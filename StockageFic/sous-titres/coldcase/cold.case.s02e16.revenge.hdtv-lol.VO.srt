August 29, 1998

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,446
Hey, look at this, Kyle.

4
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,379
Mom?

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:17,157
- Oh my God, put it back!
- It's Tommy Bonzai?

6
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:19,709
I don't want Tommy
Bonzai on my shirt.

7
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,432
Why not? I thought you 
loved the Bonzai Brigade.

8
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,982
'Cause I gotta look cool.

9
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,451
Kyle's gotta look 'cool'.

10
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,117
Tell her why.

11
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:31,064
Tell her why.

12
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:35,024
Shelby's gonna be 
in my class this year.

13
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:38,245
Shelby Bryman?

14
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:41,906
Everyone knows miss Drake 
seats alphabetical, so...

15
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,671
She'll sit next to me.

16
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,211
Got it.

17
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,615
Strikin' Tommy.

18
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,960
Look, how do these grab you
for cool, hmm?

19
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,648
Yeah!

20
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:53,582
Oh yeah...

21
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:55,672
Twenty five bucks a pop?

22
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,263
C'mon! It's just a couple of shirts!

23
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:00,545
One Shirt?

24
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:02,955
Maybe one.

25
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:04,977
- Yeah!
- Let's hit the dress room.

26
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,352
I can go by myself.

27
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,936
I dunno.

28
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,008
I'm not a baby, Mom.

29
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,670
He'll be fine, I promise.

30
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,723
Kyle?

31
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,667
You gotta pretend 
to try these on, c'mon.

32
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,413
Kyle?

33
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:42,039
Kyle?

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,302
Kyle?

35
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,604
Kyle?

36
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:25,545
[ BREAM, K. M98-227 ]

37
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,763
Father.

38
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,705
John.

39
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:41,422
Thanks for dropping by.

40
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,294
Thanks for nothing, 
you owe me a dime.

41
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,066
Our Lord rested on Sunday, 
apparently,

42
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,497
so does a Sixers defence.

43
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,016
- Jannie was here yesterday.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,907
Final arrangement for the baptism.

45
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:04,031
Her boy's growing like a weed.

46
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,319
Something goin' on with her?

47
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,705
- Not that I know of.
- Have you talked lately?

48
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:14,596
Must've been a few weeks,
I'm swamped at work.

49
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,822
Well, work is why I called you.

50
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:24,129
In 1998, I took confession from 
the neighborhood kid, Bernny Gantz.

51
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,731
He was caught up
in a kidnapping.

52
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,358
- Kidnapping of who?
- A little boy.

53
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,537
Kyle Bream.

54
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:34,335
They found him dead 
in Salem Harbor.

55
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:36,686
This Gantz confessed 
to the murder?

56
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,472
No, said he was 
just paid to watch him.

57
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:41,993
Where do we find him?

58
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:43,888
All Saint's Ground.

59
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:47,379
Got himself killed last week 
robbing the jewelry store.

60
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,422
So that's why you're 
freed up to tell me.

61
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,395
Berny never did much with his life.

62
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,900
Maybe some good could 
come from his death.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,570
I'll pull the job.

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,338
Take another look.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,130
Give Jannie a call.

66
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,431
Yeah.

67
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:05,777
I will.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2005/03/13

81
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:45,952
Kyle Bream, nine years old. Disappeared 
from the department store in Torresdale.

82
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,966
A day later, the parents 
get a ransom call.

83
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,426
FBI come in?

84
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:52,383
They set up a money drop, 
put undercovers at the scene.

85
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,095
Hey.

86
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,795
Hey.

87
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:01,740
Dad puts a cash in 
a prearranged dumpster.

88
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,508
Ten minutes later, guy comes 
diggin', the feds move in.

89
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,564
Well, he's the wrong guy.
Just a vagrant.

90
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,002
Kidnapper never showed.

91
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:09,912
Figured he made the feds,
got spooked.

92
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,993
And the Breams 
never saw Kyle again.

93
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:15,062
Body was found a month later.
Drowned.

94
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,869
So the heat's on, kidnapper 
cuts his losses and kills the kid.

95
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,902
They ever get close 
on who snatched him?

96
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,277
No phone trace, 
nothing on store cameras.

97
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:26,183
Maybe the late Berny
Gantz gets us closer.

98
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:30,478
Gantzs was the guy who told your 
brother he was paid to watsh Kyle?

99
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,659
- What'd you find on him?
- He was small time.

100
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,486
Theft, credit card crime, 
forgery charge.

101
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:37,960
Tried to fake a power ball ticket.

102
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,719
He's a real brain truster.

103
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,841
His older brother Manny.
Same shed, Different tool.

104
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,120
A lot of the same arrests as Berny.

105
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,830
Could be a team.

106
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:59,878
Hey, Manny.
Mind if we step in your office?

107
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:01,487
Off... office?

108
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,789
I just eat here.

109
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,422
It's the best kubide
west of the Nile.

110
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,826
Yeah, we wanna talk 
to you about Kyle Bream?

111
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,340
- Who?
- Nine year old.

112
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,281
Got abducted and 
murdered in '98.

113
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,622
Yeah, your brother 
Berny was in on it.

114
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,278
Berny had his own life.

115
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:16,509
Well, you got mirror-image rap sheets
to say different, you were partners.

116
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,050
We can't get Berny on murder,

117
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,337
him being dead and all but,
we can still get you.

118
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,097
Whoa! Back the truck up.

119
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:24,575
We had nothing to 
do with that kid dying.

120
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,912
So just the kidnapping then?

121
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,586
You can talk to us or the feds.

122
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,567
They'll be real interested 
in your little operatoin here.

123
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,169
Operation?

124
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:34,844
Just some fake IDs for kids.

125
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:37,579
Selling forged papers out of 
a middle eastern restaurant?

126
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,906
Two word, Manny.

127
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:39,966
Patriot Act.

128
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,748
They can put you in a hole, 
no lawyer, no trial.

129
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,948
No kubide.

130
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,597
This guy hired us to watch the kid.

131
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,071
We were babysitters, that's it.

132
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:54,167
What guy? Give us a name.

133
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,310
No names.
That's how he wanted it.

134
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,160
- Anonymous-like.
- How'd it work?

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,459
One crew to snap 
the kid, one to watch.

136
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,076
No names, no faces.

137
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,513
I only saw the guy once.

138
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,683
Gin.

139
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:13,090
Ah, you rat bastard!

140
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,337
Hey, kid. You wanna play?

141
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,364
You can't do any worse 
than this mook.

142
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,140
My Dad's coming to get me.

143
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,016
Sure he is.

144
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,689
I'm gonna miss the first day of school.

145
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,656
That's the breaks, kid.

146
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,699
I'm supposed to sit next to Shelby.

147
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,456
- That's him.
- Dad?

148
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,288
- Take him in the other room.
- C'mon.

149
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:55,937
- Kyle's in the other room?
- Come in, you're clear.

150
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,870
- He okay?
- Keeps asking about his dad.

151
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,394
Worried school started without him.

152
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:05,936
This will all be over soon enough.
I gave the parents the terms.

153
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,839
They'll get the kid as 
soon as they pay up.

154
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,333
What if they can't pay up?

155
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,022
They got a hundred large 
in bearer bonds in their safe.

156
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,220
They'll pay.

157
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,661
Bonds in the safe.

158
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,881
- How did he know about that?
- Beats me.

159
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:24,240
All I know is when the drop 
went south, he got cold feet.

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,586
he paid us off.

161
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,266
And you left Kyle with him?

162
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,864
It was business.

163
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,285
Here.

164
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,774
So is this.

165
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:46,594
We packed up 
Kyle's room last year.

166
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:52,418
It's hard to..

167
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:55,774
know what to keep.
What to let go of.

168
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:59,030
- Sure.
- Or what to do with the room.

169
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,047
Maybe one day it 
will be a nursery again.

170
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,908
We might have a lead.

171
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:08,234
Someone involved in the kidnapping.

172
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:11,751
Did you own some bearer bonds, 
Mr. Bream back in '98?

173
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,208
Yeah.

174
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,187
We cashed them 
in for the ransom.

175
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,347
The FBI thought our best chance 
was to along with their sting.

176
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,095
I didn't want to.

177
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,182
DId they go against your wishes?

178
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,974
Kent thought we should 
take their advice.

179
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:29,970
- So we did.
- They explained the percentages.

180
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,871
This was our best shot.

181
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,298
Unfortunately those percentages 
didn't apply to us.

182
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,554
- That's not Kyle.
- They said to stay back.

183
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:43,229
It's not him, 
they can't put Kyle in a bag.

184
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,370
He's gone, baby.
Oh God, he's gone.

185
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,275
You said to work with them.

186
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,679
I thought... / You said 
that's how we'd get him back.

187
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,155
You said he could go by himself 
to the dressing room!

188
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:55,238
- Baby...
- You promised he'd be fine...

189
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,973
Anyway.

190
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,622
We believe, who ever 
knew about the bonds,

191
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,994
had something to 
do with the kidnapping.

192
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,555
- No one knew about them.
- You sure about that?

193
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,641
Yeah, I never told a soul.

194
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,891
What?

195
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,781
My sister.

196
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:24,058
I told her.

197
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:27,239
In case something ever happened 
to us I wanted them to know.

198
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,540
Them?

199
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,290
She and her husband.

200
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,576
You told Ed?

201
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,121
Who's Ed?

202
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,987
Things didn't turned out so good between 
you and Tina Bream's sister, huh Ed?

203
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,899
Didn't even make it to 
the second anniversary.

204
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,100
I had a problem...
I guess you guys know that?

205
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,917
Locked up three times 
for drugs, twice for theft-

206
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,305
I was stealing to support my habit.

207
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,962
Slippery slope.
Petty thefts, kidnapping.

208
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:59,078
- Murder-
- No!

209
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,400
Manny Gantz picked you 
out of a photo spread.

210
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,407
You snatched Kyle, 
killed your own nephew.

211
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,691
I didn't kill no one.

212
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,289
You needed money, the in-laws 
had it, you knew how to get it.

213
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:10,125
Yeah, but when the things got hinky 
with the ransom you got nervous,

214
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,951
- and now Kyle's a reliablity.
- I'm outta here...

215
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,593
Hey, Ed. You ain't listening?

216
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,160
We got a witness.

217
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,259
Okay.

218
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,586
I'm a scumbag.

219
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:29,264
I took Kyle but...

220
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,115
When I saw feds at the drop 
I got scared so

221
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,057
I made other arrangements.

222
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:44,139
So you're Kyle.

223
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,475
You like comics, Kyle?

224
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:50,674
Some.

225
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:55,059
They made this one 
into a movie, right?

226
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:00,100
- It was a video game first.
- You're right.

227
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,074
You like video games?

228
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:09,008
My Mom says, 
Sega makes your head soft.

229
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,407
Hey, I got a Sega.

230
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,265
My head's okay.

231
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,282
You can come play games 
at my house if you want.

232
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:21,424
I want my Mom and Dad.

233
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,770
I'm told they went on a trip.

234
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,305
Without me?

235
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,600
I don't know why.

236
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,780
Was it 'cause 
my shirt costed 25$ a pop?

237
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,354
You know that is a lot
of money for a shirt.

238
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,918
No worries.

239
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,881
See, you and me...

240
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,394
We could take a trip of our own.

241
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,752
An adventure.

242
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:10,230
You can have 
your own secret identity.

243
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,459
Like Peter Parker in Spider Man?

244
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,721
Exactly.

245
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,315
Parker.

246
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,456
I like that name.

247
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,193
Me and this guy... 
made a deal.

248
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,978
What kind of deal 
are we talking about?

249
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:40,634
What did you do with Kyle?

250
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,981
I sold him.

251
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,976
Hey, babe. Hi.

252
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,573
I'd thought you'd bring the baby.

253
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,648
He's with Mom.

254
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,900
She coming Friday?

255
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,617
Of course.

256
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:21,666
I saw your uncle yesterday, 
and he thought you'd seemed upset.

257
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,119
No.

258
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,925
Jannie?

259
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,364
What?

260
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:35,571
I saw Brad Witham last week.

261
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,593
I was having dinner at Olson's.
He was behind the bar.

262
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:48,000
Are you sure it was him?

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,505
I know that smile.

264
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,804
Right.

265
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,878
Remember how you 
wanted to press charges?

266
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,585
- Yeah.
- Or at least go find him and-

267
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:01,453
You and Mom stoped me.

268
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:07,265
I wish you hadn't listened to us.

269
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:11,449
Oh, Jannie... / Why was I worried 
about how people would think of me?

270
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,491
Who cares about that now?

271
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,388
You were so sure of what 
you wanted you begged me.

272
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,264
I know.

273
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:21,667
You wanted to just forget it.

274
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,753
Well,

275
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:26,718
I was eighteen.

276
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,158
I was wrong.

277
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,815
So what do we know about 
this guy who bought Kyle Bream?

278
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:40,311
- Name's Rudy Taner.
- Was anyway.

279
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,989
- Suspect's a cold job, too.
- For real? How'd it go?

280
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,005
Guy was shot a few months 
after Kyle turned up dead.

281
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:50,959
School administrator, 45, lived in...
Malrow Park. Nice neighborhood.

282
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,275
Well, someone took him out 
in his nice tomato garden.

283
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:57,373
Well, the assigned took evidence 
from the home computer.

284
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,899
Turn's out Taner was 
running a website.

285
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,650
'boysinbloom.com'

286
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,067
- Kiddy porn.
- Oh, man.

287
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,632
- Kyle was an investment.
- So why kil him?

288
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:10,314
Let's go with the feds, see if 
they red-flagged visitors to the site.

289
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,772
This guy got a family?

290
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:16,445
- Looks like he had a wife.
- And didn't she get the prize.

291
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:24,549
This boy may have stayed with you 
and yor husband in the fall of '98?

292
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,993
Rudy and I were 
seperated by then.

293
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,751
Was that because of his website?

294
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,362
I found out about that after 
he died like everyone else.

295
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:33,071
Never suspected?

296
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:36,551
I had a night job, a weekend job, 
plus this during the week.

297
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:40,165
- I didn't have time to monitor him.
- So you divorced him.

298
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,768
He left me.

299
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,585
Ditched me to raise 
Archie on my own.

300
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,852
Archie's your son?

301
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:47,730
Yeah. / Did he ever spend time 
with his dad after you two split?

302
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,050
He'd stayed with him 
on the weekends when I worked.

303
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,489
You weren't worried about that?

304
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:56,184
But he would never...
not his own son.

305
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:58,781
You ever see this kid?

306
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,898
- But his hair was different.
- How so?

307
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,363
It was blond like Archie's.

308
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:07,511
I remember thinking they 
could have been brothers.

309
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:10,518
- Where was this?
- At Rudy's house.

310
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:13,412
One Sunday when 
I went to pick up Archie.

311
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,643
Archie?

312
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,758
Gotta go, right now!

313
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,430
Archie?

314
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,351
Mom? In here.

315
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,650
You're early.

316
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,319
I wanted to get to the store 
before it closes, so get your stuff.

317
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,856
But Dad wanted me 
to make milk shakes.

318
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:32,606
If I don't shop tonight I can't go again 
until Wednesday, so let's move it!

319
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,457
Put your coat on, 
I'll get your stuff.

320
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:37,255
No! Mom! You can't go in there!

321
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,768
It's Parker, some family friend.

322
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,113
Why is he in your bedroom?

323
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:50,154
His Parents are out of town 
so Dad gave him my room.

324
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,969
I don't like Samurai Planet.

325
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:56,508
He got the wrong ones, 
I like Bonzai Brigade.

326
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,375
I've got all 24 issues at home.

327
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:02,233
What are you doing here, Sandra?

328
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,155
I uh- got off early.

329
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,449
- Let's go, Archie.
- Can't I just stay, I mean-

330
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:09,001
- Maybe Dad could bring me home.
- Next time kiddo.

331
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,024
Get your coat.

332
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,951
Hey, nap time in 10 minutes, star.

333
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,307
His parents are 
colleagues of mine.

334
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:20,155
They're both sick.
It's a real tragedy.

335
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,846
Archie said they went out of town.

336
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,271
Well, it's a cover story.

337
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:28,316
He looks like Archie 
when he was-

338
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,625
Nine.

339
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,761
Yes, he does.

340
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:38,056
Such a wonderful age.

341
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,839
I didn't know anything was wrong.

342
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,322
I didn't.

343
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:56,548
Your mom, saw this kid 
at your dad's place.

344
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,635
Yeah, that's um-

345
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:03,122
that's uh- 
what's he's name...uh-

346
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:04,696
Parker.

347
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,248
Parker?

348
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:10,014
Yeah, my Dad take him in for a while. 
He said he had some problems at home.

349
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,557
That's what your pop said.

350
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:14,967
Yeah, he was like that generous.

351
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,735
Kid's real name was Kyle Bream.

352
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:20,577
He got murdered after 
your dad took him in.

353
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,167
Murdered?

354
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,082
You're not saying that my Dad 
had anything to do with that?

355
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,154
You Dad bought Kyle from 
the man who kidnapped him.

356
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:29,199
- No.
- Archie...

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,448
- He was a child pornagrapher.
- Oh, not that crap again.

358
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,611
There's evidence, his website.

359
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:39,498
My Dad gave this kid a home 
after his own parents bailed on him.

360
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:43,244
Can we throw the football, Dad?

361
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,332
Practice my spiral?

362
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:47,867
Sure. Later.

363
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,153
What's wrong, Parker?

364
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,746
Nothing.

365
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,460
Tell me.

366
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:17,563
I didn't really care if I had cool shirts.

367
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,447
I know but people get 
overwhelmed sometimes.

368
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:25,297
That's what happened 
to my Mom and Dad?

369
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:27,274
Little boy can be very expensive.

370
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,741
That's why they didn't want me?

371
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,671
Yeah.

372
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,271
But Uncle Rudy does.

373
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:36,805
And he won't leave you.

374
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,138
Can we practice now?

375
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,364
Whatever Parker wants.

376
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,972
Parker isn't good at football.

377
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,171
My Dad just tried to help him.

378
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,288
Kyle had brown hair.

379
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,300
So?

380
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,073
Your Dad changed it to look like yours.

381
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,424
Your Mom says you 
could have been brothers.

382
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,860
And your meaning is what?

383
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:10,673
My Father was a good man.

384
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:28,419
[ BEST SMILE: Brad Witham ]

385
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,054
Hey, Boss.

386
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:33,546
What's the latest?

387
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:37,036
This Rudy Taner did 
a Stockholm Syndrome on Kyle.

388
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:40,276
Had him believe that 
his parents ran out on him.

389
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:42,119
That's explains how he kept him there.

390
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,602
Also had a son Archie thinking 
he was the world's greatest dad.

391
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,573
A kid's gotta 
believe in someone.

392
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:52,649
Got the FBI file on Taner's website.

393
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,575
There's pictures.

394
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:57,407
- Of Kyle?
- Among others.

395
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,867
That might not be the worst of it.

396
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:06,470
Federal watch list for 
paying members to the site.

397
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,530
Check the 'B's.

398
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:12,952
Ken Bream?

399
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:16,203
Kyle's dad had himself
a membership.

400
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:25,979
You like boys, Ken?

401
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:27,551
What are talking about?

402
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:30,478
Your membership 
the 'boysinbloom.com'.

403
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:32,851
Kyle showed up on that site.

404
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,610
- As a model.
- That's some kind of coincidence.

405
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,575
It's not what you think.

406
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,545
Then what is it?

407
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:44,105
My husband didn't have anything 
to do with what happened to Kyle.

408
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:46,999
You don't really sound 
convinced to that.

409
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,379
I just shouldn't have believed him.

410
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:50,688
About what?

411
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,256
That Kyle would be okay by himself.

412
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:54,900
At the store.

413
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,120
We're not talking about
the dressing room, Tina.

414
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,364
Then what?

415
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:04,687
Mrs. Bream, your husband was accessing 
child pornagraphy on the Internet.

416
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,020
I know.

417
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,141
Rudy Taner. 
You know him?

418
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,490
Know. / See, the innocent answer 
would've been "Rudy, who?".

419
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,325
- Or just "Who?".
- I would've taken either.

420
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:20,207
- I didn't know him.
- Didn't?

421
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:22,840
Hey, pervert!
We're talking to you!

422
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,941
- What did you call me?
- I know what you are.

423
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:29,228
- I make a study out of people like you.
- You don't know anything!

424
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:32,754
Then tell us.

425
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,248
It was Rudy Taner's site.

426
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,342
Pictures of little boys?

427
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:40,919
Including Kyle.

428
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:44,228
I'm the one who told Ken about it.

429
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,222
How did you know?

430
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:53,689
We got crank calls
after Kyle died.

431
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:55,687
Letters.

432
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:58,193
You don't know how cruel.

433
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:02,693
At first, I thought 
she was one of them.

434
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,510
Mrs. Bream?

435
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:13,599
I saw your boy.

436
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,265
What?

437
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:17,890
Your son Kyle, I-

438
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:20,742
I saw him.

439
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,755
- My son is dead.
- Last fall.

440
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,450
In a house on highland street.

441
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,494
Don't do this.

442
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:30,743
The man who lives there, Rudy Taner.

443
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,347
He hurt my boy, too.

444
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,022
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

445
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,741
He took pictures of your boy.

446
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,147
- There's a website-
- Get away from me!

447
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:46,738
He likes Bonzai Brigade.

448
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:54,752
But not Samurai Planet.

449
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,750
He said he had all 
the good comics at home.

450
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,201
Twenty four issues.

451
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:05,982
Rudy lied to me.

452
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,844
But I believed him.

453
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,390
I'm so sorry.

454
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,158
I'm sorry...

455
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,499
She told me.

456
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,022
And I told Ken.

457
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,804
Why not go to the police?

458
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:29,249
I didn't have a lot of faith in 
the authorities at that point.

459
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:33,579
Right.

460
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,240
It was time to make things right.

461
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,207
I went to that site 
that woman told Tina about.

462
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:45,349
Bought a password.

463
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:48,943
And there was Kyle in...

464
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,018
We know.

465
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:57,880
She blamed me.

466
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:03,455
For losing him, and for the FBI.

467
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:10,218
- I had to make it up to her.
- By doing what?

468
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:33,122
Turn around.

469
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,644
- Who are you?
- I was Kyle Bream's Dad.

470
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,583
The boy in the harbor.
I read about him.

471
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,498
I'm so sorry.

472
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:48,221
You got nerve.

473
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:51,967
Mr. Bream. / Do you know the feeling 
when you wake up from a nightmare,

474
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,665
and you realize...

475
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:55,712
it's just a dream?

476
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:57,530
How good that feels?

477
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,548
That relief?

478
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:05,030
When I wake up, I realize...

479
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,600
it was all real.

480
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,805
- I didn't kill him.
- I saw the pictures.

481
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:10,828
That's all it was. 
It was just pictures.

482
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,922
And that was enough.

483
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,316
You deserve worse than this.

484
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:21,866
But it'll have to do.

485
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,277
Then let me tell you the truth. 'Dad'.

486
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,276
He was the best piece of...

487
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:56,332
I never thought I'd get away with it.

488
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:01,027
Then months went by, then years.

489
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,844
You know we're gonna 
have to charge you.

490
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:13,340
It was wrong, I know but...

491
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,434
I'm not sorry.

492
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:23,337
It didn't help though.

493
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:28,297
He's still gone.

494
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:36,309
You told Tina Bream what was going on 
in that house but you didn't tell us.

495
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:39,825
- I've got caravan in 10 minutes.
- You knew what was happening with Kyle.

496
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,482
Plus a client is waiting for me to call.

497
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:45,671
Hey, Sandra.
Stand still.

498
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:48,748
He was her son.

499
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:50,616
She deserved to know.

500
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:53,996
Telling her, got your husband killed.
Was that kind of what you intended?

501
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:57,056
I saw that boy's picture in the paper,

502
00:28:57,056 --> 00:29:00,145
and I knew what Rudy had done
and I thought he should pay.

503
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:03,590
For what he did to Kyle?

504
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,406
- Or to Archie?
- He never touched Archie!

505
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,825
You told Mrs. Bream Rudy lied to you.

506
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:14,667
You weren't just talking about 
that day with Kyle, were you?

507
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:19,157
That's why all the night jobs, 
the weekend jobs, never goin' home?

508
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,620
Would have meant having to deal with it.

509
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,488
I never thought a man like 
Rudy would look at someone like me.

510
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:28,226
So you let him hurt your own boy?

511
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,547
I pretended I didn't see.

512
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:35,069
It was easier that way.

513
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,251
to believe.

514
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,720
What?

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,866
That I was his star.

516
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,604
He always call me that.

517
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:49,478
Before Archie was born.

518
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:51,527
'Star'.

519
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:03,534
Your mom's sorry, Archie.

520
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,416
For what your dad did.

521
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,417
For not stoping him.

522
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:10,965
I don't know what
she means by that.

523
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:12,492
Why are you protecting him?

524
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:13,878
He hurt you.

525
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,546
He hurt Kyle, too. Didn't he?

526
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,620
He was there for me.

527
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,010
She wasn't. 
She was never around.

528
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,972
- She works three jobs to support you.
- To avoid me, you mean.

529
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,799
Look, whatever your mom's 
failings were, your dad did worse.

530
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,703
No.

531
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:31,249
No, he-

532
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:36,038
- He loved me.
- That ain't love, Archie.

533
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:44,182
He couldn't hurt Parker.
Because Parker went away.

534
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,002
You make a mean milk shake, son.

535
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,392
Doesn't he, Parker?

536
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,047
Yeah.

537
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,275
I gotta go to the bathroom.

538
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:02,935
Come here.

539
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,797
Hey. Keep the door open.

540
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:14,152
Why do you watch him like that?

541
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,105
Like what?

542
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,920
He's never going away, is he?

543
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:25,338
I'm going online,
keep off the phone.

544
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,590
- Dad?
- What, Archie?

545
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,376
Why don't you like me anymore?

546
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:38,850
Get your stuff, 
before Mom blows a gasket.

547
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:47,461
A deal's a deal. 
He's bought and paid for.

548
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:50,073
- I'll get your money back.
- I don't want the money.

549
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,292
I have what I want, please.

550
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,563
I made a mistake.

551
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,229
Uncle Ed?

552
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:04,389
You're saying Kyle's 
uncle came to the house?

553
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,541
I told you my Dad was innocent.

554
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:10,657
What happened when Ed came?

555
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,623
He took Kyle away.

556
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:17,585
That was the last time 
I ever saw him.

557
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,057
I told you I gave Kyle 
to that Taner Guy.

558
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:26,002
- Sold him.
- And that was the last you saw them.

559
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:27,937
- Right.
- That's wierd.

560
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:30,883
Got a witness who puts you 
at Taner's place after the fact.

561
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,577
- What witness?
- His son.

562
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,632
- He said you came back for Kyle.
- Did a repo.

563
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:37,484
- Someone offered you a better price?
- Oh, no...

564
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:39,933
Maybe you thought it was 
safer if Kyle was dead.

565
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,514
- No tracks.
- C'mon, No!

566
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:44,280
- No? You ain't go back there?
- Yeah, okay! I went but that's-

567
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,443
He was your nephew, Eddie!

568
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,506
It's blood.

569
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,406
I smoked up all the money.
Six weeks straight, I'm flying.

570
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:58,821
Then I come down,

571
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:00,846
Seen what I've done.

572
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,059
I went back there 
to make things right.

573
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,671
Uncle Ed?

574
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,479
Uncle Ed, 
what are you doing here?

575
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:10,155
- I came to take you home.
- This is his home.

576
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,122
- Right, Parker?
- Parker?

577
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:15,093
Archie, take him to his room.

578
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:19,568
- Kyle, don't you wanna go home?
- He 'is' home!

579
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:23,866
It's okay Uncle Ed.
I'm too expensive.

580
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,141
- What d'you do to him?
- I loved him.

581
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,328
Which is more than 
you can say. 'Uncle Ed'.

582
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:38,393
So the parents, they don't know about 
the whole child peddling side of the family?

583
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,268
- Aren't you the black sheep.
- You can't just keep him here like this.

584
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,421
- That's why we're gonna go away.
- Where?

585
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,321
Canada maybe?
Or Europe?

586
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:46,867
Just him and me, no distractions.

587
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:49,835
You're crazy, Kyle!
Get out here.

588
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,799
Kidnapping, 25 to life!

589
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,749
That means, stone cold 
sober in a six by nine cell.

590
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:57,841
Think about it.

591
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:01,967
You're out of money.

592
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,572
Don't be ashamed.

593
00:34:03,572 --> 00:34:05,662
We all have our needs.

594
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:07,845
Will a thousand do it?

595
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,445
Two?

596
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:11,496
- Get away from me.
- Five?

597
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,773
We have a winning number.

598
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:24,283
God, help me.

599
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,921
I left him.

600
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:30,691
I hadn't had a hit in days, 
you don't know what it's like.

601
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:33,235
Well, guess I'm missing out.

602
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,672
Archie said you took him.

603
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:43,465
I'd give anything if that were true.

604
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,167
- What do you have?
- Scotch, neat.

605
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,333
- Mccallen, oban?
- Twelve.

606
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,604
Pretty girl, maybe you'll get lucky.

607
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:10,820
You never know.

608
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,692
Get her a few drinks, and her taken
home, she's good to go, right?

609
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,202
Even if she says otherwise.

610
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,979
Do I know you?

611
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,678
You don't remember.

612
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:29,908
Maybe the name, 'Stillman'?

613
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:33,734
Jannie's dad.

614
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:35,926
It's been like twenty years.

615
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,185
Eighteen.

616
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:42,251
- Look, I don't know what she told you-
- She lives in this neighborhood now.

617
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,088
This is her home.

618
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,525
So tonight, you're gonna quit this job.

619
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,866
You can't tell me what to do.

620
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:58,171
I can do a lot, Brad.

621
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:02,067
Eighteen years ago, 
my daughter kept me and you apart.

622
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,388
But time's changed.

623
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,441
You get me?

624
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:24,708
You and Kyle's Uncle tell 
different stories, Archie.

625
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,054
You gonna believe 
a meth head kidnapper or me?

626
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,468
Oh, you agreed on one thing.

627
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:34,937
Ed came back for Kyle 
but he didn't leave with him.

628
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:37,406
Hey, your dad persuaded him otherwise.

629
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:39,310
My dad wouldn't kill Parker.

630
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,271
Even after he got tired of him?

631
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,500
Like he got tired of you?

632
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,789
No.

633
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,413
- Not Parker.
- Why not?

634
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,672
Because he was his 'star'.

635
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,756
Non-filters.
Reminds me of home.

636
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,346
My Mom had 
a two pack a day habit.

637
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:18,210
- Good for her.
- Little vodca to smoothe it all out.

638
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,144
Some nights more than a little.

639
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:26,991
Then it was my job to 
clean her up, put her to bed.

640
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:28,670
That sounds great.

641
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,483
It sucked.

642
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:36,496
I did it anyway.

643
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,272
Know why?

644
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,772
Because after I tucked 
her in some nights?

645
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:48,035
She'd reach out, like this.

646
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:54,816
And that made it okay.
Her doing that,

647
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,349
loving me.

648
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:03,788
I would've done anything for that.

649
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:07,683
Yeah.

650
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,159
Yeah.

651
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,656
Like you did.

652
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:16,312
For years.

653
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,665
For your dad.

654
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:24,780
But then...
Kyle came along.

655
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,094
Right?
Took your bedroom, your stuff.

656
00:38:29,094 --> 00:38:31,856
Your dad found someone new to love.

657
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:34,007
And he was going to take him away.

658
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,065
And leave you behind!

659
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,893
Canada or Europe.

660
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:46,357
You were only thirteen.

661
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,568
You needed your dad.

662
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:51,418
I believed him.
You know?

663
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:54,660
- You believed?
- What he always told me.

664
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:58,941
That I was his 'star'.

665
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,955
Couldn't let Parker have my Dad.

666
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:13,488
Hey.

667
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:15,090
Come on. Get up.

668
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,097
We're leaving.

669
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:19,776
Where are we going?

670
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,067
Tell me where you live 
I can take you home.

671
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:25,990
- I am home.
- No, this is 'my' home.

672
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,417
Not yours.

673
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,528
Your mom and dad 
never went away.

674
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:34,117
They didn't?

Yeah.
