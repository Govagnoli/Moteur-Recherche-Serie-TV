1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Patriot pride !

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Patriot pride !

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Patriot pride !

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,600
Patriot pride ! Come on.
Pump those legs. Patriot !

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
All right, back in formation !

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
There's no way we're not going
to make the varsity squad.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,600
We've worked so hard.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,800
You know how awesome that would be,

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,700
hanging out with the senior girls ?

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,400
Going to senior parties ?

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,100
Cheering in front of real people
instead of our bedroom mirrors.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,100
Rainey, I just want you to know

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,500
that if you make it and I don't...

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,600
Shh ! That's not gonna happen.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,600
But if it does, I won't be mad.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,700
Celeste, shut up.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
We're both gonna make it, okay ?

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,400
Be-Fri.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,300
What's up, St-End ?

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,300
Okay. Rainey.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,600
Let's see your varsity cheer.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
Ready ? ! Okay !

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
We is the key !

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,100
To take victory !

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,900
We is the key !

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
To take victory !

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,300
Okay, stop.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,700
Rainey, um, what are you forgetting ?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Um...

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,900
You're never fully dressed without a...

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,800
Smile. Right.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,200
Sorry, I was just, uh... concentrating.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Well, don't.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,700
'Cause it makes you look like you
have a giant bloomer wedgie.

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Gather round, girls. It's your moment in the sun.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,500
All right.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Your new varsity members are...

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
Celeste Church and Rainey Karlsen.

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Thank you, everyone, for trying out.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,600
Whoo !

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,100
Victim's mom found graffiti on some art.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
Not graffiti, it's part of the art.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Exhibit where visitors write down secrets,

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,100
put them up on a wall.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,100
People pay money for that ?

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
Yeah, it's art.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,600
If I can make it, it ain't.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,300
Are you the detectives ?

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,300
Yeah, Detectives Rush, Valens.
You must be Ms. Karlsen.

50
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Yes. Rainey's mom.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
You found something related
to your daughter's death.

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,300
They said she took an overdose
of drugs accidentally.

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
High levels of GHB
and alcohol in her system.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Rainey didn't do those things.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
It's hard to always know
what a teenager's up to.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,400
I know my daughter. She was a good girl.

57
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,200
Not a follower.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, according to the autopsy...

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,900
I know what the autopsy says, Detective.

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Someone murdered her.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
And that proves it.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,100
"I killed Rainey Karlsen."

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,900
Could be some kind of prank.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,700
Scotty...

65
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
that drawing.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,900
What is it ?

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Same thing they found on her body.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
They never released that to the public.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,700
So whoever wrote that note...

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Killed my daughter.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,700
"Cold Case" Season 04 Episode 20

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,700
Rainey Karlsen.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Junior at Birmingham High School.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Just made the varsity cheerleading squad,

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
popular, pretty,

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
lots of friends.

77
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,600
Who'd want to kill someone like that ?

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,900
I would.

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,100
High school.

80
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
I loved high school.

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Really ?

82
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,000
I was a big hockey star.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,000
You ?

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
First round at state.

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Scored the winning goal, MVP.

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Couldn't keep the girls off me.

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,500
Who were you in high school, Lil ?

88
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Definitely not the cheerleader.

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
Bad girl no one'd mess with ?

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
You could say that.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,900
You, too, Miller ?

92
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,500
Look at you the wrong way,
get popped in the mouth ?

93
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Who says you still won't ?

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Same drawing on Rainey's body
showed up on this

95
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,800
from the museum.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
We track it ?

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,900
No luck.

98
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Latents checked for prints and
surveillance footage was a wash.

99
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,900
Drug panel found high levels of GHB

100
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,300
in her system mixed with alcohol.

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,100
GHB, the date-rape drug ?

102
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, but in small doses,
kids use it recreationally.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Street name: Liquid X.

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,900
Levels were off the chart.

105
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Maybe she was partying,
miscalculated the dosage.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,700
Or she was drugged.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
No evidence of sexual assault.

108
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,000
So, why use it ?

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,300
Maybe the assault got interrupted.

110
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
She was out partying.
None of her friends saw it.

111
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Missed the afterschool pep rally.

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Never to be seen again.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,900
Till she turns up dead
on the 50-yard line.

114
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Not likely to have booze
and drugs in your system

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,400
and be partying alone.

116
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Her best friend was

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Celeste Church.

118
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,700
If anyone knew who Rainey
was partying with that night,

119
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,100
homegirl would.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,600
I had no idea who Rainey was
with the night she died.

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,300
I thought you were best friends.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,700
Had been since sixth grade,

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
the year Rainey's dad died

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
and my parents dragged me
through their nasty divorce.

125
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Sounds like you had
a lot to talk about.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
We were each other's shelter
from the storm.

127
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,500
To be honest, I...

128
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,700
couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

129
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Special girl ?

130
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,500
A kind of girl who had no
idea how special she was.

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,300
Rainey bloomed junior year.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
That what changed your friendship ?

133
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
High school pecking order ?

134
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
No, making the cheerleading squad did.

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,500
But you both made it in, right ?

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
Yeah, but our squad captain,

137
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Becca Abrams,

138
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,300
was the gatekeeper to all the parties

139
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,200
and she chose favorites.

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
I take it you weren't one of them. Right.

141
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,600
But Rainey was.

142
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,700
Hey, Be-Fri...

143
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,900
think we can sit with them ?

144
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,900
It'll totally rock if we can.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
Well, get over here.

146
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
So, I'm like, "Mom, that's totally unfair.

147
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Why can't a I have a Beemer and a boob job ?"

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,500
My parents just like to deny me things.

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,100
Your mom would actually let you get a boob job ?

150
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,600
Well, long as I asked her in cocktail hour.

151
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,500
Anyhoo...

152
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,700
Celeste...

153
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,200
now that we're friends,

154
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,300
we have a secret to let you in on.

155
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,300
Oh, cool.

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,400
In junior high, we had a nickname for you.

157
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
The Black Hole.

158
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
'Cause you ate everything in sight.

159
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,800
Isn't that so stupid ?

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
I never heard anyone call you that.

161
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
You know, I finally lost all my baby fat.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
I wear a size 6 at The Gap now.

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
Ugh, I'm so pissed at them.

164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,700
They totally resized all their
clothes to make fat people feel good.

165
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,900
Celeste isn't fat. We both wear a size 6.

166
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,800
I mean, just 'cause everyone else
in America weighs 5,000 pounds,

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
don't punish me. Totally.

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,300
Rainey...

169
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
you got to try this new lip gloss.

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,700
It's got viper venom in it
to make your lips puffy.

171
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Puffy lips are good ?

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,900
What's this about puffy lips ?

173
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Oh, my God, shut up, Casey.

174
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Saw you girls at tryouts.

175
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Looking hottie bo-bottie.

176
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Thanks.

177
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Rainey, there's a huge kegger this weekend.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
You've got to come.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Um, okay.

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,100
Friday or Saturday ?

181
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,400
Um, I can't remember.

182
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Rainey, we'll let you know.

183
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
All right. Rainey's gonna party with us.

184
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
Welcome to the big leagues.

185
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,400
On the outside, I was this popular cheerleader,

186
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,000
but on the inside I was still a fat sixth grader.

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,700
Rainey and Becca became fast friends ?

188
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Well, Becca had no choice.

189
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,700
Rainey was a major threat to her boyfriend.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Yeah, but if Becca saw Rainey as
a threat, why'd she pal up to her ?

191
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,400
It's like when Madonna wore
that "I Heart Britney" T-shirt

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,500
or when Britney started hanging out
with Paris Hilton.

193
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,600
A ploy for a fading star
to control a rising star.

194
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,100
Becca wanted to control Rainey.

195
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,700
"Frenemies," exactly.

196
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,500
And rain or shine,

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Becca was determined to keep her man.

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,100
Determined enough to kill Rainey ?

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
The cheerleading squad was a shark tank.

200
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Everyone out for blood.

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,500
Sounds like Becca was the Great White.

202
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
You think someone killed Rainey ?

203
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,500
That's so sad.

204
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,900
She was such a sweetheart.

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Don't you think we should maybe actually
send her the centerpiece ?

206
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
We understand you saw Rainey as a rival.

207
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,100
Your boyfriend had the hots for her.

208
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,300
Please.

209
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Rainey was pretty,

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,200
but she was seriously
clueless when it came to guys.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,900
So why invite her to party with you ?

212
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,200
She was a cheerleader...
Birmingham's elite.

213
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
It was all part of the benefits package.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Doesn't mean you didn't dose
her beer at one of your keggers.

215
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Look, you can imagine how bad
it looked for me when she turned up dead.

216
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Why's that ?

217
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,200
Someone in our squad ODs on drugs ?

218
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Not cool.

219
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,100
Right.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
You have any idea

221
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
who might have wanted to hurt Rainey ?

222
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Totally.

223
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,000
The people who always want to hurt
the good-looking popular people...

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,800
sad weirdoes of the world.

225
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,900
Okay, you are riding your skateboard...

226
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,200
He's so hot.

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
hit a rock and go flying,
but your skateboard stops.

228
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,700
Yeah, but isn't he kind of old ?

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
What, according to Newton's
First Law of Motion

230
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,600
is the rock ?

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Yes, Casey ?

232
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
My ass ?

233
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,600
That's a good guess,

234
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
but I think I'm looking
for a different answer.

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,700
What's up, nerd ?

236
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
Rainey, did you have a guess ?

237
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,600
Um, just stretching.

238
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,500
Okay...

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
other guesses ?

240
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,500
Uh, hello ?

241
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,800
You look stupid if you look smart.

242
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,500
Shouldn't it look smart
if you look smart ?

243
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,900
Listen, if you want to commit social
suicide by being a big ol' loser,

244
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
you can go ahead and turn
in your pom-poms.

245
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
No, I mean, I'm sure I would
have gotten it wrong

246
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
or whatever.

247
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay.

248
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,100
You're pathetic.

249
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,200
Excuse me ?

250
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,900
They say men keep women down ?

251
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,200
But you tear each other apart,
especially you cheerleaders.

252
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,700
You don't know me. I don't need to.
You're a cardboard cutout.

253
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm an individual. Really ?

254
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Nice outfit and lip goo.

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
It's called lip gloss, freak.

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
Someone should do the female race a favor

257
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
and eradicate you idiots.

258
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
And since you're spending
your life just stretching,

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
I'd start with your worthless ass.

260
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Losers are so pathetic.

261
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,200
Spend all their time projecting
their ugliness onto other people.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,300
It's sad, really.

263
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
So you think this Joe
character killed Rainey

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,100
'cause he was a loser ?

265
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,700
You've got to do better
than that, Becca.

266
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,500
A few months after Rainey died,

267
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,400
Joe was expelled from school.

268
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
For what ?

269
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
For making drugs in the chem lab.

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,500
Drugs ? What kind ?

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
Rumor was...

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,900
Liquid X

273
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
Heard you were cooking
up some X back in the day.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Of course that was the rumor.

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,300
Rumor ?

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
You were expelled for drug use.

277
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,700
Not liquid X.

278
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,700
I got caught smoking pot on the
bleachers for the fifth time.

279
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,600
Wasn't a rumor that you threatened Rainey.

280
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,000
Told her you'd eradicate her worthless ass.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Look, I was an outcast in high school...

282
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,700
by toting around my Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance,

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,600
thinking I could change the world
by provoking dialogue.

284
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
That explains that away.

285
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,900
Well, maybe you took out some of that

286
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,000
adolescent angst on the popular girl.

287
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
I was wrong about Rainey, okay ?

288
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,100
You didn't think she was
cardboard cutout ?

289
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,200
I thought she was better than those
bunch of morons she hung with.

290
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
Morons like Becca ?

291
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And Casey.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
You think he had something
to do with it ?

293
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Guy'd stop at nothing to get in her pants.

294
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,900
You shouldn't assume I'm an idiot

295
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,800
because I'm a cheerleader.

296
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,900
You're right.

297
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,600
Pigtails and short skirts
usually equal genius.

298
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,300
An unbalanced force.

299
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,400
What ?

300
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,600
That's the answer.

301
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,500
An object at rest has to stay at rest

302
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,300
and an object in motion

303
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
tends to stay in motion

304
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,600
unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

305
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
Newton's First Law of Motion.

306
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,000
If you're not an idiot, why act like one ?

307
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
You wouldn't understand.

308
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Wouldn't understand a little
thing called "peer pressure" ?

309
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Offer me drugs.

310
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
What ? Just do it.

311
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
You want drugs ?

312
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,500
No !

313
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,700
And that's how you deal with peer pressure.

314
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,100
It's just... it's like they belong,

315
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,200
you know, with their cool
uniforms and their pom-poms.

316
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Everyone knows who they are,

317
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,400
wants to be their friend.

318
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Maybe it's stupid and shallow
to want that.

319
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
No, sounds like what we all want.

320
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
Rainey, you better be on
that kegger on Saturday.

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm not taking no for an answer.

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,900
Casey, what are you doing ?

323
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,900
What about Becca ?

324
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
That old jock mattress ?

325
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
Get your hands off of her, you tool.

326
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Who the hell are you ?

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Guess I'm no one.

328
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,300
You saying Casey drugged Rainey ?

329
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
It is his style.

330
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,300
Meaning ?

331
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,200
You'll never guess who was brought up
on date rape charges

332
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
his sophomore year at college.

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Mr. Big Man on Campus himself.

334
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,800
Those date rape charges were dropped.

335
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
You're not supposed to ask me about that.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We'll ask whatever we damn want, Casey.

337
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,100
You got a real problem with keeping
that thing in your pants, huh ?

338
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,700
What kind of questions is that ?

339
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,700
Well, we know you had the hots
for Rainey Carlson.

340
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,600
So ? She was tight.

341
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,900
Where were you the night Rainey died ?

342
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,500
My parents were out of town.

343
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
I threw a kegger. There were, like,
a hundred people there.

344
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,600
We're gonna need those names.

345
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Fine.

346
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
The point is you pursued Rainey.

347
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
Wanted to get your rocks off.

348
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm not saying I wouldn't hit that.

349
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Sure, I tried.

350
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,800
She told you to get lost.

351
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
Wasn't me she told to step off.

352
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,300
Shh.

353
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,000
All right, juniors.

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Congratulations on
your first game.

355
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,100
You were awesome. Thanks, Becca.

356
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm so excited. Now...

357
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,600
We have a little tradition.

358
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
We all did it after our
first varsity game.

359
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,200
Now it's your turn.

360
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,100
To do what ?

361
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,700
Kiss.

362
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Each other.

363
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
But there aren't any guys around.

364
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,000
Isn't that kind of lame ?

365
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,000
Excuse me ?

366
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Lame ? It's a frickin' tradition.

367
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,500
I don't want to, Becca.

368
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,300
Really ?

369
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Well, you do what I say.

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,800
I say "kiss," you better kiss.

371
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's just do it. It'll be stupid.

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
That's exactly the point.

373
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Come on ! That ain't no kiss !

374
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
Let's see some tongue action !

375
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,300
Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue !

376
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,500
Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue !

377
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue ! Tongue !

378
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,100
Hey, hey, where do you think you're going ?

379
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,300
You didn't roll the dice yet.

380
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
What ? Let go of me.

381
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Remeber your roll is with me the guy's kiss.

382
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Oh !

383
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,900
Coach Pruitt ?

384
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,300
You're an adult.

385
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,100
You're supposed to protect us !

386
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,900
No, look, Rainey, this is all
in good fun here, okay ?

387
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,000
I wonder if Principal Palmer
thinks it's in good fun.

388
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
You threatening me ?

389
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,900
I doubt she'd want a perv
like you teaching us.

390
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,100
You are way out of bounds, young lady.
You know what I'm saying ?

391
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
It was just a little hazing.

392
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Rainey couldn't deal.

393
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,800
Coach Pruitt was in the girls' locker room ?

394
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,800
Sure, he let us in the gym.

395
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,900
Bought us beer from time to time.

396
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Totally cool guy.

397
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,400
And Rainey threatened to rat him out ?

398
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
She was up tight.

399
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Girls I'm with need to know how to party.

400
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,700
If she went to the principal,

401
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,200
it would have meant Pruitt's job,
his future.

402
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,400
So maybe he shut her up before
she had the chance.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,900
Coach Pruitt

404
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,900
You must be Lamont's parents.

405
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
He's a great kid. I just wanted
to discuss his homework environment.

406
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
Detectives Miller,

407
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,400
Jeffries. Homicide.

408
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,300
We're investigating the murder
of Rainey Karlsen.

409
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Rainey, that was, uh...

410
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
Ten years ago.

411
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,100
My first year of teaching.

412
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,900
Understand she caught you playing peekaboo

413
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
in the girls' locker room.

414
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Threatened to tell the principal
and ruin your career.

415
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
Well...

416
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,300
fortunately, she never reported me.

417
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,400
That is fortunate... for you.

418
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,400
She did, however, teach me a valuable lesson.

419
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,200
And that was ?

420
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,000
It was time for me to grow up,

421
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
stop trying to be friends with my students.

422
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
And that's relevant to her murder...

423
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,700
how ?

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,300
It happened the day of the pep rally.

425
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
The one Rainey missed. Yeah.

426
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,000
Morning after, they...

427
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,500
found her body.

428
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,100
So what happened ?

429
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Rainey blew her top.

430
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,700
She wasn't gonna take it anymore.

431
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
We all know that force is a vector.

432
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,500
You can see here that that's
represented by these arrows.

433
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,500
If a table didn't push back with the
equal force gravity exerts on the book,

434
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
it would go right through the table.

435
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Quit your sniveling.

436
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Last year I rolled a 12.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
That's why books don't
go right through tables.

438
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,000
Pretty weird, if you ask me.

439
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,500
Um, that was good, Doreen.

440
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,200
Go ahead and sit down.

441
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Becca, you're next.

442
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
Friction.

443
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,000
It's a real downer.

444
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,200
How do you fix it ?

445
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
Lubrication.

446
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
Ooh !

447
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Very nice,Becca.

448
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
What ?

449
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,700
How was that a real presentation ?

450
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,800
She doesn't even have a poster
board. Why is that okay ?

451
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,100
I mean, it'd be great if she were a
playmate and this were the Playboy Mansion,

452
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,600
but this is supposed to be a physics class.

453
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
I know I'd rather be at the Playboy Mansion.

454
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,500
We're supposed to actually be learning things.

455
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,300
All right, Rainey,

456
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,700
you've made your point.

457
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Why should I listen to you ?

458
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,600
'Cause you're the teacher ?

459
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,900
You're a joke.

460
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
I'll give you detention, young lady.

461
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
No way.

462
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm not afraid of you.

463
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,500
You tell him, Rainey. Joe,

464
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,800
drawing on your desk,
that's vandalism... detention.

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't turn this on him
just so you can feel

466
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
in charge while you let your
buddies do whatever they want.

467
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,600
You're pushing it.

468
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,600
Joe is the only real person in here !

469
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,300
Rainey... The rest of you are just...

470
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,400
pod people !

471
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm out of here !

472
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,900
Someone needs to take a chill pill... bo-kay ?

473
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,000
Bo-kay that !

474
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Rainey called me out.

475
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
And she was right.

476
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
Joe went after Rainey ?

477
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,800
He find her ?

478
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,500
I don't know. I never saw her again.

479
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Funny how Joe forgot to mention any of this.

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You said... Joe did a lot of drawing on his desk.

481
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Yeah.

482
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Kid fancied himself a angst-ridden Picasso.

483
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,400
You still have that desk ?

484
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,800
Is this a public school ?

485
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Uh, it's, uh,

486
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,400
one of these over here.

487
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,500
Look familiar ?

488
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,800
Recognize this ?

489
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, it looks like my handiwork.

490
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,200
What about this ?

491
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,600
You were with Rainey the night she died.

492
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
You wrote your secret in the museum,
you killed her.

493
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,100
Yeah.

494
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,100
I wrote it. It was me.

495
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Are you admitting to the murder of Rainey Karlsen ?

496
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes.

497
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,700
Just like that.

498
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,700
You did it ?

499
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Yeah.

500
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,700
You want to tell us why, Joe ?

501
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,600
People kill people all the time for no reason.

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,600
But Rainey stood up for you.

503
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
Told Coach Pruitt to s

504
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,400
You didn't drug Rainey with GHB, did you ?

505
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
No.

506
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Then why admit to it ?

507
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,500
It's our ten-year reunion.

508
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,800
No one thinks about her...

509
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
cares about her.

510
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
No one but you.

511
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,400
It's my fault she died.

512
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm the unbalanced force.

513
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,400
If it weren't for me,

514
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
she'd be alive today.

515
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey.

516
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,800
Been looking for you everywhere.

517
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,700
And the one place you're not is the pep rally.

518
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah.

519
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm not going.

520
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Does that mean you're quitting ?

521
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm already in trouble with Becca.

522
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,900
If I quit, she'd turn everyone against me.

523
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,100
I'd go through the rest of high school

524
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
being...

525
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,700
A nobody ?

526
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Yeah.

527
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,700
Wha... What are you doing ?

528
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,200
It's an atom.

529
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,800
Or the universe.

530
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,400
Or high school.

531
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,300
So that's what it looks like.

532
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,100
You don't want to be these orbiting dots,

533
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,900
because then you get all tangled up

534
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,500
in... the beginnings and endings of things,

535
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
and you bump into other dots.

536
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,600
What do you want to be ?

537
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
The center.

538
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Grounded...

539
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,400
and observant.

540
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,600
Still.

541
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,800
And....

542
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,100
um...

543
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,900
when bodies fall out of the gravitational pull

544
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,800
of a larger body,

545
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
that's when they become their own center.

546
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,500
I like that.

547
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
I draw it a lot.

548
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,000
To remind myself.

549
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,700
Does it work ?

550
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,300
Yeah.

551
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,700
I mean,sometimes.

552
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,500
It can be lonely.

553
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,400
Can two centers be friends ?

554
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,100
I'd like to think so.

555
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm gonna quit the cheerleading squad.

556
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300
You're better than them, Rainey.

557
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm gonna go to tell Becca right now.

558
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,600
Before I lose my courage.

559
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Hey, Rainey,

560
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,600
remember, it's just high school.

561
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah.

562
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,600
It's just high school.

563
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I was wrong.

564
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
It wasn't just high school.

565
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
Same night Rainey died,

566
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
she told Becca to shove it.

567
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,500
And you never told the cops ?

568
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
I was the bad druggie kid,

569
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,600
voted most likely to serve time.

570
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,900
If you said you were with
Rainey the night she died,

571
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,000
you'd be the scapegoat.

572
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
No one would've believed it was Becca.

573
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,900
She was the Queen Bee.

574
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I'll handle this.

575
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
This is a special night for me.

576
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,700
It's my ten-year reunion.

577
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Can't your stupid investigation
wait until tomorrow ?

578
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,300
Tough to say good-bye to the
glory days, huh, Becca ?

579
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
What's that supposed to mean ?

580
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Your life peaked at the high school prom.

581
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
Everything since then...

582
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
it's been all downhill.

583
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I happen to be perfectly happy.

584
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Is that why you can't hold down a job ?

585
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,200
Why at 28, you've had two failed marriages ?

586
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,200
Going on three ?

587
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,700
Little fish in a big pond.

588
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
That's why this night means so much.

589
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,900
You get to be Great White Becca again.

590
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I don't have to listen to this.

591
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,200
The old Becca would have never run away.

592
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,900
You ruled this school. When you said
"Jump," they said, "How high ?"

593
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
Being popular was a full-time job, 24/7.

594
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,900
Then Rainey comes along.

595
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Tells you to take your pom-poms
and shove 'em.Excuse me ?

596
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
I rescued that toe-bag from Loserville.

597
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
I don't think so. No ?

598
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
She was going to quit the squad.

599
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Show the world what a loser you were.

600
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,000
News flash: I am not a loser.

601
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,200
I showed that bitch who was boss.

602
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,800
You know, Rainey not showing up
for the pep rally

603
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
really screwed our formation.

604
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,200
Our totem pyramid was lopsided without her.

605
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,500
She's totally out of line.

606
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
So what are you gonna do about her ?

607
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,500
You know what I need from you bitches ?

608
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,800
More complaining.

609
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
I'll deal with her, all right ?

610
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
But for right now...

611
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I have a surprise for you.

612
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
We're gonna party hardy tonight, bo-kay ?

613
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,100
All you need is one drop. Seriously.

614
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,600
What is it ?

615
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,000
Liquid X.

616
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
It'll make you feel like ten times as drunk.

617
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
And that's good news for you, Celeste.

618
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Fewer calories.

619
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,100
Well, look who decides to show.

620
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Thanks for ruining formation, Rainey.

621
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,800
You rock. And P.S.:

622
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,100
that stunt you pulled in class ? Not cool.

623
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm quitting.

624
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,500
What ?

625
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
No, you're not. Nobody quits.

626
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Well, I am. Rainey, no. You can't.

627
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,600
Celeste, it's okay. You can quit, too.

628
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
But I don't want to. Get a grip, Celeste.

629
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,500
No one's quitting.

630
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,900
Do you know how lucky you are to be on this squad ?

631
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,000
How many girls would die to shake your pom-poms ?

632
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
I don't want it

633
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,000
if it means the prize is being you.

634
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,000
Being me ?

635
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,500
You're the meanest, most manipulative, most...

636
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
vapid person I have ever known.

637
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Every girl wants to be you

638
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,400
because every guy in school wants to bang you.

639
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,400
Good luck holding onto that for the next 40 years

640
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
because that's all you have.

641
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,400
I want something more.

642
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
Don't move a muscle, bitch.

643
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,900
Grab her !

644
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Right now !

645
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,900
You know, Rainey, you skipped out on hazing.

646
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,700
I think it's time you had your fair share.

647
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,600
Get off me !

648
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
Give me a drink. Get off me !

649
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Now, Celeste !

650
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,600
Come here !

651
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
What's wrong with her ?

652
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
She only had one beer !

653
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,100
We're out of here, Celeste.

654
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,800
She's your friend. You clean this mess up.

655
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,500
I taught that twit who was boss: me.

656
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,300
You left Rainey on the field with Celeste ?

657
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,300
Yeah.

658
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,100
Those two losers deserved each other.

659
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,600
And Celeste handed you the drink ?

660
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,100
You sure about that, Becca ?

661
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,500
Look, I-I don't know what Thunder Thighs did.

662
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Okay ? And frankly, I don't care.

663
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,500
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
a full evening to attend to.

664
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,100
Don't move a muscle... bitch.

665
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,800
Surprised to find you here, Celeste.

666
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,500
Everything looks so small.

667
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,300
Back then, it all seemed so important.

668
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,900
Making peace with the past ?

669
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,200
That why you came back ?

670
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,200
Make peace with Rainey ?

671
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Crap.

672
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,600
I was almost happy.

673
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,300
You were never happy back then.

674
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
That why you drugged your own beer ?

675
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,400
I just wanted to fit in.

676
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Be popular.

677
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,700
To be liked. Instead, they used you.

678
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Humiliated you.

679
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,200
Rainey didn't. She stood up for you.

680
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,000
She was your best friend.

681
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Rainey left me

682
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,000
in that locker room...

683
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,900
alone.

684
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,100
What happened ?

685
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,000
In that locker room.

686
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,600
I just want to forget it.

687
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,200
Please.

688
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
Rolling the dice...

689
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
wasn't just kissing,

690
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,400
Celeste, was it ?

691
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,700
Rainey found out.

692
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,700
she was gonna destroy the squad.

693
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,600
You couldn't let her do that.

694
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,900
I'd given up everything to be a cheerleader.

695
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,400
I paid too high a price.

696
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,600
Come on. You have to get help, Rainey.

697
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,500
We have to get help.

698
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,000
Wow. I'm really sick.

699
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
That was my beer and it had a whole bottle of X in it.

700
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,800
We need to go now.

701
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,100
What ? Why would you drug your own beer ?

702
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,500
I just wanted to check out for a little bit.

703
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Check out ?

704
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,900
You mean like... kill yourself ?

705
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,900
No.

706
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,800
Forget it, Rainey.

707
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,200
Just forget it.

708
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Real friends don't do the things they do.

709
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,800
Let's walk away, Celeste.

710
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Walk away ?

711
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
Like what you did to me in the locker room ?

712
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,400
I'm so sorry.

713
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,900
I heard you had to kiss ten guys.

714
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
It wasn't kissing, Rainey.

715
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
When I tell my mom... No, you can't tell.

716
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,600
It's gonna be over.

717
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,300
Over ?

718
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
There'll be no more squad anymore.

719
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,000
But without a squad, what will I do ?

720
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Anything you want.

721
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
You're funny.

722
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,300
You're smart.

723
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,100
But the squad's all I've got.

724
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm popular now.

725
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,500
And people like me.

726
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,100
And I'm finally...

727
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,100
somebody.

728
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,500
You always were somebody, Celeste.

729
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,700
To me.

730
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,000
I can't give it up now.

731
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,200
After all I've been through.

732
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
All I've done.

733
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
It's all I have, Rainey.

734
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,700
I feel really sick.

735
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,600
Maybe you should call an ambulance.

736
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,700
I'm gonna tell my mom what they did.

737
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,500
I already called an ambulance, Rainey.

738
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,100
You did ?

739
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Yeah.

740
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
They're coming any minute now.

741
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,800
Don't you worry.

742
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Thanks, Be-Fri.

743
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,700
You're my best friend.

744
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,100
I think I hear sirens.

745
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Me too, St-End.

746
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,700
Joe's right.

747
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,100
You can see it all from the center.

748
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm gonna go to sleep now, okay ?

749
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay.

750
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
("High and Dry" by Radiohead playing)

751
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
* Two jumps in a week *

752
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,700
* I bet you think that's pretty clever *

753
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,300
* Don't you, boy ? *

754
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,600
* Flying on your motorcycle *

755
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,900
* Watching all the ground beneath you drop *

756
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,500
* You'd kill yourself for recognition *

757
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,200
* Kill yourself to never, ever stop *

758
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,900
* You broke another mirror *

759
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,400
* You're turning into something you are not *

760
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,100
* Don't leave me high *

761
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,100
* Don't leave me dry *

762
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,700
* Drying up in conversation *

763
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,500
* You will be the one who cannot talk *

764
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,800
* All your insides fall to pieces *

765
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,200
* You just sit there wishing you could still make love *

766
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
* They're the ones who'll hate you *

767
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,700
* When you think you've got the world *

768
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,900
* All sussed out *

769
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,600
 ? ? ?

770
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,700
* You will be the one screaming out *

771
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,200
* Don't leave me high *

772
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,700
* Don't leave me dry *

773
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,900
* Don't leave me high *

774
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,400
* Don't leave me dry *

775
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:47,300
* Don't leave me high *

776
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,100
* Don't leave me high *

777
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,000
* Don't leave me dry. *
