00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:04,855
June 8, 1997

4
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:07,150
What do you say, Dorothy,
should I double down?

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,237
You're showing a four,
the book says no, but hey...

6
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:11,319
you're hot.

7
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,834
Me or the cards?

8
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,243
Both.

9
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:17,747
Good luck.

10
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,809
# And teach the world 
to sing in perfect harmony #

11
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:26,850
# And teach the world 
to snuff the fires and the liars #

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,424
# Hey I know it's just a song #

13
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:30,469
# but it's spice for the recipe #

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,372
# This is a love attack .... #

15
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,870
Nice playing!

16
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:38,379
# It's just like any fad
it retracts before impact #

17
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:39,347
# And just like fashion.... #

18
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,156
Nice flirting with you, Dorothy.

19
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,037
You should never quit
after a win.

20
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:45,095
I got a feeling my luck's
running out.

21
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:48,588
# So don't delay act #

22
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,941
# now supplies are running out #

23
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:54,813
# Allow if you're still alive 
six to eight years to arrive #

24
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,976
# And if you follow 
there may be a tomorrow #

25
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,892
# But if the offer is shun #

26
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:03,517
# you might as well be 
walkin' on the sun #

27
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,416
You waste your money
on the daily numbers?

28
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,648
- Every morning.
- Five bucks down the drain.

29
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,618
I don't got dependents.
I can afford it.

30
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:48,514
- So if you won big, you'd retire?
- Nah. I'd stay doing what I do.

31
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:52,681
I'd just dress sharper...
if that's possible...

32
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,032
- and brag a lot more.
- If that's possible.

33
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,643
Lil, you want to take a look at this?

34
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:58,633
What is it?

35
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:01,531
Regional broadcast
from Delaware State Police.

36
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,003
They just got a murder similar to
a cold job in Jersey.

37
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,702
Young white male,
walked into the woods,

38
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:07,887
shot once in the chest.
Both were hitchhikers.

39
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,608
- Motive?
- Straight robbery.

40
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:12,490
Bullet in both cases was .38 caliber.

41
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,899
"Requesting information on
any like murders,

42
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,556
solved or unsolved, in the region."

43
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:17,928
What, they think they got 
a serial murder?

44
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:20,402
- Sounds like it.
- Nice. I'll check the H-records.

45
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,563
We had a job like that.

46
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:24,620
Yeah, a kid hitchhiking.

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,063
Five, six years ago.
Danny Saltzman's job.

48
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,187
Saltzman. Right.

49
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,248
What do you remember about it?

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,177
It was in the Summer.
And just like you said,

51
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,443
in the forest, hitchhiker, .38 slug.

52
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:34,477
Remember his name?

53
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:35,643
I should remember.

54
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,516
Saltzy brayed on and on about that kid.

55
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:40,193
There wasn't much on it,
some footprints, fiber.

56
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah, he just turned 20,
uh... "Gone good."

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,487
Saltzman was always saying.

58
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,058
"Crummy kid gone good", over and over.

59
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:46,772
He was a good-looking kid.

60
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:48,627
Saltzman had his picture taped up
on the wall.

61
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,086
Damn, this name thing's gonna bug me.

62
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,931
You ever establish who the kid
caught a ride with?

63
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,967
Nah, case went cold fast.

64
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,754
Dean... I think his name was Dean.

65
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:57,697
No, it wasn't Dean.

66
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:59,204
- Darren... Darren something.
- No.

67
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,192
Matt.

68
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:04,097
- What?
- Mills. Matt Mills.

69
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,882
Right. That's it.

70
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,481
Yeah. Almost had it.

71
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:18,767

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/12/21

80
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,242
Matt Mills, 20,

81
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,464
shot in the woods off the Expressway.

82
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:49,676
The 3,000 bucks he'd just won
in Atlantic City, gone.

83
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,533
Like the other two jobs.

84
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,300
I talked to Jersey and Delaware,
both are thinking it's the same doer.

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,463
Serial killer.

86
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:57,642
Our guy Matt could've been his first.

87
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,391
Well, Matt's killed in '97.

88
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:01,776
Jersey's body turns up fall of 2000.

89
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,397
And Delaware's just four weeks ago.

90
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:04,855
A three-year cooling off period.

91
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:06,894
I say we go right now.
To Delaware.

92
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:09,186
No need.
Delaware's coming here.

93
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,109
Don't get too excited, Scotty.

94
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,677
A serial job don't get you
hopped up just a little, boss?

95
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,314
What else do we know
about the victims, Lil?

96
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,451
All young guys, 18 to 20.

97
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,397
All three were headed home
from Atlantic City

98
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,723
after winning a few thousand
in the casinos.

99
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,079
So the doer hangs around the tables,

100
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,831
stalks the winners,
catches up to them

101
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,300
on the lonely road home.

102
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,019
These kids are leaving
with thousands of bucks.

103
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,002
Why are they hitchhiking?

104
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:34,273
File says Matt missed his bus back.

105
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,019
I could win ten grand over there,

106
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,778
I still ain't paying a cabbie
300 bucks to drive me home.

107
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,069
Now, you put it that way,
I guess my tumb's out too.

108
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,805
Besides the robbery and the .38,

109
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:45,406
we got a size ten print that
lines up with other murders.

110
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,301
Plus the gray carpet fiber
on the body.

111
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,454
Delaware and Jersey
have a list of seven suspects

112
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:50,692
that could've done both jobs.

113
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,967
Add in this murder,
maybe we narrow it down even more.

114
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,295
Vera and Jeffries can check 
the list, see if anyone

115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,219
had ties to Philly in '97.

116
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,282
Hmm. / What?

117
00:04:58,282 --> 00:04:59,422
When Matt was 17,

118
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,836
he got locked up by
my Sergeant at West Detectives.

119
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:02,825
For what?

120
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:05,144
Him and his cousin robbed
a food mart. Got probation.

121
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,653
I'll put a call in,
see if he remembers Matt.

122
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:08,307
Good.

123
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,634
Better get to the family, Lil.

124
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,530
Let them know what's going on.

125
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:20,866
Hello.

126
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,045
What's your name?

127
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:23,227
Katie.

128
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,741
- I'm Detective Rush.
- Detective Valens.

129
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,041
Are your parents home?

130
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,303
Is it about Matt?

131
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,484
How'd you know?

132
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,835
Whenever it's cops,
it's about Matt.

133
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,469
So Matt was in Atlantic City

134
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,570
visiting his cousin 
Blaine that weekend?

135
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,850
Matt hadn't seen Blaine 
for a long time,

136
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,931
he wanted to go whoop it up with him.

137
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,139
Yeah, he'd earned it.

138
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:45,306
How so?

139
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,455
He was working for a brokerage house.

140
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,010
An entry level position,
but a good start.

141
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,329
He'd gotten into computers,
that investment world.

142
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:54,591
It was impressive.

143
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,142
During the days,
he was hustling at his jobs,

144
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:59,569
nights he was over at Drexel
taking classes.

145
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,648
Folks he worked for liked him,

146
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:02,266
but Matt knew he needed his B.A.

147
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,271
Sounds like your son really stepped up.

148
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:06,676
After that trouble he 
and Blaine got into.

149
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:11,308
A footnote in our file mentions 
the food mart robbery.

150
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,296
It wasn't a footnote to us.

151
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:18,064
Matt had some... very bad years.

152
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,159
First, he was stealing 
money off my dresser,

153
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,827
then breaking into the neighbor's house.

154
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,322
I'm glad he robbed that store.

155
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:27,413
He became a different 
person after that.

156
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,771
Scared straight.

157
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,596
No.

158
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,881
That didn't straighten him out.

159
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,020
He straightened himself out.

160
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,802
There's a difference.

161
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,894
That kid...

162
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,330
He had what it takes.

163
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:44,986
He had it.

164
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:48,557
Well, the next three years,

165
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,969
Matt was the boy we'd always 
dreamed we'd have.

166
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,156
And what about Blaine?

167
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,917
Blaine's still over in Atlantic City.

168
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,460
You the guys from Philly?

169
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:04,443
Blaine Robbins.

170
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:05,821
Detectives Rush and Valens.

171
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:06,476
Hey.

172
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,474
Gotta admit, um...
I'm not that glad to see you guys.

173
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,517
Dragging up Matty's ghost
has me feeling kind of funky.

174
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,145
- Don't you want his murder solved?
- Definitely.

175
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,098
Look, he missed his bus.

176
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:22,490
I told him stay, but 
he had to be at work.

177
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:25,961
I would've given him a 
ride myself, but no wheels.

178
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,189
Well, you remember anyone watching Matt
that night, haning around him?

179
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,950
Well, I wasn't with him at the time,

180
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,905
but Matt is a... was....
a real approachable guy.

181
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,259
Let's talk about that robbery 
you and Matt did.

182
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,255
Those were our bad years.

183
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:42,275
We were kids.

184
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,008
Kids who needed a thousand bucks.

185
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,131
A thousand bucks for what?

186
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,834
Start a vending machine business.

187
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,548
What, like a Coke machine?

188
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:49,653
Candy bars.

189
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,830
There was a machine for sale 
for $1,000.

190
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,145
And the idea was, 
after we stocked it,

191
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:55,944
Matt and I could clear $300

192
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,128
a week!

193
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,266
Young guys, thinking big.

194
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,450
Yeah... Yeah.

195
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,758
Anything else about that night?

196
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:10,968
No, I...
I was kind of hammered.

197
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,693
Been celerbrating all night.

198
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,746
Celebrating what?

199
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,945
Matty had become a real entrepreneur.

200
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:19,853
This rockin' investment opportunity
had just come our way...

201
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,142
So this Click Twice 
stock is a sure thing?

202
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,518
For us to get in on an IPO,

203
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,352
the broker would be doing us 
a major favor.

204
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,845
And that would get us in 
on the ground floor,

205
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,255
right where you wanna be.

206
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:33,158
The stock'll shoot right up,
that's why everyone wants in.

207
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,226
But then it'll re-set, 
find its real value.

208
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:39,385
But, by that time, 
you and me have already cashed out.

209
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,281
Millionaires by age 25.

210
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,624
We would've made out like bandits.

211
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,102
But...

212
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:52,267
without Matty, the deal...
went up in smoke.

213
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,234
How's our list doing?

214
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,281
Getting shorter.

215
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:58,891
Two guys were in jail in '97,

216
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,952
three others have good, 
substantiated whereabouts

217
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:01,952
at the time of Matt's murder.

218
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,369
So that leaves two.

219
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,082
One.

220
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:07,384
Oh. Meet Sam Royal, 
Delaware State Police.

221
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,768
- How's it going?
- Okay.

222
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,315
Down to one, huh? / Yeah.

223
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:13,314
My suspect number 
two was in a hospital

224
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:16,143
in Bridgeport having dialysis
the night Matt was killed.

225
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,283
So who's that leave?

226
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,440
Henry Floyd.

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,511
Truck dirver with a three-page sheet.

228
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:25,048
He's a convicted thief,
con artist, attempted rapist...

229
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:27,827
- overall menace to society.
- Sounds like you know him pretty good.

230
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:31,005
Yeah. I interviewed him.
He's got ice water in his veins.

231
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,507
And a size ten shoe.

232
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,512
Guns?

233
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:37,313
Got three registered hand guns,
including a .38 Smith and Wesson.

234
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:40,517
Oh, and, uh... Mac 
withdrawls puts Floyd

235
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:42,780
in the AC casinos the night 
before each of the murders.

236
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,001
Gas receipts also put him 
near the crime scenes.

237
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,516
I'm liking Floyd more and more.

238
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:48,313
Oh, when I asked him about these kids,

239
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:51,764
the cocky S.O.B. smiles at me
and tells me

240
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:53,670
he never picks up hitchhikers.

241
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,368
What was cocky about that?

242
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:57,689
I never mentioned hitchhikers.

243
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,618
I wanna meet this guy.

244
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:03,262
I got copies of his logs,
he's due back tomorrow.

245
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,872
Where's he stay in Philly?

246
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,832
Uh, he's got ties
to a woman out in Bristol.

247
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,556
- What's the tie?
- Girlfriend.

248
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,933
Name's Janice Burns.

249
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:13,331
Yep...

250
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,347
I'm the girlfriend.

251
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,860
- That always sounds so silly.
- Why is that?

252
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:24,859
I look like a girly-girl to you,
Hot Stuff?

253
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,394
Besides, um... I wouldn't exactly...

254
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,666
consider what we got
a traditional situation.

255
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,730
What do you have?

256
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,669
Henry comes here for one thing.

257
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,535
Two, if he decides to stay 
and eat up all my food.

258
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,451
That doesn't sound like
you get much out of this.

259
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,590
Why you let him in?

260
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,895
Because if I don't, 
he'll get his tool box

261
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,554
and he'll take the door off the hinges.

262
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,558
He's done it before.

263
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:54,277
Who knew you'd be better off 
leaving your door unlocked.

264
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:57,020
Janice, you never called
the police, filed charges?

265
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,231
- Nope.
- Why not?

266
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,713
I know what he'd do to me.

267
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,881
Look, I made my bed.

268
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,360
The only reason I met Henry

269
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,192
was I was at the truck stops 
looking for dates.

270
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:13,095
And now that animal's been
in my life for ten years.

271
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,919
I knew what I was doing was risky.

272
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,783
So, tomorrow is just another day?

273
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,267
What's tomorrow?

274
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,770
Henry's coming to town.

275
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,442
I didn't know that.

276
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:24,468
He hasn't called you?

277
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:27,243
Like I said, I leave the door open.

278
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:29,661
Damn it.

279
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:30,925
Ah, don't worry about it.

280
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,249
Janice, you say Henry's been trampling 
in and out of here the last ten years?

281
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:37,279
That's right.

282
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,977
And how long have you had this gray carpet?

283
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,645
Hey, lab going to do a rush job 
on that fiber?

284
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,095
We'll have the results
by the end of the day.

285
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,350
You check on Floyd?

286
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,052
On schedule. Should arrive
at Muncy's Meats by noon.

287
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,045
It'll take him at least another 
40 minutes to get out to Janice's.

288
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:00,223
- We'll go early and wait for him.
- Royal's already on his way over.

289
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,002
He's got it bad for this guy?

290
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:04,707
Got a few hours. 
Wanna take a ride, see my old Sergeant.

291
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:05,575
He called back.

292
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,836
He remembers the arrest?

293
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:10,017
Just says he's in the office.
We should swing by.

294
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,842
Scotty Valens.

295
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,259
How's Homicide treating you?

296
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,298
Ain't all bad. 
How's things here?

297
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:20,539
Good and quiet with you gone.

298
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,688
Manny, this is
my new partner, Lilly Rush.

299
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:24,553
Nice to meet you.

300
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,237
Same here.

301
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:28,181
Here's that DC number on that 
arrest I was talking about.

302
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,152
Two kids robbing a food mart, right?

303
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:30,801
Yeah.

304
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,804
Let me grab the 49...

305
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,115
Cousins.

306
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,221
One of the kids, Matt Mills,
ended up dead.

307
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,802
Matt was younger of the two.

308
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,156
Him mom said getting locked up 
scared Matt pretty good.

309
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,916
I don't know if it was so much 
about being locked up

310
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,233
as it was that Russian 
reading him the riot act.

311
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,820
The Russian is the store owner?

312
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,346
Yeah. Ivan Medvedenko.

313
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,695
Made a scene out here 
you wouldn't forget too easy.

314
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:54,643
so I took the phone, dialed 911.

315
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,965
I should've ran after them.

316
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,116
No, calling was the right thing.

317
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,290
That is one, right there.

318
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,010
You!

319
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,661
You stole from me!

320
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:07,662
Shame on you.
Your dirty hands.

321
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,114
Lazy, American boy.

322
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,501
Calm down, Ivan.

323
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:13,519
How old are you?

324
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,251
Seventeen.

325
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,149
Too late.

326
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,297
Too late for what?

327
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,438
Change.

328
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:24,051
You'll always be spoiled.

329
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,124
Die!

330
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:28,117
Just, die.

331
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,205
A boy like you no one will miss.

332
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:32,518
Johnny, take this man downstairs.

333
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:36,585
Russian tells Matt to die.

334
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,393
Anything behind those words?

335
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:41,477
First detectives on that kid's 
murder came asking the same,

336
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,919
but Medvedenko had no record.

337
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,304
Wonder if Matt and Blaine 
ever want back to his store.

338
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:48,479
If they were dumb enough to do that,
then I'd say all bets were off.

339
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:49,772
Sorry.

340
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:51,826
Rush.

341
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:55,000
- Working with a girl, huh.
- Yeah.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,484
She a political case?

343
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,849
Nah, she came from North.

344
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,474
Did real good there.

345
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,041
Floyd just got to town.

346
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,482
Gotta go. Thanks, Manny.

347
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,443
Henry Floyd?

348
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:26,811
Yeah.

349
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,897
Philadelphia Police.

350
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,134
Sit down, Henry.

351
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,115
Get you some coffee?

352
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,742
Sure you can't offer me more
than that, sweet tits?

353
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:55,672
Oh... you and me are gonna
some problems, Henry.

354
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:56,970
It's okay, Scotty.

355
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,386
You wanna do me, huh?

356
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,152
I'm not sure yet.

357
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,541
Twirl around once.

358
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,807
Scotty, give me and Henry 
some private time.

359
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,073
You've been naughty, Henry.

360
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,655
Three murders along your truck route.

361
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,202
So?

362
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:27,451
We've been charting where you've been
and what you've done,

363
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,937
and not just us.

364
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:30,762
Jersey and Delaware cops are 
on your ass, too.

365
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,979
Am I under arrest?

366
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:33,500
No.

367
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,070
You're free to go.

368
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,310
Want to?

369
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,561
No, I'm enjoying myself.

370
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:44,515
We have copies of your trucking logs,
credit card receipts,

371
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:46,024
day-to-day map of your whereabouts.

372
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:50,232
Dolly, none of that means 
nothing and you know it.

373
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,883
Actually, one good piece of 
physical evidence

374
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,328
can mean everything.

375
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,824
And we have fibers, Floyd.

376
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,119
from Janice's carpet.

377
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,944
Oh, you've seen Janice?

378
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:06,417
So you know what an upgrade you'd be.

379
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,280
Three murder trials in three states.

380
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,693
Anyway you look at it,

381
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,851
you'll get the needle.

382
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:16,187
Matt Mills.

383
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,383
You ended his life for $3,000.

384
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,302
- You ever think on that?
- I don't get your meaning.

385
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:25,664
Well, what's the lowest you'd 
end someone's life for?

386
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:28,292
2,000, 1,000...

387
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,648
a Swiss Army Knife?

388
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,703
Dolly, you and me...

389
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,190
we don't see the world the same way.

390
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,145
Oh, you're a Philosopher.

391
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:41,080
So that gives you the right
to take someone's life away?

392
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,169
You're putting words in my mouth.

393
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,997
I didn't kill him, didn't kill anyone.

394
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,825
Then take a polygraph for me.

395
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,077
Okay.

396
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:56,704
Did you murder Matt Mills?

397
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,157
No.

398
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,424
Did you kill Chuck Praska?

399
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:05,199
Chuck get iced in Jersey or Delaware?

400
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,711
Yes or no answers, Floyd.

401
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,858
Roger that.

402
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:13,713
Did you murder Chuck Praska?

403
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,189
No.

404
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,443
Did you murder Brian Fritz?

405
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,164
No.

406
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,700
The next question
I want you to answer incorrectly.

407
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,627
The purpose is to intentionally
make the chart spike.

408
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,105
Is this card the ace of spades?

409
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,520
Yes.

410
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,731
He never spiked.

411
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,873
not even when he lied about the card.

412
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,727
He beat the polygraph.

413
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,852
But good.

414
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:01,477
You know, you never should have 
gone to see Janice.

415
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:12,637
Now s perfectly good ten-year
relationship will have to end.

416
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,502
You gonna kill her, too, Henry?

417
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,317
Like those three kids?

418
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:18,591
You're putting words 
in my mouth again.

419
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,914
What?

420
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,594
What are you looking at?

421
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,754
A dead man.

422
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:35,405
And get those feet off my table.

423
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:40,360
The ball on Floyd's left 
boot is severely worn down,

424
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,074
probably from pressing down 
on the clutch when he's in his rig.

425
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:43,832
First time around,

426
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,611
criminalistics looked at 
the brand, size, and tread.

427
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:48,224
Maybe they never looked at 
the ball of the foot.

428
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:51,026
So let's pull the molds from evidence,
re-submit them to the lab.

429
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,294
You wanna that Jersey know?

430
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,538
Yeah.

431
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,402
- Hey.
- See you.

432
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,139
Yeah.

433
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,619
Lot of wear and tear 
on Floyd's left hoof.

434
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,773
If the plaster molds 
match, we got him.

435
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,662
Good. 'Cause the fiber match 
didn't happen.

436
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,112
- Crap.
- Inconclusive.

437
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,901
But I got something else.

438
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:09,955
Yeah, what?

439
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:11,379
Manny called back.

440
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,564
He ran that store owner
through the computer again.

441
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:16,228
Starting '99, he does have a sheet.

442
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:17,197
For what?

443
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,427
Arrested for assaulting one of 
his customers.

444
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:20,839
Then five months ago...

445
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,506
chased a shoplifter with a revolver.

446
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:23,973
Fired six shots.

447
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,130
What kind of revolver?

448
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,306
.38 Special.

449
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,136
Just like the one that killed Matt.

450
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,116
Better go have a conversation.

451
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,337
Philadelphia Homicide.

452
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:43,528
We wanna ask you some question.

453
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:45,846
I haven't done anything.

454
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:48,622
We're investigating the murder
of a young man you had history with.

455
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,780
Recognize him?

456
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,267
You know who that boy is, don't you?

457
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,914
He robbed me.

458
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,690
Him and the other.

459
00:19:58,202 --> 00:19:59,661
Held you at gunpoint, right?

460
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:00,863
Like animals.

461
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:12,072
Thanks.

462
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:31,811
Hey.

463
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:33,759
What are you doing there?

464
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,634
Sorry, pops.

465
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:35,966
Hey!

466
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,147
Get away.

467
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:39,069
If you don't get away, 
I'll call the police.

468
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,351
Get away, I said!

469
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:44,523
Hey!

470
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:45,196
Thief!

471
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,041
- Don't move!
- Thief!

472
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,336
Don't move! Don't move!

473
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,832
Matty, hurry!

474
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,170
Don't move!

475
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,869
You shouldn't have chased me out.
Why you gotta make things complicated?

476
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,813
Matty, hurry!

477
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:58,083
Let's go!

478
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,974
They never saw Pejia,

479
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,098
my son,

480
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:07,443
and for that... I am thankful.

481
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,114
But you must've held a grudge.

482
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,203
What's your meaning?

483
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,597
Those boys got arrested 
but only got probation.

484
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,026
- Did that get you mad, Ivan?
- They should've gone to jail.

485
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,873
And since they didn't, maybe you
decided to do something about it.

486
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:20,659
Aah, three years later?

487
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:23,763
You remember how many years later
Matt got killed?

488
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,174
You heard that kid got murdered, huh?

489
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:27,567
Yeah. Everyone talked about it.

490
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:30,282
You recall where you 
were the day he died?

491
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,207
- Here. Working, like always.
- Can you prove it?

492
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,492
I leave people alone.

493
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:37,450
I've never hurt anyone.

494
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,940
Oh, you leave people alone

495
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,683
outside of when you shoot your gun
off at them, is that it?

496
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,552
I don't have a gun.

497
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,852
Medvedenko, we're cops.

498
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,230
We know about you firing shots 
at the shoplifter.

499
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,184
The neighbors told police 
you had a .38 Special.

500
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,575
No gun was found. Go on, check.

501
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,010
That's 'cause you got rid of it.

502
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,580
Please, leave my store.

503
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,629
You wanna tell us about 
the gun, otherwise

504
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,049
you look suspicious, Ivan.

505
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,572
I sold it.

506
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:02,968
To who? / Back to whom
I bought if from Mr. Joey.

507
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,506
Mr. Joey?

508
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,457
You saying Joey's, his last name?

509
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:07,708
I don't know.

510
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,143
He just has hot guns.

511
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,692
At his pawn store.

512
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,693
You'll never find it.

513
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,317
I wanna find Mr.Joey. 
Follow that gun.

514
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,279
- Molds came back.
- The ball on the left foot?

515
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,278
Worn down.

516
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:24,413
Perfect match...

517
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,619
for Jersey and Delaware.

518
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,027
What about our job?

519
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,102
So, Floyd didn't kill Matt.

520
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,154
But it absolutely puts him away
for the other two hitchhiker jobs,

521
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,663
and, uh, honest,
I can't thank you enough.

522
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:43,256
Yeah.

523
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:44,678
Anytime.

524
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:46,977
Floyd'll go down to holding 
until Jersey can get here.

525
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,527
You can fight over him down there.

526
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:50,801
Thanks, Philly.

527
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,977
I couldn't have done it without you.

528
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,739
So, you just solved two murders.

529
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:59,127
- That's pretty decent.
- We didn't solve our murder.

530
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:00,829
Matt's our job.

531
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,080
Lil...

532
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,119
Matt's sister.

533
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:09,097
Hi, Katie.

534
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,611
Hi. Is it okay I'm here?

535
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:15,908
- Sure. Your parents with you?
- No. I got the address off your card.

536
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,073
Uh, I'm gonna go find Mr. Joey.

537
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:20,935
What can I do for you?

538
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,835
I wanted to know about Matty.

539
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,944
'Cause no one tells me,

540
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,496
and... I mean, I miss him, too.

541
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:31,294
What do you wanna know?

542
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:34,770
Do you know who killed him?

543
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,573
Not yet.

544
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,647
Blaine said a serial killer.

545
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,297
You're close to Blaine, huh?

546
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,247
He tells me things, 
not like my parents.

547
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:49,627
Well, your parents probably 
just wanna keep you young,

548
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,215
Katie, as long as possible.

549
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:53,039
Matt treated me like a grown-up.

550
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,227
Blaine's just like him.

551
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:56,896
Real nice,

552
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:58,930
really, really smart.

553
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,161
Smart, huh? / He knows how
to do all kinds of stuff.

554
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,465
He can fly a plane.

555
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,128
- Blaine's a pilot?
- He has his license.

556
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,327
And later this year, 
he's starting a restaurant.

557
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:10,738
Really.

558
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,831
Well, a nightclub kind of place.

559
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,689
I got some seed money 
saved up to invest.

560
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:19,069
Sounds like you got business 
in your blood, Katie.

561
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,547
Like Matty did.

562
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,315
He called me that night.

563
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:30,139
Matt did?

564
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,302
Before he died.

565
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:36,890
I'm coming home tomorrow, okay?

566
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,346
You made a lot of money?

567
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,158
Yup.

568
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,660
So you'll buy me something?

569
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,067
- I already did.
- What?

570
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,670
Sand dollars.

571
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,784
What else did you do there?

572
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,970
I ran into somebody I knew.

573
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,517
Sort of got into a fight with him.

574
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:54,080
It brought up some bad feelings.

575
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:55,317
Matty?

576
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:58,117
Yeah?

577
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:01,107
Besides the sand dollars, 
could you bring taffy, too?

578
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:03,832
Sure. Taffy, too.

579
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,186
I was only ten.

580
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:09,574
I didn't think about what he said.

581
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,090
I understand.

582
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,168
But now I'm thinking that maybe

583
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:15,878
it mattered that he ran into someone.

584
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:16,944
It might.

585
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,611
Thanks for telling me now.

586
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,286
He first came by after
them two kids robbed him.

587
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,761
Said he had to have a gun.

588
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:24,951
You gave him the .38.

589
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,581
Then all was quiet for, like, years

590
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,789
till he ran wild on that shoplifter.

591
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,929
After that craziness, he came back,
wanting to move that gun real quick.

592
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,514
I need to get that gun, Jeoy.
Where is it now?

593
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:35,934
I only had it another week.

594
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,993
It went back out hot?

595
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,069
Nah. I'm riding on the boulevard,
minding my own business.

596
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:42,188
These bozos on patrol pulled me over.

597
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:43,028
I wonder why.

598
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:44,820
The bastard said I ran a light.

599
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,179
Next thing you know, 
they're confiscating

600
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,669
that .38 out of my glove box,

601
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,274
and I'm on my way back to court.

602
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,440
What did the Judge say?

603
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,454
Ordered that gun destroyed.

604
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:54,128
Wasn't such a loss.

605
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:55,874
I might've had a body on it anyway.

606
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:58,175
How well you know this Ivan Medvedenko?

607
00:25:58,944 --> 00:26:00,634
Well enough to stay out of his way.

608
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:01,449
What's his deal?

609
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:03,949
When he first came to the neighborhood,
he was actually kind of nice.

610
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:07,559
Had this idea America was gonna 
treat him and his kid right.

611
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,858
Didn't work out that way?

612
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:11,631
He hated all them lowlifes 
hanging around,

613
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:14,133
homeless trying to get 
free stuff from him.

614
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,251
When he came asking for that gun,

615
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:19,905
talking about lazy 
kids needing a lesson,

616
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:23,824
he had some... glint in his eye.

617
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,768
Kind of scared me.

618
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,328
- Morning.
- Hi.

619
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,460
Over losing Floyd?

620
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,787
- All about Medvedenko now.
- What changed?

621
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,399
I've been trying to connect Medvedenko

622
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,557
to Atlantic City the weekend 
Matt was killed.

623
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,259
And?

624
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,433
Guess who won a Center City Bank 
sweepstakes, June of '97?

625
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,034
- Medvedenko.
- His wife.

626
00:26:45,756 --> 00:26:48,891
Prize was a free gambling 
junket in Atlantic City,

627
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:49,749
trip for two.

628
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,236
Medvedenko said he was working.

629
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,895
- Guess he wasn't working.
- Oh, it's gonna be a good day for us.

630
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,879
Bad one for Medvedenko.

631
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:02,164
You lied to me, Ivan.

632
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,689
I had to.

633
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,197
I knew you'd bring me in.

634
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:08,066
That you'd suspect me.

635
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,634
Those are some good instincts.

636
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,246
I'm innocent.

637
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,002
When did you come to this country, Ivan?

638
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,255
1973.

639
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:18,376
'60s and '70s were some 
dark times in Russia.

640
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,295
Walk lightly.

641
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,448
Very lightly.

642
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:24,692
Must have felt good to finally 
get to America.

643
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:29,822
Since I was a boy, it was my dream...

644
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,066
to work...

645
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,787
make your own life.

646
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,759
What a gift.

647
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,814
Then one day, two 
good-for-nothing boys,

648
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:39,778
who didn't think much of that 
gift, came and robbed you.

649
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:41,671
I didn't kill that boy.

650
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:42,850
Take a seat.

651
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:47,143
Don't lie to me.

652
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:49,907
You were in Atlantic City, 
so was Matt Mills.

653
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:55,486
Okay.

654
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,435
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

655
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,582
Yes, I saw him in Atlantic City.

656
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,419
I saw him, did not kill him!

657
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:04,942
Remember me?

658
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,221
I-I-I don't want any trouble.

659
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,675
You don't want trouble?

660
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,347
I didn't want trouble either.

661
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,644
My son, Pejia.

662
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,778
You don't remember him.

663
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,009
But he was there when you robbed me.

664
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,127
He saw!

665
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,924
Sir, I regret what we did,

666
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:33,412
an-and I heard what you said to me.

667
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,930
I tell Pejia if he works hard,

668
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,160
he can be anything he wants.

669
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,011
But he says, "Dad,

670
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:46,777
why work hard when people 
can just take your money?"

671
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:49,289
You did that.

672
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:51,178
Sir...

673
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,905
all I can do is say I'm sorry.

674
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:57,736
Please...

675
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,717
Did you shake his hands?

676
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:04,577
No.

677
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,341
Because sorry wasn't good enough.

678
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:08,087
And who would miss this kid anyway?

679
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:09,231
What?

680
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:12,557
If he died, who would 
miss a boy like him?

681
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:14,194
Remember saying that?

682
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:14,972
No.

683
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:19,183
There he goes,

684
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:21,376
lying to me again.

685
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,238
You already lied to me about the gun.

686
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,046
You lied about leaving people alone.

687
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,859
Lied about your whereabouts 
the day of the murder.

688
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,791
I mean, who do you think 
you're lying to, Ivan?

689
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,056
I'm the police.

690
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,189
You got that?

691
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,725
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

692
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:36,624
Because you wanna see your son again,

693
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,707
I'd better start hearing some I believe.

694
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:42,117
Please.

695
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,300
You're going away, Medvedenko.

696
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,509
I'll disappear?

697
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,253
What?

698
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,358
You'll make me disappear?

699
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,365
- Or Pejia?
- Hey, you're damn right.

700
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:55,205
You wanna keep lying, Medvedenko?

701
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:58,336
Poof! Now start talking about 
how you killed Matt Mills.

702
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:02,495
- I have to see my son again.
- Tell me about the .38 you got from Joey.

703
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,721
How you took Matt in your car

704
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,213
and marched that kid into the woods

705
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:07,967
but don't you lie!

706
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,385
I hate a liar!

707
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:16,908
Yes.

708
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:18,994
Yes, what?

709
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:22,626
I did it.

710
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:24,918
I killed him.

711
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,780
You want me to feel sorry for you?

712
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,352
You murdered a kid.

713
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:45,831
- I'll write what you want.
- I write, you talk.

714
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,619
It's got to be first person.

715
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,516
The other one deserved death.

716
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,309
- What other one? Blaine?
- He put the gun to my head.

717
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,850
He was there that night, too, Ivan.

718
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,309
You could've had a twofer.

719
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,895
I saw him outside the casino,

720
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,044
but he drove away before 
I could say anything.

721
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,333
He went.

722
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:13,473
Yeah.

723
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:16,526
I'll notify Matt's family, his cousin...

724
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,854
I don't know, Scotty.

725
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,092
Don't know what?

726
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:22,181
Blaine told us he would've given 
Matt a ride home,

727
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,566
but he didn't have wheels.

728
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:26,087
But Medvedenko said he saw 
Blaine driving away in a car.

729
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,075
So, Medvedenko's lying.

730
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,964
Maybe, but you should check it out.

731
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:33,000
We did. DMV shows Blaine 
didn't own a car in '97.

732
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,975
But AutoTrack just gave me 
a secondary address

733
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,583
on Blaine for all of '97.

734
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,390
A magazine subscription 
was sent to his workplace.

735
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,636
What workplace?

736
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,378
Roll-The-Dice Rentals.

737
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:44,154
A rent-a-car company.

738
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,196
Would have given Blaine 
access to a car.

739
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,596
Medvedenko just confessed.

740
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:51,390
I mean, why would he go 
if he didn't do it?

741
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,990
Because you got him wetting his pants.

742
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,060
You figured out where he lives, 
and you went there.

743
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,057
Ain't that our job?

744
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:57,238
Scotty, you ask a guy like that

745
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:59,676
if he wants to see his kid 
again, maybe he thinks KGB.

746
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:01,880
Maybe he thinks you're saying
you're gonna kill his kid.

747
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,393
Make him disappear.

748
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,983
That was a good interview.

749
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,237
Let's make sure of that.

750
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,581
We got a lot of power in that room.

751
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,951
No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.

752
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,182
It's one more trip to Atlantic City.
We can afford that, can't we?

753
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:20,995
Before we put away father of 
an 11-year-old forever?

754
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:24,755
That's gonna be one fun 
ride, I'll tell you that.

755
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,144
We can't get a car for another hour.

756
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,510
Okay. / It's pretty pathethic.

757
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,979
The department don't get 
enough cars to go around.

758
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,279
You're just now noticing 
our crap resources?

759
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,584
Don't take a tone.

760
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,859
I was just about to say that to you.

761
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:47,995
Just hung up with 
the Atlantic City Flying Club.

762
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:51,094
Blaine shelled out $3,000 
in October '97.

763
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,079
Exact amount stolen off of Matt.

764
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,435
Four months after he died.

765
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:55,787
Case was cold by then.

766
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,695
We know Blaine didn't
have a lot of cash flow.

767
00:32:57,695 --> 00:33:00,239
$3,000 all at once is significant.

768
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,878
Yeah, but do you kill your buddy
just so you can take flying lessons?

769
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,956
This wasn't for recreation.
He was gonna start a business.

770
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,406
Another business?

771
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:11,094
The plan was to buy a Cessna 
and go into aerial advertising.

772
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:13,967
Like one of them planes with the 
banner flying over Eagle games?

773
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,839
Yeah, for "Ted's TV and Stereo",
whatever.

774
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,166
So, what happened?

775
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,417
The $3,000 got him through 
instruction, not to his license.

776
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,698
- Blaine never became a pilot.
- Another brainstorm down the drain.

777
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,419
But he didn't kill Matt for the money.

778
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:27,820
What's his motive?

779
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,389
They hadn't seen each other in a while.
Maybe they grew apart.

780
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:31,582
We know Matt changed.

781
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,440
Blaine's looking like the 
mope he's always been.

782
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,424
Could rub a guy the wrong way if your
prodigy grows up different than you did.

783
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:40,898
Especially if that kid looked up
to you the way Katie does now.

784
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,369
Let's go see about that car.

785
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,336
If Blaine took a car out that day,
I don't have the paperwork.

786
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:50,236
What about mileage that's not
accounted for?  You track that?

787
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,458
Give me a second.

788
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,044
Of course, all this tells me

789
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,035
is if a car went out on 
such and such a day,

790
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,721
- not who drive it.
- Understood.

791
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:00,378
Okay, here's something.

792
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,285
One vehicle does show 
some missing miles.

793
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:05,305
89 miles on a Honda Accord.

794
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:08,926
About the round-trip distance 
between here and the crime scene.

795
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,854
Sure glad I fired that kid.

796
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,358
Why did you fire Blaine?

797
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,095
One morning he showed up with a gun.

798
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,537
I saw it in his duffel bag.

799
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:17,522
What'd you do about it?

800
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,482
I took the gun, 
I turned it into the cops.

801
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:31,567
You're a tough guy to find, Blaine.

802
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,820
I've been upstairs.

803
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:37,556
Got on a bit of a streak this morning.

804
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,187
The house comped me a room.

805
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,681
Come on, number two.

806
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,467
Come on, two horse.

807
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:46,050
Even a permanent address,
I couldn't find one.

808
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,539
I don't got one right now.

809
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:52,107
- Where were you living last?
- With some chick. It's a long story.

810
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:52,904
Been there.

811
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,539
Yeah. Drink?

812
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:56,791
Em..Thanks.

813
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,262
Uh, what you're having.

814
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:00,718
Come on.

815
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:05,346
Come on, two, two, two, two...

816
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,483
Damn it!

817
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,283
We talked to your cousin Katie 
the other day, Blaine.

818
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:16,269
Yeah? I love that kid. 
Smart, you know?

819
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:18,840
Funny, she said that about you.

820
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,041
Yeah?

821
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,579
Told me about the nightclub, bar
restaurant thing, you're getting started.

822
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,108
Sounds like a hot move.

823
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:26,388
Could' been big,

824
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:29,821
but some backers just dropped out.

825
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,337
Deal fell through.

826
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,030
Same old, same old, right?

827
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:34,930
What?

828
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,711
You just seem to run into that a lot.

829
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,247
You know, this restaurant deal,

830
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,523
and that airplane venture before that.

831
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:41,859
Candy bar machine.

832
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:43,613
Why you taking shots?

833
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,892
Those aren't shots.

834
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:46,892
Part of me feels for you, Blaine.

835
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:48,990
When a someone's bad at 
what they want to be good at,

836
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,345
that's not easy to deal with.

837
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,207
We know about Roll-the-Dice 
Rentals, Blaine.

838
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:53,879
How you took the car out that day.

839
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:55,288
There's no record of that.

840
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,846
There's a record of the mileage.

841
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:58,507
Probably didn't think 
it through that far, huh?

842
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,732
Didn't cover your tracks 
with that gun too good, either.

843
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:01,874
Bringing it to work.

844
00:36:01,874 --> 00:36:04,018
Now A.C. police have it inventoried.

845
00:36:04,018 --> 00:36:06,892
And spending Matt's three 
grand at the flying school...

846
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,446
Kind of a half-baked 
plan, huh, Blaine?

847
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:10,716
Kind of a familiar theme for you.

848
00:36:10,716 --> 00:36:12,327
I'm good at business.

849
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:14,796
Matt was the one working for 
a brokerage house,

850
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:15,889
making connections.

851
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:17,143
I taught Matt.

852
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:19,999
A 20-year-old with enough 
moxie to get in on an IPO.

853
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:22,712
You said you were happy 
about that, but maybe it hurt.

854
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:25,261
Matt being the guy who was 
the one making things happen.

855
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,921
I made that happen!

856
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:32,158
The IPO was my idea. 
The whole damn things.

857
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:36,033
Millionaires by age 25.

858
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,189
Salud.

859
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:42,378
Blaine, put the drink down.

860
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:43,491
What?

861
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,475
In theory, everything you're 
saying is great.

862
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,909
Now let's talk specifics.

863
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:50,173
Yeah, yeah, let's talk.

864
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:51,766
Who are the principals behind this?

865
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,972
These McSorley Brothers.

866
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,073
It's their dot com.

867
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:56,262
And who's underwriting?

868
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,069
Uh...

869
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,421
I don't know.

870
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,157
Well, you'd want to find that out.

871
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:04,589
Look, Ronnie Mack says 
we got to jump on this.

872
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,602
Blaine, IPO's are all based on hype.

873
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:07,370
You can't just go on what

874
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,257
this pit boss buddy of 
yours is telling you.

875
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:10,409
When I get back to the office

876
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:11,601
I'll see what an analyst thinks.

877
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:12,770
Ship's gonna sail.

878
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,524
We gotta pull the trigger on 
this day after next.

879
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,180
Then why we having this conversation?

880
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,112
You said we needed 15 grand to get in.

881
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,698
Where are we gonna get 15 grand?

882
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:22,504
A casino.

883
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:26,858
A casino?

884
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,990
I've been casing this place.

885
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,270
Here we go.

886
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:33,891
What are you doing?
Cover that.

887
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:36,392
They got an open cage here.

888
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,437
We're in and out in 40 seconds.

889
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,728
Are you crazy?

890
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:42,964
Watch how you're talking to me.

891
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:45,175
Blaine, you gotta wake up.

892
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,177
Always with the pipe dream.

893
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,421
- It's getting stupid.
- Blah, blah, blah.

894
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:50,764
Forget you, pal.

895
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,087
I'm doing this one myself.

896
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,284
I'm not gonna let you.

897
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:57,132
You're not gonna let me?

898
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,890
I'll walk over to the cage right now.

899
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,401
Tip'em off.

900
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:08,818
Listen, he don't wanna go along?

901
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,668
Fine.

902
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,978
But saying he's gonna stop me?

903
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:15,265
For my own good?

904
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,537
That runt used to wear 
my hand-me-downs!

905
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,922
Now he's gonna big-man me like that?

906
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,221
No.

907
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,068
I'm sorry.

908
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:48,482
All right.

909
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,126
Come on. Get in.

910
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:12,175
Don't you stop. I swear, Matty,
I blow your head off.

911
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,353
All right. All right.

912
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:18,766
Go to that tree.

913
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,406
Okay.

914
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:24,806
Turn around.

915
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,290
Listen, Blaine, you're gonna rob me?

916
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,386
Take the three grand from the tables.
You can have it.

917
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,725
Shut the hell up.

918
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,085
I'm talking now.

919
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:35,151
You've known me longer than anybody.

920
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:38,156
Why did you look at me like that?

921
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:39,220
Like what?

922
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,387
You're still doing it.

923
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,315
Put your head down.
I don't wanna see your face.

924
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:44,205
Do it!

925
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:49,445
Nothing's changed, Matty!

926
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:53,415
Suddenly, you're looking at me like
you don't know what the hell I'm doing?

927
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:56,257
All I need is a break.

928
00:39:56,257 --> 00:39:59,113
One break and I'm on my way.

929
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,004
You've always known that

930
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:02,496
since we were kids.

931
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,641
You were the only one.

932
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,758
- Blaine...
- Shut up!

933
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:11,367
There's nothing for you to say.

934
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,554
I wanna see it...

935
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,068
in your eyes.

936
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:20,081
Matty, I need one thing to go my way.

937
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:22,262
And no one's gonna tell me different.

938
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,465
Now you look up at me,

939
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:29,587
and you show me you still know that.

940
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:48,651
Just one break...

941
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:09,641
# Blessid Union Of Souls의 "I Believe" #

942
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:17,815
# Violence is spread worldwide 
and there are families on the street #

943
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,506
# And we sell drugs to children now 
oh why can't we just see #

944
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:32,120
# That all we do is eliminate our future 
with the things we do today #

945
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,238
# Money is our incentive now
so that makes it okay #

946
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,299
# Walk blindly to the light
and reach out for his hand #

947
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:05,190
# Don't ask any questions
and don't try to understand #

948
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,841
# Open up your mind
and then open up your heart #

949
00:42:11,756 --> 00:42:17,637
# And you will see that you and me 
aren't very far apart #

950
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:24,644
# Cause I believe that love is the answer #

951
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:31,286
# I believe that love will find the way #

952
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:05,632
# I believe that love is the answer #

953
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:12,412
# I believe that love will find the way #

954
