00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:03,264
Mom, you found my jacket.

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:05,855
You're the best mom in
the whole wide world.

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,417
Go, Scat, get out of here.
You're gonna be late.

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:11,751
Where's dad?

5
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:13,858
Ed, Stevie's going now!

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:15,712
Hold on a minute!
Don't go!

7
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:18,410
Can anyone in this house
just talk at a normal level?

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,085
Say "cheese."

9
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,824
Doesn't he look handsome, Ed?

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,083
Mom, don't get all weepy. Jeez.

11
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,549
Wear your seatbelt tonight.
It's pouring cats and dogs out there.

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:32,873
Better get out of here before mom decides 
she's going to the prom with you.

13
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:35,739
Okay. Parental units, 
I'm out of here.

14
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:38,256
Don't forget your keys.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,981
The Caddy?

16
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:47,208
Are you serious, dad?

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,310
Could be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

18
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:54,584
- Thanks, dad.
- Have a great time, son.

19
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:56,230
Be careful.

20
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,641
Bye.

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,844
Bye.

22
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,828
Are you a detective?

23
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,270
Yeah.

24
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,675
Can I help you?

25
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:54,488
I have information on a murder.

26
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,760
The boy who died.

27
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,288
His name was Steve Jablonski.

28
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,903
Jablonski.

29
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:06,976
Sounds familiar.

30
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:11,322
He was buried alive 26 years ago.

31
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:14,493
Right.

32
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:15,807
That was horrible.

33
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,339
Yes, it was.

34
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,086
You got some information?

35
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:30,908
I buried him with this.

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,541
You think this guy's for real?

51
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,782
Depends on that shovel head.
Lab say how long it'll take?

52
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:21,157
A couple hours, maybe.
Job went cold day one.

53
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,729
Been going through Jablonski's box.

54
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,753
Pretty grim stuff.
Check this out.

55
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:29,129
Doer made the kid
write out his own will.

56
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,095
Sent it to Jablonski's parents.

57
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:34,787
"My name is Steve Jablonski."

58
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,938
"This is my last will and testament."

59
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:39,725
"Mom, don't worry, because
he promised it won't hurt."

60
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:42,264
"It'll just be like falling asleep."

61
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:45,646
"I'm sorry about the car, dad."
"Please don't let this get you down,"

62
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:50,357
"because I know one day 
we'll meet in heaven."

63
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:55,125
Parents found it in their mailbox a few hours 
after their son's body turned up.

64
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,723
That's tough.

65
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,280
Cops never went public with it.

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,686
And now the doer waltzes
in 26 years later.

67
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:04,726
If he's the doer.

68
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,803
Go find out.

69
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:17,202
Cold out tonight.

70
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,396
Yeah.

71
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,703
I hate the rain.

72
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,259
So what's your name?

73
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,055
John Doe.

74
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,201
That's original.

75
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:36,176
- And you are?
- Detective Rush. Lilly Rush.

76
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:38,804
I want you to know
that I feel terrible...

77
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:41,405
about what happened to that boy.

78
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,740
So why'd you kill him?

79
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,148
Couldn't help it.
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:53,217
Such a nice kid, 
so worried about his dad.

81
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:56,725
Too bad I was the one
who stopped to help.

82
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:59,084
Yeah. Too bad.

83
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,840
We spent a lot of time...

84
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,836
talking about dying.
About saying good-bye.

85
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:11,559
Good-bye?

86
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:15,074
People lose a loved one and they grieve.

87
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,928
When you're the one dying,
you lose everyone.

88
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:23,355
- Ever experience that?
- No.

89
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:26,569
- Can't say I have.
- Steve did.

90
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,117
It was a heartbreaking thing to watch.

91
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,609
Let me level with you, John.

92
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,429
You haven't told me anything
the public doesn't know already.

93
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,965
So why should I believe 
that you did it?

94
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:46,330
You look at me 
and you see a quiet, simple man.

95
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:49,466
So did he.

96
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,632
Didn't believe me...

97
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:56,034
when I told him he was gonna die.

98
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,142
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

99
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:11,275
Yeah, there's a gas station
down off route 291?

100
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,907
Sure. Get in.

101
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,569
I'm Steve, by the way.

102
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,247
Dripping all over your car. Sorry.

103
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,199
Not a problem.

104
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,102
Call me John.

105
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:29,942
- Looks like you're headed to a formal.
- My prom.

106
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,936
So you must be what?
17? 18, Steve?

107
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,269
17, yeah.

108
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,490
Great age.

109
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:43,970
Guess that makes you almost legal, huh?

110
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,732
What?
You think I poisoned it?

111
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,739
Thanks.

112
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:57,241
To getting to the prom.

113
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:59,998
To getting to the prom.

114
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:08,114
That's the turn off for the gas station.

115
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,734
Excuse me? You just passed it.

116
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,560
I hate to tell you this, Steve,

117
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,663
but you're gonna die tonight.

118
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,144
That's funny.

119
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:28,449
How do you feel?

120
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:32,411
Knowing that.

121
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,756
Could you just turn around please?

122
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:37,630
I put something in your beer.

123
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:42,385
I had to.
I'm sorry I lied.

124
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:45,912
In a few moments,
you'll be unconscious.

125
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:48,189
It won't hurt.

126
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:53,758
I think we should go back.
My dad will be really mad about the car.

127
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,160
I knew you'd try that,
so I removed the door handle.

128
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:07,321
There's no point in trying to escape
or trying to scream.

129
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,939
No one can hear you for miles.

130
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,160
And then you killed him.

131
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,975
Detective Rush...

132
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,673
now I remember that name.
You were in the newspapers last year.

133
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:29,955
You caught that serial killer.

134
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,664
- You getting off on this?
- Pardon me?

135
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:38,862
Waltzing in here,
playing games, making crap up.

136
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,298
I'm telling the truth.

137
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:44,323
So tell me how Steve said good-bye.

138
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,795
Don't forget your umbrella 
on the way out.

139
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:00,650
"I'm sorry about the car, dad."

140
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,901
"Please don't let this get you down"

141
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:09,838
"because I know, one day,

142
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:13,415
we'll meet in heaven."

143
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,278
That's how.

144
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:21,049
Something you gotta see.

145
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,902
- The lab results came in, Lil.
- Okay.

146
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:33,891
They found fresh dirt on the shovel.

147
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,460
You did it again.
Didn't you, John?

148
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,796
There is another boy.

149
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:52,980
Time ran out for Steve Jablonski,
but maybe not for this one.

150
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:56,167
This boy's still alive?

151
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:00,225
Steve lasted six hours in the ground.

152
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,253
Maybe he will, too.

153
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,622
He kills once, stops for 26 years
and then kills again.

154
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:17,269
Right. But as far as we know,
this kid's still alive.

155
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,444
ME confirmed it took about six hours
before Jablonski ran out of air.

156
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,931
- We gotta hurry.
- So what's the game plan?

157
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:27,279
ID the missing kid. Probably 17, 
same age as his first victim.

158
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,861
Check missing persons reports.
Maybe get lucky.

159
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,416
What about this John Doe character?

160
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,452
Guy had got no ID, wallet,
nothing with his address on it.

161
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,544
- We ran his prints?
- No luck.

162
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:39,603
Jablonski's parents are on their way up.
Maybe they know him.

163
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:42,670
- In the meantime, we keep him talking?
- Right.

164
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,190
He only wants to talk about the 1980 job.

165
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,792
We find out why he did that murder,
maybe we save this boy.

166
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,208
So let's cut to the chase, John.

167
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,438
You tell me where this boy is and 
I'll make sure the DA cuts you a deal.

168
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,659
I'm not interested in deals.
That's not why I'm here.

169
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,454
You're here about Jablonski.

170
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:00,949
Why not tell us about your other victims?

171
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,158
There are no others.
Just him.

172
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,740
And the boy out there now.

173
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,430
- So what's your real name?
- It isn't important.

174
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,781
You walk in here confessing to a murder,
but you don't want to tell us who you are?

175
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:19,200
What I'm wondering is why wait 
26 years before you  kill again?

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,511
I mean, you must have been, what?
In your late 20s with Jablonski?

177
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,614
Knowing who I am isn't going
to help you find him. I'm sorry.

178
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,793
Why'd you make him write his own will?

179
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:31,099
People should have the chance
to put their affairs in order.

180
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:33,524
To make sense of their lives.

181
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:37,803
- To say good-bye.
- Now, that's real standup.

182
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:41,850
- Anger is stage number two.
- Excuse me?

183
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,584
Like you, he got angry, too.

184
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,369
What happened?

185
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:02,223
You're gonna die tonight, remember?

186
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,979
The Caddy.

187
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:12,142
The Caddy. I can't just leave it there.
It's, like, his most prized possession.

188
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:15,120
Who?
Your father?

189
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,596
I got my grades up, and I spent
weekends working on the yard.

190
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:21,165
So he'd trust you with it.

191
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,767
You gotta turn around.

192
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,693
My dad, he'll think I messed up again.
It's not true.

193
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,201
Sounds like you've been 
a disappointment to your father.

194
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,661
You gotta turn around!

195
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,730
Why are you doing this to me?

196
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,361
- To know what it's like to die.
- Why me?

197
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:55,951
You said anger was stage number two.

198
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,217
Stage two of what?

199
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:59,353
The five stages of dying.

200
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:03,084
The first is denial.

201
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,975
Then anger.

202
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,313
Then bargaining.

203
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:10,987
Depression and acceptance.
I'm familiar.

204
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:15,679
- I'm sorry.
- Keep your condolences, please.

205
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,992
Their final thoughts, feelings.

206
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:25,406
You'll never know what they were.

207
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,592
You wish you did, don't you?

208
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,059
Steve Jablonski's mother
and father got to.

209
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:36,468
So stage number three is bargaining, John.

210
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:40,140
You know what we want.
What about you?

211
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,645
- I want to meet them.
- Who?

212
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:46,866
Jablonski's parents.

213
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,934
Why?

214
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,448
To tell them I'm sorry.

215
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:02,118
I used to dream about this moment,

216
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,353
fantasize about it.

217
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,830
What I would do to you if we met.

218
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:16,520
But now I know that won't
ever bring my boy back, will it?

219
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:22,730
You left him alone.

220
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,295
In that place.

221
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:28,603
Steve chose that playground.

222
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,024
Do you want to know why?

223
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,502
Tell me, please.

224
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,161
When he was ten years old, 
he told me that's where he,

225
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,435
he hit his first home run.

226
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,344
And that it was the only time
in his life that he knew.

227
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,080
Knew what?

228
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,337
That you were proud of him.

229
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,219
Tell me...

230
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:05,594
tell me what it was like
for him at the end.

231
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,480
Are you sure you want to know?

232
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,460
I need to know.

233
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,193
Are you sure?

234
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,231
You want money?

235
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,759
Is that it?
Is that what you want?

236
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:36,721
Because my family, they,
they've got money, lots of it.

237
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:40,258
They'll pay anything you want.
I swear they will.

238
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:42,423
Are you ready to put
your affairs in order?

239
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:46,450
My dad is a lawyer. 
He will do anything to get me back.

240
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,729
Are you ready to say
your final good-bye?

241
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:52,783
Just tell me what you want.

242
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:58,090
I want you to think about how
to say good-bye in your will.

243
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,055
Your last will and testament.

244
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:07,783
If you let me go, I won't tell.
I swear to god, not a soul.

245
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:12,162
You can just drive off.
What do you say?

246
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:22,422
I'll do...

247
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:27,522
you know, that.

248
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:30,233
What, Steve?

249
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:35,415
It'll just blow your mind, 
what I'll do, like, if you...

250
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:39,452
Just please don't hurt me.

251
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,691
Mom...

252
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:47,282
- I'll kill you!
- Lynne, Lynne!

253
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:50,618
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- I'll kill you.

254
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,714
I told you that because 
your boy was lucky.

255
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:54,822
You should go. Please.

256
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,261
- Don't listen to him.
- Some people don't have a loving family

257
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:01,436
and a cozy home to say good-bye to,
but Steve did.

258
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:05,973
We held up our end.
Now it's your turn.

259
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:08,162
Where is he?

260
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,931
Some people just have
a locker to call home.

261
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,480
And a vent to keep them warm at night.

262
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,188
You talking about yourself, John?

263
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:21,440
Or him?

264
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,611
A locker to call home.

265
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,698
This boy's what?
Homeless? Runaway?

266
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:32,308
A vent keeping them warm at night.
Subway station?

267
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,457
Or a train station.

268
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,066
30th street?

269
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,427
Guy's the invisible man.
No one's seen squat.

270
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,691
If this John Doe was even here.
Could be a wild goose chase.

271
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,785
Heating vents, lockers.
You got a better idea?

272
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:54,141
This guy could be jerking us around.

273
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,226
Better than doing nothing,
because we're running out of time.

274
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,651
Got less than four hours left.

275
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:00,208
Put me in a room alone with him,

276
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,345
20 minutes. I'll get John Doe talking.

277
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:05,667
Son of a bitch.

278
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,656
He led us right to it.

279
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:13,413
Last will and Testament

280
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:22,546
- That from our new kid?
- Found it taped to this locker.

281
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:25,712
All we got so far is his name,
Justin Bradley.

282
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,820
"This is my last will and testament.

283
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,510
"Everything in my locker goes
to you, Valentino."

284
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,995
"It's not much, but it's all
I got in the world."

285
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,283
"Remember the horses in the field?

286
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,910
Maybe we'll meet there one day."

287
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,058
- That's it.
- Who's Valentino?

288
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,519
Vera and Miller are asking around.

289
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,302
Horses in the field.

290
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:47,341
Could be, like, Jablonski's
meet-in-heaven thing?

291
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:49,001
Anything in the locker?

292
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:53,908
Uh, sneakers, sweatshirt, this box.

293
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,419
Why's he carrying this around?

294
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,487
Vera found the friend, Valentino.

295
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:06,761
Picked him up a few minutes ago,
right outside the station. / All right.

296
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:09,367
Me and Justin kick it
time to time. So what?

297
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,093
He work the train 
station, too, Valentino?

298
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,181
You mean, is he hooking?
Take a guess, Chico.

299
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,917
When did you see him last?

300
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,457
Earlier tonight. I don't know.

301
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,689
Was he with this guy?

302
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,374
I ain't no snitch.
Ask him your own damn self.

303
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:25,484
Look, we think this guy 
abducted your buddy.

304
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:26,899
We think he might kill him.

305
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:31,643
So, from where we're standing, Chico,
you got two options.

306
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:34,364
Talk or take a ride down 
to the morgue in a few hours.

307
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:37,505
Cops... 
You're full of more juice than Johns.

308
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,791
It's all the same to you,
I gotta make a living here.

309
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,871
"The horses in the field."
Does that mean anything to you?

310
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:46,917
- Who told you that?
- Your friend Justin in this.

311
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,611
See, this John you're working
so hard to protect?

312
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:53,644
He makes his victims write out 
their own wills before he kills them.

313
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:59,324
- I saw that guy a few hours ago.
- Yeah. What else?

314
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:02,624
Justin was standing right there.

315
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:05,162
Talking about horses in the field.

316
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,525
Cheap bastards could turn up the heat 
in their rides, know what I'm saying?

317
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,911
I'm jacking the next one
and riding off into the sunset.

318
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:18,373
Yeah, sure. Two-bit hooker like you, 
Justin, you'll get real far.

319
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:21,427
If I take the back roads, 
the cops will never catch me, boy.

320
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:25,471
That's right. Saw it in that movie,
Thelma and Louise.

321
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,845
Those white girls end up
flying off the cliff at the end.

322
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,022
Is that how you want to blaze out?

323
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:34,869
Whatever.
You're tripping.

324
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,185
At least I got a plan.

325
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:39,090
You gonna get out of here, is that it?

326
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,173
That's it.

327
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:44,672
And go where, mijo?

328
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:51,318
Right here is where you're at.
Don't you forget it.

329
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:54,385
There was this other place.

330
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:58,427
My mom brought me there once.
When I was a kid.

331
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:02,214
There were these horses in a field.

332
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:07,543
That's where I'm going.

333
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:12,576
You want to come?

334
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,974
What?

335
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:17,800
Forget it.

336
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,748
Don't be scamming my lighter, yo.
Give it back.

337
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:23,730
I don't want your
cheap-ass plastic light.

338
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,344
Ask me again.

339
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,993
- Grandpa's mine.
- Yeah.

340
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:46,705
- So I'll catch you later or whatever.
- Yeah. Whatever.

341
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:04,022
Rode off into the sunset.
That's all I know.

342
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:06,156
And this guy was in a green minivan.

343
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:08,081
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

344
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,313
Got a look at his license plate, too.

345
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:15,334
W-E-J-8 something.
Like "wedgie." Whatever, right?

346
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:18,275
Is there anything else
you can tell us about Justin?

347
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:21,834
He was a runaway,
sick of foster homes.

348
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,758
- On his own since forever.
- He had you.

349
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:28,685
Truth is, I met Justin two weeks ago.

350
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:31,279
Barely knew the kid.

351
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:39,224
You a regular at the train station?

352
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:41,050
Hardly.

353
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,936
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, positive.

354
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:48,331
Because these two kids, you know...

355
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:54,287
wonderbread suburbs boy,
broke-ass nobody.

356
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,650
- There's nothing in common, right?
- Right.

357
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,961
Except...

358
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,531
they're both 17.

359
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:10,041
It's a hell of an age, 17.

360
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,505
It was raining
when you picked him up tonight.

361
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:17,390
- It was cold out?
- Yes, it was very cold.

362
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,277
But your car is warm.
It's dry.

363
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,707
Justin gets in, he's shivering.

364
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:30,151
Maybe he's grateful
for the warmth, maybe not,

365
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,828
all that matters is...

366
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,896
he's this close.

367
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:40,843
You can smell his skin,

368
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:45,243
his hair, his breath.

369
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:47,464
- Anything can happen.
- You're way off base.

370
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:50,081
- You like teenage boys.
- That's not why I picked him...

371
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,380
When he begged for his life,
what'd you make Justin do?

372
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,181
- That's not why I picked him!
- Then why pick 17-year-olds?

373
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:59,383
Because the little bastards
think they'll live forever!

374
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,282
But they won't.

375
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,692
No.

376
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,406
You make sure of that.

377
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,910
In the end, they give up, too.

378
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,512
Here.

379
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,958
This is the place.

380
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:40,628
Why do you want to die here?

381
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:43,287
Who cares?

382
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:46,808
You wanted me to pick a place,
so I did.

383
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:48,676
There has to be a reason.

384
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:52,140
There's no reason, okay?

385
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,492
What are you waiting for?
Do it already. Kill me.

386
00:25:56,492 --> 00:26:00,411
I have to know, why here?

387
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:05,952
Me and her.

388
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:11,852
We rode the horses in this field.

389
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:15,890
Before she got in her car accident.

390
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,293
I was ten.

391
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:27,764
My mom was all I had in the world.

392
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,975
And this place?

393
00:26:32,352 --> 00:26:36,511
Was where I mattered to somebody once.

394
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,403
He's so alone right now.

395
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:46,784
Out there in the rain.

396
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:53,555
If only someone would find him.

397
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:02,265
Boss wants you.

398
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,772
We tracked down his registration
off the license plate Valentino gave us.

399
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:22,425
Who is he? / John Harding, age 54, divorced, 
father of two, high school teacher.

400
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:23,418
Who would've thought?

401
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:26,290
Rush and Jeffries are talking
with his ex-wife.

402
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:36,483
I haven't talked to my ex-husband
in almost a decade.

403
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,206
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

404
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,500
What about your sons?

405
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,539
They were never close with him.

406
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,459
After the divorce,
he just stopped coming by.

407
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,079
Something else you want to share?

408
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,037
Not particularly.

409
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:50,801
How old are your sons?

410
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:53,821
Jack is 16,
and Stan is almost 18. Why?

411
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,249
The boy that was killed
and the one out there tonight?

412
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:57,866
they're the same age.

413
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,690
We're running out of time, Mrs. Harding.

414
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:09,317
John called me this morning,
said the tremors had started.

415
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:12,248
- Tremors?
- He said his time was limited.

416
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,994
The tremors signaled the beginning 
of the end for him.

417
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,022
What are you talking about?

418
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,163
He didn't tell you?

419
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:25,920
John has M.S. Multiple sclerosis.

420
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,057
My ex-husband is dying.

421
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:39,070
Multiple sclerosis.

422
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,979
Your muscles atrophy,
you go blind, weak.

423
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:47,160
It can take years until your mind's
trapped in a near-dead body.

424
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,491
That's why you bury them alive.

425
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:53,862
You want to see them die,
slowly, the way you're dying.

426
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:54,983
You may be right.

427
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,309
The five stages of death, you weren't 
talking about your victims,

428
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,870
you were talking about yourself.

429
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,523
Diagnosed 26 years ago,

430
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,936
the same year Steve Jablonski goes missing.

431
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:06,811
Then you go into remission,
think you got it beat.

432
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,533
One day your hands are shaking...

433
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:13,386
and you know it beat you.

434
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:15,092
I see you met my ex-wife.

435
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:18,165
You tell her about your M.S.
when you got married?

436
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:21,519
Didn't think so.

437
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,008
When did she find out?

438
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,845
When our first son was born.

439
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:28,107
Husband diagnosed with a terminal disease.

440
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:32,083
She'd be a monster if she
dumped you, so she stayed.

441
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,006
Made do.

442
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,767
Settled.

443
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:41,251
Must've been lonely, you dying,
seeing that pity in her eyes.

444
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:44,551
- She never pitied me.
- No.

445
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:47,896
She just pretended to still love you.

446
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,616
Takes something out of you, pretending.

447
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:53,861
You never get it back.

448
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:57,949
The years go by,
and one day you wake up, and...

449
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:02,652
you're both strangers.

450
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:04,625
And alone.

451
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:08,380
And that's why you picked Steve.
Because he was young,

452
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,466
on top of the world,
the way you once were.

453
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,427
And Justin...

454
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:19,992
he's who you are now.
Alone, afraid.

455
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:24,369
Do you ever wonder...

456
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,670
what it must be like...

457
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:33,679
alone in the ground,

458
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,056
no going back?

459
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,842
The final stage.

460
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:42,096
Finally...

461
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:45,167
having to accept...

462
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,408
remember...

463
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:56,620
the horses in the field?

464
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:02,198
Maybe we'll meet there someday.

465
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:06,131
Will you make sure that
Valentino gets it?

466
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,303
I will.

467
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,534
- You ready?
- No.

468
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:17,219
Not yet.

469
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:21,079
It's so cold.

470
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:23,955
I can't stop shaking.

471
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,224
It's gonna be okay.

472
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:29,916
Will it hurt?

473
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:32,571
After a while, it's just...

474
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:36,775
quiet, still.

475
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:39,416
Like falling asleep.

476
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:42,489
I want things to be...

477
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,961
still.

478
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:50,189
There are so many things
I should have done,

479
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:52,483
I should have said.

480
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:56,266
I should have asked 
Valentino one more time.

481
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,498
Asked him what?

482
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:03,135
Do you want to come?

483
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:09,318
You ready, Justin?

484
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,657
If I see my mom in heaven,
do you think she'll remember me?

485
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:39,316
What is it?

486
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,267
The music.

487
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:45,150
Can you hear?

488
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:51,041
The horses in the field.

489
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,053
That was the music playing.

490
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,129
I remember that music.

491
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,920
I'm ready now.

492
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,832
I think, in the end...

493
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:19,999
he accepted.

494
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:25,378
Is that where Justin is?
In that field?

495
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:27,924
Tell us where.

496
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:37,136
It's too late for him.

497
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,400
For me.

498
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:49,246
There's a point you have to accept
like Justin did...

499
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:53,006
that it's over.

500
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:58,308
We know he buries them where they ask.

501
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,875
Someplace important to them.

502
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,803
For Steve, it was where
he hit his first home run.

503
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,363
For Justin, the field he rode
horses with his mom.

504
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:07,425
Same field where
he said music was playing.

505
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,647
Music, horses...
that's a weird combination.

506
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:13,326
Whatever Justin had in his locker
had to be important to him.

507
00:34:13,326 --> 00:34:17,026
- Significant somehow.
- There's nothing here but junk.

508
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:21,317
Tickets like you'd find at a fairground.

509
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:23,440
So...

510
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:28,507
Horses, music, fair, tickets.

511
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:33,017
- Merry-go-round. 
- How many are there in Philly?

512
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:35,232
I know a few.
Veronica makes me take her.

513
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,674
- You remember where?
- Uh,

514
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:41,918
Germantown, corner of Lombardy
and, uh, damn.

515
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,298
Fourth street.

516
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:46,173
- Need a unit at Lombardy and fourth right away.
- Oh, there's another one down near the docks.

517
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:48,472
The water.
Can't bury him there.

518
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,471
- What's the next one?
- There's 20 fairgrounds, and counting.

519
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,411
- We got to narrow it down.
- How?

520
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:56,785
He's gone through all the stages
of dying except one.

521
00:34:56,785 --> 00:35:00,860
He needs someone to be there
like he was there for Steve, for Justin.

522
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,036
That's why he came in tonight.

523
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:06,013
The last stage : Acceptance.

524
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:12,135
He needs to do one more thing 
before he can accept.

525
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:19,775
It finally stopped.

526
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,667
The rain.

527
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:24,948
Did it?

528
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,431
You read about me in the papers.

529
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:32,270
You know I was almost shot.

530
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,132
Yes.

531
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:36,948
Almost died.

532
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,899
But you didn't.

533
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:42,272
You killed him first.

534
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,174
That's why I hate the rain.

535
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:52,449
The quiet it brings.

536
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,351
Why?

537
00:35:56,826 --> 00:36:00,346
Because that's what
it was like inside my head

538
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:03,504
right before I pulled the trigger.

539
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:12,344
They say you see the moments 
of your life right before you die.

540
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,346
No.

541
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,431
Just one moment.

542
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:22,650
Like Steve did.

543
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,398
Justin.

544
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:32,222
And, after, I think
you're ready to say good-bye.

545
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,311
Why are you here, John?

546
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:45,931
I already told you.

547
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:52,476
In this room, people
tell me all sorts of things.

548
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,317
You can, too.

549
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:59,480
And I'll listen and not leave you,
like everyone else has left you.

550
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,737
- To die alone.
- Like those boys died?

551
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,284
How you must hate them.

552
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:08,971
Steve, Justin.

553
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:12,005
So young.

554
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:14,382
Their lives just starting.

555
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,087
They get into cars with strangers
and believe they'll live forever.

556
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:20,231
- You think that's a crime?
- It is because they won't.

557
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:24,307
They should know that
and not be disappointed later.

558
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:25,907
Like you once were.

559
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:29,518
I've been dying for 26 years.
I never believed.

560
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:31,560
Didn't you?

561
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:38,607
And I'd give anything to never
have walked into that attic.

562
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:41,690
Never looked down the barrel of his gun.

563
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,291
So I could still believe
that I'd live forever.

564
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:50,548
Remember?

565
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:54,449
No.

566
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:59,498
It's the most beautiful thing
we'll ever do.

567
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,356
Believing that.

568
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,931
I don't remember.

569
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:07,374
I do.

570
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:13,241
Wintertime...

571
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:16,940
alone on the street...

572
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,573
learning to ride my bike.

573
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:24,099
It's almost dark.

574
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:28,403
I remember the wind in my face,

575
00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:30,916
and closing my eyes,

576
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:35,521
and suddenly I'm flying.

577
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:42,241
You don't hate them because 
they believe they'll live forever.

578
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,735
You hate them

579
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:47,969
because we once did, too.

580
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,865
Remember?

581
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:00,850
Swimming in the river...

582
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,786
my friends...

583
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:11,026
dared me to jump from the bridge.

584
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,878
It was a hundred foot fall.

585
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:21,197
Did you? Did you jump?

586
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,930
I was 17.

587
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,962
Immortal.

588
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:34,549
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

589
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:36,423
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

590
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:38,480
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

591
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,723
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

592
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,553
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

593
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:44,557
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

594
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:46,558
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

595
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:49,983
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

596
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,907
You believed when you jumped.

597
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,129
So did Steve.

598
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:51,762
And Justin.

599
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:54,012
If only for a moment.

600
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:56,793
You could have died 
jumping off that bridge.

601
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:59,465
But I lived.

602
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,258
Let him live, too.

603
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:19,334
 ¢Ü Lifehouse's "You And Me"  ¢Ü

604
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,987
 ¢Ü What day is it? ¢Ü

605
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:30,692
 ¢Ü And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive ¢Ü

606
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:33,249
 ¢Ü I can't keep up ¢Ü

607
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:41,242
 ¢Ü and I can't back down 
I've been losing so much time ¢Ü

608
00:41:42,758 --> 00:41:46,056
 ¢Ü Cause it's you and me ¢Ü

609
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:51,249
 ¢Ü and all of the people 
with nothing to do ¢Ü

610
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:56,361
 ¢Ü Nothing to lose
And it's you and me ¢Ü

611
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:01,416
 ¢Ü and all of the people
And I don't know why ¢Ü

612
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:07,065
 ¢Ü I can't keep my eyes off of you ¢Ü

613
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:11,894
 ¢Ü All of the things ¢Ü

614
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:19,586
 ¢Ü that I want to say 
just aren't coming out right ¢Ü

615
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:22,059
 ¢Ü I'm tripping on words ¢Ü

616
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:29,872
 ¢Ü You've got my head spinning 
I don't know where to go from here ¢Ü

617
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:34,965
 ¢Ü Cause it's you and me ¢Ü

618
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:40,081
 ¢Ü and all of the people 
with nothing to do ¢Ü

619
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:45,256
 ¢Ü Nothing to prove
And it's you and me ¢Ü

620
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:50,372
 ¢Ü and all of the people
And I don't know why ¢Ü

621
00:42:50,372 --> 00:42:55,878
 ¢Ü I can't keep my eyes off of you ¢Ü

622
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:01,043
 ¢Ü There's something about you now ¢Ü

623
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:05,939
 ¢Ü I can't quite figure out ¢Ü

624
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:11,207
 ¢Ü Everything she does is beautiful ¢Ü

625
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:17,075
 ¢Ü Everything she does is right ¢Ü

626
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:21,342
 ¢Ü Cause it's you and me ¢Ü

627
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:26,515
 ¢Ü and all of the people 
with nothing to do ¢Ü

628

 ¢Ü Nothing to lose

629

 ¢Ü and all of the people
And I don't know why ¢Ü

630
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:41,658
