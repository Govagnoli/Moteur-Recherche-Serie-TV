00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:11,834
December 11, 1978

4
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:21,827
It's snowing outside.

5
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:25,024
There is no outside.

6
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:27,420
No yesterday.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,018
Promise?

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,894
Matthew!

9
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:34,152
Matthew Adams.

10
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,969
It's my dad.

11
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,100
Matthew Adams.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,154
Matthew!

13
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:43,745
Matthew doesn't know you.

14
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:45,343
I wanna see my son.

15
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:46,801
He was an orphan 
when I met him.

16
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,624
Look, you son of a bitch.

17
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:51,201
- I know what you do.
- And I you.

18
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:54,043
You are manipulating
a screwed up kid.

19
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:56,752
- And who screwed him up?
- I demand to see him.

20
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,283
Call to him.

21
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,230
He has free will.

22
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,957
Matthew.

23
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,241
I want you to come home.

24
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,848
Beth wants you to come home.

25
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,931
Matthew!

26
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,867
Matthew!

27
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,822
He's got a new father now.

28
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:56,919
Father, I am free.
Good bye. - Matthew.

29
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:06,662
Classification : Suicide

30
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:18,197
Matthew and I were 
only a year apart.

31
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,714
People used to think 
that we were twins.

32
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,695
So what made him join this group?

33
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:24,245
You mean cult.

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,468
Okay.

35
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:29,758
After Matthew's first year of college,
our mother killed herself.

36
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,253
Matthew kind of drifted after that.

37
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,790
So he joined this First Generation,
cut off old ties?

38
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,523
And this was '76.
Jonestown had just happened.

39
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:41,366
The Kool-Aid? / We were scared that 
they were gonna do the same thing.

40
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:44,783
So we hired this deprogrammer.

41
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:47,333
- Remember his name?
- Yeah. Bill Crawford.

42
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,158
He got Matthew to a motel room,
but two days later he escaped.

43
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:52,949
While you were there?

44
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,259
No.

45
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,543
My dad and I left him alone
with Crawford.

46
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:02,417
The next morning,
Matthew was on our porch.

47
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,346
Dead from cyanide.

48
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,728
Suicide?

49
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:09,800
Well, that's what we thought for all of these 
years and there was even a note. But..

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,767
then I saw this.

51
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,382
 Rescue Misson Turned Murder?

52
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:16,917
Crawford's still in business, huh?

53
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:21,000
Last week he was working with 
a girl who died of an asthma attack.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,319
Then he tried to cover up
and make it look like a suicide.

55
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,305
How did he do that?

56
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,209
Dosed her with poison,
forged a note.

57
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,376
And said she escaped?

58
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,887
Like your brother ?? supposedly dead.

59
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,977
We never should've left
him alone with that man.

60
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,374
Anna Mayes.

61
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:47,981
Can I..?

62
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,348
What's going on?

63
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,998
My lieutenant sent me.

64
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:57,779
We found a floater this morning
in the Schuykill.

65
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,439
- You call the updesk?
- No. I came to you 'cause um..

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,743
it's someone we know.

67
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,344
It's Scotty's girl.

68
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,041
Elisa?

Father, I'm free.

80
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,105
Good bye, Matthew.

81
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,523
- Standard suicide note.
- Or not.

82
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:13,481
The sister thinks maybe this deprogrammer  
wrote it after Matthew died in his care.

83
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,324
Deprogramming,
sketchy business.

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,707
What'd boss want with Valens?

85
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,936
- Don't know.
- Got the 49 on this Matthew Adams?

86
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:29,607
20 years old, mainline kid was 
pre-med at Penn for a year and dropped out.

87
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,273
Father was a surgeon, right?

88
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:32,688
He couldn't have liked that.

89
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,649
No, especially when Matthew 
dyed his hair black,

90
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,686
started hanging out at the Arsenal.

91
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,446
- Arsenal?
- Punk spot.

92
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:39,898
Mohawks, slam dancing.

93
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:43,105
Yeah. He was into 
that cult June of '78.

94
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:47,246
After he died Vice stormed the place, 
found a vial of cyanide for every member.

95
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,454
They were gonna pull 
their own Jonestown.

96
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:51,284
Him dying might've stopped that.

97
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,429
I remember those 
First Generation nuts.

98
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,051
Leader was named Warfield.

99
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,999
- What was he preaching?
- Erase the past,

100
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,899
come start a new generation
with him as their father.

101
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,182
Father Warfield is in prison now.

102
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:03,486
Chester.

103
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,943
Deprogrammer's our first stop.

104
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,640
- So what?
- You give Anna my job,

105
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,619
bring me out here to 
break the news?

106
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,306
It's about Elisa, Scotty.

107
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:18,376
Is she in trouble?

108
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,623
They found her this morning
in the Schuykill.

109
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,014
Found her?

110
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,449
Yeah, looks like she jumped.

111
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,490
Nah, that can't be.

112
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,839
I'm sorry, Scotty.

113
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,486
Nah, cuz she wouldn't.

114
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:40,160
I spoke to Manny Fernandez at West.
He's got Anna working the case.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,196
Well, then I gotta talk to Anna.
because...

116
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:49,231
No, she's scared of heights.

117
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,643
- And she was getting better.
- Yeah, I know.

118
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,583
I'm gonna walk.

119
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,087
Still working while 
you were on bail?

120
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,482
Why shouldn't I work?

121
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:22,043
- I'm no threat.
- Till this last time.

122
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,760
It was an accident.

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,041
You dosed her with 
strychnine accidentally?

124
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,700
You remember Matthew Adams?

125
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,028
Yeah, I remember every job.

126
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,238
You had an accident with him too,
used cyanide to cover your tracks.

127
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,565
- Off by a mile lady.
- Things go wrong.

128
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,972
'78, deprogramming was 
just being invented.

129
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:42,432
Look, that kid, he crawled out 
of bathroom window of the motel.

130
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,345
I never saw him again.

131
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:48,285
You were obviously not above breaking 
a few laws to get your work done.

132
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,384
If somebody you loved was 
hold up with David Koresh in Waco,

133
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:54,987
wouldn't you want me to get him out
before the Feds lit that place up?

134
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,307
Tell us about Matthew.

135
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:59,577
It's like every job.
Started with a rescue.

136
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,136
You mean kidnapping?

137
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:03,784
Look, man, I was the good guys.

138
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,430
Matthew Adams?

139
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,122
Matthew Adams!

140
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:20,970
Get him.

141
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,409
There's no Matthew Adams here.

142
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,875
Now,

143
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,985
or Charlie Manson here gets it!

144
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:37,047
Door!

145
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,174
- Matty.
- What's going on?

146
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,293
- We're here to help.
- Son, listen to me.

147
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,352
I'm not your son.

148
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,529
Tell him.

149
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,089
Your name is Matthew.

150
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,902
You live at 1020..

151
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,331
In three days, it's zero hour.

152
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,984
And everything will 
be wiped away.

153
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,986
More. More!

154
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,025
You love the Sixers, but you cheer 
for the knicks just to piss off dad.

155
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,960
Matt.

156
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,204
Please look at me.

157
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,591
Your sister's talking to you.

158
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,829
Three days till zero hour.

159
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,230
No more talking.

160
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,816
Shhh.

161
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,269
What was zero hour?

162
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,622
It was the cult's plan 
for mass suicide.

163
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:23,939
But Matthew died two days later.
Why kill himself a day early?

164
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,709
Maybe so we wouldn't stop him.

165
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,911
Look, I got a 90 percent 
success rate.

166
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,727
That Warfield character,

167
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,163
he really messed up 
that kid's head.

168
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:49,737
Maurice Warfield.
Detectives Rush and Jeffries, Homicide.

169
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:53,065
Ah, the faces of the law.
So serious.

170
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:58,249
Desperate to hide you're the same 
scared children you always were.

171
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,127
We're here about
Matthew Adams.

172
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,077
Lived with you, 1978.

173
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,399
He was an artist.

174
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,464
His father tried to fill 
his head with science.

175
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:10,850
And you tried to convince him 
you were his father.

176
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,004
All I ever did to Matthew 
was suggest he had a choice.

177
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,906
There's nothing criminal
about that.

178
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,207
Tax fraud and statutory rape
are another story.

179
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,363
Well, those are your laws.

180
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:21,606
Not yours?

181
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,504
I don't accept your authority.

182
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,856
I consider myself wrongly detained.

183
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,796
Just a misunderstood man
spreading a good word.

184
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,268
- Amen.
- And the good word was?

185
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,795
That you can erase your past,

186
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,216
choose your family.

187
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,896
Take you as their father?

188
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:40,368
- I love children.
- Probably sounded good to Matthew.

189
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:42,171
How'd you find him?

190
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:46,352
Like you found any lost soul in 1978.

191
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,676
In a lost place.

192
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:30,590
Hey.

193
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:57,939
Do I know you?

194
00:11:58,603 --> 00:11:59,907
No.

195
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,542
But I know you.

196
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,785
Really?

197
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:04,195
A rebel boy,

198
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:07,416
in combat boots and 
Gucci socks.

199
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,796
- Poor little rich kid.
- You don't know anything about me.

200
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,411
I stole your thunder.

201
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:14,145
Not letting them finish.

202
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,492
You wanted to 
get your ass kicked.

203
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,429
- Why would I want that?
- World's full of pain.

204
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,016
You wanna control
how you get hurt.

205
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,561
But you can't.

206
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,471
Screw you, man.

207
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,545
Okay.

208
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:33,630
Maurice sees things in people.

209
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,490
Right.

210
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,364
Like what?

211
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:48,205
And he needed a place to crash, 
so he came home with us.

212
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,743
How does he end up dead?

213
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:52,877
Ask the commando who 
came in and held a gun on me.

214
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,954
He took Matthew away.

215
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,857
I never saw him again.

216
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,509
But you know he died 
from cyanide.

217
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,639
I heard that. / Which you 
had stashed at the cult,

218
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,316
prepping for your mass suicide.

219
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,179
Don't believe the ghost stories.

220
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,267
There was no suicide plan.

221
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,591
- No?
- It wasn't even a cult.

222
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:14,158
Just an ideal.

223
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,408
And now?

224
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,648
First Generation is

225
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:19,541
a thing of the past.

226
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,142
Frannie looked over the autopsy, says

227
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:28,223
Matthew had abrasions on his back, 
might have come from being dragged.

228
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:31,966
If someone moved him,
it goes from a suicide to homicide.

229
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,407
Maybe the deprogrammer?

230
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,294
Crawford hopped to plane
in Miami that night.

231
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,523
Records back it up.

232
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:41,284
Crawford's in the clear, boss.

233
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,465
Bad news.

234
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,745
Scotty's girlfriend.

235
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:49,880
They found her body
in the river this morning.

236
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:56,814
Where is he?

237
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:59,273
Home.

238
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,444
We gotta go there.

239
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,346
He needs time, Lil.

240
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,374
Alone.

241
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:10,505
Yeah, it's what he wants.

242
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:53,259
Obey the first generation.

243
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,375
Anything?

244
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,911
Uh...

245
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:09,831
One lift from the window.

246
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,271
Run it through AFIS tonight.

247
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:17,529
For a thing of the past,
the First Generation sure is organized.

248
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,126
Warfield got word to 
the outside nice and quick.

249
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,428
Must be still around
in the cult from prison.

250
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,368
So who's his man 
on the outside?

251
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,823
We'll check visitor logs tomorrow,

252
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,666
see who he had contact 
with after we left.

253
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,727
You got nice neighbors.

254
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,862
They didn't see squat.

255
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:37,429
Warfield told us about two other
members, Nick and Alison.

256
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,095
We got a date with them 
in the morning.

257
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,316
What's wrong with these cats?

258
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:44,110
Nothing.

259
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,484
You okay?

260
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,639
Scotty?

261
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,632
Yeah.

262
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:22,655
Hey, Scotty.

263
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:25,192
We're sorry.

264
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,823
Yeah, I told Elisa's mom
I'd pick up her stuff.

265
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:30,045
Oh yeah, of course.

266
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:34,248
You got the scene photos?

267
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:35,797
Not yet.

268
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,467
Cuz, uh..
I wanna see them.

269
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,161
No reason for that.

270
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,594
I wanna see them, Anna.

271
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:46,268
There was a note addressed to you,

272
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,824
supposed to hang on to it, 
but I got a copy.

273
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,403
Where was it?

274
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,618
On her bed.

275
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,740
Hey, if you wanna talk..

276
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,192
Hey, I gotta jet.

277
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,583
- I wanna help you, Scotty.
- I'm good.

278
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:18,966
So, Nick. You were Maurice's 
muscle back in the day.

279
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:21,966
I washed myself clean
of Maurice Warfield 25 years ago.

280
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,948
Well, someone's 
keeping the cult alive.

281
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:25,036
Any idea?

282
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:28,002
Sorry. I've baptized myself 
in the name of the lord.

283
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,736
Thought you two were 
thick as thieves.

284
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:30,975
For a time.

285
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,437
Anyone in the cult have
a reason to hurt Matthew?

286
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,474
No one but Warfield himself.

287
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,891
Why's that?

288
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,406
False gods can be wrathful.

289
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,238
We don't speak cult.

290
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:44,951
Matthew crossed him,
after his three days.

291
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:45,817
Three days?

292
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,217
Initiation rite.

293
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,485
Spend three days 
in total darkness.

294
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,783
Sounds fun. / Matthew came out 
knowing just what he wanted.

295
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,128
Son?

296
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,550
I was..

297
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,872
I was so alone in the dark.

298
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:17,303
You don't have to be.

299
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,580
Not any more.

300
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,789
I remember.
All of it.

301
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,059
No memories.

302
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,836
No past, no pain.

303
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,441
You can let all that go now.

304
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,518
I can?

305
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,321
Come on.

306
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,362
Matthew.

307
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:46,077
We want you to stay here.

308
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:48,574
With us. If you want.

309
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,949
Really?

310
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:53,994
Will you stay?

311
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,843
I wanna show you 
what a family is.

312
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,138
What love is?

313
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,067
I want that.

314
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:02,596
Then choose someone.

315
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,671
Anyone.

316
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:07,331
To love.

317
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,859
Alison.

318
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:17,623
Alison. Come on.

319
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,647
Is it okay?

320
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,902
Matthew has chosen you.

321
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,845
I love you.

322
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,308
And she loves you.

323
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,577
You'll be together one month,

324
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,188
no more.

325
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:40,498
You understand?

326
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:43,393
I understand.

327
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,528
So this Alison was
Warfield's squeeze.

328
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,298
But Matthew wanted that.

329
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,038
Did they obey the one month rule?

330
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,566
No.

331
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:55,874
They fell in love.

332
00:19:55,874 --> 00:20:00,710
So you're saying Warfield offed Matthew because 
he was banging her past the cult expiration date?

333
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,159
I'm saying he defied Maurice.

334
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,989
And Maurice did not like
to be defied.

335
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:18,523
You got a nice shop.

336
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,914
- You own it?
- All the designs are mine.

337
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,449
I work for myself.

338
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,502
You still think about Matthew?

339
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:28,450
The love of your life gets snatched at gunpoint 
and you never lay eyes on him again.

340
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,994
What do you think?

341
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,948
We heard you were Maurice's girl.

342
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,578
He had a lot of girls.

343
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,825
Any chance you were special?

344
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,894
He didn't like Matthew choosing you?

345
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:43,384
No. It was more important to Maurice 
to be a father figure than anything else.

346
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,291
So when your month 
with Matthew was up...?

347
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,688
Maurice said we could stay together.

348
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:50,751
Any idea who's keeping
the cult going for Maurice now?

349
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,162
He had a lot of sway
over a lot of people.

350
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:57,520
Guy could make you follow 
him into a burning house.

351
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,179
How did he get you?

352
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,704
I was at the end of 
a bad marriage.

353
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,812
He made me feel special.

354
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:08,175
Alison, how do you get out
from underneath someone like him.

355
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,033
For me, it was when Matthew died.

356
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:13,610
Biggest lost of my life.

357
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,645
You think Matthew killed himself?

358
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:18,009
I don't know. 
We were all pretty messed up.

359
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,594
What if we told you now 
it was a homicide?

360
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:25,628
I guess I'd ask if you've
looked at his dad.

361
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,233
Why?

362
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,876
I spent 2 summers here
as a lab tech.

363
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,652
Build character.

364
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,080
Methyl iodide,

365
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,708
thallium,

366
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,723
Cyanide.

367
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:52,254
Doctor Boyle said she saw you.

368
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:53,825
I thought maybe you came to talk.

369
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,174
We ran out of things
to talk about a long time ago.

370
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:58,206
Then what are you doing here?

371
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,090
You'll find out.

372
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,615
Looking for narcotics?

373
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,419
What? 'Cause I might be 
a dope fiend, right?

374
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,363
- Baby, let's go.
- Is she one of them?

375
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:06,528
She loves me.

376
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,833
Those zombies are 
controlling your mind, Matthew.

377
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,165
No, that's your specialty.

378
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,396
You're just ike your mother.
A total headcase.

379
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:21,374
Don't talk about her. / You take 
after her in all the worst ways.

380
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:26,455
I will never forget the secret.

381
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:33,802
The secret?

382
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,032
I don't know what it was.

383
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,868
But Matthew hated his dad for it.

384
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:42,394
- And with everything going down..
- What was going down?

385
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:45,148
Maurice had a plan.

386
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,590
Zero hour.

387
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,192
The suicide.

388
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,579
- That's not what it was.
- Then what?

389
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,632
It's gonna be the ultimate
loyalty to Maurice.

390
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,310
We were all gonna 
kill our fathers.

391
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,352
So zero hour wasn't mass suicide?

392
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:11,961
Mass patricide.

393
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,756
30 vials of cyanide for 30 dads.

394
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:17,243
So then our boy Matthew was
going to kill the surgeon?

395
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:19,936
Maybe the dad knew what was 
going down, beat him to the punch.

396
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:21,371
The timing's suspicious.

397
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,373
The day before he was targeted to die?

398
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:26,051
Or maybe it has to do with 
the secret Matthew mentioned.

399
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,534
Prints are back on your window.

400
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:29,949
Whoever broke in ain't in the system.

401
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,189
We get a list of visitors 
authorized to see Maurice?

402
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,411
Yeah.

403
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,580
- It's long.
- He's had that many blood relatives?

404
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,877
Turns out he fathered 
a fair amount of kids in his day.

405
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,994
Every cult you ever read about, 
the leader's doin' all the ladies.

406
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:44,945
It's good to be king.

407
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:49,307
Talk to the dad, see if he had 
advance word on zero hour.

408
00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:56,479
The sister's here.

409
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:01,782
Matthew wouldn't do that.

410
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:04,054
That's what they were planning.

411
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,726
I'm sorry. / I mean he and 
my dad had their problems but...

412
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,210
Matthew wasn't himself.

413
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:12,548
Why couldn't I reach him?

414
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:16,469
His girlfriend said something
about the secret..?

415
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,528
He told her that?

416
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:20,345
No details.

417
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,926
My father wanted 
the things he wanted them.

418
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:28,851
When Matthew was pre-med,
everything was great.

419
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,641
And when he dropped out?

420
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,035
Dad blamed mom.

421
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,229
They fought.

422
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,850
It was ugly.

423
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,948
So was the secret about her?

424
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:47,313
When you work at the lab this summer,
all that garbage has to come off.

425
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:50,842
Well, maybe I'm not working
at the lab this summer.

426
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,084
What's that?

427
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:57,735
My friend Sonnet needs an apprentice
to stretch the canvases and mix paint.

428
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,977
Your friend, the pot head?

429
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:06,210
Med schools aren't really impressed
with mixing paint all summer.

430
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:10,216
I dropped out of Penn.

431
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:14,654
And I'm applying for art school.

432
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,334
Did you know about this?

433
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,249
- It's what he wants.
- It's what you want.

434
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,760
- I want him to be happy.
- Maybe he can end up with pill popper.

435
00:25:24,078 --> 00:25:26,544
Dad, Matthew's a great artist.

436
00:25:27,338 --> 00:25:29,593
You know, I just.. Forget it.

437
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,477
I'll go to med school.

438
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:35,233
You know, if I'm so awful,
why don't I just kill myself?

439
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,295
You're drunk again.

440
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:39,091
This time, I'll do it.

441
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,295
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- I will, I will.

442
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:41,601
Then kill you, already.

443
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,805
Otherwise shut up.

444
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,773
Forget them.
You're going to art school.

445
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:01,859
I'll find a quiet place
in the middle of nowhere.

446
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:05,044
That's where I'll go.

447
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,099
Can I come?

448
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:16,796
And when the police came,

449
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:20,833
he made us say that we all saw it.

450
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:22,062
But only he did.

451
00:26:22,062 --> 00:26:24,114
That's why Matthew 
hated him so much.

452
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:26,016
But not you?

453
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,087
I was the good girl.

454
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,988
I went to medical school.

455
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,624
Tried to forget.

456
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,029
But I never did.

457
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,567
Do you think 
your dad killed her?

458
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:41,022
I don't think so.

459
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:45,579
I don't know.

460
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,932
I didn't want my family's 
ugliness exposed.

461
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:01,415
Maybe you didn't want anyone 
checking the prints on the gun.

462
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:03,918
My wife's death was 
ruled as suicide.

463
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:07,476
- So was Matthew's.
- Lucky man, aren't I.

464
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:10,512
Two of my three family 
members checked out on me.

465
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,700
Did you know your son
was plannig to kill you?

466
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:17,038
- No.
- Kinda suspicious,

467
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,379
Matthew dying saved your life.

468
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:21,528
I tried to save my son,
not kill him.

469
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,276
How about your wife?
Did you kill her?

470
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:29,319
I watched my wife 
shoot herself in the face.

471
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,922
That almost killed me.

472
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:34,242
- Okay.
- As for Matthew,

473
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:37,360
have you ever looked into 
the eyes of someone you loved

474
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,002
and realize the person 
you know is gone?

475
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,515
Yeah.

476
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,130
At what point do you give up?

477
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:51,320
I know you're there, Matty.

478
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,202
That you hear me.

479
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:56,333
He's been at this 
for 40 hours.

480
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,396
Why don't you let me take over?

481
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:01,164
My father will rescue me.

482
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:03,661
- You won't win.
- That man, Matty,

483
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:06,795
he's just like dad.
They just wanna control you.

484
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:09,846
Tell you how to live.

485
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:14,748
Promise me you wouldn't
let that happen.

486
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:16,185
Remember?

487
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,830
That quiet place 
in the middle of nowhere?

488
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:22,713
Enough, Beth.

489
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,739
I know you remember.

490
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:01,778
Hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

491
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:04,615
Home, 
to my father.

492
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,918
Oh, Matthew.

493
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:09,596
Why wasn't I ever good enough?

494
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,916
You hated me
because I was like mom.

495
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,523
No.

496
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:16,278
You killed her.

497
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,008
Matthew.

498
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:20,258
What do you want from me?

499
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,596
I wanna forget you.

500
00:29:23,336 --> 00:29:26,696
I don't wanna feel 
bad any more.

501
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,342
Okay.

502
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,386
You win.

503
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:38,906
It's your life.

504
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,715
Get in.

505
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:43,136
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

506
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,042
I'm a surgeon.

507
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,011
I know when 
I've lost a patient.

508
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,381
Where'd you take him?

509
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,998
Back to that place.

510
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,599
He got out of the car,

511
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,282
never looked back. / So you saw him 
walk back into the cult the night he died.

512
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:05,247
I saw that man Warfield
welcome him back.

513
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:08,269
You never told 
your daughter about this?

514
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:11,135
She'd hate me.

515
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:13,934
And I couldn't afford to 
lose anyone else.

516
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:23,343
Scotty.

517
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,594
I got your message.

518
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:27,767
I couldn't get back. Sorry.

519
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,441
I've been worried about you.

520
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,208
I'm with her family.

521
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,317
What can I do to help?

522
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:36,621
Tell me where we are in this job.

523
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,926
Maybe you shouldn't 
be here right now.

524
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:44,857
Well, then you tell me
where I should be.

525
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,450
Thought you could 
break into my house

526
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,331
chase me away, Maurice?

527
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:57,203
I didn't break in anywhere. / We know 
you're still running the game on the outside.

528
00:30:57,203 --> 00:31:00,202
We also know about the patricide.

529
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:04,839
Patricide? Now, last time you said 
I was planning a mass suicide.

530
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,096
Which one is it?

531
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:10,117
Well, you said you never saw 
Matthew after the kidnapping.

532
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,811
But he came back.

533
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,717
- Two days later.
- Says who?

534
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:16,745
- His dad. 
- Well, that doesn't mean I killed him.

535
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:19,616
Add to that, 
your deputy Nick fingered you.

536
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,562
Nick did?

537
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,640
I see what he's doing.

538
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:30,622
Nick is the keeper
of my congregation.

539
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,843
I thought the cult was dead.

540
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:34,656
He's supposed to lead
until I get out.

541
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,265
But I guess he sees a chance 
to keep me locked up forever.

542
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,221
So Matthew came back.

543
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:42,747
And we were all thrilled.

544
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,331
Except Nick.

545
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:48,107
- How come?
- Because with Matthew gone,

546
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,462
he could try to get his wife back.

547
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:52,457
His wife?

548
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:54,168
Alison.

549
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,049
Alison and Nick were married?

550
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,031
And Nick did not like
sharing her.

551
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:00,662
You saying he killed Matthew?

552
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:02,715
I know they said it was a suicide.

553
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:05,338
But, nah..
Suicide's for cowards.

554
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:07,793
Matthew was brave.

555
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,290
Talk more about that.

556
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,164
What? Suicide?

557
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:14,113
Well.

558
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:17,299
"It's a screw you to the world."

559
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,450
- "I never really loved any of you."
- Is that right?

560
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,895
- Forget it, let's go.
- No, no, no.

561
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,135
What else does it proof?

562
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:24,994
Defective thinking,

563
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,847
- Narcissism..
- Keep going.

564
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,723
And that the so-called 
loved ones have failed.

565
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:37,595
Keep talking!

566
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,483
So is Valens in the wood shed?

567
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:54,650
Boss said he'd keep it in in-house.

568
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,811
Keep it out of I.A's hands.

569
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:59,721
It's true about Nick Logan's
congregation. Check it out.

570
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:02,670
This is a list of family 
allowed to visit Maurice,

571
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,206
these are the members 
of Logan's church.

572
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:06,634
Same list.

573
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:10,573
So Logan's the number two
in charge till Maurice goes out.

574
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,825
But he figures that if Maurice stays 
in for murder, he'll be number one.

575
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,891
Classic power struggle.

576
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,473
Whatever happened to 
old-fashioned cult loyalty?

577
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:23,041
I'll talk to Alison and see 
how possessive hubbby was.

578
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,281
Let's go back to the preacher.

579
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:34,113
Hey, Scotty.

580
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,897
Hey.

581
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:43,138
I, uh.. snapped out, I know.

582
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:44,342
Sorry.

583
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,390
Most people wouldn't try to come 
back two days after something like this.

584
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:51,327
I ain't most people.

585
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:52,586
Yeah.

586
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:54,260
It won't happen again.

587
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,936
I need your gun, Scotty.

588
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,667
Just for a little while.

589
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:02,347
You want my badge, too?

590
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:05,335
No, the badge is yours.

591
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:26,002
Elisa was in a lot 
of pain, Scotty.

592
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:29,828
It wasn't a suicide,
what happened.

593
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,323
Wasn't there a note?

594
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,884
But it wasn't like that.

595
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:38,789
I mean, if she jumped 
or something..

596
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:42,404
It'd be more apologizing,
that she couldn't make it.

597
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:44,343
Well, what did she say?

598
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,601
It was about the good stuff.

599
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,126
When we were kids.

600
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:55,993
Scotty, that's how sometimes
people say good bye.

601
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,850
No. No,

602
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,275
she wrote about this..

603
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:02,300
this birthday party.

604
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,175
Her friend turning 14 and 
how we're both there

605
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:08,622
sneaking looks and talking 
about how the river smells,

606
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:10,040
and how in her head,

607
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,045
she's waiting for the light 
to fade so I can hold her hand

608
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:19,410
in the dark 
and no one would see.

609
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:27,185
Don't tell me 
that note is the end.

610
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:33,168
It's the beginning.

611
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,731
I should get back.

612
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,163
Yeah.

613
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:09,505
Turns out you're just watching over 
Maurice's flock until he's released, Nick.

614
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,552
I'm a minister to 
a hundred people.

615
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:13,516
You're a stand-in 
for a psychopath.

616
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,116
It's my congregation.

617
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:17,157
They look to me,
not Maurice.

618
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:18,908
He told us about Alison.

619
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:20,425
Must've hurt.

620
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:23,920
Some guy slipping it 
to the wife in front of your face.

621
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,937
Maurice let them be together.

622
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,901
That why you killed Matthew?
Over her?

623
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,362
I didn't kill anyone.

624
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:34,973
Guy gets kidnapped you figured this is 
my chance to slide back in with the missus.

625
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:37,670
But the kid's back
two days later, ruins everything.

626
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,433
It made me angry.

627
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:43,173
- But I didn't kill him.
- Then who did?

628
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,434
The real psychopath.

629
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,574
Who's that man?

630
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:12,182
No one.

631
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:15,934
Welcome home, son.

632
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,205
Baby, you came back.

633
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,757
They took him away to brainwash him.
We have to know if they got to him.

634
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,607
He came back, he's pure.

635
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,964
I'm ready for tomorrow..

636
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:28,576
Zero hour.

637
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:31,475
- Never been more ready.
- We have to be sure.

638
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,589
Go upstairs.

639
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:37,814
You wait for her.

640
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,101
Nick's right.

641
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:45,746
If he's tainted,
he could ruin the plan.

642
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:47,925
I'm in charge of zero hour.

643
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:50,190
Let me decide if he's okay.

644
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,390
And if he's not?

645
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:58,398
It'll be the biggest loss of my life.

646
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,391
Alison was in charge of zero hour?

647
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,245
Maurice gives her all the
important assignments.

648
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:15,665
Gives? Present tense?

649
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:18,731
She's diehard, like him.

650
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,210
Nick and I got married
when I was 18.

651
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,400
Smart, right?

652
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,990
How long did it last?

653
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,945
Oh, less than a year.

654
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,548
I was all too glad to forget 
our past when we met Maurice.

655
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:35,164
Was Nick the jealous type?

656
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:36,413
Why do you ask?

657
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:40,228
It takes a lot of rage dumping 
kid's body on his father's doorstop.

658
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:42,438
Unthinkable.

659
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:46,405
You know Matthew made it 
back to the cult that night.

660
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:48,999
No,

661
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,624
I would've seen him.

662
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,217
His father drove him there.

663
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,466
Is it too hot?

664
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,981
No, but I could use some honey.

665
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:14,276
Sure.

666
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,713
Hands behind your head.

667
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:21,488
This is a mistake.

668
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:24,372
On your knees.

669
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,134
All your own designs, right?

670
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,636
You got her, Rush?

671
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:35,336
She's the one who 
broke into my apartment.

672
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:36,840
More than that,

673
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,444
she killed Matthew.

674
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:41,048
- You can't prove that.
- You had the cyanide.

675
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,670
Promised to kill him if 
the outside had gotten to his head.

676
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,680
Poor Matthew.

677
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,703
His sister ruined him.

678
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,738
She got through.

679
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,950
I had no choice.

680
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:07,227
I thought I'd lost you.

681
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:08,952
You'll never lose me.

682
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:10,540
So, you're ready for zero hour?

683
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,988
That's why I came back,
we have to get out of here.

684
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:14,917
What?

685
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,552
What Maurice wants us
to do, it's crazy.

686
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:20,455
They got to you.

687
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:22,436
Baby, he wants us to kill people.

688
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:24,389
We're wiping out the past.

689
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,934
We can't do that.

690
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,927
But, we can move on.

691
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,091
To a quiet place in 
the middle of nowhere.

692
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:34,911
Just me, you, my sister.

693
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,862
We'll go to police,
we'll tell them about zero hour.

694
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:42,299
And then, we're free.

695
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:45,811
Does your family know 
you're doing this?

696
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,836
My dad drove me here.
We didn't say a word the whole drive.

697
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,722
- Baby, we gotta hurry.
- Okay.

698
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:55,217
Okay, but

699
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:57,693
we can't just run away.

700
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:00,080
We have to leave Maurice a note.

701
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,042
Okay. Yeah, fine, whatever.

702
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,698
Just write,

703
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,987
Father,

704
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,766
I'm free.

705
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,923
Good bye.

706
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,004
Sign it.

707
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:20,985
I don't need a father anymore.

708
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:25,053
Just you.

709
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,568
Do you feel it yet?

710
00:41:34,683 --> 00:41:37,479
It'll just be a minute now.

711
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:40,310
Alison.

712
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,045
I'll leave you 
on his doorstep.

713
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:46,838
