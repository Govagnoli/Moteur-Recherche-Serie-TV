00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:03,521
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:09,446
December 6,1998

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:16,168
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

4
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:21,256
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

5
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:25,180
OK, everyone!

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,117
The final score
for Lionstaff initial public offering,

7
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:36,656
opening price 11 dollars a share,
closing price 31!

8
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,930
You're officially rich

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,623
so this is the last free pizza
you're getting on me.

10
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:47,143
Scott, 31, that's like 15 million.

11
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:50,160
For the company,
how much is it to me personally?

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,585
I don't know Midas, enough.

13
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,966
Scott, Amy, you kids, we did it!

14
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:58,499
And the guys at the club
said that text stocks are over.

15
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:01,762
Well youth is the future,
and they're old.

16
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,122
- We're glad you're pleased.
- Pleased? I'm ready to party,

17
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,937
- you got something set up for after?
- Mr. Coleman,

18
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:09,016
the brokers are asking
for a picture with you. / Sure.

19
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,383
Not with us?

20
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:15,020
If you really want your picture
taken dressed like that.

21
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:21,557
Don't worry.
Lionstaff will help you.

22
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:23,552
It's not just a draw for money.

23
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,857
Thanks, but that's not it.

24
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,515
Then what?

25
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:31,699
It's all in paper,
it's not real yet.

26
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:36,786
To be worried at a time like this
takes a special kind of person.

27
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:40,069
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,626
Yeah, I really am.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,433
Lind, Amy   Sudden Death

30
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,081
I think finally the public schools
are doing something right and then this.

31
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,316
Just a sec, it's loading.

32
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,049
And what is it your boy
found, exactly?

33
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,805
Death threats in a document
on the computer.

34
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,326
Donated to the school.

35
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:44,068
I found it on the hard drive.

36
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,780
I was recovering it for extra credit.

37
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,432
Sounds like you're good at this.

38
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,270
Nah. I just can't do PE.

39
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,222
It's up. You can look.

40
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,289
Entries are dated,
looks like a diary.

41
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,078
Or it could be just a prank.

42
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,790
That's what I thought.

43
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,634
But then I looked up the name.

44
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:08,632
Amy Lind's an actual person.
Who's like, actually dead.

45
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,598
Poison shuts her eyes,

46
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,498
poison stops her tongue,

47
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:18,186
poison stops her ghasty heart.

48
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:22,658
Ghasty? / Writer don't wanna
break the flow and run spellcheck.

49
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:25,516
Goodybe to hell Amy Lind.

50
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:27,758
Dies of a heart attack,
24 years old.

51
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:30,931
Poison stops her heart.

52
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,892
You can take it from here?

53
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:36,526
- Come on.
- They could need me.

54
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:37,537
It's good work,

55
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:41,080
we got any questions
we'll let you know.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,083
Thanks.

57
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,747
24's pretty young to have
a bad ticker.

58
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:53,351
Yeah, I guess it happens
but so does poison.

59
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:56,547
Well let's find this writer
who hated Amy so much.

60
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:01,458
See if he went from diarist to doer.

61
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,716
- Mace, 'ssup?
- Hey, Scotty.

62
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,798
- Mia Fernandez called me.
- I know.

63
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,611
I asked if I could catch
you out here.

64
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:55,514
OK. / We gave it some thought
before reaching out to you,

65
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:58,110
- didn't wanna stir things up.
- What happened?

66
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,747
Um, we had an incident
on the bridge this morning.

67
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:05,895
Guy threw a girl into the Schuylkill.

68
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:13,865
- She died?
- In ICU.  Busted up pretty bad.

69
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,104
Washed up
near the same spot as Elisa.

70
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:18,350
You're thinking
this is a serial thing with him?

71
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,577
- Don't know yet.
- But it was the same spot as her?

72
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:27,762
Figured you'd want your shot
at this guy when you came in. / Yeah.

73
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,802
Probably tommorrow sometime?

74
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,708
What's his name?
I'll read up.

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,292
Dante Catches.

76
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:44,529
I figured...this would be the way.

77
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:49,074
Sit tight, something about Elisa
would come out.

78
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,401
Yeah.

79
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:01,123
Yeah. Thanks.

80
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,426
Amy Lind died 2 days after
the last entry in the diary.

81
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:09,776
Did the computer unit
have any luck with it?

82
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,113
Can't ID a writer
but it came from an Internet company.

83
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,556
Lionstaff. / That the start
where Amy worked at?

84
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,785
Oh not just worked at, created

85
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:21,004
with fellow Wharton grad
Scott Sawyer, they were co-CEOs.

86
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,777
Nice timing they had.

87
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:26,593
Got their MBAs in '97,
started their company in '98.

88
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:30,736
IPOed December '98,
peak of the dot com boom.

89
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:31,986
Try bubble, Nick.

90
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:35,914
They're sure cop top of the world for
two months then quick slide in to nothing.

91
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:39,825
Amy dies in May,
just before they close their doors.

92
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:42,549
Now how does the coroner
explain heart failure at 24?

93
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,319
Stress induced.

94
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,762
The company was losing
200,000 dollars a day.

95
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,210
How about drugs?

96
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,178
Not in her system

97
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,229
but standard autopsy
doesn't test for poison.

98
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,469
Our diarist's method of choice.

99
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,767
All right, start with Scott, Amy's partner

100
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,026
he can tell you
who was on the computers.

101
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,989
Other angle is the poison.

102
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,747
Meaning exhume the body,
test again?

103
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,350
Need family's permission.

104
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,987
Um, there's a sister.

105
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,784
A Laura. Local.

106
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,070
Good.

107
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:19,485
You have my permission
to do whatever you need to do.

108
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:23,334
Well it's likely with a new autopsy
we'll get new information.

109
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,497
You really think someone poisoned her?

110
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,392
Someone sure wrote about it.

111
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:30,265
Was there anyone at her office
she had a problem with?

112
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,705
I wouldn't know.
She was living here

113
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,141
but after she and Scott
got the venture capital money,

114
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,863
I almost never saw her.

115
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,779
Business took up all of her time?

116
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,343
She worked late every night,
went rowing every morning.

117
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:46,672
If I saw her,
she was asleep right there.

118
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:49,349
Couch surfing, she called it.

119
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,077
What about this Scott?

120
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:53,532
Were they involved at all?

121
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:59,868
I don't think Amy would have said no
but Scott liked them busty and adoring.

122
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:03,650
That wasn't Amy.
So strictly business?

123
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,704
She said they made the perfect team.

124
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,468
Scott had the flash, got the attention,

125
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,220
Amy knew how to close a deal.

126
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,528
Ever see the two of them in action?

127
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:15,699
I was here when they first got funded.

128
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,591
Their whole world changed in a day.

129
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:25,649
Well, interesting idea

130
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,228
but how are you gonna
make it work exactly?

131
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:33,112
Two Wharton graduates,
Suma Kum Ladi, we'll find a way.

132
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:38,207
Good packaging, I admit
but it's not really an answer.

133
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:43,117
It's 3 AM,
your child's having a seizure,

134
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:46,516
you're speaking gibberish,
you need help. / Uh huh?

135
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:50,757
You go online.
What's happening with this boy?

136
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,376
- And there we are.
- Lionstaff.

137
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:56,777
Type in the symptoms,
get answers in a matter of seconds.

138
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,683
And instructions,
how to help him.

139
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,901
It's a lofty goal,
helping people.

140
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,236
And a sound business idea.

141
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:10,202
The users will be desperate.
Desperate people pay.

142
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:16,342
Well, I gotta tell you,
when I was your age,

143
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:21,710
the only thing I had going on
in my garage was band.

144
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,610
Whatd'ya think?

145
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,800
- I'm in.
- How much?

146
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,960
How's a million sound?

147
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,468
After that they rented the office
and she was pretty much gone.

148
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:49,539
- But she kept living here?
- Yes.

149
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,517
Eating ramen.

150
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,270
I told her 'Honey, you're a millionare,

151
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,534
if I were you I'd be setting up house
on the Main Line.'

152
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,159
Sounds like a tough lady.

153
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,279
Desperate people and all.

154
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,247
No.

155
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:07,460
You should understand
the reason Amy wanted this company.

156
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,001
We had a brother, Gage,
he died just before he turned 10.

157
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,448
The pictures on the table.

158
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,562
When she talked about being online
in 3 in the morning

159
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:20,520
she was talking about herself.

160
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,742
You saying
Amy didn't have a heart attack?

161
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:28,451
She did but someone
might have helped her along.

162
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,859
I guess anything's possible.

163
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,391
- Those days were crazy.
- How so?

164
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,973
You're 24, too young
to rent a car.

165
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,607
You can't imagine being a multimillionare.

166
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,130
Can't imagine your friends would die.

167
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,251
Yeah but you are and they do.

168
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:46,657
And you lose it all.

169
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,624
It was a wild ride.

170
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,039
And I was lucky.

171
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,587
Couldn't have taken it without her.

172
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,147
Meaning?

173
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:56,467
Amy had the ideas.

174
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,406
I did the dog and pony show,
she did the headwork.

175
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:01,581
Anyone around who felt different?

176
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,371
You mean did she have enemies?

177
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,522
Yeah. We called them employees.

178
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,905
Malvender has something
he'd like to discuss. / OK.

179
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:24,051
He came to me,
I told him he had to talk to both of us.

180
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,876
Go on, Mal.
I want to be made partner.

181
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,074
- Partner?
- I'm building your system.

182
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,206
Without me you have no business.

183
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:35,927
Well, your work has been really creative.

184
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,464
- It sure has.
- Thank you.

185
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,525
But Scott and I started the business.
It's ours.

186
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,773
- So I don't matter?
- You do.

187
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,864
That's why you pull a big salary.

188
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:52,585
Sorry.
Guess it's no can do.

189
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,098
Well can we revisit this later?

190
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,702
There are only two partners
of Lionstaff,

191
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,690
Scott and me.

192
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,447
I get the picture.

193
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:04,903
Ghasty, idiot woman.

194
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:10,089
I admit, I leaned on her
for the bad cops.

195
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,504
I don't enjoy saying no.

196
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:14,959
That word Malvender used.
Ghasty?

197
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,418
Hindi. For whore.

198
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,606
We learned a few variations.

199
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,219
Malvender sounds like an angry guy.

200
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:26,354
And he sounds like her diarist.

201
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:40,074
Poison stops here ghasty heart.
Recognize that?

202
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:43,618
- Key word there, ghasty.
- What is this?

203
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:47,537
It came off a computer
from Lionstaff. 1999.

204
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:49,890
So because it's a Hindi word
I must have written it?

205
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,882
- Did you?
- No.

206
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:54,293
So how come it sounds like you?

207
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,922
Everyone in that office
picked up my swear words.

208
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,479
Yeah but you had
a real beef with Amy.

209
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,020
You wanted to be made partner.
She said no.

210
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,051
Hard on you?
Having a woman turn you down?

211
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,006
That whole time was hard for me.

212
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:11,593
New country, no friends,
trying to send money home.

213
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:17,060
My behaviour wasn't too graceful.
But not this.

214
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,499
So you didn't carry a grudge?
Not for her shutting you down?

215
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,938
I was lucky not to get caught
between her and Scott.

216
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:26,125
I thought they were friends.

217
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,986
Started that way.

218
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:31,027
When the big money came, war.

219
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,283
Is it true?

220
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:36,295
You bought a Ferrari?

221
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,586
Why not?

222
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,206
- In crab oil?
- Scott.

223
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,690
They way you're spending,
we can't afford any set backs.

224
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,861
I don't plan on any.

225
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,918
And I have a great new idea forming.

226
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:48,756
- What's that?
- Superbowl ad.

227
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:52,145
A million five for 30 seconds.

228
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,602
A million five is more
than we started with.

229
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:58,209
And we've grown.
I have a good feeling about this.

230
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,277
- We're not doing it Scott.
- Too late.

231
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:04,206
It's done.

232
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:10,462
Beginning of the fireworks.

233
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,990
So he made a million dollar
decision without her?

234
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,260
And it was a flop.

235
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,660
No tickers from the ad?

236
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,783
We got lots of hits
but zero business.

237
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,716
Suddenly we're 3 million
in the hole.

238
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,315
No wonder she was mythed.

239
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,296
That's when the business
started to slide.

240
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,585
Throw downs between Scott and Amy,
they escalate?

241
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:32,097
Into silence.
Like a shout.

242
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,601
Scott said he and Amy were friends.

243
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:40,196
Opposite was true a
ccording to this Malvender dude.

244
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,693
Let me guess,
they fell out over money.

245
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,005
Not that Scott told us that.

246
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:45,310
Sounds like a reinterview.

247
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,876
News from the ME.

248
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:50,865
Amy's body had 8 times
the normal level of potassium chloride.

249
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,073
That a poison?

250
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:55,183
Not normally but a high enough
dose induces heart attack.

251
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,707
How was it ingested?

252
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:59,283
Dissolves in water.
Kicked in within half an hour.

253
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,058
So she probably drank
it that morning.

254
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,978
That points to someone close.

255
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:05,538
New questions for the sister.

256
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:11,625
New autopsy shows
your sister was poisoned, Laura.

257
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,345
With potassium chloride.

258
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:19,180
But you know what that is,
I bet, being a chemistry teacher and all.

259
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,918
Yes. / Know who
would've been with her?

260
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,397
- 6:30 that morning?
- No idea.

261
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,516
Well how about you?

262
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:30,064
So we disagreed on
how to spend money.

263
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,744
See, you say that like
it's no big deal.

264
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,198
In my line of work,

265
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,046
when people fight about money

266
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,238
it usually don't end too well.

267
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:40,553
I'm not some street corner thug.

268
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:44,835
So you got some more
refined way of gettin' what you want?

269
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:48,756
Hands off?
Poison maybe?

270
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:51,030
Why would I want my sister dead?

271
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,399
Hard living next to all that success,
none of it being yours.

272
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,807
I was proud of her.

273
00:15:56,807 --> 00:16:00,239
Pride can turn to envy on a dime.

274
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:04,382
After Gage died,
Amy was all I had.

275
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,976
Sisters have to stick together.

276
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:10,998
If not you Laura, then who?
It's 6:30 AM. / I don't know.

277
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:12,134
She row with anyone?

278
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:18,308
No. The river was her place.
She went there alone.

279
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:21,073
No boyfriend, anyone
who stayed over?

280
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:27,282
Amy was driven, focused,
wasn't attracted to a lot of guys.

281
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:30,429
She got a kitten
when she moved in.

282
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:36,100
Always joked it would be her,
her career and her beloved cats.

283
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:38,508
My true feeling,

284
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,298
Amy died of a broken heart.

285
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,905
She never got over Gage.

286
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,561
Convenient theory for you.

287
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:48,871
We were partners,
I wouldn't profit from hurting her. / No?

288
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:52,093
And ultimately we had
the same wolf at our door.

289
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:56,022
- That wolf being?
- Coleman.

290
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:59,338
After the Superbowl fiasco,

291
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:02,367
he rained fire on both our heads.

292
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,642
I thought you were gonna sell that.

293
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:19,097
I'm not givin' up the car.
Makes an impression.

294
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:22,368
How are you keeping up payments?
Another loan?

295
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:25,322
Mom.
Lay off.

296
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:28,595
Scott! Amy!

297
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:31,779
- I buy that?
- Excuse me?

298
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:35,822
You've just been throwing around
my money like confetti, haven't you?

299
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,053
Is this about the ad, Cliff?

300
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,376
You think this is a game?
Monopoly?

301
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,419
Of course not.

302
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,532
I give you a million dollars
that I've earned sweating

303
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:48,004
and bleeding and you spend it
on cars, watches, sushi.

304
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,055
Appearences matter.

305
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,572
Then you get around
to an actual business decision

306
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,930
and you blow your wad
on one ad?

307
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,171
We thought the exposure
was worth the gamble.

308
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,811
No, no!

309
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:05,353
Who's stupid idea was this?

310
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:08,261
- It was a joint decision.
- It was a fiasco.

311
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:11,283
- We're sorry.
- Let another one get by you,

312
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,747
I'll do worse than this.

313
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:25,720
He had a right to be mad
but he was psycho mad.

314
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,809
Sounds like you ducked for cover
and let him lay on Amy.

315
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:34,260
Not exactly me at my best.

316
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,511
News.

317
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,019
We got some background
on Cliff Coleman.

318
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,191
Me too.
He's got a rage problem.

319
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:50,892
He also had a rich wife.
In '94 she died of a heart attack.

320
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:51,831
Like Amy.

321
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,527
Plus Coleman has
a medical condition, kidneys.

322
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,977
Which is managed by
potassium chloride

323
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,853
in a steady daily dose.

324
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,417
Dante, we got two witnesses
who say you grabbed

325
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:12,065
Angela Stimpson by the hair
and tossed her off the bridge.

326
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:16,552
Yeah. I know.
I was there.

327
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:19,259
Wanna say why?

328
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,069
I had to.

329
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,400
You had to?

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,145
Some people just gotta go off.

331
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,933
- at people?
- rls.

332
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,199
Long hair.
Wrong in the head.

333
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:34,042
So it wasn't just Angela
that had to go over, there were others?

334
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:38,085
A lot of girls.

335
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:44,650
How about her?

336
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,995
Yeah, oh, yeah.

337
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:49,123
Are we talking last winter?

338
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,682
You see her and decided
she had to go?

339
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:52,015
Well she ain't right in the mind?

340
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,925
- How'd'you know that?
- She talked to me.

341
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:58,609
Yeah? / Wanted to get
to her boyfriend's house.

342
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,083
He lived all the way across town.

343
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,672
But her car was broke

344
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:10,199
and he ain't pickin' up the phone
so she's walkin' when I meet her.

345
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,104
So why does that make you
throw her in the river?

346
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:16,011
She don't listen.

347
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:19,421
Why does she gotta love that guy?

348
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,290
He don't love her like I do.

349
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,036
Man, who you talking
about Dante? / Angela.

350
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,670
I wrote her letters with my heart.

351
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,751
Poured out on them,
I loved her so bad.

352
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,743
She know, Angela?

353
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:33,517
I told her every day,
I was her guardian angel.

354
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,230
And the other girls?

355
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,145
There were no other girls.

356
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:44,346
Elisa didn't drive,
she never had a car.

357
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,222
We lived 6 blocks
from each other.

358
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:51,172
Angela should be arrested
'cause she took my heart.

359
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,940
You think she'll ever forgive me?

360
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,652
It ain't him.

361
00:20:55,652 --> 00:21:00,859
Angela. Angie.

362
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,132
It'll just be a moment.

363
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:14,123
Coffee or tea, sir?

364
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:23,167
- Sir?
- Officers. Hello.

365
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,553
Nice digs you have here.

366
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:27,261
I have the privelege of being
a fortunate man.

367
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,866
Got some questions
about that fortune.

368
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,396
It came from your wife's family,
we understand.

369
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,474
Guilty.
Please.

370
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:43,750
- And, how'd she die?
- Heart failure.

371
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,317
The loss of my life.

372
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,996
You know Amy Lind died
the same way.

373
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:53,620
- Coincedence, huh?
- Yes, both were tragedies.

374
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,687
- Why are you here?
- We're looking in to Amy's death.

375
00:21:56,687 --> 00:22:00,244
We hear you bitched her and Scott
out pretty bad at one point?

376
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:04,089
Gotta breathe fire once in a while.
Make people jump.

377
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:09,046
- Gotta smash cars, too, huh?
- Oh, that.

378
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:14,485
The reason I was so mad
at Amy was she knew better.

379
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:17,179
And the golf club,
that was your way of saying it?

380
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:21,284
Oh, I told her more calmly again.

381
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:23,530
Right here.

382
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,843
I'm sorry about my outburst in
the parking lot.

383
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:29,936
It wasn't my car.

384
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:32,466
Good of you to give me
a second chance. / Sure.

385
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:37,165
Geraldine, thank you,
and hold all calls.

386
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,045
Again, I'm really sorry
about the ad.

387
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:44,643
It wasn't your idea, was it?

388
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:50,113
I believe that Lionstaff
can succeed, Amy.

389
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:53,905
But I don't think it
can succeed with Scott.

390
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,202
- Mr. Coleman.
- You're a rescuer. I see that.

391
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:01,202
First your brother and now Scott.
That's fine.

392
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:05,941
But when push comes to shove
you gotta save yourself.

393
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:09,697
- He's my partner.
- Amy,

394
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:14,658
your company is like
a hot air balloon.

395
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:16,915
It's rising, it's way up.

396
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,042
But it's coming to a mountain.

397
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:22,398
You cut a sandbag,
it could stay up in the sky.

398
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:27,970
You keep that sandbag and
it brings the whole thing crashing down.

399
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,812
Scott's not a sandbag.

400
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,608
He's dead weight.

401
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:35,150
He's showing off,
he's seduced by trappings,

402
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,650
he deserves to be cut out.

403
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,581
We're best friends
from business school,

404
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:39,684
we've been together since...

405
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,556
Honey, that's sentiment,
this is business.

406
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:45,111
Your next appointment is
here Mr. Coleman.

407
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,144
Go home.

408
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:52,031
Get out of here you're a child.

409
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,630
Excuse me?

410
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,978
Miss, don't get hysterical
and don't raise your voice to Mr. Coleman.

411
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,934
Moral of the story,

412
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:13,666
don't do business with kids.
They're emotional.

413
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,650
And the millions they cost you?

414
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,471
No feelings about that?

415
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:18,914
Venture capital is gambling

416
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:20,634
and I knew standing in that garage,

417
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,853
I was just laying a bet.

418
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:27,271
Excuse me.
Powder room.

419
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,870
Coffee?

420
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:41,808
Thank you.

421
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,650
You didn't like Amy, did you?

422
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,382
She wasn't interested in being liked.

423
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:54,728
- By you?
- By anyone.

424
00:24:54,728 --> 00:25:00,419
That's what they teach girls these days,
to be hard, aggressive.

425
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,025
Mannish.

426
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:07,895
Coleman seemed to have
a high opinion.

427
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:11,286
He always looks for
the good in people.

428
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,359
And you?

429
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,565
I just try to look after him.

430
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:23,151
Anyway Amy was busy enough
carrying on with a married man.

431
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:24,329
Really?

432
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,472
Every time I went by that office

433
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:27,930
I saw that she had him
wrapped around her finger.

434
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,561
- Who are we talking about?
- That Indian.

435
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:38,104
But I suppose to every feminist
a man's just a toy on a string.

436
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:44,088
- So Amy and you.
- Just me.

437
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:46,275
It was the one way kind.

438
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:49,797
I thought you hated her Mal.
Not making you a partner.

439
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:51,992
That was before I worked with her.

440
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:55,078
- Spent time with her.
- And your wife?

441
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:58,333
My marriage was arranged.

442
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,094
They still doin' that?

443
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:03,071
My family's traditional.

444
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:06,960
So, you were pretty much strangers?

445
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,628
Home was an akward place.

446
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:12,335
I was more comfortable with Amy.

447
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:15,552
She know how you feel?

448
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:19,807
Love, it's hard to keep to yourself.

449
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,895
Is this seat taken?

450
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:33,193
Someone's shorting our stock,
betting against us.

451
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,174
I have something
I must tell you.

452
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,924
I'm gonna find out who.

453
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:40,579
If it's anyone inside,
my next call's to the SEC.

454
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:45,457
There is a book.
It is called 'Out of Africa'.

455
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:48,217
Thanks, Malvender.

456
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:50,041
It is about a young woman

457
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,835
obliged to marry and move
far from home.

458
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:54,246
There's a movie, right?

459
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:59,194
She is lonely, but she is very brave
and she works very hard.

460
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,842
She reminds me of you.

461
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:05,156
Malvender. Thank you.

462
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,141
I am also from far away
and I am also alone.

463
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:11,083
Didn't you just get married?

464
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:18,441
Well, you see it's that...

465
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,529
I love you.

466
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,681
- I've been there.
- Thanks.

467
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:33,463
Did your wife know?

468
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,340
It's why she wrote the diary.

469
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,419
Back up,
your wife wrote that diary?

470
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:44,310
She was new to the country, all alone.

471
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,694
She could see I was thinking
about someone else.

472
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,584
How'd she know it was Amy?

473
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,222
I suppose I talked about her a lot.

474
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,251
She wrote that on the computer
I took to and from work.

475
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,058
There's some serious things
said in that diary.

476
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,658
I know but Mobli was
no threat to Amy.

477
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:03,787
The morning Amy died
my wife and I were in Bangelo, India.

478
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,552
We'll need to see your passports.

479
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:11,090
It must've been quite a scene
when you found out what she wrote.

480
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,085
She talked, and I listened.

481
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:18,968
After 4 months of marriage
we finally met.

482
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:36,445
You heading home Scottie?

483
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:40,748
No, no just, taking a sec.

484
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:45,217
Those SEC finances
gives you cross eyes.

485
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:48,367
You looking for who was
shortin' Amy's stock?

486
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:52,804
No, looking for one guy
in particular. Coleman.

487
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:56,162
Figured he lost a pile
bettin' on Amy and Scott

488
00:28:56,162 --> 00:29:00,096
maybe he tried to make
it back playin' dirty.

489
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,472
How'd it go over at West?

490
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:13,607
It was OK.

491
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:18,688
Interviewed a guy Mace brought in.

492
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:23,657
Thought maybe there was
a connect to Elisa there.

493
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:34,699
Just didn't pan out.

494
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:40,734
Oh, Scottie you're not gonna know.

495
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:43,810
Not next year, not the year after.

496
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,195
And so lay it to rest?

497
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:53,147
Saving grace heals the pains.

498
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:55,817
- I'm gonna go back up.
- Sure.

499
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:58,108
Good night.

500
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:23,493
Can't we call some forensic accountants
to read this stuff?

501
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:26,778
This is worse than
those poems last year.

502
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:29,551
I think I found something.

503
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:33,327
- Serious?
- H.G. Friday.

504
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,949
Holding company with 9.8 mil.

505
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:39,017
We got Coleman's name
attached to that? / Looking.

506
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:41,029
- That's gotta be illegal.
- Sure.

507
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:44,644
He knew the company was tanking,
he bets against it. Insider trading.

508
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:47,079
So maybe Amy finds out,
calls him on it.

509
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,089
And unless he's willing to go to jail
he has to shut her up.

510
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,630
Good theory but we're talking
about the wrong millionare.

511
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,470
Name attached to H.G. Friday
is Geraldine Wright.

512
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,875
Coleman's secretary?

513
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:07,878
H.G. Friday.

514
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:11,382
- I don't know what that is.
- Who that is.

515
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:12,746
His Girl Friday?

516
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:19,280
I certain secretary
with a 9.8 million nest egg.

517
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,210
I've never seen these before.

518
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,880
You know what I think?

519
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,020
I think Geraldine pretends she doesn't
know anything about business.

520
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,618
Hmm. Math is for men.

521
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:30,320
I think she understands perfectly.

522
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,404
I think she got filthy rich
playin' dumb.

523
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:42,204
I, I have 2,237 dollars in the bank.

524
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:45,790
- Also an IRA.
- Come on Geraldine, you hated Amy.

525
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,260
Like you hate all women
who are driven.

526
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,900
- Headstrong.
- Mannish.

527
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,446
The least you could do was make
some money off the little chippy.

528
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,740
So you shorted stock
on her company.

529
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,317
And when Amy caught on to it

530
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,782
you slipped her some of
Coleman's potassium chloride.

531
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:03,261
Probably in that fine coffee of yours.

532
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:07,039
I don't understand.

533
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,858
You can talk to my accountant.
Steven Franklin.

534
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:11,442
That's Coleman's accountant.

535
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,490
He handles everything for me, too.

536
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:22,417
Then I think you know
how your name got on this paper.

537
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,942
Your'e loyal, Geraldine.

538
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:30,363
It doesn't mean he is.

539
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:33,126
I looked after Mr. Coleman.

540
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:38,246
I took care of his needs.
For 22 years.

541
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,684
I was his constant companion.

542
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:45,323
I guess this is your reward.

543
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:48,487
6 years ago he set you up
for security spotting.

544
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:52,199
Now he sets you up for murder.

545
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:58,440
That girl thought she could play
with the big boys.

546
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,337
She thought they'd play fair.

547
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:05,147
- But?
- They didn't.

548
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:08,103
And the knives came out.

549
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,203
Mr. Sawyer!

550
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:13,136
Amy found out.

551
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,459
Found out what?

552
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,154
About you shorting stock.

553
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:18,723
You mean she found out about us.

554
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:23,560
I don't think she knows that,
that it's me, too.

555
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,247
- What's she doing?
- Calling the SEC.

556
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,399
- That's prison.
- I know.

557
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,655
- That's bankruptcy, then prison.
- Oh, God, I can't.

558
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:36,364
We both know there's no talking to her
she's so damned stubborn.

559
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,734
So what do we do?

560
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:41,534
Stop her.

561
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,827
You know what happens
if we don't.

562
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:47,707
That Ferarri gets repoed,
condos emptied out.

563
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:51,189
You move into the state pent.

564
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:57,349
I can't. Not to her.

565
00:33:57,914 --> 00:34:01,008
Scott.

566
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:06,621
You remember us standing here a week
ago talking about your future? / Yeah.

567
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:09,901
- What's your future like?
- A hot air balloon.

568
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:13,045
And what did you say you would do
if anything got in your way?

569
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:17,958
If any sandbag started
dragging you down?

570
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:21,653
- I said...
- Go on.

571
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:26,205
I said whatever it is
I'll chop that mother off.

572
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:38,712
I guess I wanted to see her
get knocked down a peg.

573
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:42,419
But she didn't get knocked
down a peg, Geraldine.

574
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,475
- She got killed.
- I know.

575
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:51,744
She was killed with Coleman's
medication. You know that, too?

576
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:54,560
Yes.

577
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,049
I keep track of his persrciptions.

578
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,645
I refilled that one
just before that meeting.

579
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:02,909
And?

580
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,839
In the afternoon it was gone.

581
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,177
Packing up, Scott?

582
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,708
That never looks good.

583
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,053
I'm just going for the weekend.

584
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:23,714
We know about you and Coleman.

585
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:27,173
Know? / That you were shorting stock
together behind Amy's back.

586
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:30,260
H.G. Friday ring any bells?

587
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,663
Then Amy found out
and was gonna report you.

588
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:37,591
Always one step behind,
aren't you, Scott?

589
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,571
Well now's your chance
to get ahead.

590
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,042
Cause we're talking to you first
before Coleman.

591
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,665
I don't have anything to say.

592
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:47,289
Really? Cause I'm guessing
Coleman's fancy lawyers

593
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,817
are gonna be saying
you stole his meds. / No.

594
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:52,906
Oh, he'll sell you out as easy as
you two sold out Amy.

595
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:54,661
He went to her first, Scott.

596
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:56,148
D'you know that?

597
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:59,008
Tried to cut you out
but she said no. She was loyal.

598
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:03,286
You don't have to tell me
how much better than me Amy was.

599
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,879
That's something I knew all about.

600
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,353
Is that why you did it?

601
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:12,777
Sick of always coming up
a little short next to her? / No.

602
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:15,439
I was trapped.

603
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,669
I couldn't face jail.

604
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:23,021
And I couldn't face her finding out.

605
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,215
Coleman said it would be fast.

606
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:27,838
That he knew it would work.

607
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,438
Yeah, because he did it to his wife.

608
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,895
He told me I'd be a natural.

609
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:40,394
Said all I had to do was talk.

610
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,577
Still do this every morning
by yourself?

611
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:53,494
Why? Did you think
about joining me? / No.

612
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:56,860
I get enough of workouts just looking at you.

613
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:04,443
I came to say the Superbowl ad was
dumb./ We didn't know it wouldn't work.

614
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:08,078
I went about it wrond,
I should've worked with you.

615
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,512
Thanks.

616
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,282
Peace?

617
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:19,835
I know you don't like
to buy them for yourself.

618
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:29,552
- Lionstaff was a good idea.
- It was?

619
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,433
We struck out on this one.

620
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:36,231
We got stuck with a bad guy.
But it's OK.

621
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,226
Yeah?

622
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:41,024
We just have to choose
our partners better next time.

623
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:46,951
- I mean if you want to.
- Sure.

624
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:48,694
It'll be back to the garage.

625
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:52,334
You and me that's
how we work best anyway.

626
00:37:57,918 --> 00:38:01,289
You know, when I first started
coming here it was for Gage.

627
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,934
To think about him.

628
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:10,262
But lately I started letting myself
notice everything that's alive, here, now.

629
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:13,730
And there's so much.

630
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:20,122
I still love him but I think maybe
now I'm ready to

631
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:22,587
start having
my own life, you know?

632
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:26,655
- That's good.
- Yeah.

633
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:33,403
So, thanks for stickin' with me.

634
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:46,330
- Amy.
- Yeah?

635
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,193
See you in the office.

636
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:55,984
See you.

637
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:08,694
