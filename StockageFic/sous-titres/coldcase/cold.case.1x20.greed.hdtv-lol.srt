2
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:05,578
Well. To boys,

3
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:08,134
Here's to
buying cheap and

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,511
selling dear.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,604
Selling?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,852
I sold our positions in Navrax

7
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,025
right before the plummet.

8
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:18,165
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Couldn't risk the leak.

9
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:19,700
Timing is everything.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,568
Had to get out
before the lemmings.

11
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:24,349
- There he is.
- The Kipster.

12
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,034
- We have a problem.
- What now, kiddo?

13
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,688
- We're celebrating.
- It's important.

14
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,172
Everything's important to you, Kip.

15
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:31,330
And nothing is important to you.

16
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:33,877
The mouse roars.

17
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,864
People are losing their
shirts on Navrax.

18
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:37,453
Well, I got my shirt.

19
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,819
Ascot Chang, it's tailor-made.

20
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:41,348
Please, Charlie.

21
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,424
- We have to talk.
- All right, all right.

22
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:46,037
Sit down.
Take a load off.

23
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,562
Keep 'em coming, Vicky.

24
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:51,531
Yes, sir, Mr. Danville.

25
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:57,113
Nice tail on that one.

26
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:06,647
To lives of quiet desperation

27
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:09,115
and not leading them.

28
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,901
Thanks for coming.

29
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,787
You could've just 
cancelled over the phone.

30
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,988
Cancel? And miss the chance 
of seeing Tripod and Cyclops?

31
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,291
Who says you're gonna see them?

32
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,451
I'm an optimist.

33
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,989
So, um, this guy is a friend of 
my older brother's, Randy Price.

34
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,634
Got in the jam with the SEC, FBI.

35
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,924
Enron type scandal.
Now he wants to cut a deal.

36
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:08,160
He's got something 
on the homicide?

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,993
Charles Danville, 1985.

38
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:13,407
- Never heard of him.
- Big financial wizard back in the day.

39
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:17,171
Now Randy is in danger of going 
the way of Martha Stewart.

40
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,399
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,553
Get your feet off my desk and 
your ass out of my chair, Randy.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,151
Geez, Kite.

43
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,864
Is that any way to 
treat an old pal?

44
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:34,111
Detective Rush,
Randy Price.

45
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,468
You're a homicide detective?

46
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,356
I gotta start committing
some real crimes.

47
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,158
Enough of this white collar crap.

48
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,125
You got something
you wanna tell me, Randy?

49
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,763
I've got something amazing.

50
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:52,631
I know who killed Charles Danville.

51
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,736
Okay, fine.

52
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:58,106
You don't wanna solve the murder of 
one of the biggest names on Market Street,

53
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,485
I can take this
info elsewhere.

54
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:00,432
Door's that way.

55
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:02,966
You told me this lady was
top notch, Kite.

56
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,291
She is.

57
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,363
Look, detective.

58
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:11,537
Before all this unpleasantness
with SEC occurred,

59
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,616
I was senior vice president 
of mergers and aquisitions.

60
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,586
I'm really busy, Randy.

61
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:23,336
Two weeks before Danville was killed, 
I was in the john of this hotel.

62
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:30,148
Son of a bitch,
you lost it all.

63
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:31,727
- Do I know you?
- Stu Livermore.

64
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,273
I invested 50 grand in Bentech 
and now look at this.

65
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,654
It's worthless.

66
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,615
You run the dry cleaners.

67
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,113
You begged me to let you invest.

68
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:42,678
Because you were supposed to be 
the big shot with all the inside information.

69
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,069
Well, did you read
the perspectives?

70
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,193
Because it clearly states
the risks involved.

71
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,414
I need that money back.

72
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,840
All right, all right.

73
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,543
Stu, is it?

74
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:53,754
Maybe,

75
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:57,540
just maybe if I pull a few strings, 
I can get you into Navrax.

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,002
What's Navrax?

77
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,165
It's a sure thing.

78
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:03,455
You already wiped me out, remember?
I don't have any more money.

79
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,872
- You must think I'm really stupid.
- Not stupid, desperate.

80
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,752
And Navrax is your way out.

81
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:11,218
Trust me.

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,706
Don't let me pressure you.

83
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:14,910
- You sure about this Navrax?
- Hey,

84
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,752
ou got a better way out?

85
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:19,035
Take it.

86
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:26,041
I got a life insurance policy.
It's worth about 10 grand.

87
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,380
But I warn you.

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,966
This Navrax bombs,

89
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,710
you're gonna pay with your life,

90
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,986
trust me.

91
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,663
What happened to Navrax?

92
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,137
It crashed and burned.

93
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:40,427
Two weeks after Livermore invested.

94
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,323
Same time Danville got killed.

95
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,229
I told you it was good.

96
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,135
Well, why didn't you let the
cops know about it back then?

97
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,895
How would I profit from that?

98
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,854
I was saving it for a rainy day.

99
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,730
And now, it's pouring.

100
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,741

110
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,725
Theory in '85 was 
a car jacking gone wrong.

111
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:34,275
Danville's body was found 
in an alley off the Market Street.

112
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,584
I remember Danville.

113
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,102
He was all over the business 
section back in the '80's.

114
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:42,814
His Delorean was found the next day
in Ardmore, 20 miles away.

115
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:44,362
Junked and stripped.

116
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:46,675
Lotta high end cars got 
jacked in '85.

117
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:50,389
Yeah, they busted a ring of guys for 
exporting car parts overseas that year.

118
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,496
Details of the theft match
up with the MO in all the others,

119
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,164
except this one
left a victim.

120
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,324
And that pal of Kite's,
Randy Price..

121
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,576
A '80's throw back,

122
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,973
a real Market Street, 
'greed is good' type.

123
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,417
But he's got information?

124
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,290
This story about Livermore waving 
that gun around is pretty interesting.

125
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,907
Maybe Livermore shot Danville,

126
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,023
took the Delorean to 
make it look like a car jacking.

127
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:11,630
Scotty and I'll track down Livermore, 
see what he has to say.

128
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,913
Want me and Vera to go talk
to the last-to-see?

129
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,115
- Who was it?
- Victoria Jordan,

130
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,223
bartender at a place
called Arbitrage.

131
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,870
I've been there
with my stockbroker.

132
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,348
You're in the market, boss?

133
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,162
Half of America is, Lil.

134
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:26,198
Not my half.

135
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,459
I'll give my broker a call,

136
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,157
see what he know about Danville
and company he used to work for.

137
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,186
Stu Livermore?

138
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:44,725
Detectives Rush
and Valens.

139
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,261
Hey, finders keepers.

140
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,029
It ain't illegal colllecting
discarded tickets.

141
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,512
We wanna talk to you
about Charles Danville.

142
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,703
Danville.

143
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,669
That lying huckster ruined my life.

144
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,258
We heard.

145
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,298
You been talking to my ex.

146
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,465
She told us 
where to find you.

147
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:03,154
You had a run-in with him
June, 7th, 1985.

148
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,189
Swore that if  Navrax bombs,
you'd kill him.

149
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,189
That's right.

150
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,009
What?

151
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,372
You think I made
good on that threat?

152
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,876
You shoved the gun to his chest.

153
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,441
Should've fired it too.

154
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,368
But instead I invested
another 10 grand with him.

155
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,812
Two weeks later,
that was gone too.

156
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,206
Mr. Livermore?

157
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,389
Hey. Kip Krowley,
I'm an associate of Mr. Danville's.

158
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,434
I don't want an associate,
I want Danville.

159
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:33,169
Mr. Danville is
extremely busy. / Yeah,

160
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,698
busy robbing on 
his people like me.

161
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:37,689
I went to the headquarters
in Navrax Corporation.

162
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,836
You know what I found?

163
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:40,409
One..

164
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:43,220
One old lady in an 8-by-10 
office answering the phone.

165
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,593
That's Navrax.

166
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:47,475
An old lady with a phone.

167
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,210
You..You must be mistaken.

168
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,571
No mistake. / Well, I'm sure 
that there's an explanation.

169
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,594
That money was going to 
pay for my children's education.

170
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:58,407
My wife's gonna leave me.

171
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,825
I'd kill myself,
but that wouldn't do any good.

172
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,773
I've already cashed in 
on my life insurance.

173
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,294
Hey, I..

174
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,210
I'm very sorry.

175
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,276
Please, I'm begging you.

176
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:17,115
If I don't get that money back.

177
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:19,474
Just.. you give me your number, 
Mr. Livermore, okay?

178
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:23,413
I personally gurantee Mr. Danville
will look into this and call you.

179
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,007
- When?
- End of the day.

180
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:27,464
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

181
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:30,201
I give you my word.

182
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,524
I was sitting by the phone
all that day like a chump

183
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:40,619
waiting for that kid to come through.

184
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,261
I got the brush-off.
I finally went to bed.

185
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,486
And I saw the story on
the morning news.

186
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,718
But you never got 
your money back?

187
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,871
Guess I could've hired a lawyer,

188
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,559
try to sue, you know, 
if I had a cent to my name.

189
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,063
But I didn't.

190
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,027
Still don't.

191
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,241
You were the last person 
to see Charles Danville alive?

192
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,175
Yeah, around two am.

193
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,431
Saw him walk out that door
like every night.

194
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,769
Anyone with him?

195
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,534
Nope.
Lost Boys left earlier.

196
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,002
Lost Boys? / Yeah.

197
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,612
Danville had a group of young
boys that worshipped him.

198
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,438
Fed his ego. / From Collins Brothers,
the firm where he worked?

199
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:21,824
They wished.

200
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,962
Danville's boys weren't Ivy League.

201
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,269
They were wannabes.
On the outside looking in,

202
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,136
until Danville took pity on them
about a month before he died.

203
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,585
He had met them before? / No,

204
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,748
not that I knew of at least,

205
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:38,702
but he got real friendly, real fast.

206
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,696
Wonder when
I'll ever be those boys.

207
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,609
Yeah. Galaxy far far away.

208
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,152
Go get some stock tips.

209
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:54,586
Holy crap,
that is Charles Danville.

210
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,082
He's.. he's coming our way.

211
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:58,948
Be cool.

212
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,271
Mr. Danville.

213
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,903
Can we buy you a drink?

214
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,950
You guys from Blaine?

215
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,761
Yeah, but how could you tell?

216
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:10,885
Well, to start,

217
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,426
You're dressed like 
used car salesmen,

218
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,988
you're at the bar, because

219
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,118
you can only 
afford an appetizer

220
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,543
and you're gawking at the swells

221
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,668
like they're different species.

222
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,727
Which they are.

223
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,185
Except for me.

224
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:29,460
I used to work in a sweat shop 
just like Blaine back in the day.

225
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,874
Cold caling chumps for
ten dollar commissions.

226
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,899
So how did you get to 
where you are?

227
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,172
Cajones.

228
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,971
Big brass ones.

229
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,961
You guys got 'em?

230
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,698
Yeah, we got going it. Yeah.

231
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:45,928
Good. Cause if you're hungry,
maybe I can help you out.

232
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,606
Seriously?

233
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,721
I'm putting together a bond offering 
for a company called Navrax.

234
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,098
You know Navrax?

235
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,931
Yeah, of course.

236
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,297
Navrax is awesome.

237
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,448
You're crappy liars.

238
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:00,913
But you'll get better.

239
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:04,073
Stick with me, I'll teach you 
how to sell snow to eskimos.

240
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,743
You'll be millionaires 
by the end of summer.

241
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,585
Interested?

242
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,877
Yeah.

243
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,629
Why would a big shot like Danville 
wanna associate with nobodies?

244
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:19,445
Maybe he saw himself 
in those boys.

245
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,901
Maybe he was just slumming.

246
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:23,150
All I know was,

247
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,979
the day he died, we got stuck 
with 11 thousand dollar tab.

248
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,364
11 grand,

249
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:29,963
worth more than my car.

250
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,877
- Way more.
- Owner of the Arbitage at the time,

251
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,507
he thought Danville was
made of money.

252
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,746
Just too busy to get 
around to paying it.

253
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,246
Me, I would never 
have let that happen.

254
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:42,846
- The owner still around? 
- Sold the place, to me.

255
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,203
And I don't give credit to no one.

256
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,070
Four bucks.

257
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:53,012
So Mackie's your broker, huh?

258
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,096
He told you where to find me?

259
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:58,287
So Danville worked for you
for what, six years?

260
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,938
Something like that.

261
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,951
Thought he got killed
in the car jacking.

262
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,207
Well, we're taking 
another look at that.

263
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,804
My detectives talked 
to a woman at the Arbitrage

264
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,463
and said the guy was a louse,

265
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,126
welched on his debts.

266
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:13,013
- Sounds about right.
- I thought Danville was a heavy hitter.

267
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:14,571
Rolling in dough.

268
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:16,022
For a while.

269
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:19,132
Then he hit a losing streak.
Every stock he hyped went in the toilet.

270
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,232
That's why we fired him.

271
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,416
Fired?

272
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,007
Wasn't he still the employee
of the Collins Brothers when he died?

273
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,214
On paper, he was.

274
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,920
But he begged us to let 
him stay unsalaried

275
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,288
until he can get another gig going.

276
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,356
So Danville was on the ropes.

277
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:37,917
Day he died, we had to cover 
about half a mil of his debts

278
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,657
to protect the firm's reputation.

279
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:41,453
Keep up the appearances.

280
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:45,105
And keep the authorities off 
our backs checking records.

281
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:47,692
Fat lot of good 
it did us considering

282
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,456
I got popped for insider trading.

283
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,138
Well, it could've been worse.

284
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,846
You could've ended up like Danville.

285
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:56,207
Broke? / Dead.

286
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,294
So Danville's broke
but still playing the big shot?

287
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,506
Yeah, scrambling to get the
Navrax deal off the ground

288
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,454
while his reputation's still intact and

289
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,562
he still had an office
at Collins Brothers.

290
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:14,758
So this guy's all tabbed out,
but he's still got a corporate apartment,

291
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,738
tab in the five star restaurant 
and a Delorean to push around?

292
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:19,108
How do I get this job.

293
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,944
Now, how come the assigned didn't look 
at the disgruntled investors for this?

294
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:25,522
- Car jacking theory looked solid.
- Collins Brothers covered for Danville.

295
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,354
They erased the 
paper trail of his debts.

296
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,965
And plus white collar criminal
ususally get sued, not shot.

297
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:33,456
So, maybe the doer isn't 
your typical investor.

298
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,174
Let's check the SEC records.

299
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:38,114
See if anyone with a criminal
record bought shares with Navrax.

300
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,344
We'll go talk to Danville's
old associates.

301
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:43,444
The Lost boys. / Start with the kid that 
was supposed to get back to Livemore.

302
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:44,380
Kip.

303
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,296
Kip Krowley?

304
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:52,897
Detective Rush and Valens.

305
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:54,423
It's about Charles Danville.

306
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,050
Charlie Danville?

307
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,391
That was a life time ago.

308
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:59,502
We've been talking to an old
associate of yours,

309
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:02,152
- Randy Price.
- Oh yeah, I read about Randy.

310
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:04,058
He's in trouble with the SEC, huh?

311
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:06,406
He says Stu Livermore 
threatened Danville's life.

312
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,514
No kidding.

313
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,108
We know you dealt with Livermore 
in '85 running interference for Danville.

314
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,956
But you never told 
the cops about that.

315
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,213
Well, Charlie was killed 
in a car jacking.

316
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:16,916
What would Livermore
have to do with that?

317
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,831
Did you know he pulled
a gun on Danville

318
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,904
two weeks before his death?

319
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,369
No, I didn't.

320
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,200
I just felt bad for the guy.

321
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,139
Did you talk to him?
Is he making out?

322
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,946
He's collecting used tickets
off the floor at the OTB.

323
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,942
That's a shame.

324
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:38,602
I tried to talk to Charlie 
about him the night that he died.

325
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:42,287
To lives of a quiet desperation.

326
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,101
And not leading them.

327
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,692
So, kiddo.

328
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,913
What's so important that can't wait?

329
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,476
I went to the headquarters
at the Navrax Corporation.

330
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:02,616
- This about the drycleaner mope?
- Livermore.

331
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,576
And he was right.
It's nothing.

332
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,624
Nothing. It's an old lady 
answering phones.

333
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:07,766
So?

334
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,884
It's the idea that counts.

335
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:11,190
Not the the brick and mortar.

336
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,463
Charlie.

337
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,821
I promised Livermore that 
you would call him.

338
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:15,932
I personally guaranteed..

339
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,570
Don't promise things, kiddo.

340
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,730
Can you help him?

341
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,333
Please.

342
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,616
For me.

343
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,351
That's good.

344
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,635
Kip.

345
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,228
Going for the heart like that?

346
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,501
I actually have taught you something.

347
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:34,599
So you will talk to him? / No.

348
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:35,854
Hey,

349
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:37,969
I'm a heartless bastard, remember?

350
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,810
No, you're not.

351
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,903
You are too good to be true.

352
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:47,426
Kiddo, have a drink.

353
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,107
Lighten up.

354
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:57,140
That was the last time that I saw him.

355
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,129
I walked to the train and
went to my mom's.

356
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:04,366
Danville sounds like he was telling the 
truth about being a heartless bastard, huh?

357
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,763
Nah, that was just his way.

358
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:08,845
He was training me to be like him.

359
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,906
Were you upset when he died?

360
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,948
Broken up.

361
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:14,200
Like I said,

362
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,159
he was trying to 
teach me to suceed.

363
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:20,439
Wasn't his fault I couldn't
cut it in his world.

364
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,548
These are records from the SEC.

365
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:29,703
About 4000 people invested
in Navrax back in '85.

366
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,528
Most for a thousand bucks or so.

367
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,882
And only a dozen 
went in for 25 grand.

368
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,428
Anyone with a record?

369
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,071
Yeah, one. 
Teddy Mars.

370
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:40,072
Served 5 years for dealing 
cocaine in the late '80's.

371
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:43,950
And another three for manslaughter,
broke a guy's neck in Frackville.

372
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:47,577
How does a ?? like Mars get into 
business with a highroller like Danville.

373
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,733
If he was selling 
cocaine to Danville.

374
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,133
Danville was broke.

375
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,848
Maybe there was 
some bartering going on.

376
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,951
And cocaine for stocks?

377
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:58,183
- And if those investments tanked?
- Mars would come collecting.

378
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,391
The old fashioned way.

379
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:03,533
Check with his parole officer
see if he's got a good address.

380
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,089
Teddy Mars.

381
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:16,155
Wanna talk to you about 
Charles Danville.

382
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,149
You ain't Vice.

383
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,832
And you don't look like Narcs.

384
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:26,952
Homicide. / You invested 25 grand in the 
complany Danville was selling called Navrax.

385
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,946
Hold up.

386
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:31,588
Let me get my lawyer down here.
We can have a real nice pow wow,

387
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:32,607
just the four of us.

388
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,563
While you're on the line,
we'll talk to your boys over there.

389
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:38,943
- What boys?
- The ones that are dealing for you?

390
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,567
You got me wrong detectives.

391
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,408
I'm an artist now.

392
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,339
Suit yourself, Teddy.

393
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,358
With what they're holding,
you're coming with us.

394
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:50,531
So how'd you get 
involved with Danville?

395
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:52,109
That ain't a secret.

396
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,765
For a time I supplied
all the joints in Market Street.

397
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:57,977
- Including Arbitrage?
- Especially Arbitrage.

398
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,712
Them Brooks Brothers types
liked to party.

399
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,591
Teddy.

400
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,547
You should get on 
this Navrax.

401
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:17,100
- Make some fortune.
- You wanna taste the merchandise?

402
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,451
How much for the whole ounce?

403
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,131
Boys deserve a treat.

404
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,691
Ounce is three grand.

405
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,314
You already owe me ten.

406
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:25,578
You know what,

407
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:28,427
I'm gonna cut you in on
this Navrax deal for 25 thousand.

408
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:30,261
Couple of months,
it'll be worth twice that,

409
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,740
- maybe three times.
- Yeah, you do that.

410
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,306
After you pay me 
the 13 grand in cash.

411
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,868
I'll give that think through. / Teddy,

412
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,160
- this Navrax is like money in the bank.
- You don't got it, do you?

413
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,041
I'm offering you 25 grand
in bonds for 13.

414
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,893
Give me your Rolex.

415
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,557
Teddy, come on.

416
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,002
Imma take your watch

417
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,063
and your worthless paper.

418
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,596
But 24 hours,

419
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:09,392
I want my 13 K in cash.

420
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,330
So did you get your money?

421
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,984
Next day.

422
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,942
One of Charlie's boys
delivered a briefcase full of green.

423
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,312
You happen to remember 
who gave you the money?

424
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:21,077
Yeah, the pretty boy.
Beau something.

425
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,038
Look, if you don't believe me, ask him.

426
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,943
He'd tell you.
I got paid.

427
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:28,027
I didn't kill Charlie.
Cuz I had no reason to.

428
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:31,719
I may have met a Mr. Mars
back in the '80's.

429
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,267
I couldn't say for sure.

430
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,705
We're Homicide, Beau.

431
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:38,057
- Not Narcotics.
- Or the SEC.

432
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:42,328
Well, then.

433
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,437
Hell, yeah, I remember Teddy.

434
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,781
He was our supplier.

435
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,192
Did Danville send you to him 
with a briefcase full of money?

436
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:49,081
Yeah.

437
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,873
And he was pissed about it too.

438
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,682
We were coining it on Navrax,

439
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:56,381
but Charlie hated to
part with the actual cash.

440
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:57,539
So why did he?

441
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:01,074
Cuz Charlie could take the heat 
from the blue ?? ladies or ??.

442
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,246
But Teddy Mars was 
a different story.

443
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:06,410
So you knew Danville was a swindler?

444
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,283
I looked the other way.

445
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:12,309
You any other investors that
might want to see Danville dead?

446
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:13,328
Investors?

447
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,330
No.

448
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,901
Then who?

449
00:20:19,464 --> 00:20:21,584
After I gave Teddy the cash,

450
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:24,418
I went back to Charlie to
return his Rolex.

451
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:35,254
Our brave boy,
back from the trenches.

452
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,824
The guy scared the piss out of me.

453
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:42,410
Sit down,
take a load off.

454
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:49,989
Help yourself.

455
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:52,332
Thanks.

456
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,238
I got your watch back.

457
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,654
I want you to keep it.

458
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:08,077
Token of my appreciation.

459
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,282
Seriously.

460
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:14,900
You're the one, Beau.

461
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,974
You're the one who's
gonna make it big.

462
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,916
I am? / I don't think 
the others have what it takes.

463
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,506
But you,

464
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:27,037
you know what it takes.

465
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,668
Don't you?

466
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:34,311
That's when I got out.

467
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,921
Danville hit on anyone else
you know of?

468
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,952
He hit on all of us.

469
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:41,014
If you wanted to succeed with Charlie, 
you play by his rules.

470
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:42,926
And that meant sleeping with him?

471
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,393
If you wanted to get ahead,

472
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:46,179
that's what it meant.

473
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,391
Want a deal, Randy,
you start talking.

474
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:59,228
And you tell all.
No more saving for a rainy day.

475
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,454
Livermore didn't kill Danville.

476
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,633
I know what I heard.

477
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,174
You know what we heard?

478
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:05,704
Danville liked boys.

479
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,337
Young ones.
Up-and-comers, like you.

480
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:10,459
He hit on you, Randy?
Cuz he hit on Beau.

481
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,335
Yeah, but Beau didn't kill him.

482
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:13,796
He's got an alibi.

483
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,776
He was at his girlfriend's
the night Danville got dead.

484
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:18,573
But you, you don't 
have a alibi, do you?

485
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:21,368
Wait a minute.
You think I killed Danville?

486
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,458
That's insane.

487
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,835
So, you like biting the pillow.

488
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,560
You didn't get horizontal
to make it to Homicide?

489
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,428
Guy's worthless.

490
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:33,999
This deal's off.

491
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,222
Okay, okay.
Cool your jets.

492
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,146
God.

493
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,191
Did I service Danville to get ahead?

494
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,043
Yeah, so what?

495
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:47,914
So maybe you felt 
humiliated by that.

496
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:50,541
Decided to gun down the man
who made you catch for him.

497
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,738
I did what I had to do.

498
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,420
- Big deal.
- You got anything more on Danville,

499
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,913
you wanna say it right now, Randy.
Cuz your deal is going south, fast.

500
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,317
Okay.

501
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:05,485
All right.

502
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,864
This is the entire truth.

503
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,139
Well, that's big for Randy.

504
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:12,865
I met Danville earlier 
than I said before.

505
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,153
How much earlier?

506
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:16,700
Little more than a month 
before he was killed.

507
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,498
You want a ride?

508
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,206
Hey, you're Charles Danville.

509
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,715
That's right.

510
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,750
And you work for Blaine & Sons.

511
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,466
How do you know that?

512
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:42,626
I used to have a crappy 
umbrella just like that.

513
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:43,950
Hop in.

514
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,546
This is so cool.

515
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,814
Took me hard days 
of work to afford it.

516
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,691
Do you think I'm kidding?

517
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,757
No.

518
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:04,589
You know, I used to work
for a joint like Blaine.

519
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:05,565
- Back in the day.
- Seriously?

520
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:09,208
Till I wised up,
took some risks.

521
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,176
You a risk taker, uh..?

522
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,251
Randy.

523
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,736
Randy Price.

524
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,544
Yeah, I like risk.

525
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:16,820
Good, Randy.

526
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,061
Then I'm gonna 
make you a proposition.

527
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:22,631
I'm gonna create a company
at thin air, sell the hell out of it.

528
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:23,829
Can you do that?

529
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,692
I'm Charles Danville.

530
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:27,705
I can do anything.

531
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:31,754
Still looking for a couple salesmen.

532
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:34,737
You know anyone 
who might be interested?

533
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:41,915
So Danville meeting you,

534
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,295
Kip and Beau at the Arbitrage,
that was a setup?

535
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:46,408
Yep. Worked like a charm, too.

536
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:48,938
And Beau and Kip never knew 
Navrax was bogus?

537
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:50,749
Beau knew it was 
a boiler room scam,

538
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,121
but he didn't care
so long as he making out.

539
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,309
And Kip?

540
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,677
Kip was a fool.

541
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,707
Out of his depth.

542
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:00,550
Believed every word Danville said.

543
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,398
Why'd you keep 
this from us, Randy?

544
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,992
Because it was a crooked deal.

545
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,283
And I'm facing charges of 
invested fraud.

546
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:10,452
Okay, you know what,

547
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,593
I just remembered something.
And this is good.

548
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:13,933
Hey, feel that?

549
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:15,322
It's raining again.

550
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:19,422
Kip Krowley the dummy,
he got his mother to invest in Navrax

551
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:20,572
and she lost a bundle.

552
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:23,001
Oh we've seen the list of investors,
there's no Krowley.

553
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,322
No, Danville told me she invested.

554
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,332
He bragged about closing the deal.

555
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,064
Hey, your boyfriend in there
was telling the truth.

556
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,616
It's too bad.

557
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,724
Kip's mum did invest in Navrax.

558
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:38,760
She went by Mavis Breen,
not Krowley.

559
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
How much'd she drop?

560
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,880
50 grand.

561
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,290
That's worth a conversation.

562
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,370
What? You got plans?

563
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,466
Kind of.

564
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,143
You got plans?

565
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:53,227
You kidding?
I'm married.

566
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:55,328
I'd take any excuse
not to go home.

567
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:59,679
I wish you boys would've
given me some warning.

568
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,563
Would've made myself presentable.

569
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:06,273
We just wanted to ask you
about Navrax, Mrs. Breen.

570
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,878
Mavis, please.

571
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:10,609
I'm divorced.

572
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:14,660
Can you tell us how you came
to invest in the company, Mavis?

573
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,249
You'd have to 
ask Kip anout Navrax.

574
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,927
Well, we'd rather talk to you.

575
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:22,836
Kip isn't in any trouble, is he?

576
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,656
Cuz if he is,
it's my fault.

577
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,657
And how does that work?

578
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,526
Well, when it comes to men,

579
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:32,163
I make terrible choices.

580
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:35,692
And poor Kip had to suffer
through my divorces ??

581
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:37,134
all four of them.

582
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:39,943
So, about Navrax,

583
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,448
Kip told you to invest?

584
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:44,791
He knew I had some money in 
the bank from my last settlement.

585
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,264
He just wanted to help me grow it.

586
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,292
Did you ever meet Charles Danville?

587
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,639
He took Kip and me to dinner.

588
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,808
You know, to make his pitch.

589
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:56,476
Chin chin.

590
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,221
What is this?

591
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,056
Well, that is called sushi, Ms. Breen.

592
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,270
Oh, it's Mavis.

593
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,568
Why isn't it cooked?

594
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:18,065
Oh, it's cutting edge.

595
00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:20,479
Raw's the next big thing.

596
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:23,343
Well, I prefer chicken teriyaki.

597
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,984
Mum., Charlie has a great
investment opportunity for you.

598
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:32,328
It's a company called Navrax, Mavis.

599
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,345
High tech.

600
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:36,063
Japanese are interested 
in investing, right, Charlie?

601
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:39,071
But I promise you 
it has nothing to do with sushi.

602
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,867
Charlie's a genious, mum.

603
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,170
He's a senior VP at Collins Brothers.

604
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,793
I've heard of Collins Brothers.

605
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,119
I'm old news.

606
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,108
Kip here is the future.

607
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:51,792
No thanks to you, huh?

608
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,995
I may have helped out a little bit.

609
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:56,464
Charlie is my mentor, mum.

610
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:58,890
You flatter me, kiddo.

611
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,435
I certainly appreciate 
your taking interest in my boy.

612
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:07,567
But when it comes to investing,
I'm all for cautious.

613
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,370
Well, your mum's just my lady, Kip.

614
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:13,662
It's obviously going 
to take more than one dinner

615
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:16,094
to get her to see the 
wisdom of investing.

616
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:20,631
So, Danville convinced you?

617
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,036
Eventually.

618
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:24,512
I really invested for Kip's sake.

619
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:27,719
You know, to help 
advance his career.

620
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,148
Lot of good that did.

621
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:31,323
You must've been pretty angry
losing all that money.

622
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,935
- Furious.
- How about Kip?

623
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:34,275
He was devastated.

624
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:36,665
He really believed in that Danville.

625
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:39,444
So in your defense, 
he took revenge on Danville.

626
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:44,010
Oh no, my Kip couldn't hurt a fly.

627
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,853
Me, on the other hand,

628
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:49,719
I wanted to string Danville
up by his lying neck.

629
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:52,355
But of course I didn't.

630
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,387
Man was dad 
before I could buy a rope.

631
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,334
Your friend Price is a real prince.

632
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,991
He's my brother's friend.

633
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,438
And he's always been a low life.

634
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:08,154
Well, he's saint 
compared to Danville.

635
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,740
That's the j.o.b.

636
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,810
We don't get to pick our victims.

637
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,394
So, you

638
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:19,635
wanna go see another
movie tomorrow night?

639
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,776
It's first Thursdays, tomorrow.

640
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:24,167
First what?

641
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:27,357
First Thursday of every month,
the homicide detectives get together,

642
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:29,824
- retired and active.
- To do what?

643
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,108
Talk.

644
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,447
Drink.

645
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:34,141
Sounds fun,
bring me along.

646
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,172
I don't know, Kite.

647
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,100
You're not in the Hat Squad.

648
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,431
You guys have more weird 
names for yourselves.

649
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:43,629
It's usually just cops.

650
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:47,843
Well, I'm a friend of a cop.

651
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,309
You wanna see the girls?

652
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,910
Met your mum, Kip.

653
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,430
You did. / Heard how she lost 
a cool 50 K to Navrax.

654
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh boy. / You forgot to 
mention that to us, did ya.

655
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,762
Well, I didn't tell you because I thought 
it would look like I killed Charlie.

656
00:30:21,762 --> 00:30:24,059
- It does.
- And that's just the half of it.

657
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,896
- What do you mean?
- Randy Price, Beau Munger,

658
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:29,212
they say Danville was 
a sexual predator.

659
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:31,233
They said that?

660
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:33,790
Come on, Kip.
Quit the act.

661
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:35,306
You worshipped Danville.

662
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:37,511
Not only did he use you
to get to your mum's money..

663
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,943
He hit on you too.

664
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,995
No.

665
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,928
That's not how it went.

666
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:50,950
You really think I should buy it?

667
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,079
Hell yes, I think you should buy it.

668
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,209
Maybe I should save the money
that we're making off Navrax.

669
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,021
No, no, kiddo.

670
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:59,505
There's plenty more 
where that came from.

671
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,583
- I do love it.
- Then buy it.

672
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,616
You derserve it. / Yeah?

673
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:05,369
I'm really proud of you, you know.

674
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:06,848
You've come a long way.

675
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,094
I don't know.

676
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:11,115
Hey, kiddo,
you stick with me.

677
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,621
You're gonna rule 
Market Street one day.

678
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,066
Follow right in my footsteps.

679
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,052
Come on, kiddo.
Let's grab the bull by its horns.

680
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:21,214
Okay.

681
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:24,376
I gotta tell you something.

682
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:29,352
The car's not the 
only thing that I love.

683
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,462
I love you, too.

684
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:35,293
I love you, too, kiddo.

685
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,661
No, I mean

686
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:42,276
I really love you.

687
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,482
Charlie didn't hit on me.

688
00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:53,023
I hit on him.

689
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:55,185
Now that must've surprised Danville.

690
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:57,830
He was surprised.

691
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:00,421
But then we fell in love.

692
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,186
You buy that Mustang?

693
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,334
Yeah.

694
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:09,036
Charlie and I drove 
all over town in it.

695
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:12,503
I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with him.

696
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,856
So the thought of me killing him

697
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:20,022
is so crazy.

698
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,224
I loved him,

699
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:24,517
I still do.

700
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:36,211
Yeah, Kip said he took trains to 
his mum's the night, Danville died.

701
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,930
- Yeah.
- There's a reason.

702
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,115
I ran all the car jackings 
in June of '85,

703
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:42,754
no mustang is stole in Philly.

704
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,262
But in Montgomery county
where Kip's mum lived..

705
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:48,208
- Cherry red mustang?
- Junked and stripped.

706
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:49,604
- Guess where?
- Ardmore.

707
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,335
Just like all the other 
car jackings.

708
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:53,156
Including Danville's Delorean.

709
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:54,627
Pretty amazing coincidence.

710
00:32:54,627 --> 00:32:56,288
How'd they miss this in '85?

711
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,892
Montgomery County and Philly
were like two separate countries, Scotty.

712
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:03,483
So maybe Kip's playing us
using love as a alibi.

713
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,696
Let's bring the math teacher
in this time.

714
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:07,994
See whether he likes our house.

715
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:10,321
This is wrong.

716
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,851
Why are you doing this to me?

717
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:16,034
- He's excellent.
- Sure you don't teach drama?

718
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:18,405
I'm telling you the truth.

719
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:20,503
I didn't kill Charlie.
Why do you think that?

720
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:23,217
Well, cuz your precious 
cherry red Mustang was car jacked

721
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:24,875
a few days before Charlie was killed.

722
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,739
So you knew exactly how 
to cover up a murder

723
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,355
and make it look like 
a car jacking.

724
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:31,239
Was it spur of the moment, Kip,
or premeditated?

725
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:34,144
I left Charlie at the Arbitrage alive

726
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:36,855
and then I went to the train station
jsut like I told you.

727
00:33:36,855 --> 00:33:38,937
I believe you left the bar, Kip.

728
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:41,364
Then you waited outside for 
Danville to leave.

729
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:43,455
Shot him twice and took off
in his Delorean.

730
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:47,105
- No, that's not what happened.
- So what did happen?

731
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,536
The night he was killed I,

732
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:51,302
I kept at him.

733
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:53,958
I confronted him one last time.

734
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,313
Charlie.

735
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,471
We're having 
a conversation here, Kip.

736
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:03,402
I'm not leaving till we talk.

737
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:12,084
What's bothering you now?

738
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,317
- If you won't help Livermore..
- Get over Livermore.

739
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,904
At least tell me that the 
50 thousand my mum invested,

740
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:19,391
you're not gonna scam her too.

741
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,729
Your mum already received
a return on her investment.

742
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,180
What do you mean?

743
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,040
Ask her.

744
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,745
Charlie, you're really 
confusing me here.

745
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,404
Is, is my mother gonna get 
her money back or not?

746
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,434
No, Kip.

747
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:33,702
She's not.

748
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,220
But she's my mother.

749
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,082
And she is not some stranger
like Livermore.

750
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:41,800
I thought that you cared
about us, I mean me.

751
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,742
I do, kiddo.

752
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:45,160
That's why you need to listen 
to me very closely.

753
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,677
This game ain't for you.
Get out while you're still young.

754
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:49,149
Go back to the sticks.

755
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,547
Become a librarian.

756
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,306
Something more your speed.

757
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,409
You're kidding, right?

758
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,274
I wanted to help you
but you're just not catching on.

759
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:57,217
- Charlie.
- It's over.

760
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,975
- No sale.
- But I love you.

761
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:00,970
Sorry.

762
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,881
So long, kiddo.

763
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:17,298
I left there crying like a baby.

764
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,602
Never saw Charlie again.

765
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:21,794
Says you.

766
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,795
I went to my mum's.

767
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:25,007
Like I told you.

768
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,075
When it comes to alibis,

769
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,135
a mother's pretty close to worthless.

770
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:32,279
I can't confess to
a murder I didn't commit.

771
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:34,532
Why don't you believe me?

772
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:45,846
What are you doing here?

773
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:48,713
Kip's in custody for murder
of Charles Danville, Mavis.

774
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,105
Oh no.

775
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:51,643
No, that's not right.

776
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,495
Kip did not do anything.

777
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:55,303
We know about Kip's car 
getting jacked.

778
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:56,804
So what?

779
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:58,208
That doesn't prove anything.

780
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,803
So you knew about that, too.

781
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:01,041
Well, of course I knew.

782
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,604
Mavis, there are ways of tesifying
that you could help Kip,

783
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,903
reduce his sentence.

784
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,409
He seems like a decent guy
jury will respond to that.

785
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,671
Seems?

786
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,540
That boy's an angel.

787
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,698
All the same, 
he killed a man in cold blood.

788
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:16,456
And left him to die in the road.

789
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:18,686
That boy is an angel.

790
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,773
And,

791
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,678
and Danville

792
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:25,982
was the devil.

793
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,631
I'm sorry, mum.

794
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,047
So sorry.

795
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:34,903
I don't care about the money.

796
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,735
I loved him.

797
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:38,847
I know.

798
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,764
Mum,

799
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:43,481
I really, really loved him.

800
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:48,918
You mean,

801
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,102
you and him?

802
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:56,026
Yeah.

803
00:36:56,026 --> 00:37:00,906
God, he used me and 
spit me out like I'm nothing.

804
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:02,487
He told me that I was..

805
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:07,917
I wasn't cut out for the business
and just go back to the vegetable patch.

806
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,290
It's okay.

807
00:37:10,404 --> 00:37:13,608
It's okay, baby.

808
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,700
It's okay.

809
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:40,053
Hello, Charlie.

810
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,904
Mavis.

811
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:43,276
What are you doing here?

812
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,534
Called the bar,

813
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:47,323
made sure you were
still here and sauced.

814
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,185
What do you want?

815
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,812
You. / Again?

816
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,238
I didn't give you enough
of the workout last night?

817
00:37:57,238 --> 00:37:59,582
Yeah. That was a business.

818
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,843
You had to close a deal.

819
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,786
What, are you sore 
about the money?

820
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:05,583
Forget the money.

821
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,052
I want you.

822
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,026
Look, Mavis, I'm a little tired.

823
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:18,316
Im an adult,

824
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:20,492
I got no one but myself to blame

825
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:24,240
for sleeping with 
a cold blooded reptile like you.

826
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:26,221
But Kip's just a kid.

827
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,319
- He's in his 20's.
- He's a baby.

828
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,130
Look, why don't you just
put the gun away. Okay?

829
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,475
We'll talk the whole thing through.

830
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,196
Sleep with a mother and her son?

831
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:36,683
This is low as it gets.

832
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:39,751
- Kip doesn't have to know.
- He's never gonna know anything.

833
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,329
Just think you got what was
coming to ya

834
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,253
Kiddo.

835
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:31,266
# Cyndi Lauper의 'All Through The Night' #

836
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:36,188
