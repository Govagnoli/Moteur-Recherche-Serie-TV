The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,410
- you got another headache?
- It's nothing.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,470
{\a6}May 08,1998

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,040
Got a new one for the overrated list.
Might even surpass kurt cobain.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,300
- More overrated than the mona lisa?
- Definitely.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,680
Frank lloyd wright?Why is he the architect who gets to be famous?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,500
What the hell is this?I'm supposed to be on a plane to houston.I've got a car...

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,130
I came to you 15 years ago for a job.
Know what you said?

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,310
I don't have time for this crap.
Sit down,harvey.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,760
you said I was a state college punk.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,370
Said you only took wharton,ivy league guys.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,170
Basically called me a loser.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,150
I'm a lot of things,but a loser I ain'T.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,170
- Your point?
- Point is,I just got off the phone with your board.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,880
They've agreed to a buyout offer I made last night.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,490
What?I now own 51% of your company.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,570
That means this state college loser is your boss.

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,560
Guess what?
You're fired,harv.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,710
Now,as for the rest of you on harvey's team,don't worry.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm sure you can find a new home for your malaise and incompetence.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,160
as for...

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,550
how the hell did a seagull get in here?

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,710
you okay?

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,020
excuse me.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,890
- what are you doing here?
- You ever going to call home,jay?

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,420
Busy paying for your next trip to cabo,buttercup.

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,520
So you still haven't talked to dr.Lason about your tests?

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,390
No.

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,080
I did.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,200
It's bad news,jay.

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,690
it's the worst.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,190
everyone's talking about you and that ada.

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,030
- What's to talk about?
- How much you guys "hate" each other.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,570
That's right,we do.

35
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,870
What?

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,440
- Morning,boss.
- Morning.What'd the me want?

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,190
Ever hear of larry kenick?

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,850
So-called angel of death nurse?
Jackson hospital.

39
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,930
Just fessed up to killing six dying patients in the last decade.

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,100
Yeah,took 'em out with heavy doses of morphine.

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,740
Now frannie's reviewing all the other deaths happened on his watch.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,070
- She find something?
- Guy named jay dratton.

43
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,700
40 years old,brain tumor.
Died weeks before anticipated.

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,640
Frannie thinks his narcotic levels were on the high side.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,380
And kenick was his nurse when he suddenly flat-lined.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,930
So maybe he was the angel's seventh victim?

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,420
Or someone really had it in for this dratton.

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,340
Otherwise,why kill someone who's literally on his deathbed?

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,490
where are you going,mom?

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,970
Bars are closed.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Mom,the doctor said if you drink any more,you're going to die.

55
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,060
It's that simple.

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,680
Doctor has it backwards.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,940
I die if I don'T.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,320
- You're staying here.
- Don't bully me,lilly.

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,710
I'm your mother.
I'm not a murder suspect.

60
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,450
I always wondered who that drunk woman was driving me to school.

61
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,510
Well,maybe you should have asked your father for a ride.

62
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,600
If you hadn't sent him packing.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,710
He left.

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,100
I stayed.

65
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,360
Do you remember you used to have those bad dreams?

66
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,120
I would read to you all night just to calm you down.

67
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,230
- I was there,lilly.
- And now you're just making stuff up.

68
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,720
My mother used to work so hard.

69
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,700
Eight hours a day at a department store,and then...

70
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,270
back home,make dinner for us.

71
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,130
I was always so proud of her.

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,180
I'll make some tea.

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,630
I'll stay with you a while.

74
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,990
I'm going to do what I want,lilly.

75
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,410
You can't push me around.

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,830
Fine.
You want to kill yourself?

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,520
There's nothing I can do to stop you.

78
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,120
Jay dratton.

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,560
Hedge fund manager,self-made millionaire.

80
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,360
Living the good life in bucks county.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,330
- Beautiful wife,beautiful house.
- Then cancer hits.

82
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,000
Two months after the diagnosis,guy's on his deathbed.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,360
And he couldn't take those beautiful millions with him.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,470
- Anything hinky in the will?
- No.Wife and son got it all.

85
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,550
Nurse found an open notebook at jay's bedside.

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,540
- The name "louise" on it.
- Girlfriend on the side.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,580
So far,no luck tracking down any louises connected to him.

88
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,990
Well,scotty and lil are out at chester prison,starting with the good nurse kenick.

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,110
Hope they don't cough around him.

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,860
you know,my granddad had als.

91
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,840
Was a boxer,couldn't hold up a spoon in the end.

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,890
Oh,yeah?
Yeah.

93
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,970
Suffered for weeks before he died.
Still don't know the point of that.

94
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,830
Hmm.There's always hope,right?

95
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,530
Well,you know you can put down a dog if it's in pain?

96
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,690
Or a cat.
Yeah.

97
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,030
Why not us?

98
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,090
You like playing god,larry?

99
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,140
No,

100
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,000
but you know what I do like?

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,300
Dignity.

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,420
I've seen men scream when they lose it.

103
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,930
Seen women beg to die with it while they still can.

104
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,450
Well,two of the six people you killed were in a coma.
They weren't begging for anything.

105
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,940
Their brains were cabbage.
No chance of recovery.

106
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,870
That how you felt about jay dratton?

107
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,430
No.
Jay was something else.

108
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,140
If anyone was going to beat cancer by sheer willpower,it was that guy.

109
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,820
But he was losing,in pain.

110
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,450
Patient records show you checked on him an hour before he died.

111
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,430
probably.Then I left to make other rounds.

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,980
- While the morphine kicked in.
- No.

113
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,110
I helped people who had lost their will.

114
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,140
Jay had nothing but will.

115
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,470
So you being his nurse that night--just coincidence?

116
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,200
Lady,I've confessed to helping six people pass on with dignity.I got nothing to hide.

117
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,880
He ever mention someone named louise?

118
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,180
Not to me.But...

119
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,880
he and I weren't exactly chatty.

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
First day I saw the guy,I knew to back off.

121
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,730
Well,jay,you have a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme...

122
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,430
in english,please.

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,420
Tell it like it is,doc.

124
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,720
You have a tennis ball-size tumor in the back of your head.

125
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,130
Okay.

126
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,560
- So we cut it out.
- It's in an inaccessible area.

127
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,930
- You wouldn't,uh...
- spit it out.

128
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,790
- I wouldn't survive the surgery?
- That's right.

129
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,210
Chemo.

130
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,340
Radiation.

131
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,330
Treatment isn't an option.
The cancer has spread to your spine.

132
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,010
At best,you have three months to live.

133
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,180
This is,uh,larry kenick,a nurse in our hospice program.

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,900
a nurse in our hospice program.
He'll be at your beck and call.

135
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,810
Uh,what can we expect to happen?

136
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,320
Short-term memory loss,confusion.

137
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,360
Maybe hallucinations.

138
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,800
- is this what they teach in medical school?
- I'm sorry?

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Giving up like france?

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,050
- You said tell it like it is.
- I did...

141
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,900
and I will.

142
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,460
I'm going to beat this.

143
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,580
It's a simple fact,like today's tuesday.

144
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,410
Like your golf tie is absurd and inappropriate.

145
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,370
I know guys who have survived cancer.
The key is attitude.

146
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,110
Defeat ain't an option.
It's nonnegotiable.

147
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,470
- I'm not saying give up hope.
- Then hope it is.

148
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,780
Put me through the most aggressive treatment possible.

149
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,370
Go crazy.

150
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,650
Write a paper about me.

151
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm sorry I don't have better news.

152
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,100
Jay,why do this to yourself?

153
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,610
- Gee,honey,I was sort of hoping you'd want me to live.
- That's not what I'm saying.

154
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,730
- Bet you're shopping for black dresses in your head right now.
- Jay!

155
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,830
What looks better with crocodile tears: Armani or gucci?

156
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,940
Admit it: You're rooting for the cancer.

157
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,340
Cancer can't get you fast enough,jay.

158
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,830
I hope it hurts.

159
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,260
- Jay always that combative?
- Not to mention the wife.

160
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,340
Classic rich couple.
Had everything,still miserable.

161
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,480
Your alibi sucks,kenick.

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,130
We might be back to hear a little more about dignity.

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh,I'll be here.

164
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,840
The loving wife inherited three million bucks,right?

165
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,750
Maybe the cancer didn't move fast enough for her.

166
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,850
sounds like you and your husband hated the sight of each other,caroline.

167
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,930
Wasn't how it always was,but it's how we ended up.

168
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,230
Then he gets cancer,vows to fight it.

169
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,090
Jay grew up poor in fishtown.
He liked to fight.

170
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,950
And maybe you liked the idea of being a merry widow.

171
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,340
- The sooner the better.
- So you helped the cancer along.

172
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,500
If I hated jay that much,I would've let him suffer,not end his pain.

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,280
Three million bucks says maybe not.

174
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,120
The name louise mean anything to you,caroline?

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,470
No.

176
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,730
I know jay wrote that down,but he wasn't lucid in the end.

177
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,020
And were you with him at the end?

178
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,320
I was at home with my son.
He was grounded.

179
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,550
Guy like jay,with his love of fighting,must have had his share of run-ins.

180
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,840
- It was a daily thing with him.
- Racked up a lot of enemies?

181
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,730
Right into his final days.

182
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,030
No,listen.

183
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,040
Listen to me.

184
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,770
Our offer's not changing.

185
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,350
We got to negotiate with strength.

186
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,220
What are you so afraid of,phil?

187
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,580
Hang on.
Other line.

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,100
phil?

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,390
Yeah,your B...

190
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,230
were on the other line.
They miss you.

191
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,220
Yo.

192
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,500
Mind keeping it down?
I'm trying to give my kid some medicine.

193
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Call you back.

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,820
Rumor is,sick people need peace and quiet.
You're making my daughter feel worse.

195
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,950
And I'm on my second round of chemo,

196
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,940
and I'm walking off a puking spell.

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,040
So you have to do it here?
The hallway isn't public?

198
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,010
Oh,all right.
I'm asking you nice.

199
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,260
Ask me any way you like,chiquita,I'll walk where I want to.

200
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,570
sand.

201
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,650
sand?What are you talking about?

202
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,250
Headache,that's all.

203
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,510
By the way,lady,

204
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,390
your daughter cries all night.

205
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,470
Could you ask her to keep it down?

206
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,160
So that's why no one comes to see you.

207
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,610
- Excuse me?
- Your best friend is a phone,

208
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,800
and when your wife was here last time,she looked annoyed as hell that you were still alive.

209
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,110
Thanks for your observation.

210
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,990
No one's going to give a rat's ass when you're gone.Dying alone's got to be the worst kind of death.

211
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,100
No.The worst kind of death is dying poor in a target shirt.

212
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,160
You should be the one about to pass away.

213
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,580
Not my daughter.

214
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,070
Her daughter had cancer,too?

215
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,800
Brain tumor.
Like jay.

216
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,030
And she was helping with the girl's medication?

217
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,800
A lot of parents do that.
Less scary for the child.

218
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,220
So,amelia was handy with a needle.

219
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,230
If she could give morphine to her daughter,why not jay?

220
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,690
why not jay?

221
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,080
what's up?

222
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,530
It's just my mom didn't come home last night.

223
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,900
Did she go back to her place?

224
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,450
No,super would have called me.

225
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,030
I got some feelers out.

226
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,510
amelia flores?

227
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,490
- Yeah?
- Philly homicide.

228
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,900
Need to talk to you about jay dratton.

229
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,950
why do I wanna talk about that son of a bitch?

230
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,060
Well,there's some confusion,amelia.

231
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,840
- 'Cause your daughter passed away june 21,1998.
- Think I don't know that?

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,550
Yet,june 28th,you're back at the hospital.

233
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,380
Same day that "son of a bitch" jay died from a morphine od.

234
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,760
What gives?
You missing the food?

235
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,400
If someone put that jerk out of his misery,it's news to me.

236
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,500
- Why were you at the hospital,amelia?
- I was back to talk about my bill.

237
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,600
I had no insurance,owed 175 grand.
Had to set up a payment plan.

238
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,350
And did you visit jay while you were there?

239
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,260
Last person I wanted to see was that guy.
But if someone took him out,I say he deserved it.

240
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,890
- Bad blood between you two,huh?
- Seemed like that was his way with everyone.

241
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,100
You ever hear him talk about someone named louise?

242
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,370
Yeah.

243
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,850
The day he went home.

244
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,230
so you're coming home for good,dad?

245
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,700
Hopefully.I'm all done with the chemo treatments.

246
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,270
Now I wait for it to kick in.
'Cause I was gonna have some friends over saturday.

247
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,470
Maybe some other time,okay?

248
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,410
Yeah.

249
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,950
What is...

250
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,010
is that a tattoo?

251
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,500
Yeah,I've had it for like three months.

252
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,960
You lose a bet?
Funny,dad.

253
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,630
You look tired.
Get any sleep last night?

254
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,330
- Not really.
- You out with your buddies?

255
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,960
You know,you got cancer and now you're all interested in my life?

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,540
See if you can get a little more lame,dad.

257
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
I've always been interested.

258
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,670
Yeah?
Okay.

259
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,190
I drove into kensington,scored some blow,

260
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,200
then I hit an after-hours club.

261
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,220
Mom thought I was at the library.

262
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,730
- Tell me you're kidding.
- It's the truth.

263
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,270
Thought you liked that,dad.
Tell it like it is.

264
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,910
Fine,tommy.

265
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,490
I'm cutting you off.
Allowance,trust.Everything.

266
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,370
Good luck buying coke with no job.

267
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,060
Whatever.

268
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,370
And that beamer you want for graduation?

269
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,770
Kiss it good-bye.

270
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,030
I...

271
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,240
there was a woman.

272
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
Louise.

273
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,460
Great.Louise?

274
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,480
Does mom know about her?

275
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,440
sounds like jay was having hallucinations.

276
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,190
Dying people need to shake things out from their past.

277
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,190
They hang on until they make peace with it.

278
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,060
Seems like tommy's another guy who wanted dad to keel over sooner than later.

279
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,700
It means "the good death," you know.

280
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,810
What does?

281
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,850
Euthanasia.
it's greek for "good death."

282
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,020
A guy like that angel of death nurse?

283
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,090
Larry kenick.

284
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,460
After seeing how my daughter suffered--they should give him a medal.

285
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,140
Thanks.
Bye.

286
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,450
She turned up.

287
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,780
There's the girl scout of the year.

288
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,830
Where'd you sleep last night,mom?

289
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,970
My mother always worked so hard for us kids.

290
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,970
I know.

291
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,160
Eight hours at the department store,right?

292
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,910
You were...

293
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,840
you were proud of her.

294
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,070
I was.

295
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm sorry you can't be proud of me,lil.

296
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,250
Mom,you gotta hang on.

297
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,050
You can't fix me this time.

298
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,370
Every day you get a new chance to start over.

299
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,010
I'm out of chances.

300
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,600
No.

301
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,540
It's not too late.

302
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,030
It is,lilly.

303
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,050
It really is.

304
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,330
It's the end.

305
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,220
Hey.

306
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,930
Then I want you to stay with me.

307
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,520
No matter what.

308
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,200
Keep it coming.

309
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,110
Hey.

310
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,160
You'll stay with me,right?

311
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah,I will.

312
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,990
Tommy dratton?

313
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,280
Tom.

314
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,310
Detectives miller and jeffries.

315
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,070
- It's about your father.
- What about him?

316
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,680
It turns out someone killed him before the cancer did.

317
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
- Shot him full of morphine.
- No kidding.

318
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,000
You didn't get along with him,did you?

319
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,790
Not particularly.

320
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,580
In fact two days after his death,you bought a $50,000 car.

321
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,930
Guilty.

322
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,980
Kinda like those beverly hills brothers,

323
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,100
took their dad out to get his money.

324
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,360
Except they hadn't been cut out by him.

325
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,170
Not like you were,tom.

326
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,900
Look,I was at home with my mom on the night he died.

327
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,890
And I didn't have to kill him.

328
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,680
He was already dead in my mind.

329
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,440
So,what happened to the fancy wheels?

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,790
After I spent a few years getting wasted and being pissed at the world,

331
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,950
I finally saw what I was doing.

332
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,940
Repeating history.

333
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,910
One night I looked into my rearview mirror

334
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,420
and saw my dad staring back.

335
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,460
And changed your ways?

336
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,980
- Lost the tat.
- Yeah.

337
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,260
Look,I have a kid now.
I didn't want to be that kind of father.

338
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,040
What do you know about this woman louise?

339
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,540
No idea who she was.

340
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,930
Neither did he.The tumor was doing crazy things to his mind...

341
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,490
Hello?

342
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,070
Hello?

343
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,580
Jay, you ready?

344
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,480
Morning,sunshine.

345
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,210
Dude,

346
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,240
dig the cane,huh!

347
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,030
I'm loving this thing.

348
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,050
When the cancer's gone,I'm gonna keep using it.

349
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,790
- My new trademark.
- What's the latest?

350
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,910
So far,so good.

351
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,900
Out of the hospital a week now.

352
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,770
Feeling better.

353
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,400
Maybe you should take the day off.

354
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,050
The day you slow down is the day they beat you.

355
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,840
But you already won,man.

356
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,970
That's what my father said...

357
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,480
before he was laid off.

358
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,180
Why do you...

359
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,050
why do you have a motel key?

360
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,740
- What are you talking about?
- I saw the motel key.

361
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,180
She kept it?

362
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,140
She?

363
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,500
What are you saying?

364
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,110
- Nothing.
- It's caroline.Isn't it?

365
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,990
- like you care.
- You son of a bitch.

366
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,810
What kind of companies do we like to buy?

367
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,010
Undervalued,underappreciated.
That sound like a woman we know?

368
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,900
- She's my wife.
- It's your fault!

369
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,440
- And you're my best friend.
- You stopped caring about her years ago.

370
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,800
Get out!

371
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,950
Oh,yeah,since I'm the general partner,I'm buying you out.

372
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,160
Say hi to harv on the unemployment line.

373
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,490
- Did your dad buy him out?
- He was in the works.

374
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,490
Papers were supposed to be signed in july.

375
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,850
But jay died first.

376
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,300
Look,I really gotta go pick up my son.

377
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,590
Okay.

378
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,720
Thanks,tom.

379
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,220
Phil plays his cards right,he gets the money and the girl.

380
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,490
And caroline gets a new husband.
One who appreciates her.

381
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,640
But the clock's ticking on phil to lose millions.

382
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,420
Suddenly,killing a dying man,makes a hell of a lot of sense.

383
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,580
So,phil,

384
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,780
you're giving it to jay's wife on the sly,

385
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,930
he finds out,retaliates by cutting you out of your company.

386
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,090
The company I now run?

387
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,330
That one?

388
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,190
You run it because you killed him for it.

389
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,900
Hey,sherlock.

390
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,030
- Jay was days away from croaking.
- But first he was gonna fire you.

391
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,770
And a guy like you has no problem killing a dying man.

392
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,230
You don't know jack about guys like me.

393
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,610
Lot of money at stake for you and your new boyfriend,caroline.

394
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
- Boyfriend?
- Phil.Your husband's partner.

395
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,540
- Risky move.
- That was one night of revenge.

396
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,930
I was trying to get jay's attention.

397
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,900
- Did you?
- Yeah.

398
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,990
He threatened to divorce me.

399
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,730
But by then his heart wasn't in it anymore.

400
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,180
jay.

401
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,950
I've been looking all over for you.

402
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,530
You see the doctor?

403
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,660
Said the tumor's not responding to treatment.

404
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,350
Apparently,the cancer's not interested in my winning attitude.

405
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,190
You gonna do more chemo?

406
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,610
No.It's pointless.

407
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,580
I can barely remember those days.

408
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,230
What days?

409
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,130
When tommy was a baby.

410
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,800
Our one-bedroom apartment in fishtown.

411
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,470
Jay...about phil,

412
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,060
t was one time and it was pathetic.

413
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,340
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

414
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,180
We don't need to pretend that we have something.

415
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,450
Maybe we never did.

416
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,920
And you...

417
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,790
don't have to play the role of faithful wife anymore.

418
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,190
- I mean it.I can die alone.
- Jay...

419
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,540
I have no right to put you through this.

420
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,630
Are they giving you enough medication for your pain?

421
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,990
I'm all right.

422
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,580
It comes and goes.
I mean,I...

423
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,910
I keep having these weird flashes.

424
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,830
- With the headaches?
- Yeah.

425
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm on a beach.

426
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,540
The wind's blowing.

427
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,720
- Sounds peaceful.
- No,it's not.

428
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,350
I think I did something terrible.

429
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,500
First time I'd ever seen jay give up.

430
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,730
He tell you this terrible thing he did?

431
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,810
No.

432
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,480
And I didn't even ask.

433
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,330
We were long past sharing secrets.

434
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,190
Was that your last conversation with him?

435
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,740
Yeah.
Two days later he was gone.

436
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,280
He'd given up on winning and I'd given up on him.

437
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,620
We had it out over caroline.
He made his threat.

438
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,970
That was that.

439
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,930
You weren't worried he would follow through?

440
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,490
He didn't have the energy to buy me out.

441
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,180
The last thing he did was take 175 grand from his slush fund.

442
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,290
He say why?

443
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,440
Just that it was for a woman.

444
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,130
Maybe cancer boy was the one cheating.

445
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,380
Was her name louise?

446
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,250
No.

447
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,440
I don't think so.

448
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,380
How about amelia?

449
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,830
That's it.

450
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,150
Jay dratton was suffering,just like your daughter did.

451
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,520
And didn't you say guys like larry kenick should get a medal?

452
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,250
- Doesn't mean i did what he did.
- You had access to morphine.

453
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,130
You knew how to administer it.

454
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,660
And jay had the 175 grand you needed to pay your hospital bills.

455
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,140
You make a deal,amelia?
To help him die?

456
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,170
I told you I didn't see him that day.

457
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,590
But you did see him again?

458
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,190
I couldn't help my daughter,but I could help him.

459
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,770
but I could help him.

460
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,320
I had six vials of morphine left over.

461
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,110
- That's enough to kill a man.
- I said i wouldn't do it.

462
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,360
But you gave him the vials.

463
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah,the day he died.

464
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,100
I couldn't tell you before.
I knew how it would look.

465
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Yeah.

466
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,620
Like crap.

467
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,820
Even that jerk didn't deserve such pain.

468
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,070
And when was this,amelia?

469
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,700
When he came to see me.

470
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,950
you.

471
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,200
I heard about your daughter.

472
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,030
And...

474
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,010
I'm ashamed...

475
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,030
at my behavior.

476
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,740
I want to help cover any expenses you might have.

477
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,020
no,thanks.

478
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,360
I'm going to leave this check here.

479
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,930
I've been very fortunate in my life.

480
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,890
Please...

481
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,720
let me share it with you.

482
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,660
What's that?

483
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,810
Open it.

484
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,860
I saw your daughter in the hallway one night.

485
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,660
- Keeping you awake again?
- No.

486
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,290
We both couldn't sleep.

487
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,110
She told me...

488
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,980
she saw butterflies in her room.

489
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,650
Hallucinations.

490
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,820
And I told her about mine.

491
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,060
Just talking to her,

492
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,570
she somehow put me at ease.

493
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,120
I didn't deserve it.

494
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,930
thank you.

495
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,700
you want to sit down?

496
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,810
what was it like for her?

497
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,040
Was she lucid?
Was she...

498
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,270
in pain?

499
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,660
She was peaceful near the end,just looking at the butterflies.

500
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,110
Good.

501
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,980
I think they were angels waiting to take her to the other side,to heaven.

502
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,120
I might be headed to a different neighborhood.

503
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,970
hell is only for people who've forgotten how to love.

504
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,620
You can't love anymore?

505
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,950
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

506
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,150
- I keep seeing things.
- The beach?

507
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,200
Yes...
and A...

508
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,490
a woman named louise.

509
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,920
What are you doing there?

510
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,730
I was...

511
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,230
at a motel.
I...

512
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,060
Dad!

513
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,540
tommy was there.
He saw everything.

514
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,000
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No.No,I'm better.

515
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,110
I'll call someone.

516
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,350
What did tommy see on the beach?

517
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,040
I don't know.

518
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,690
But who did jay call to pick him up?

519
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,380
his son.

520
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
He took him back to jackson.

521
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,130
So tommy was on hand in his dad's final hours.

522
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,040
along with six vials of morphine.

523
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,830
yeah,okay,I drove my dad to the hospital.

524
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,940
Different story than you gave before.

525
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,110
- It was years ago.I forgot.
- Oh.

526
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,480
You forget he had six vials of morphine with him,too?

527
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,760
I don't know anything about that.

528
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,900
Something's hinky here,tom.

529
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,640
You didn't forget taking your dad back to the place he died.

530
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,890
You left that out on purpose.

531
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,260
Why?

532
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,760
If I told you,I'd have to remember how I was with him.

533
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
How you were when?

534
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,200
The last time we were together.

535
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,720
Like always,I was blind with hate.

536
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,080
That's just being a teenage kid.

537
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,040
The man was dying in front of my eyes

538
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,510
and I was hard as nails.

539
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,230
Can I go now?

540
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,780
I haven'T...

541
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,740
I haven't been much of a father,have I?

542
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,750
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

543
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,990
Yeah,right.

544
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,490
I know...

545
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,270
you're always pissed off

546
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,500
and I know where you get it,

547
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,130
but you got to let it go.

548
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,630
It's poison.

549
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,110
Isn't the water beautiful,tommy?

550
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,430
Take my hand,tommy.

551
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,540
dad!

552
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,250
- Where'd you go,daddy?
- I had a work phone call.

553
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,850
- You know what I told them?
- What?

554
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,970
I said I'm staying the week out here with my family.

555
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,440
- Work can wait.
- Yeah...!

556
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,650
- Isn't the water beautiful,tommy?
- Yeah.

557
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,500
It wasn't a nightmare.

558
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,690
Remember the week I took off work?

559
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,660
We stayed at the shore

560
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,250
in that crappy motel?

561
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,180
I don't know.

562
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,420
Sure you do.

563
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,900
We were a real family once,tommy.

564
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,270
Promise me you remember.

565
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,880
Do you?

566
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,930
I don't remember a thing.

567
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,250
I know you do.

568
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,190
I-I know you remember.

569
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,170
I should have told him I remembered.

570
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,300
'Cause you did.

571
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,890
So your dad was reaching out in the end.

572
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,860
- You tell your mom that?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,070
And she was so happy.

574
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,630
I mean,she still hated the guy and everything.

575
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,110
Which is it,tom?
Happy or not?

576
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,140
If your mom was happy,

577
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,760
- maybe she went back to make peace with him.
- No way.

578
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,870
- That's what I'd do.
- She didn'T.I told you I was with her that night.

579
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,340
Doesn't make it so.

580
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,450
She went to him.

581
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,170
Didn't she?

582
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,720
Jay sounds like he was a real piece of work.

583
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,570
he was.

584
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,860
Well,some people are like that.

585
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,800
Impossible.

586
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,930
You try to stop caring,you try to write 'em off,but...

587
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,610
it's always there.

588
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,010
That attachment,that...love.

589
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,700
- Not for me and jay.
- No?

590
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,850
No,I didn't love him by the end.
I told you that.

591
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,330
Not even when you heard he'd been talking about that week at the shore?

592
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
- The shore?
- Yeah,the three of you.

593
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,000
At motel louise.

594
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,890
- He was probably just hallucinating.
- No,it was real.

595
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,520
And it's just that kind of memory that won't leave you alone.

596
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,040
Makes you keep loving.

597
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,370
So maybe I did still care.
What's it matter?

598
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,270
I think when you heard jay was talking about that week,

599
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,750
you remembered,too.

600
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,520
Remembered those days when he was a better man.

601
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,690
You heard that and you couldn't stay away.

602
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,520
- Of course you went to him.
- You don't know what I was going through.

603
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,740
I do,actually.

604
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,850
There's someone I...love.

605
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,490
Someone I wish I didn't,but...

606
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,800
I can't stop...

607
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,650
and...

608
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,970
she's dying.

609
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,990
I fought and I scrapped with her for years.

610
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,100
Just when I think I'm done with her,

611
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,750
I remember things.

612
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,050
Like when I was little,

613
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,590
I'd get these nightmares,and she'd...

614
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,390
read  the velveteen rabbit to me.

615
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,720
I felt so safe.

616
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,130
It matters where the heart begins.

617
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,980
You know?

618
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,570
I know.

619
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,470
And when it's the end,

620
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,630
maybe the most we can do for that person is...

621
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,370
help them along.

622
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,430
To get peace.

623
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,810
A peaceful death.

624
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,840
A good death.

625
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,440
I understand if you helped jay die.

626
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,730
But is that ever the right thing?

627
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,050
To help someone who's in pain?

628
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,570
Who you love?

629
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,890
I don't know how that can be wrong.

630
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,300
Do you?

631
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,280
You don't have to be here.

632
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,630
I want to.

633
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,030
Got some new ones.

634
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,150
For my list.

635
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,740
Oh...

636
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,190
the overrated list.

637
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,060
No.

638
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,540
Underrated list.

639
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,010
Underrated?

640
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah,

641
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,840
there's ice water,

642
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,600
and the tv remote.

643
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,470
Those things are magic.

644
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,730
And the sound...

645
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,480
the sound of you laughing.

646
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,660
Very underrated.

647
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,740
I miss it.

648
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,440
tommy told me about the beach.

649
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,280
Louise.

650
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,910
Yes.

651
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,290
I remember,too.

652
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,030
You do?

653
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,810
Yeah,I think somehow along the way,we both forgot.

654
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,450
Promise me...

655
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,340
promise me you'll remember the guy in this picture.

656
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,810
I promise.

657
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,130
And no matter how much time there is,

658
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,010
I'm here now.

659
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,890
I've run out of ways to not...

660
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,430
think about the pain.

661
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,950
Oh...

662
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,080
- jay,no...
- I have no right to ask you.

663
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,080
You're sure?

664
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,100
It's nonnegotiable.

665
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,710
I love you,you know.

666
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,910
I love you.

667
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,890
hey...

668
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,850
you know what I remember most about that motel?

669
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,640
I remember us laying in bed together at night,

670
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,830
and I could...

671
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,410
hear the ocean waves.

672
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,770
Feel a cool breeze move over us.

673
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,940
And I felt...

674
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,920
you next to me.

675
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,140
We were both so in debt.

676
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,420
struggling with our jobs,and..

677
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,090
all I could think was...

678
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,420
"babe,we'D...

679
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,350
we'd already made it.''
