00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:15,271
# Move yourself #

2
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:17,296
# You always live your life #

3
00:00:17,296 --> 00:00:20,792
# Never thinking of the future #

4
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,955
# Prove yourself #

5
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,667
# You are the move you make #

6
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:28,210
# Take your chances win or loser #

7
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,559
This guy should not be on the streets.

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,444
Is it such a big deal?

9
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:34,518
He's twisted.
What if he did that to Gwen?

10
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,856
I just don't see why you have to
be the one to take the stand.

11
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:39,099
There's ten other women.

12
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,021
I want to be the one that stops him.

13
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:52,705
How'd you get so stubborn?

14
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:03,058
Sorry.

15
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:05,955
Are you going to the fires, Daddy?

16
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,084
That's right. pumpkin.

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,800
Daddy's going to the firehouse.

18
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:59,915
Lorraine Lounis.

19
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,991
I'm thinking about a job in '83.

20
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:02,979
She family?

21
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,002
I don't know.

22
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,057
I just gave her a call and send you over.

23
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,067
Thanks, boss.

24
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,323
Lorraine.

25
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,418
Detective Rush.

26
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,375
You worked the old cases?

27
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,648
How can I help you?

28
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:20,912
Uh.. actually it's my fiance's daughter
needs help.

29
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:22,634
She's meet me here.

30
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:23,822
Okay.

31
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,809
She's a really nice girl.

32
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:29,422
She just has some problems.

33
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:32,267
Do these problems have anything to
do with homicide?

34
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,601
Her mother was murdered 20 years ago.

35
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,090
She and her father were
both haunted by it.

36
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,006
Rob doesn't talk about it much.
But....

37
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,586
Gwen is obsessed.

38
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:45,418
And it's making her do crazy things.

39
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,004
Like?

40
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,589
Oh. Here she is...

41
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:51,756
Gwen!

42
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,518
Over here.

43
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,894
I don't know what good this is gonna do.

44
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,890
This detective is going to help us.

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,058
I'm Lily Rush.

46
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,057
You wanna tell me about your mom?

47
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:19,035
Her name is Dana Deamer.

48
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,837
She got killed by Albert Miller.

49
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:25,570
A drainless pervert,
she was about to testify against.

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,791
He exposed himself to Dana.

51
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:33,873
A week before his trial,
a bomb went off in her face.

52
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,961
She leaved her 16 minutes,

53
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,574
then died in our backyard.

54
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:45,109
Miller.. never even got arrested.

55
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,995
- We don't always get them.
- I know.

56
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,755
The first time.

57
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:55,440
He is in jail now for another charge.
But he's about to be paroled.

58
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,040
In three days.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,264
Have you been tracking him for a while?

60
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,567
I just turned 25.

61
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:08,392
That's how old my mom
was when she died.

62
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:11,589
I never realized until now.

63
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:14,409
Just how young that is.

64
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,522
So that's when you looked him up.

65
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:20,113
Ever since then, her behavior
has been a little reckless.

66
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,779
- Lorraine!
- We have to tell her.

67
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,068
She's been calling Albert Miller
in jail, making threats.

68
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,589
- You don't wanna do it, Gwen.
- He killed my mother.

69
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,382
And if nobody's gonna do
anything about that, I will.

70
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:36,298
How much do you remember
about the day it happened?

71
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,071
Just parts of it.

72
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,458
I was only five.

73
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,395
Everybody up?

74
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:56,189
Yes, but Missy has the flu.
So she stays in bed.

75
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:59,028
I'll be right back to braid your hair.

76
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:05,526
Time to braid everybody's hair.
Everyone but poor Missy.

77
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,809
Then I went out to the back...

78
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:24,762
and saw her.

79
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:30,603
I wish I would've never have done that.

80
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:33,512
I'll read your mom's case.

81
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:36,200
If I get new direction,
I'll talk to parole board,

82
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,107
see if they'll hold Miller
to give me time, okay?

83
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,269
You can do that?

84
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,812
I can try...

85
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,698
but they'll be more receptive
if you stop the threats.

86
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:04,813

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/10/05

98
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,806
Got a live one?

99
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,974
At Third and Indiana.
Gag gone bad.

100
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,962
Timmy Sanders needs backup.

101
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,552
He always needs backup.

102
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:41,615
Yeah, couple of yuppies got jacked
by some dirtballs posing as drug dealers.

103
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,032
But the yuppies were packing..
semi-automatics.

104
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,493
And Fu Manchu..
runs chinese checkout on the corner.

105
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,583
Pulls out his pump-action shotgun,
makes it a three-way shoot-out.

106
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,955
- And Sanders got this?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,538
And you know he needs help.

108
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,988
Guy couldn't solve a crossword puzzle.

109
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,410
So you going to come out and
play with the boys, or what?

110
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,230
Can't. Got a box to see about.

111
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,072
Another cold one?

112
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:07,492
Yeah, yeah, tell that to
this girl threatening to castrate the doer.

113
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,499
When are you coming back on the line?

114
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:13,492
Don't know if I am.

115
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,291
When did this job come in?

116
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,872
'83.

117
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:20,027
An '83 job can wait, Lilly.
Come on.

118
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,549
No, it can't.

119
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,567
It's waited long enough.

120
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,249
Dana Deamer.

121
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,859
A bomb was left on her back porch
inside some kind of box.

122
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:36,536
She picked it up,
it went off in her face.

123
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:39,119
- They had a good suspect?
- Albert Miller.

124
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,386
High school teacher and
chronic sexual deviant.

125
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:44,224
She was scheduled to testify against
him after flashing her.

126
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:46,418
But then Dana conveniently dies.

127
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:49,321
Mmmm. Her daughter's been living
with it for the past 20 years.

128
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,413
- and it shows.
- Damaged goods?

129
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,773
Like it happened yesterday.

130
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,649
They couldn't make a case against Miller?

131
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,190
Couldn't place him at the scene
or connect him to a bomb.

132
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,871
Well, I hope he's not back
teaching high school.

133
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:05,639
No, he is in Graterford doing
a stretch for indecent exposure.

134
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,027
Sweet little girl.

135
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:11,706
Her dad still fireman?

136
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:14,146
Mm-hmm. He's our next stop.

137
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,452
Look, I don't want to be any trouble.

138
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,002
I know you've got plenty of
new homicides to deal with.

139
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,198
We work old ones.

140
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,776
Well, Dana's case seemed like
it should have been open and shut.

141
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:36,780
but it just slipped through the cracks.

142
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,809
Rob's as worried about Gwen as I am.

143
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,181
I'm always worried about Gwen.

144
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,782
She's not helping herself
by threatening Albert Miller.

145
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,230
I know.

146
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,269
She just...

147
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,940
She never got over losing Dana.

148
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,857
Did you?

149
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,085
I try to look ahead and not back

150
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,036
but Gwen... she...

151
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,698
talks about closure a lot.

152
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:02,485
We're going to see what
we can do before the parole hearing.

153
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:06,220
Anything you can do to keep him
locked up. I'm all for.

154
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,509
He's a dangerous man,

155
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:11,904
and my headstrong daughter
keeps provoking him.

156
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:14,972
- Did he threaten Dana in '83?
- He sure did.

157
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,065
And she still insisted on testifying.

158
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,750
Dana was headstong, too.

159
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,198
It was your company that
was called to the scene, right?

160
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,414
I've responded to a thousand fires.

161
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:27,052
But when I heard my own address...

162
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:37,554
Mom!

163
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,273
Mom!

164
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,127
Mom!

165
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,671
Maria, where is Dana?

166
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,834
Mom's hurt.

167
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:02,037
I sat next to her body...

168
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:04,208
as long as they would let me,

169
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,131
and I remember when I finally got up.

170
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:09,858
they handed me her wedding ring.

171
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,973
You think you've put something away
and then it...

172
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,008
sneaks back sometimes.

173
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:20,554
Did your company have an arson
investigator on the scene?

174
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,260
Yeah, Frank Lawson.

175
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,970
He's still on the job in Cedarbrook.

176
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,115
Thanks for cooperating.

177
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:33,967
Maybe you and Gwen can
finally get closure here.

178
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:42,236
Rush, he's got something.

179
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:43,197
Yeah?

180
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:44,680
Oh, yes.

181
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,683
Got something good.

182
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,286
deep in the databases.

183
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:51,382
Your pervert Albert Miller had a secret.

184
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,276
Something they didn't get in '83?

185
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:56,483
Well, they didn't have Nexis or
Auto-track in '83.

186
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,979
From '78 to '82,

187
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:01,676
Miller worked summers in mines
on the Iron Range in Minnesota,

188
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,237
working with explosives.

189
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:06,658
If we can match what he learned in
those mines with evidence from the scene.

190
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,907
Except physical evidence is
nowhere to be found.

191
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,338
We need it before the hearing.

192
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,622
I'll go to the warehouse myself,

193
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,614
but the clerk doesn't know where
anything from the '80s went.

194
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:18,463
I think it's time we meet Albert Miller.

195
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,676
This crazy tomato keeps calling me up,

196
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:24,097
saying she's going to shoot me down
in the street if I get out.

197
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:26,334
Kind of make you regret killing her mom?

198
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,914
I flashed her mom in Franklin parkway.

199
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,519
Flashed a hundred ladies.

200
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,864
I didn't kill any of them.

201
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,450
You just threatened to.

202
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,442
I never threatened Dana Deamer.

203
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,355
That was a fiction.

204
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:40,699
I have CSB disorder.
I'm not a violent man.

205
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,196
CSB?

206
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:45,540
Compulsive sexual behavior.

207
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,832
It's a psychological condition.

208
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,498
I shouldn't even be criminalized.

209
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:52,337
You walked naked through
a girl's middle school, Albert.

210
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,859
That shouldn't be criminalized?

211
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:57,485
My life became...unmanageable.

212
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:01,550
Look, I had wrong urges,
but I never blew people up.

213
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,190
I was a high school English teacher.

214
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,011
What about the explosives you
worked with in Minnesota?

215
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,187
Hey, I stuck fuses into dynamites
and pushed the button.

216
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:14,443
That was..that was the extent of my job.

217
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,643
I don't know how to make a bomb.

218
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:22,242
You didn't mention that part of work
history to the detectives in '83, did you?

219
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,189
That would've been committing suicide.

220
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,606
Murder is more your style.

221
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,097
Look...

222
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,895
I'm reformed.

223
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:34,085
I've made a useful contribution in here
training guide dogs for the blind.

224
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:37,482
I'm going to try and get a job
in that vein when I'm out.

225
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:39,581
I deserve parole.

226
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,518
- We'll see about that in two days.
- Please...

227
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:45,515
Don't sink me with that.

228
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,815
Good luck with the CSB, Albert.

229
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,648
That guy have murder in him?

230
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:00,573
- Maybe 20 years ago, he did.
- Hmm.

231
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,197
I checked my messages, Rush.

232
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:11,849
You don't have to leave
three voice mails in three hours.

233
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,352
I really needed you, Louie.

234
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,232
And here I am.

235
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:16,489
I'm working an old case

236
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,981
and the original evidence doesn't seem
to be anywhere on planet Earth.

237
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:24,785
I would characterize that as your problem,
not mine.

238
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:28,073
What's the oldest crime scene
fresh evidence was ever discovered at.

239
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,499
Lucy, 6000 years old.

240
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,523
Someone smashed her skull in.

241
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:36,323
Well, I've got a 20-year-old crime scene
where I think we can find evidence.

242
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,924
That put a bump in your heart rate?

243
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:39,112
Slightly...

244
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,471
and I can do it in a month.

245
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,037
How about tomorrow?

246
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,822
I'm booked, Rush.

247
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:48,681
The vicitim's husband is a fireman.
Civil servant like us.

248
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,113
Uh-huh.

249
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:54,186
Daughter's been suffering over it
since she was five years old.

250
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:57,011
What makes you think there's
anything new to be found?

251
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,511
See that crawl space?

252
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,889
When the back door was blown out,

253
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,434
what if debris went under the house?

254
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,506
The guys from '83 never looked
under the house?

255
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:07,888
Why would they when there was
so much debris in plain sight?

256
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,682
That's 20 years of weather, wind.

257
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:14,889
But it was all protected by a house.

258
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,810
It's not impossible.

259
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,668
The key areas where evidence may
have been missed and possible preserved.

260
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:46,926
are here, here, here...

261
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,289
and in there.

262
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,824
- You going in that crawl space, Louie?
- You bet I am.

263
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:53,965
Rush,

264
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,142
Maria Sanchez is out front.

265
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,973
The next door neighborhood that
was first on the scene.

266
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,332
We got her interview from '83.

267
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,367
I asked her to walk us through it inside.

268
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,042
Holy mama.

269
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:17,394
Such a shame, this place.

270
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:20,988
No one wanted to buy it
after what happened.

271
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,346
This is Albert Miller.

272
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:25,855
You never saw this guy in
the neighborhood, right, Maria?

273
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,023
I should've said I saw him.

274
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:32,048
- Lied, you mean..
- Help justice get done.

275
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,979
But you didn't see him.

276
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:39,338
- Technically, no.
- Let's stick to the technical.

277
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,735
Okay.

278
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,072
Tell us what happened.

279
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,871
It was 8 o'clock.

280
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,755
I was letting the dog out,

281
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:50,942
when I hear the explosion.

282
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,378
Mom?

283
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,582
Mom....

284
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,506
This way, Gwen.

285
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:10,131
Mom! Mom!

286
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:13,159
Mommy, mommy!

287
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,448
Mom..

288
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,642
Mom..

289
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:29,521
You didn't mention the telephone in '83.

290
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,496
I guess they didn't ask.

291
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,994
- You're sure about hanging it up, though.
- Um-hmm.

292
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:39,159
Because I remember thinking
"What if her husband tries to call?"

293
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,868
Okay, Thanks, Maria.

294
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,962
Think Dana got a prompting phone call?

295
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,378
It's possible.

296
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:50,206
- Phone records.
- 20-year-old phone records.

297
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:54,330
Bell Atlantic, Bell of Pennsylvania,
AT&T, Verizon...

298
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,719
Four companies ago.

299
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,276
Should I get an emergency subpoena?

300
00:16:57,276 --> 00:17:00,582
- Naked aggression would be faster.
- I'll call Vera.

301
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:09,685
Detective?

302
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,786
I'm Frank Lawson.
You called me.

303
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,673
Oh...

304
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,874
- The fire marshal?
- Right.

305
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:19,627
I think the guy under the house wants you.

306
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,318
You remember what you found
on this scene in '83?

307
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:25,089
We discovered pretty quickly.

308
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,794
It was an explosive device.
Looked for an accelerant.

309
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,303
- Was there one?
- No.

310
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,552
It was just gunpowder.

311
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,733
So any old hobbyist could
have made that bomb.

312
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,056
It wasn't real sophisticated.

313
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,385
Rush!

314
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:40,093
I got something.

315
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,345
You're kidding.

316
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:42,728
I am not.

317
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:47,126
I'll just stick around in case
you need me. / Thanks.

318
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,820
Can you see it?

319
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,515
I see something.

320
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,409
Charred cardboard.

321
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:54,392
Remnants of the box the bomb was in.

322
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,614
- Will they have powder residue?
- It could.

323
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,640
- Could have fingerprints.
- Nice.

324
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,260
It's a gold mine under there.

325
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,268
I'm going to be analyzing all night.

326
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:03,680
Rush...

327
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,207
Rob Deamer's here.

328
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,653
Wonder how he heard about this.

329
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,688
Firemen's grapevine.

330
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,116
I thought Rob and Lawson were friends.

331
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:21,014
That's a thing of the past.

332
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:22,284
How you doing?

333
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,002
I wish you would have told me
this was going on.

334
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,171
I didn't know if you'd want to be here.

335
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,881
She was my wife.
I should be here.

336
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,928
Just trying to keep Miller locked up, Rob.

337
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,637
Well what?

338
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,008
Why would you...

339
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,992
What are you looking for?

340
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,005
Remnants of the explosion.

341
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:42,540
- 20 years later?
- I'm an optimist.

342
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:46,736
I see you contacted Frank Lawson.

343
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:48,446
Yeah, Is.. uh..

344
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:51,032
is there some kind of problem
between you two?

345
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:53,640
It has nothing to do with this.

346
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,779
I just...

347
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,785
I think he had a thing for my wife.

348
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,372
Yeah, I perfomed
the miracle of loaves and

349
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,532
fishes getting these telephone records.

350
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,015
How'd you do it, Vera?

351
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,686
I had to pistol whip a lady.

352
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,576
She probably deserved it.

353
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:14,677
So?

354
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:16,501
It's all for naught.

355
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,464
There's no record of any the numbers

356
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:20,823
associated to Albert Miller
calling the Deamer house.

357
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,030
Even if Albert did call Dana that morning,

358
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,914
why would she go get a package
he'd left for her?

359
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,139
He was threatening her.

360
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,988
This is exciting, Rush.

361
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:33,801
Your pieces of cardboard?

362
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:37,583
No prints.

363
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,376
- No partials.
- I'm waiting for the exciting part.

364
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:43,654
Watch as I put the pieces together.

365
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:47,005
They have teeny bits of color
in the uncharred areas.

366
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:50,264
And when you fit them together
like a jigsaw puzzle.

367
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,289
Look, look, look, look, look..

368
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,937
It was laundry detergent.

369
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:58,835
Gleen.

370
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,308
Isn't it kind of brilliant?

371
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:04,890
It is, actually.
Because look at the kitchen.

372
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,043
- On that shelf.
- Same detergent.

373
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:08,812
That was her brand.

374
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:11,651
Maybe no one made a case against
Albert because he didn't do it.

375
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:13,752
- I just cleared the pervert?
- Not necessarily.

376
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:17,052
But how would some random flasher
know what kind of detergent she used?

377
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,210
It'd have to be someone who
had been in that house.

378
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,295
Someone closer to home.

379
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,261
Someone she trusted.

380
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:44,949
I'm not going to be able to
stop this, Gwen.

381
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,313
- You said....
- I'm sorry.

382
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,111
I thought you found evidence
at the house.

383
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:50,763
But it didn't support Albert as the killer.

384
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,289
So you got our hopes up for nothing.

385
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,088
This doesn't mean I'm dropping
your mom's case, Gwen.

386
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,757
I laid off this guy

387
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,713
because you said you could help us.

388
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,745
I pray for your family.

389
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,495
I wish you peace.

390
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,749
Honestly.

391
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,801
- Pray for yourself.
- Gwen.

392
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,495
What? He killed my mom
and now he's walking out the door.

393
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:12,335
Baby,listen. There may
not be justice for mom.

394
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,625
You just have to accept that.

395
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,220
There must be something you can do.

396
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,751
- There's a lot I can do.
- We've heard that before.

397
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,508
I can't make guarantees
but I'm still on this job.

398
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:23,123
Well, why should I trust you, huh?

399
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:25,019
- I don't even know you.
- No, you don't.

400
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,890
Because if you did,
you'd know I was just getting started.

401
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:41,111
Rush, come here.

402
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,397
I've gone through these logs three times.

403
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,961
There is no record of
an incoming call that morning.

404
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,342
But....

405
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,531
you see this number?

406
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:57,291
Yeah. / Nine calls to the Deamer house
the month before Dana dies.

407
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,066
And guess who the number traces back to.

408
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,984
Frank Lawson.

409
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,254
The fire marshal.

410
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,688
And explosives expert.

411
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:07,115
He worked with Rob Deamer.
Maybe he was calling him.

412
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:10,006
Hmm? But I went through the duty roster.

413
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,915
In '83?

414
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,343
They got them going back to '68.

415
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:18,750
Lawson was only calling
when Rob Deamer was at work.

416
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,903
He knew he wouldn't be home.

417
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:23,212
That's not so bad, Vera.

418
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,356
Well, I am good for something.

419
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,256
Yeah.

420
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:33,891
Why did you transfer out here?

421
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:35,352
Change of pace.

422
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:37,117
And a 40 minute commute?

423
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,984
I like this house.

424
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:40,787
Did you stop liking the other one?

425
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:41,876
I ask because, uh,

426
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:45,694
there seemed to be some tension
between you and Rob the other day.

427
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:53,176
We drifted apart, after Dana.

428
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,270
Were you close with her?

429
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,040
We got along.

430
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,948
Got along like,

431
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:02,589
"Hey, how you doing?"
or...

432
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:05,465
got along like, uh,

433
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:08,797
nine secret phone calls in a month.

434
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,548
That marriage was falling apart.

435
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,291
You were Rob's friend.

436
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,325
How's his wife end up crying
on your shoulder?

437
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,865
Rob wasn't a great husband

438
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:21,024
and his mom was pretty hard on Dana.

439
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:23,980
She'd tell me things.

440
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,661
I was someone she could talk to.

441
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:29,019
A friend.

442
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,747
Were you in love with her, Frank?

443
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,514
Rob's mother was here all morning.

444
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,360
Sitting there with her journal.

445
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,883
Watching, writing...

446
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:41,961
She went to the bathroom.

447
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,373
I took a look.

448
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,393
I couldn't help it.

449
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,685
And?

450
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:52,054
"Expired apple juice in refrigerator"

451
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:04,053
It was punishment for last night.

452
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,809
I'm in trouble because I went out
without wearing my wedding ring.

453
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,401
Why'd you do that?

454
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:15,486
I just take it off sometimes,
to garden or whatever.

455
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,410
and just forget to put it back on.

456
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,679
But it sets Rob off.

457
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,794
Maybe there's surveillance camera in it.

458
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:27,043
Can you tell?

459
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,120
Could there be...

460
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,973
a tiny microphone?

461
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:32,972
I was navy intelligence.

462
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,969
Let me see....

463
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,563
We can't.

464
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,209
I know.

465
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:07,002
The day she died,
all he could think about was that ring.

466
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:09,043
Rob?

467
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:13,044
I think they were still working on her

468
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,090
you know, she wasn't quite dead.

469
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,888
And his daughter's terrified

470
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:20,593
but he's running around
looking for the ring.

471
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,103
"Where's the ring?
where's the ring?"

472
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,991
Like he had to have it.

473
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:26,933
Are you pointing to him
as planting the bomb?

474
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,171
No. Absolutely not.

475
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,493
The guy she was going
to testify against did it.

476
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:33,735
That's the old story.

477
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:36,425
Rob and I were both at work.

478
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:39,316
He was upstairs, I was downstairs.

479
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:41,051
Were there phones upstairs?

480
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,432
No, only where I was.

481
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:44,944
So Rob didn't call Dana that day?

482
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:48,019
- I would remember that.
- Never left the building?

483
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,330
I would remember.

484
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,680
But you could have called Dana.

485
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,650
Or left building.

486
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,198
I could have.

487
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,135
I didn't.

488
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,860
You were an explosives expert

489
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,736
and half in love with her.

490
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,196
If I loved her,

491
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,573
why would I kill her?

492
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,961
It's happened before in human history.

493
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,526
Lawson's interview goes either way.

494
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:18,408
I mean, she's unhappy,
wants to leave Rob.

495
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:20,442
He knows it, he blows her up.

496
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:22,130
Or Lawson was in love with her,

497
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,846
thinks she's going to leave her husband
and she laughs in his face.

498
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:27,783
And he knows about bombs.

499
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,479
He used to hang out in the kitchen.
He'd know her detergent brand.

500
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:33,728
He wanted into her pants.
He probably did her laundry.

501
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:36,879
Got to keep looking at both of them, guys.

502
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,499
Lil, I gotta go.

503
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,372
Bye.

504
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,367
You don't have to solve
this case tonight, you know.

505
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,749
This job is languishing.
I need to pump some life into it.

506
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:49,993
Those are bank records.

507
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:53,107
I'm going back to the basics,
following the money.

508
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:55,822
Love or money are
always your best bets.

509
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,254
And we already checked love.

510
00:26:58,254 --> 00:26:59,456
I can't stay, Lil.

511
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,766
You already said that.

512
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,186
Yeah, you did.

513
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:04,191
You're right. Bye.

514
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:11,075
- Looks like you're in for a fun night.
- Yup.

515
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:26,403
Got something.

516
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:29,500
March 10, 1979 $200.

517
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,393
April 10, $200 Automatic deduction.

518
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:34,648
Payable to the court.

519
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:38,454
By the order of the court
shall be deducted...

520
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:40,465
remitted monthly...

521
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:42,534
Robert Deamer to...

522
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:44,886
to Adrian Martin. / Mm-hmm.

523
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,493
Spousal support.

524
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,058
Did we know about Adrian Martin?

525
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:52,531
Lorraine talks about Dana
being his first wife.

526
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:55,736
She never mentioned it.
A second one.

527
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,674
It was a disaster.

528
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:03,495
Rob was so temperamental,

529
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:06,622
when you're young and
dumb that's romantic.

530
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:08,647
When you're older and married?

531
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,635
You get tired of it.

532
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,195
He's watching, judging everything.

533
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:15,006
Were you afraid of him?

534
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,295
Sometimes.

535
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,037
He was possessive.

536
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:19,728
Like how?

537
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:23,924
He'd always hold my hand in public,
but never in private.

538
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:26,647
Like the whole point of it
was to show others I was his.

539
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,009
How did it finally end?

540
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,900
My dad talked some sense into me.

541
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,951
Got me to pack up and go.

542
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:35,063
But Rob wouldn't let me leave the premises,
till I gave him my ring.

543
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:38,464
That was big with him.
Getting the ring.

544
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,276
I actually had high hopes for him.

545
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:46,451
Why do women always have high hopes
for guys who want to kill them?

546
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:48,099
Las.

547
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,913
There's another one.

548
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,551
- Another what?
- Wife.

549
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:06,455
It was only two years.

550
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:11,989
I mean, he'd be off my radar totally
if I wasn't traumatized by him.

551
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:14,200
Was he possessive, Pauline?

552
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,803
Possessive, controlling.

553
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,136
It was a fiasco.

554
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:22,673
Did he make a big deal
about your wedding ring?

555
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,168
How do you know that?

556
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,151
One night,

557
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:34,428
I had gone out to dinner with
an old boyfriend from high school
who was visiting in,

558
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:37,109
and I came home.

559
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,983
and he said
"Take off your wedding ring."

560
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:43,023
I said, "Why?"

561
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:47,050
He said, "Just take it off,
and you'll find out."

562
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,517
So I took it off.

563
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,106
He went down to the basement.

564
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,764
He had this workshop there.

565
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:59,394
And he crushed the ring in a vice,

566
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,727
and then he put it on my pillow.

567
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,669
Oh... / I figured that was my cue to leave.

568
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,542
Good call.

569
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:09,551
What kind of workshop did he have?

570
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:13,541
Uh, he made amateur rockets.
It was his hobby.

571
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,078
Lilly?

572
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:17,426
Your pervert pal's on the line.

573
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:19,291
Uh, Albert Miller.

574
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:22,193
Yeah. Apparently,
Gwen tracked him down.

575
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:24,024
Excuse me.

576
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,603
I just paid $1,200.

577
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,053
- for this piece of crap car.
- Albert, Albert.

578
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:42,827
- I can't pay to have these windows fixed.
- Albert.

579
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:45,082
- You don't want to send this girl to jail.
- I don't.

580
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:47,141
She grew up without a mother.
She's troubled.

581
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,248
Look, I don't think you did it.

582
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,914
I didn't.

583
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,622
Look, you're flawed
but you're not heartless.

584
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:55,846
You don't want Gwen arrested.

585
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:59,078
That's why you called me
when you didn't have to.

586
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,053
Being in the system ain't fun.

587
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:04,196
But that's where she's gonna end up,
if she's so damn compulsive.

588
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,300
I know.. I know...

589
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:10,399
I won't press charges.

590
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,664
Just get that loony girl out of my life.

591
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Okay.

592
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:31,019
This isn't a real constructive
way to handle things, Gwen.

593
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,300
He killed my mother.

594
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,204
- I don't care about constructive.
- I don't think he did kill your mother.

595
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:39,177
Of course he did.

596
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:42,773
The bomb that killed your mother
was in a box of Gleen.

597
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,282
So?

598
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:47,422
The person who killed her would've
known what kind of detergent she used.

599
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:49,945
That wouldn't be Albert.

600
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:56,701
Someone placed a phone call to your mom
that morning. Did you know that?

601
00:31:56,701 --> 00:32:01,315
For some reason,
there's no record of that phone call.

602
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:04,699
And I don't know how to explain that.

603
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:07,395
I wanted your help...

604
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:08,786
getting him.

605
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:12,272
- Punishing him.
- Albert wasn't that guy.

606
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,921
There's evidence that points
another way.

607
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:16,739
What way?

608
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,400
Towards your father.

609
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,263
That's crazy.

610
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,044
Put it together in your head, Gwen.

611
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:26,260
You dad's hobby was making rockets.

612
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,777
Your mom and dad fought.
He had two other wives.

613
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:30,925
One other wife.

614
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:32,288
There were two.

615
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:35,633
One before and one after your mom.

616
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:38,809
I don't know why that matters.

617
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,292
It reveals a pattern of your dad's behavior
that wasn't evident in 1983.

618
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,742
Yeah, I don't understand.

619
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:48,417
He had controlling relationships
with both those women.

620
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,245
How do you know?

621
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:52,639
And he was fixated on getting their
wedding rings when it was all over.

622
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,625
Just like he was with your mother.

623
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:58,763
My dad was devastated
about losing my mom.

624
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:04,533
He was hunting for her wedding ring,
while she lay dying.

625
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:08,555
Maria was holding your hand, not him.

626
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,342
Gwen.

627
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:25,698
Come on.

628
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,795
You're going to go
too far one of these days.

629
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:43,976
- I need to speak to Lorraine.
- No, we're leaving.

630
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:45,193
- It's important.
- Forget it.

631
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,401
Are you in charge of who she talks to?

632
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,710
Lorraine, stay in the car.

633
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:50,559
Listen, I have tried to be polite to you.

634
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,985
but maybe, you don't get polite.

635
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:54,177
I get deception from you, Rob.
And agression.

636
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:56,766
Well, our family doesn't need you.
Do you understand?

637
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:58,718
Gwen's going to get though this,
me and Lorraine are going to get married.

638
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:02,843
And we're all going to try to
get a little piece of happiness.

639
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,459
- Is that new, Lorraine?
- Just this morning.

640
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:14,270
We're leaving now,
and we don't want to see you again.

641
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:34,397
Any chance of a search warrant?

642
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,332
For a 22 year old hobby?

643
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:39,289
- Judge Fisk really likes you.
- Not that much.

644
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,433
Rush.

645
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:52,393
Hey, Gwen.

646
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,573
Hi.

647
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,056
What you doing?

648
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,470
I was looking around my dad's workshop.

649
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:06,952
Oh, yeah...

650
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,584
Thinking about my mom.

651
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:16,484
Have you ever seen a pool of blood?

652
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,139
Not just blood...

653
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,912
but a whole pool of it?

654
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,555
Yeah.

655
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,270
Yeah. you can't forget it.

656
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:36,847
If I'm going to do this,
I'm going to have to kill myself after.

657
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:39,375
Do what, Gwen?

658
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,517
Turn in my father.

659
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:50,317
Do you have evidence against him?

660
00:35:55,594 --> 00:36:00,326
I know how you make a call
without leaving a record of it.

661
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,973
How about England?

662
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,530
Do you know how they talk
in England, Gwendolyn?

663
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,817
No.

664
00:36:18,817 --> 00:36:21,540
Hello? Hello? Hello?

665
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,334
Hello?

666
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:25,885
Ooh, I want Paris.

667
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:27,699
I'll look up the code.

668
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:29,753
Can you say, "Oui, madame?"

669
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:31,367
Wee...

670
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,579
His dad...

671
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:43,169
was a telephone repairman.

672
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,705
How could he do that?

673
00:36:56,033 --> 00:37:00,269
I've seen it a hundred times
and I still don't know.

674
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,030
Do you know where he is now?

675
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:12,382
The Poconos with Lorraine.

676
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:14,798
They're eloping.

677
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,653
You don't have enough to arrest him.

678
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:42,547
He doesn't have to know that.

679
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,645
You ready, Gwen.

680
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:55,587
I hope you haven't taken the vows yet.

681
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:56,599
What's going on?

682
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,685
We haven't met.
Detective Vera.

683
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:00,390
We found Dana's killer.

684
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,742
- And?
- I'm sorry, Lorraine.

685
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,835
I know you thought
you'd found your happiness with Rob.

686
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:05,646
But he's not the one.

687
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:06,738
Why not?

688
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,574
Rob doesn't have luck with marriage.

689
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:12,380
Why don't you go sit with Gwen?
She'll tell you the details.

690
00:38:17,023 --> 00:38:18,466
Not you.

691
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:20,555
You stay.

692
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,905
What'd you do to my daughter?

693
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,878
Found her mom's killer,
like she asked me to.

694
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:28,026
Brainwashed her is more like it.

695
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:31,576
Oh, I don't know how
to control people like that.

696
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,419
- What are they talking about me?
- Hey.

697
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:39,076
If I were a betting man,
I'd say you, Rob.

698
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:40,750
You and your rocket bombs.

699
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,596
Gwen doesn't believe that.

700
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:45,677
Gwen told us how you made
the untraceable call.

701
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,010
Right.

702
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,665
Okay, excuse me.
I need to go deprogram my daughter.

703
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:52,415
Pisses you off, doesn't it?

704
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,516
Not knowing what they're
saying what they're doing.

705
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:57,260
- Don't pretend that you know me.
- Oh, I do know you.

706
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,086
I know you had two other wives
you pushed around, Pauline, Adrian.

707
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,542
- What about them?
- They were the lucky ones.

708
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,661
They got out in time.

709
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:05,341
They probably didn't talk back
like Dana did.

710
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:08,785
Probably weren't so,uh, headstrong.

711
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:11,116
You know about that, don't you?

712
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,347
I do.

713
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:16,246
I got all these opinions, ideas that
might not be the same as yours.

714
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:19,286
Now, I'm just the kind of girl
that pisses you off, Rob.

715
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:21,643
Just the kind of girl
you'd like to blow to bits.

716
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,528
Are you the kind of girl that
would flirt with your husband's friends?

717
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,938
I might. / Mouth off to his mother,
insult her to her face.

718
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:26,757
Sounds about right.

719
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:29,597
Be so damn stubborn that every single
conversation turns into World war III.

720
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,077
And on top of that, 
I'd be teaching my daughter

721
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,279
to be just as big of a pain
in the ass as I am.

722
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,236
- And you put up with this?
- Tough lady.

723
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:36,934
Well, maybe you'd deserve a lesson, too.

724
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:42,240
And it was so handy having a guy
like Albert Miller to set up.

725
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,500
Hello?

726
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,631
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,055
Okay.

728
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:37,649
We fight too much.

729
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:38,658
Yeah.

730
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:41,242
Listen, I got you something.

731
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:42,943
You did?

732
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,741
Just something I noticed you needed.

733
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,551
It's out on the back porch.

734
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,798
That's sweet of you.

735
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:51,745
Go take a look.

736
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:52,859
I'll wait.

737
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,409
Right now.

738
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:55,650
Yeah.

739
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,052
I'll wait.

742
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:55,748
