00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,490
August 13,1975

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Tell mama I'm going to play.

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,120
You better be home before the streetlights come on, girl.

4
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,970
fireflies turn into fairies at the end of summer.

5
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,840
Why fairies?

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,240
'Cause, they do.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
You made that up.

8
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,370
You never see fireflies in the winter, right?

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,820
In brooklyn, we never saw them ever.

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,780
'Cause they turn into fairies, that's why.

11
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,430
Yeah?And go where?

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,360
Their castle in the sky, where nothing ever dies.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,950
But not all fairies make it.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,850
Why not?

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
'Cause the trolls catch them.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,550
Where do the fireflies really go, melanie?

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,230
I don't know.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,710
My brother said when summer ends,
you won't play with me anymore.

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,430
Why?

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,550
'Cause you're white, and I'm black.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,940
But we're best friends.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,890
- Forever?
- Forever and a day.

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,480
Maybe when summer ends, the fireflies go to heaven.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,980
Yeah, maybe.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,330
Let's get forensics in here,
see if they can pick anything up.

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,120
- Lil.
- Morning, boss.

27
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,080
What do you got?

28
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,200
Ever hear of a letter arriving 31 years too late?

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,400
Too late for what?

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,610
Save the life of a young girl.

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,030
Former postman lived here?

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,380
Died last week.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,020
Refused to deliver mail to blacks on his route back in '75.

34
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,720
Welcome to the U.S.Postal service.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,550
His family found bags of mail stashed in the basement.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,860
The inspector's been sifting for hours.

37
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
This was in one of them.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,140
From an eight-year-old girl, melanie campbell.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,820
Went missing in '75.

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,980
Body never found.Presumed homicide.

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,190
Postcard's addressed to her best friend,
next door neighbor,

42
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,790
cherise pierce, black girl.
Take a look.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,990
"The trolls got me.

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,340
" Some kind of message?

45
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,880
It was postmarked the day melanie disappeared.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,710
Cry for help.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,580
31 years too late to save her.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,460
Maybe not too late to catch her killer.

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,420
Melanie campbell, age eight.

53
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,350
Abducted from her bedroom,
night of october 23, 1975.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,650
Her bloody ballet shshoe found in a nearby park.

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,620
Tender-age search.

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,630
Lot of time, manpower on this one.

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,750
Body never recovered.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,480
Theory was an intruder came in
through a broken basement window.

59
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,360
A postcard was sent to her neighbor, cherise pierce.

60
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,130
Never made it.

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,380
These kids were tight.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,210
Best friends, hung out 24/7.

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,840
Not the only pierce in here.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,380
Prime suspect at the time was cherise's
teenage brother, terrell pierce.

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,110
Based on what?

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,900
Kid had no record, straight-a student, Mr.Clean.

67
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,790
Neighbor id'd terrell in the campbells' backyard,
night of the abduction.

68
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,940
In these words: "Saw that colored boy
monkeying around on

69
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,870
the side of their house.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,080
" That's credible.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Lifted a partial palm print from
the campbells' basement window.

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,070
No match to terrell.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,320
Didn't stop them from interrogating him.

74
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,480
Six times.

75
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,830
Parents were questioned, too,
but dismissed as suspects.

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,330
'Cause once the black kid was id'd,
it was all about him.

77
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,730
Brewerytown was lily-white back then.

78
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,610
Pierces were the first black family to move in.

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,190
That some kind of excuse?

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,490
Not an excuse, the times.

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,790
Aka white flight.

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,470
Families hightailing it to the burbs,

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,990
terrified that their property values would tank.

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,030
One way to spin it.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,670
At least one white family stayed: The campbells.

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Families of missing kids do that, refuse to move.

87
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,470
Yeah, waiting for their child to walk through the door.

88
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Lily's gonna talk to the parents.

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,180
You want to take cherise and terrell?

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,530
Sure.

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,170
Could be terrell didn't deserve any of this.

92
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,520
Neither did melanie.

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,080
"The trolls got me.

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,720
" It was addressed to the girl next door,
cherise pierce.

95
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,640
You think melanie wrote that?

96
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,580
Possibly.Could "the trolls"
have meant something?

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,820
Melanie was always going on
about fairies and trolls and fireflies.

98
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,460
Quite an imagination.

99
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,090
But it was just child's talk.

100
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,700
Melanie did not write this.

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,620
How do you know?

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,890
She just started the third grade,
and she didn't know cursive.

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,320
Of course melanie wrote that.
These are her words.

104
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,380
But anyone who heard her
playing would've known them.

105
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,680
Who wrote it, then?

106
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,410
Maybe the person who took her.

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,520
What kind of a monster would do a thing like that?

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,270
That's what I'm here to find out, mrs.Campbell.

109
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,590
- So you'll find melanie, too?
- Oh, frances.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,420
She is alive.

111
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,060
It's been 31 years.

112
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,360
I don't care if it's 131 years.

113
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,910
Melanie is out there.

114
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,740
Can I walk you out?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,960
We are prisoners in this house
because my wife believes

116
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,480
our daughter's gonna walk through that front door.

117
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,640
Just thought you should know we're reopening the case.

118
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,470
All I want is to bury my child.

119
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
I understand.

120
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,820
Then bring her home.

121
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,960
It was a lifetime ago.

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,760
I barely remember that girl.

123
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,130
You were best friends back when
blacks and whites didn't exactly mix.

124
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,820
Take a look around.

125
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,110
Still don't.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,800
I know you probably got an unfair shake in '75.

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,460
Probably?

128
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,000
Cops had me in the box for 16 hours at a time.

129
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,150
That's rough.

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,980
Should've seen the '50s and '60s,
you want to talk rough.

131
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,580
You were id'd in the girl's yard
the night she disappeared.

132
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,700
By an old busybody who thought blacks
should go back to africa.

133
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,640
So that was a flat-out lie?

134
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,370
Flat-out.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,180
Talk about you and melanie.

136
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,900
Like I said, it was long time ago.

137
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,820
"The trolls" mean anyone in particular?

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,800
Could be the difference between
finding melanie's killer or not.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,490
Trolls were people we didn't like.

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,210
Go on.

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,800
We had codes for everything.

142
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,820
I'd say something like: "Alvina lights a spark.

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,260
" Alvina lights a spark?

144
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,660
Code for: "I left a note on our clothesline.

145
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,720
" So who were the trolls?

146
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,260
Almost everyone.

147
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,230
Our friendship wasn't looked on too kindly.

148
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,100
By who?

149
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,120
The whole neighborhood had it out for us,
from the start.

150
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,390
Everyone except melanie.

151
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:56,280
Leave...!

152
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,760
get out of here, critters!

153
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:06,340
Leave...!

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,410
What does "critters" mean, terrell?

155
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,990
Dad told you to go inside, cherise.

156
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,970
"Critters" means bugs and stuff.

157
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,180
Oh.

158
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,100
Want to see my fireflies?

159
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,480
Are those...bugs?

160
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,260
Their booties light up at night.

161
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,050
they do.Like magic.

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,880
I mean, if you believe in that stuff.

163
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,140
Quit talking to that girl!

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,250
Go home, melanie!

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,980
You're not the boss of me, Mr.Wilson!

166
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,290
I told you to go home.
Now!

167
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:53,460
Leave...!

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,000
My mom said you can come over after dinner.

169
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,590
I live right here.

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,160
We can catch fireflies when it gets dark.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,070
Okay.

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,300
See you later, alligator.

173
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,700
After awhile, crocodile.

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,440
Quite a welcoming committee.

175
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,420
Courtesy of hank wilson, head of the civic club.

176
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,680
Civic club?
More like a lynch mob.

177
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,650
Racists parading around as
neighborhood associations.

178
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,620
Who was this bozo?

179
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,520
He owned the local hardware store.

180
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,450
To him, the only thing worse than us
were whites who didn't go along.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
Like melanie.

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,270
Our friendship might have cost her her life.

183
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,220
It was our neighborhood, not theirs.

184
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,340
Your family was there for 30 years,
then, here come the coloreds.

185
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,260
And to make matters worse, little melanie

186
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,180
campbell gets all buddy-buddy with the black girl.

187
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,340
Could make a die-hard racist like you blow a gasket.

188
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,260
Whoa, hold on there.

189
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,520
When melanie disappeared, all the
white people got spooked, moved out.

190
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,440
Had to sell my house at a loss.

191
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,640
Boo-hoo.

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,870
We were working people.

193
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,220
House was all we had.

194
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,620
Beat up your own kid regular for looking at you funny.

195
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,010
What's that got to do with anything?

196
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,690
Maybe you let the fists fly with melanie.

197
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,560
Lippy little kid must have pissed you off.

198
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,300
I was working at the hardware store
the night she disappeared.

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,070
We'll check that.

200
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,290
Go ahead, and while you're at it,
check out a guy by the name of wes floyd.

201
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,150
Who's he?

202
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,130
Real estate scumbag that was creeping
around the neighborhood back then.

203
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,810
Tried to scare all the white folks into moving.

204
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,890
Why?So he could clean up?

205
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,250
Type like that would do anything for a buck.

206
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,340
You hear about that break-in the other day?

207
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,210
Right down the street.

208
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,800
Thank goodness no one was hurt.

209
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,560
Imagine what would happen if that family was home?

210
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:51,571
That's terrified!

211
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,330
Known fact-- blacks move in, crime goes up.

212
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,580
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

213
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,600
" bad things happen to decent people.

214
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,140
Well, we all know one another here.

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,140
Oh, for now, sure, but once the dam breaks,
no stopping who comes in.

216
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,350
You don't want to be the last to leave, do you?

217
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,310
I guess not, but...

218
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,870
place like genessee creek offers a safe
environment for families like yours.

219
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,040
State-of-the-art kitchens.Big yard.A pool.

220
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,890
This heat, a pool would be nice.

221
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,800
Huh?

222
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,830
Don't you fall for it, frances!

223
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,900
Get out of here.

224
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,940
I know what you're doing.

225
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,140
Just doing business.

226
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,300
Showing the nice lady the homes I have for sale.

227
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,270
You're trying to scare whites
out of this neighborhood,

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
but nobody here's leaving.

229
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,420
Except the spooks over there.

230
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,730
It's our neighborhood.

231
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,890
Sure it is.

232
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,630
My husband would never agree.

233
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,670
Neighborhood's gonna tip one day soon,

234
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
and you'll be the last white face around.

235
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,470
Not if I can help it.

236
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,310
And if one bad thing happens to some nice little white kid?

237
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,190
Won't be up to you.

238
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,990
His houses in the suburbs
weren't selling worth squat.

239
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,730
Then melanie disappears and he makes a killing.

240
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,510
Neighborhood tipped in, like, eight seconds.

241
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,170
Thanks for sharing.

242
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,380
Now get before i drop-kick you out of here.

243
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,940
Genessee creek.

244
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,130
It's that tony subdivision over near abington.

245
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,770
Lot of people made a killing off of white flight.

246
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,460
Sounds like this wes floyd guy was one of them.

247
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,950
I see your real estate ads all over the place, wes.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,570
Bus stops, billboards.

249
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,510
I do well.

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,300
And to think, it all started with genessee creek

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,370
and the abduction and murder of a little girl.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm a businessman, not a killer.

253
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,930
You made out like a bandit after
melanie campbell disappeared.

254
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,000
Sold 12 homes in one week.

255
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,300
They say you make your own luck.

256
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,940
Maybe you made yours.

257
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,070
The timing was fortuitous, so arrest me.

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600
Already have a record, wes.

259
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,580
Silly trespassing charges for putting
a few "sold" signs in people's yards.

260
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,980
To make it look like people were
moving when they weren't.

261
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,610
Smashed a few windows, too.

262
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,120
Made people think crime was going up.

263
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,330
Scare them out of brewerytown
into your white suburb.

264
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,360
It was business.

265
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,190
And it was the neighbors that
had it out for melanie, not me.

266
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,250
Neighbors like who?

267
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,051
The kibbitz on that block.

268
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,890
Saw the troubles myself at the bus stop.

269
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,550
Fairies like sweet stuff.

270
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,270
Like honey?

271
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,010
What if we put some in a jar?

272
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,500
Yeah, and if they like it...

273
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,610
first day of school and melanie's
already got a show-and-tell.

274
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,900
you gonna talk jive for us, huh?
Dy-no-mite.

275
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,010
Shut up, dale.

276
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,170
Come on, mel, we don't got to listen to him.

277
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,230
What'd you say, darkie?

278
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,850
Um...nothing.

279
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,030
Then say you're sorry.Or I'm gonna smack you.

280
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,500
Like your daddy smacks you?

281
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,520
Second thought...

282
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,860
maybe melanie should get in the first lick.

283
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,260
- Hit her.
- No.

284
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,990
- Hit her.
- Stop it!

285
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,580
- Hit her!
- I said stop!

286
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,040
Little bitch.

287
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,960
Come on.

288
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,300
Stupid troll.

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,130
Saw that kid picking on the little ones all the time.

290
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,260
You know his name?

291
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,860
Dale wilson.Hank wilson's son.

292
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,150
Runt-of-the-litter type.

293
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,980
Humiliated by a little girl.

294
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,710
Infront of the other kids.

295
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,540
And if dale was anything like his pops, not exactly the

296
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,180
forgiving and forgetting type.

297
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,150
How'd it make you feel, dale?

298
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,070
Getting popped by melanie campbell in front of everybody.

299
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,740
Not long after, she goes missing.

300
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,040
I was just young, dumb.

301
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,480
Can't argue there.

302
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,640
Held back twice.

303
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,180
So?That don't mean nothing.

304
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,870
Your old man was damn near burning crosses on lawns back then.

305
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,510
You telling me you didn't get even?

306
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,900
I'm not my father.

307
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,780
Sure acted like him at that bus stop.

308
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,700
and I felt bad about it.

309
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,200
No one knew better than me
what it's like getting picked on

310
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,640
by someone twice your size.

311
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,710
Oh, so you just let it pass, then?

312
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,150
Let bygones be bygones?

313
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,370
I went to melanie's house the next day.

314
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,060
To even the score?

315
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,220
To apologize.

316
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,280
we can leave notes to
each other here from now on.

317
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,620
Where no one'll see 'em.

318
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,600
- In the storm pipe?
- Yeah.

319
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,040
What are you doing?

320
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,100
Get away from us, dale.

321
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,930
I'm sorry for what I did, okay?

322
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,470
Sorry to both of us?

323
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

324
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,070
Now get down from there before you hurt yourself.

325
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,010
Why are you crying?

326
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,070
My mom took down the clothesline.

327
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,040
She said we can't play together anymore.

328
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,680
Her mom said they're going to move, too.

329
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
Why?

330
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,150
'Cause the neighbors don't like
fireflies and bugs and stuff.

331
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
Who doesn't?

332
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,640
Them.

333
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,530
That isn't about your fireflies.

334
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,210
It isn't?

335
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,350
It's about cherise.

336
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,030
She's the critter, stupid.

337
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,530
I'm a bug?

338
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,500
No, not a bug.

339
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,170
- A critter's like...
- like what?

340
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,780
Like not us.

341
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,620
A critter's like...not a person.

342
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,720
But I'm a person.

343
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,170
Yeah.

344
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,230
Look, you don't see horses
and chickens playing together, do you?

345
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,670
I like horses and chickens.

346
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,800
But they don't pl together, do they?

347
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,030
That's a hell of a thing to tell a kid.

348
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,060
That's the way the world was.

349
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,310
I was just the messenger.

350
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,660
Someone vandalized their house?

351
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,300
That's, uh, the story, anyway.

352
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,410
What, you disputing it, dale?

353
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,090
All I know...

354
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,050
Mrs.Campbell came into my dad's hardware
store asking about paint removers.

355
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,690
To get rid of the graffiti.So what?

356
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,610
So that was two days before her house got vandalized.

357
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,730
Are you saying Mrs.Campbell
knew it was gonna happen?

358
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,290
I'm saying she wrote those words herself.

359
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,390
Melanie and cherise were best friends.

360
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,250
That's right.

361
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,430
It concern you at all?

362
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,830
Your daughter hanging with a black girl?

363
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,670
No.Why are you asking?

364
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,930
"Critter lovers.
" Remember that?

365
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,760
Someone spray-painted
those words on our house.

366
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,630
Never reported it.Wonder why.

367
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,850
It was nothing, it was just a couple of pranksters.

368
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,530
Co why stir up more trouble?

369
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,230
We know about the visit to
the hardware store, Mrs.Campbell.

370
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,390
What are you talking about?

371
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,360
Things were heating up.

372
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,660
You wanted to get out of the neighborhood.

373
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,630
Get to genessee creek.

374
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,460
That's why you vandalized your own home.

375
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,830
People were so angry.Hank, all the rest.

376
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,870
I was afraid.

377
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,820
Of what they'd do to you.

378
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,220
Not me.Melanie.

379
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,870
There was so much hatred.Ugliness.

380
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,450
You wanted to shield her from all that.

381
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:31,690
So I...told her not to play with cherise anymore.

382
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,670
That sometimes it's best to stick with your own.

383
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,800
Aw, for god's sake, frances!

384
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,260
You refused to leave.
I didn't have a choice.

385
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,620
They were decent, hard-working people just like us.

386
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,850
I know.

387
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,590
I was just trying to protect my little girl.

388
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,330
I had no idea what damage it would cause.

389
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,560
Dale?

390
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,760
What happened?

391
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,490
It's nothing.

392
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,290
Who hit you?T-tell me.

393
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,470
My dad.Heard about that "critter lover.

394
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,920
" Said it's my fault all the white people are moving out.

395
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,950
Crazy, huh, mrs.C.?

396
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,080
Be sure and get an ice pack from the school nurse.

397
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,010
Alvina lights a spark.

398
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,810
Mel, you hear me?
Alvina lights a spark.

399
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,070
I'm not playing that anymore.
It's little kids' stuff.

400
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,950
You don't wanna see the fireflies?

401
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,770
No.

402
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,120
They're gonna leave, turn to fairies.

403
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,850
Fireflies aren't fairies, okay.

404
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,070
But you said...

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,080
and horses and chickens don't play together.

406
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,440
You said we'd be friends forever.

407
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,010
No such thing as forever.

408
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,900
That night, my little girl was gone.

409
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,510
I thought our child was in danger.

410
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,920
And she was.

411
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,430
"Alvina lights a spark.

412
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,300
" That meant cherise left a note for melanie.

413
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,750
But the clothesline was down.

414
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,960
So they were leaving them in the storm pipe, right?

415
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,550
The note never turned up.

416
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,280
Oh...that's a reach.

417
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,260
Need some leverage.

418
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,140
Same basement window the doer used in '75.

419
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,740
Lifted a partial palm print off of that ledge.

420
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,850
wasn't a hand print on the ledge.

421
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,020
It was a foot.

422
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,070
Neighbor spotted you in the campbells' yard
night melanie disappeared.

423
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,200
Already told you...
racist old bat made that up.

424
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,800
Got a print off that window ledge.

425
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,000
From a heel.

426
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,280
Tell me it's not gonna match yours, terrell.

427
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,500
I didn't hurt that white girl.

428
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,340
I said...tell me it's not
gonna match yours.

429
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,140
You made me a fool.

430
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,540
I defended you to my boss, believed in you.

431
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,420
Maybe you shouldn't have.

432
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,790
what were you doing in her yard?

433
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,230
Getting the note back for my sister.

434
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,530
Then why not say that?

435
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,560
A black boy in a white girl's yard
same night she goes missing?

436
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,580
No one's going to believe me.

437
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,730
I would!

438
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,460
You're the police.

439
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,240
I learned 31 years ago what that means.

440
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,650
Guilty till proven innocent.

441
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,110
They treated me like I wasn't even human.

442
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,270
Times change, terrell.

443
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,230
Not so much.

444
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,360
I just wanted to protect my little sister.

445
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,000
I did what I had to do that night.

446
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,850
Go on.

447
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,400
I told cherise the truth.

448
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,560
Heard about what went down
at the bus stop today.

449
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,960
Sorry.

450
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,260
I left a note for her in the storm pipe.

451
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,130
For melanie?

452
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,750
Maybe she'll find it and want to be friends again?

453
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,970
Cherise...

454
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,850
she's never going to be your friend.

455
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,780
You see, white people, they look at us,
and they see ugliness.

456
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,300
They do?

457
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,680
They don't see how pretty you are,
or how smart or how cool.

458
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,500
But I do.

459
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,710
And you gotta see that, too.

460
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,770
Melanie thinks I'm cool.

461
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,030
You can't trust 'em.
Not even melanie.

462
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,500
I can't?

463
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,800
Emmett till learned that the hard way.

464
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,100
Who's emmett till?

465
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,550
Boy who whistled at a white girl.

466
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,820
After, these dudes dragged him out of bed
in the middle of the night, shot him.

467
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,310
He wasn't even that much older than you.

468
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,810
Now I'm not trying to give you
nightmares or nothin', cherise.

469
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,070
I'm just lookin' out for my little sis.

470
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:11,120
Will you get the note back for me?
Please?

471
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,000
Sure thing.

472
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,220
Now to bed, okay?

473
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,300
Terrell?

474
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah?

475
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,310
Asdid emmett go to heaven?

476
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,400
all kids go to heaven.

477
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,920
I never forgot the look in her eyes
when I told her that.

478
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,320
She grew up faster than she should have.

479
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,720
Sounds like you both did.

480
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,630
So...you got the note?

481
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,220
It was gone when I got there.

482
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,060
Gone?Who took it?

483
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,320
I guess melanie.

484
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,050
You tell cherise that?

485
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,150
Yeah.

486
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,560
Do you know what the note said?

487
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,050
You gotta make this right, terrell.

488
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,210
By me.

489
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,750
Cherise ju wanted her friend back.

490
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,970
What'd the note say?

491
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:35,310
"Meet me in the woods...tonight.

492
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,290
" So melanie went into the woods that night.

493
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,940
And so did cherise.

494
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,780
Melanie wasn't abducted from her bedroom.

495
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,790
She went to the woods that night.

496
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,950
The woods?

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,490
You asked her to meet you there, cherise.

498
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,350
In your note.

499
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,230
That's ridiculous.

500
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
"Alvina lights a spark.

501
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,010
" Your secret code.
Meant you left her a note.

502
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,980
"Meet me in the woods tonight.

503
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,140
" You were waiting for her there.

504
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,320
We were best friends.
For forever and a day.

505
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,670
But melanie didn't believe in forever anymore.

506
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,450
The bus stop.She abandoned you.

507
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,540
Quite a betrayal.

508
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,400
It was.

509
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,610
What happened in the woods that night?

510
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,580
I spent my whole life trying to forget.

511
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,980
But you couldn'T.

512
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,910
we moved to an all black neighborhood,
a world away from brewerytown.

513
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,080
And it just got easier to pretend like it never happened.

514
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,380
What never happened?

515
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,210
I should have listened to terrell.

516
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,130
Black and white, never meant to be.

517
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,430
And I have spent my enre life living like that.

518
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,330
Never trusting another white person.

519
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,510
We believed fireflies were fairies
and friendships lasted forever.

520
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,390
But we were wrong.

521
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,920
Look.Fairies.Last of the season.

522
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,650
Thought you didn't believe in fairies.

523
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,570
I'm sorry I was mean to you at the bus stop.

524
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,820
Why'd you do that?

525
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,220
My mom said it was better to stick with your own.

526
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,950
Terrell said that, too.

527
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,680
But I don't want to stick with my own.

528
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,500
I want to be with you, cherise.

529
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,990
Me, too, mel.

530
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,600
You're my best friend.

531
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,400
- Forever?
- And a day.

532
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,400
Can't keep away from that critter, can you?

533
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,790
What do you want, dale?

534
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,390
I drive to this critter's house to
scare her, and what do I see?

535
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,980
This one trying to sneak off.

536
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,230
Thought you could get away, huh?

537
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,160
I got beat because my dad thinks
I spray-painted your house.

538
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,330
- Did you?
- No.

539
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,930
And now the whole neighborhood's gonna
move out and he says it's 'cause of me.

540
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,270
He hates me.

541
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,910
You're scaring us.

542
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,160
None of this would've happened if you hadn't moved here.

543
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,700
I wanna go home.

544
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,510
Melanie, run!

545
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,380
I heard the gunshots, and I knew,
and I did nothing.

546
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,450
Just kept running.

547
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,610
Anyone would have.

548
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,770
It's my fault we were in the woods.

549
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,240
it's my fault she died.

550
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,640
You weren't the one with the gun.

551
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:53,060
Every night I would dream about him
coming into my room and taking me.

552
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,900
And then the dreams finally stopped.

553
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,140
Until now.

554
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,730
The postcard.

555
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,940
Just the other night I had a dream.

556
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,530
Melanie was with the fireflies.

557
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,260
In a better place.

558
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,140
Heaven.

559
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,630
We got an eyewitness who saw you shoot melanie.

560
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,860
That's crazy.

561
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,230
Is it?

562
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,260
Cherise didn't see me shoot nobody.

563
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,430
Never said it was cherise, dale.

564
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,280
You sent the postcard.

565
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,160
Insurance, to keep cherise quiet.

566
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,630
Your old man beat the crap outta you.

567
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,780
You were lookin' to get even.

568
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,240
You followed cherise into the woods
that night, with your father's gun.

569
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,170
I never meant to hurt...

570
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,800
oh, cut the bull!

571
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,080
You shot at cherise!

572
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,090
To scare her.

573
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,770
But then...she screamed...

574
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,510
"and I thought...I thought I killed her.

575
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,520
And I panicked.

576
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,730
So, you had to kill melanie, too--
she was a witness.

577
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,990
Point of no return.

578
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,150
My dad beat me every night for that critter lover thing.

579
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,790
If he found out about this...
he'd kill me.

580
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,670
So I did what I had to do.

581
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,210
What, dale?

582
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:45,970
I put her in the car and drove...For hours.

583
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,990
Till we got to the west virginia state line.

584
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,330
Then what happened?

585
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,210
Then I pulled off the road.

586
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,630
It was dark and there was no one around.

587
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,320
Just us.

588
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,840
stop.

589
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,140
Right here.

590
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,930
Why'd you have to be friends with that critter?

591
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,190
why?

592
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,450
I just want to go home.

593
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,030
This is all your fault, you hear me.

594
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,520
'Cause you had to be friends with her.

595
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,870
Please.

596
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,130
Close your eyes.

597
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,030
I want my mommy.

598
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,620
You can't tell on me.

599
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,780
Please.

600
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,000
Not anymore.

601
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:16,190
And then I just...drove away.

602
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:35,910
No unidentified child murder victims
that age in west virginia, 1975.

603
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,880
Doesn't make sense.

604
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,080
Rural area.

605
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,660
Animals could've carried her off.

606
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,010
Or the body was never found.

607
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,120
Interstate files are a joke.

608
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,900
No national database on missing kids back then.

609
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,310
Kid crossed state lines, easy to fall through the cracks.

610
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,960
So even if the body was found, no way
to connect it to our missing philly girl.

611
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,270
Needle in a haystack.

612
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,860
Police report, west virginia, october '75.

613
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,500
State trooper found a girl just off route 1.

614
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,570
She was shot but alive.Head injury.

615
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,130
No memory of who she was or where she came from.

616
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,530
Transported to the county hospital in critical condition.

617
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,500
Then put in foster care.

618
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,950
Melanie's still alive?

619
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,890
Excuse me?

620
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,390
Are you jennifer robinson?

621
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,500
Yeah.

622
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,110
Philadelphia pd.

623
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,390
Okay.

624
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,790
You were a gunshot victim in '75.

625
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,100
Ain't you folks a little late to the party?

626
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,680
Hmy you don't remember the shooting?

627
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,130
Or where you're from?

628
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,330
Couldn't have been good, right?

629
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,310
Family was probably the reason
I was in those woods.

630
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,210
You're wrong.

631
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,840
Your mom and dad never stopped looking for you.

632
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,300
Never stopped hoping you'd
walk through their door again.

633
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,700
Is that right.

634
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,540
Their names are norman and frances campbell.

635
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,650
Good people.

636
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,150
I don't remember.Sorry.

637
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,660
They never forgot you, melanie.

638
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,760
Is that my name?

639
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,920
And your best friend was a girl named cherise.

640
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,890
She was with you that night, in the woods.

641
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,790
A lot of people still waitin'...
for you to come home.

642
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,050
I should get back to work.

643
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,450
You and cherise left notes for each other on the...

644
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,790
on the clothesline.

645
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,540
You believed in fireflies and fairies.

646
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,760
Please.Stop.

647
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,040
That's why he brought you into the woods.

648
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,390
Because you were brave.

649
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,170
In a world that wasn'T.

650
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:02,470
I remember...I wasn't alone.In the woods.

651
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,830
Because the fireflies were there...

652
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,660
telling me heaven had to wait.

653
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,060
'Cause I had to live.
