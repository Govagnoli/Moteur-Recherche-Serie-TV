00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
mark my words,lawrence,if these teetotalers get their way,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,940
- prohibition will be enacted.
- It'll never happen,sir.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,840
You can actually make your own record,frances.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,170
{\a6}June 9,1919

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,070
- In shellac,right,mother?
- And play it on your own gramophone.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,830
- Isn't that thrilling?
- Fascinating.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,380
A man's libation is sacred,worth going to war over.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,020
The war to end all wars wasn't enough for you,father?

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,080
Elizabeth,please restrain our young filly from eavesdropping.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,560
I'm 18,father,hardly a filly.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,760
Lawrence,I don't know how you tolerate frances's behavior the way you do.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,530
I find her spirit refreshing,if somewhat droll.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,380
And I find being spoken about as if I weren't present somewhat irksome.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,750
That is quite enough out of you.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,290
Mary pickford's got a new picture out.
Should we all go?

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,900
You two go.I've had my fill of female histrionics for one day.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,610
Don't frown,dear.
It makes you look so dour.

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,440
Votes for women.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
Ratify the 19th amendment so women can vote!

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,550
Speak of the devil.
Teetotalers themselves.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,060
Votes for women!

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,060
Ratify the 19th amendment so women can vote all across our great land.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,840
Votes for women.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,530
Votes for women.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,260
here we go again.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,340
A woman's place is in the kitchen!

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,170
Not rabble-rousing in the street!

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,540
You are the rabble-rousers.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,670
What on earth are you doing?

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,430
They're awfully brave.

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,550
They're an awful nuisance is what they are.

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,770
Are you detective rush?

34
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,190
- Yes.And you are?
- Emma stone.

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,860
My women's studies professor mentioned you in a lecture.

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,060
Really?

37
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,540
Yeah,she tracks women in traditionally male-dominated professions.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,670
Says you're the only female homicide detective in philly.

39
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,040
Well,there are two of us now,actually.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,220
em...My great-great aunt frances stone was murdered.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,240
- Great-great?
- 1919.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,210
She was thrown off the second story landing of my great-great grandfather's house.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,200
Old money: Grand houses and the families

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,740
who lived in them in turn-of-the-century philadelphia.

45
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,320
My grandmother's favorite book.
The earmarked pages are about my family.

46
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,670
Now that's what I call a house.

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,500
It's all gone now.
The house,the money.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,290
The suspects.

49
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,060
My grammy stone gave this to me before she died last week.

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,650
His name was lawrence wakelee.

51
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,740
He was frances's fiance.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,690
And that's frances?

53
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,410
She's beautiful.

54
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,170
They broke off the engagement just before she was killed.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,260
- Grammy stone say anything else?
- No.

56
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,550
but I found this...

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,810
hidden inside the locket.

58
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,050
I think it's a love letter.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,040
"My dearest phil,

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,790
if our secret passion's revealed,"our lives would be in great danger.

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,510
"We must proceed with caution.

62
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,890
Yours as ever,frances.

63
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,020
So franny was stepping out.

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,940
And maybe the fiance found out,killed her?

65
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,880
So you'll look into it?

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Solving this case isn't gonna bring back the good old days.

67
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,790
Frances's murder haunted my grammy stone.

68
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,330
She was as close to a mother as I ever had.

69
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,540
So you're doing this for her?

70
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,720
- Be our coldest job yet.
- Record breaker.

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,900
So...

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,030
what are we waiting for?

73
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,320
Let's break out the ice picks.

77
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,320
June 23,1919.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,670
Frances may stone died of injuries caused by a fall

79
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,230
- from the second story of their house.
- Broke her neck.

80
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,960
Scratches on the forearms,defensive wounds.

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,980
Means frances put up a fight.

82
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,190
Family wasn't home.
No witnesses,no leads.

83
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,570
Pretty thin.

84
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,870
The stones were rich.Father oed one of the largest breweries in philly.

85
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,920
You'd think there'd be a big investigation.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,340
Unless the family didn't want a scandal.

87
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,730
Keep their names out of the press.

88
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,340
So what do we got on our potential doer lawrence wakelee?

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,870
Just the locket,the note.

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,500
And these gossip columns the old hat squad had in their investigation.

91
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,220
"The setting could not have been more perfect "for the engagement

92
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,410
of mr.Lawrence wakelee to miss frances stone...

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,200
I had this made for you.

94
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,910
Who is this handsome devil?
I'd like to meet him.

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,310
Don't joke,frances.

96
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm sorry.
I'll treasure it.Thank you.

97
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,750
I had something else made for you,as well.

98
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,130
Will you marry me,frances stone?

99
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,540
Oh,lawrence,I don't know what to say.

100
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,480
I do.Because our life is going to be grand.

101
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,870
I know just the house we'll live in,that you'll run,d just the number of children we'll have and...

102
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,800
but I don't know if I even want to run a house or have children.

103
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,300
Frances...

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,840
- what kind of talk is that?
- I was accepted at vassar,you know.

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,860
But you've already found a husband.

106
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,810
Is that all you think college is for?

107
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,040
- I know you love your books,frances.
- I want to do more than read,lawrence.

108
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,990
I want to experience life firsthand.

109
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,640
I want to see the world,maybe write about it.

110
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,550
Your father already gave his blessing to our marriage.

111
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,770
So what I want is really beside the point,anyway,isn't it?

112
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,690
Frances,this should be the happiest day of your life.

113
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,780
- I mean,I am quite a catch,as they say.
- I know you are,lawrence.

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,460
Excuse me,ma'am,sir.

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,410
Both your parents were wondering if there was any news you'd like to convey.

116
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,510
Well,frances,is there?

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,310
Yes,there is.

118
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,350
tell them I have accepted the proposal of mr.Wakelee.

119
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,690
Oh,frances,you are going to be so happy.

120
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,590
I know you are.

121
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,430
Mr.Wakelee,miss stone.

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,000
The woman with the black eye,here in the corner...

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,970
her name is listed as philippa abruzzi,

124
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,210
housemaid.

125
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,380
Philippa.

126
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,980
Phil.

127
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,070
- Rush.Uh-huh.
- That's who frances's love note was addressed to.

128
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,650
No wonder she was so afraid of their secret passion being revealed.

129
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,720
Okay,thanks.

130
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,420
sorry,boss.Got to make a run.
I'll be back.

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,150
Get up,mom.

132
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,070
Lilly.em..
What..waht are you doing here?

133
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,960
I could ask you the same thing,but I won'T.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,840
Thank you for coming.
Now go away.

135
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,270
I don't want you to see me like this.

136
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Like it would be a first.

137
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,110
Oh.

138
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,150
Jackie left me.

139
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,980
when?

140
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,550
I haven't heard from him in five months.

141
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,610
Is that why you haven't returned my calls?

142
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,920
Call.

143
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Let's go,mom.

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,310
- squad car's gonna take you home.
- You can't?

145
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,690
No,mom.

146
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,630
Oh,right.
Your precious j-o-B.

147
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,290
I'll come by the apartment later.

148
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Don't bother.

149
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
We could've come to see you,audrey.

150
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,570
Oh,and miss the chance to get out of old folk's calisthenics?

151
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,040
Oh,please.

152
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
You're doing me a favor.

153
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,540
looks like you've been doing calisthenics.

154
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,980
We'd like to ask you some questions about your mother,philippa.

155
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,250
She worked for the stone family?

156
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,340
Oh,for ten years.

157
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,830
Can you tell us about her relationship with frances stone?

158
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh,sure.I grew up in that house

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,610
till the stones went broke on account of prohibition,

160
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,810
and they had to fire everyone.

161
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,980
Your mom and frances were close?

162
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,200
Oh,like sisters.

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,420
frances was a natural born teacher.

164
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,480
Taught my mom to read.

165
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,310
Unusual for the time,women from different classes getting close.

166
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,260
Oh,very.

167
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,010
But frances was a modern girl for her day.

168
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,430
Very progressive.

169
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,350
Any chance they were...

170
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,020
closer than sisters?

171
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,040
Like lovers?

172
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,310
Hmm,men love to think that,don't they?

173
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,530
We found what appears to be a love letter

174
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,670
from frances to your mother.

175
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,510
Very sorry to disappoint you,but no,they weren'T.

176
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,250
Although sometimes I wish they had been.

177
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,410
My mother had terrible taste in men.

178
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,680
Anyone you can think of,maybe get the wrong idea about your mom and frances?

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,910
All I know is

180
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,680
my mother and frances

181
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,320
did have a secret,

182
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,200
but it wasn't sexual.

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,540
- hi,aunt franny.
- Hello,audrey.

184
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,570
Will you read me a story later?

185
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,380
Yes,but I need to talk to your mother right now.

186
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,740
About her black eye?
My dad gave it to her.

187
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,280
Audrey...

188
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,600
go upstairs.

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,930
Is that true,phil?
He hit you?

190
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,320
It's your fault.You never should have taught me to read.

191
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,610
He hit you for reading?

192
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,110
For reading this.

193
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,050
He hates suffragettes.

194
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,460
- He should be arrested.
- For hitting his wife?

195
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,070
They'd have to arrest half the men in philadelphia.

196
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,320
I saw them passing these out getting pelted.

197
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,050
- I like how they don't back down.
- Me,too.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,660
There's a meeting tomorrow night.

199
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,670
If my husband caught me at a suffragette meeting...

200
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,120
if your husband came to a meeting,they'd string him up.

201
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,440
Now that's a sight I'd like to see.

202
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,040
Just think if we could vote,phil.

203
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,620
Men would have to listen to us.
Treat us like equals.

204
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,760
Now that's a sight I'd like to see.

205
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,520
My father treating me as something other than his little filly.

206
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,350
We could pass laws punishing men who beat their wives.

207
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,790
And audrey,she could become a lawyer...

208
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,860
send those jackasses to jail.

209
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,540
It hurts to even think about.

210
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,000
It hurts not to.

211
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,610
so their secret passion was political?

212
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,160
They were suffragettes.

213
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,680
Opens up a whole new suspect pool.

214
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,990
Like all the men who were opposed to women getting the vote.

215
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,580
Like frances's father.

216
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,160
Why's that?

217
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,590
Because he knew that women were the driving force

218
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,990
behind prohibition.

219
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,020
And prohibition is what ruined him.

220
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,020
grandma stone didn't like to toss much.

221
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,700
You really think frances's father might have killed his own daughter?

222
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,290
Well,if he thought she was betraying him,sure.

223
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,290
Seen murders happen for a lot less.

224
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,000
Check this out...sophie tucker.

225
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,460
She was elizabeth's favorite.

226
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,620
Ipod of 1919.

227
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,780
I think I found something.

228
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,450
What?

229
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,930
Frances's diary.

230
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,820
"june 14,1919.

231
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,010
"I should be overjoyed at lawrence's proposal,"

232
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,290
but all I can think about "is mother reading to me as a girl.

233
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,070
"How excited she was by the words,the places described.

234
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,000
the places described.

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,120
"And how she is now...

236
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
needlepointing her life away.

237
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,680
" Sounds like franny wanted more.

238
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,870
June 15,the last entry.

239
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,080
Anything about her father?

240
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,940
No,her first suffragette meeting.

241
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,280
"I felt like alice in wonderland entering that house

242
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,090
through the looking glass,"and peering into my very own future,"

243
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,900
one where my ideas were appreciated,not patronized,

244
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,350
by a woman unlike any I had ever met before.

245
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,370
Half the legislators are in favor of ratification.

246
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,610
And half are against,with less than a dozen undecided.

247
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,350
And the vote is in less than two weeks.

248
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,090
So the question is how to best influence those undecideds to our way of thinking.

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,850
- What do you think?
- Me?

250
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,850
Yes,you.

251
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,950
Well,I just came to listen,really.

252
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,410
You haven't had enough of listening to men decide our future?

253
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,150
I...

254
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,190
what was the question?

255
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,170
How to get the undecided men in the pennsylvania legislature

256
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,750
to ratify the 19th amendment.

257
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,100
Well,maybe,I...

258
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,750
I think we could picket their houses.
Let them know we know who they are.

259
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,720
That's very good,

260
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,320
miss...?

261
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,600
Stone.

262
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,250
Frances stone.

263
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,380
And this is philippa abruzzi.

264
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,290
and why are you here,frances?

265
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,800
I saw you on the street,standing up to those men.

266
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,980
Fearless...
I want to be like that.

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,010
A suffragette has to be tough,frances.

268
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,130
Tough enough to withstand shouts,

269
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,500
and projectiles and even fists.

270
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,730
- Are you ready for that?
- I'd like to think I am.

271
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,230
Pardon me,

272
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,860
ladies.

273
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,820
Frances,come along.

274
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,090
- But,mother.
- Now!

275
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,890
And you...

276
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,900
I dragged her here,mother.

277
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,620
No one just barges into my home uninvited.

278
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,330
You,and your kind,will leave my daughter out of your sordid affairs.

279
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,440
- will leave my daughter out of your sordid affairs.
- I came on my own accord,mother.

280
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
And you will leave on your own accord as well.

281
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,130
And if I refuse?

282
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,810
Someone will be looking for a new job.

283
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,260
Good day...

284
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,040
ladies.

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,060
We're not ladies,lady.

286
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,370
We're suffragettes.

287
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,390
this little rebellion of yours ends now,frances.

288
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,080
Or else.

289
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,650
diary ends there.

290
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,710
I had no idea there was a civil war going on in my family.

291
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,170
So it wasn't the dad that had it out for her.

292
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,010
It was mother against daughter.

293
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,640
And elizabeth wasn't the backing down type.

294
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,770
You mind if we take this with us?

295
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,740
My grandmother used to needlepoint these.

296
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,910
Domestic angels.

297
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,930
What's a "domestic angel"?

298
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,050
Perfect woman,or what they thought was one back then.

299
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,780
See any that look like me?
Single,working moms?

300
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,600
"A meeting of the philadelphia chapter "of the woman's suffrage association

301
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,180
will take place "on june 15

302
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,160
at the home of chapter president alice B.Harris.

303
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,120
" That's the same meeting elizabeth stone dragged frances out of.

304
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,690
There are notes on the back,handwritten.

305
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,770
Frances's?

306
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,480
"A woman's first obligation is to maintain domestic harmony.

307
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,490
" Sounds more like elizabeth.

308
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,620
Like she was preparing to give frances a lecture.

309
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,830
Yeah,and these are her talking points.

310
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,980
I cannot believe you dragged me out of that meeting.

311
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,790
How did you even know I was there?

312
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,950
did you go in my room?
Search through my things?

313
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,880
Lawrence told me you're having second thoughts about the engagement.

314
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,660
Oh!What is happening to you,frances?

315
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,510
Why should men have the right to vote and we shouldn't?

316
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,470
Because politics is a dirty business full of dirty men.

317
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,350
And we need to keep our hands clean,is that it?

318
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,030
We have a responsibility to remain above the fray.

319
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,110
Phil's husband beats her,do you know that?

320
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,610
That's their business.

321
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,600
And there is nothing she can do about it

322
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,200
because she doesn't have any rights.

323
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,380
And what about you,mother?

324
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,330
Needlepointing all night while father's out doing god knows what.

325
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,560
Your father has a business to run.

326
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,040
And you have what,a household?

327
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,280
Is that really all you want?

328
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,790
Why do you try and hide how smart you are?

329
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,480
It's like you're ashamed of it.

330
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,720
On the contrary,I'm proud of who I am.

331
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,560
Of this family.

332
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,420
Of your father's accomplishments.

333
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,410
If women get the vote,

334
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,840
prohibition will be enacted and this family will be ruined.

335
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,290
Is that what you want?

336
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,500
I want to accomplish something on my own.

337
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,100
And what about my accomplishments?

338
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,720
I've dedicated my life to this family,to who and what we are.

339
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,750
to who and what we are.

340
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,440
I won't survive our ruination.

341
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,970
But you can save us.

342
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,590
You know what they're up to.

343
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,870
You want me to spy on them?

344
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,640
A woman's lot in life is hard,frances.

345
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,200
Her choices few.

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,770
Please,mother,don't ask this of me.

347
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,790
The sooner you accept the truth,

348
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,690
the better off you'll be.

349
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,600
now that's a mom who knows how to lay down a guilt trip.

350
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,060
And if frances caved,betrayed the suffragettes like her mom wanted...

351
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,240
suffragettes become the suspects.

352
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,620
'Cause those women weren't fooling around.

353
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,470
Especially not with a benedict arnold in their midst.

354
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,520
Mom.

355
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,110
you wake?

356
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,080
I haven't had a chance to tidy up.

357
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,110
I don't have the energy i just used to have,you know?

358
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,540
Well,maybe if you eat something,it might help settle the vodka.

359
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,440
I feel so tired all the time.

360
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,190
What you need to do,mom,

361
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,340
is stop making excuses

362
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,590
and start going to your aa meetings again.

363
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,170
I will.

364
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,650
- I promise.
- That's what you said last time.

365
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,430
I've been cleaning up your messes since I was a kid.

366
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,280
I know.

367
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
Oh!

368
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,000
- It's got to stop.
- It will.

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,560
- I-I'm gettinin too old for this is.
- no,I'm the one that's getting too old for this.

370
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,140
- You think I like being like this?
- Sometimes I think you do.

371
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,610
I got a lot of good years left.

372
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,240
I could still meet someone,huh?

373
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,530
You clean up real nice.

374
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,410
You always have.

375
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,810
Yeah.

376
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,710
Well,that's exactly what I'm going to do.

377
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,730
I'm really going to do it this time.

378
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,520
Oh,I promise,lilly.

379
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,430
I promise.

380
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,010
Lilly rush?The only female homicide detective in philadelphia?

381
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,670
Well,there's two now.

382
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,900
And I'm detective vera,one of the nameless male horde.

383
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,920
your student,emma stone,

384
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,130
- came to see us about her relative's murder.
- How can I help?

385
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,950
You're an expert on the suffragette movement?Alice B.Harris?

386
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,320
Wrote my thesis on her.

387
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,440
Well,she might not be the hero you think she is.

388
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,510
What could possibly make you believe that?

389
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,720
Well,alice was the leader of the women's movement in philly,right?

390
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,340
Which means if someone betrayed her,she'd have the most to lose.

391
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,090
- Who would betray alice?
- Emma's relative,frances stone.

392
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,040
Because her family owned the brewery.

393
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,100
Wanted to put the suffragettes out of business because of their support of prohibition.

394
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,060
Frances spied on alice for her family.

395
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,670
And we think alice might have found out,

396
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,530
killed her.

397
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,430
- But frances stone wasn't a traitor.
- How do you know?

398
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,970
Because I had the honor of interviewing alice before she died.

399
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,670
She talked about frances?

400
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,690
I have the recordings in here.

401
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,640
Alice had high hopes for frances.

402
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,480
Then again,she had high hopes for the women's movement,too.

403
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,120
Wanted votes for women in every country.

404
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,370
Here's the file.

405
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,140
I remember one girl in particular

406
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,180
who I thought was the face of our movement.

407
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,190
All heart and no guile.

408
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,720
are you sure it's wise to put the legislators' names on the
banners,alice?

409
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,300
They have to know we know who they are.

410
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,830
Isn't that what you said?

411
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,390
- Remember,frances,we're only as strong...
- As our greatest fear.

412
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,750
Where's your friend,frances,the one who came to the last meeting with you?

413
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,140
- She couldn't make it.
- Did your mother fire her?

414
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,350
No,but...

415
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm not feeling very well.
Will you excuse me?

416
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,380
I know who your father is,frances.

417
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,950
- You do?
- I'm a suffragette,not a teetotaler.

418
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,210
If you knew,then why allow me to join your chapter?

419
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,440
Because I trust you.

420
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,080
You shouldn'T.

421
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,330
- You think you're trapped?
- I am.

422
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,080
You're a spoiled,rich girl living in a gilded cage.

423
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,360
But you are also a smart,passionate young woman who knows right
from wrong.

424
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,410
passionate young woman who knows right from wrong.

425
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,480
A woman who would never betray what she believes in.

426
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,050
How can you be so sure?

427
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,300
Because I was just like you not so long ago.

428
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,690
- You were?
- In over my head.

429
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,120
Not sure what I'd really got myself into.

430
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,040
Not even sure if it was worth it.

431
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,960
- But it was?
- We are going to change the course of history,frances.

432
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,490
How many people do you know who could say that?

433
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,160
this is an illegal gathering.
You're all under arrest.

434
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,930
- It wasn't me.I didn't tell anyone.
- I know.

435
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,820
What's the meaning of this?
There are no laws against a gathering of women.

436
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,850
- There's been a report of illegal activity.
- What illegal activity?

437
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,660
- Operating a bordello.
- That's absurd.

438
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,620
You want to add resisting arrest to the prostitution charges?

439
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,790
- You know when I said you had to be tough?
- I'm ready.

440
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,750
if women today knew what women back then had to go through,

441
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,180
they wouldn't take the vote for granted.

442
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,690
No mention in the murder file of frances ever being arrested.

443
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,620
That's odd.
Everyone at that meeting was.

444
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,880
It's documented.
June 23,1919.

445
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,920
It's the same day frances was killed.

446
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,820
Well,alice harris and four other women

447
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,410
were booked into broad street station at,uh

448
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,760
5:37 P.M

449
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,390
On june 23.

450
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,220
Incarcerated on charges of deviant sexual behavior

451
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,880
and resisting arrest.

452
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,830
Held for three days before a judge voided the charges.

453
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,660
Only one other woman was taken into custody at broad street that day.

454
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,690
Yeah.

455
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,720
Jane smith.

456
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
At 5:37.

457
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,430
A single white female placed in a holding cell until further notice.

458
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,890
Exact same time.
No way that's a coincidence.

459
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,360
Well,stone's a famous name in philly back then.

460
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
Yeah,jailor might have separated her out,

461
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,990
used smith as an alias because frances was a society girl.

462
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,030
6:23 P.m

463
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,800
A mr.Smith and jones request and receive permission to see the prisoner.

464
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,610
Well,according to the log,jailor escorted smith and jones to the cell,

465
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,670
noting how agitated the men were,

466
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,830
how the older one stood back

467
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,170
to let the younger one get the first crack at the prisoner.

468
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,510
Right this way, gentlemen.

469
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,660
Frances?

470
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,530
Lawrence?

471
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,630
How did you...?

472
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,280
All that matters is I'm here to get you out.

473
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,510
- They arrested us for no reason.
- I know,

474
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,300
but it's over now.
All this silliness.

475
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,420
Silliness?

476
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,890
They hit alice in the head with a nightstick.

477
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,700
We're going to forget about that now.
Move forward.

478
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,490
Get married.

479
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,000
Just like we talked about.

480
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,110
I don't want to get married.

481
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,130
I'm sorry,lawrence.

482
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,860
I want more for my life.

483
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,580
I tried,sir.

484
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,890
are you really willing to give up everything for this so-called cause?

485
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,740
Think before you answer,my dear,

486
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,050
because this could be the most important decision of your life.

487
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,770
What are you saying?

488
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,840
You've never been poor,

489
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,970
never been treated like a second-class citizen,but I have.

490
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,470
I have,too,father,every time you dismiss me as though I were
your little stupid filly.

491
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,850
every time you dismiss me as though I were your little stupid filly.

492
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm warning you,frances.

493
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Your beliefs won't keep you warm at night,or put food in your stomach.

494
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,390
- Are you threatening to disown me?
- Unless you change your mind.

495
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,190
Forswear those corrupting women,

496
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,300
right here,right now.

497
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,650
I can'T.

498
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm sorry,father.

499
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,620
So be it.

500
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,260
You're dead to me.

501
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,640
- And to your mother.
- Mother knows I'm here?

502
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,940
Your friend,philippa,told us everything.

503
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,600
Phil?
I don't believe it.

504
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,090
How do you think we knew about the meeting?

505
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,400
That can't be.

506
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,980
It's easy to have ideals when you're rich,frances.

507
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,790
Not so easy when you're poor.

508
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,250
As you're about to find out.

509
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,780
Father,wait!

510
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,710
well,rubber meets the road.

511
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,130
- Frances couldn't hack it.
- Yeah.

512
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,930
Mr.Smith,aka ambrose stone,

513
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,690
bailed frances out of jail that night.

514
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,610
All right.Couldn't have been easy going back home to the best friend who betrayed you.

515
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,990
Yeah.If I were frances,I'd have come down hard on phil.

516
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,220
Yeah,

517
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,450
and maybe phil fought back.

518
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,560
Hate to tell you this,audrey,

519
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,840
but looks like your mother,phil,

520
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,610
betrayed her best buddy.

521
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,550
Sold her down the river.

522
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,840
my mother loved frances.

523
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,440
She was the benedict arnold of the suffragettes.

524
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,950
Oh.

525
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,440
My mother was a good woman.

526
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,310
There's a reason

527
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,400
she didn't go to that second meeting at alice harris'S.

528
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,840
Because she tipped off the police.

529
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,120
It was all my fault.

530
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,710
you were seven years old.

531
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,170
You don't know what it was like for mothers back then.

532
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,310
Once a woman had a child,

533
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,750
she was helpless.

534
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,480
Helpless how?

535
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,950
I...

536
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,670
I promised her I'd never say.

537
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,240
But...

538
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,830
she had no choice.

539
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,320
- No choice about what,audrey?
- The times she lived in.

540
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,290
Well,murder's the same now as it was back then.

541
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,090
Yes,but being a woman was entirely different.

542
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,740
- how could you?
- Go away,frances.

543
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,790
- You tell me why first.
- You wouldn't understand.

544
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,850
Did my father pay you,is that it?

545
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,250
You think I would betray you for money?

546
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,280
Your husband beat you again.

547
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,140
I've been beaten before,and I'll get beaten again.

548
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,200
Then why?

549
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,760
For audrey.

550
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,800
He hurt her?

551
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,920
He said he'd divorce me,take me to court,

552
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,690
have me judged by a jury of his peers.

553
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,420
Because juries are all men.

554
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,550
And once they heard I was a suffragette

555
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,480
they'd take her away from me.

556
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,240
Never let me seemy own daughter again.

557
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
What can I do?

558
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,510
What choice did I have?

559
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,790
I betrayed us,too,phil,

560
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,590
and for a lot less.

561
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,280
For safety,

562
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,190
for my gilded cage.

563
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,120
It's a nice cage,frances.

564
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,570
No one can blame you for wanting to stay in it.

565
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,400
Alice said,"we're only as strong as our greatest fear.

566
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,340
" Mine is losing audrey.

567
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,350
I thought mine was being disowned,but it's not.

568
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,250
It's being a coward.

569
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,640
What are you going to do?

570
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,020
I'm going to go back to that jail,fight to get alice and the others out.

571
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,520
And get re-arrested?

572
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,190
I'd rather be in a cage with bars

573
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,260
than be here and hate myself.

574
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,390
- I'll go with you.
- No,no.

575
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,510
Audrey needs you more than we do.

576
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,330
be careful.

577
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,990
I'm through being careful.

578
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,520
my mother did what she had to do for me,

579
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,960
and frances did what she had to do

580
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,060
for all of us.

581
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,260
But someone stopped her before she had the chance.

582
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,910
Someone in that house,

583
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,280
listening to sophie tucker.

584
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,970
The police report said no one was home but the servants.

585
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,030
- But there was music playing?
- Sophie tucker,elizabeth's favorite.

586
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,680
There was only one gramophone.
That one,elizabeth'S.

587
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,370
Grammy stone said after frances died,

588
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,500
elizabeth became a recluse,shut herself up in her room.

589
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,330
With her needlepoint...

590
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,070
and books.

591
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,090
Hmm,there's a record here.
"The market street recording studio.

592
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,270
" Looks like elizabeth made a recording.

593
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,510
August 18,1920.

594
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,310
August 18?

595
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,340
Does the date mean something?

596
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,140
That's the date the 19th amendment was ratified,gave women the right to vote.

597
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,010
Odd day to make a recording,especially since elizabeth was against the whole thing.

598
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,930
How happy you would have been to know that

599
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,530
he day you dreamed of has finally arrived,my dear.

600
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,460
I'm making this record

601
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,510
so that I can play it alone

602
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,220
over and over again.

603
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,370
- And where do you think you're going at this hour?
- Out,mother.

604
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,410
Not if I have anything to say about it.

605
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,630
I'm through being told what to do by you.
Or anyone else for that matter.

606
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,720
Except that coven of riffraff.

607
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,950
- Why do they frighten you so much,mother?
- They don't frighten me.

608
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,040
Then come with me.
See for yourself what they are really like.

609
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,880
Don't be absurd.

610
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,980
Absurd is thinking women are just domestic angels.

611
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,480
Absurd is thinking we need men to decide how we should live.

612
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,320
Why can't you accept that I'm happy the way I am,

613
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,140
and you can be,too?

614
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,830
Because you're not happy,mother.
You're just too scared to admit it.

615
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,190
I am a wife and a mother.
What more can a woman ask for?

616
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,140
Her freedom.

617
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,730
Don't you want that?

618
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,000
What you want will never happen.

619
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,730
Can't you see I am trying to save you from disappointment?

620
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,330
You're the one who's disappointed,mother,

621
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,300
In the bill of goods you bought hook,line and sinker.

622
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm a realist,frances.

623
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,630
Hoping for a future that will never happen

624
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,230
is simply too painful.

625
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,980
So you do want more?

626
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,160
I am happy with what I have.

627
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,750
I'm sorry,mother,but this cage simply isn't big enough for me.

628
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,830
- It's not a cage.
- Yes,it is,you just can't see it.

629
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,440
How dare you.
My life is not a lie.

630
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,320
- Let me go,mother.
- No.

631
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm happy,damn it,happy!
