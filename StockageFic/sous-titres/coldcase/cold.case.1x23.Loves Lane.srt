August 16, 1986

3
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,371
You know that I'll never ever leave you.

4
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,835
I'll never ever leave you.

5
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:28,462
You know the anything me and you hear...

6
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,843
it's just jealous people talking.

7
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,890
No one has we have.

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,594
That's why they're jealous.

9
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:39,475
Can't wait for Paris until be an adult.

10
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,942
Can't wait either.

11
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,115
Wanna get in the car?

12
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:52,675
Come on!

13
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,014
Come on!

14
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:08,061
Who's Anna Mayes?

15
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,387
Don't know.

16
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:12,029
Says she knows you from West.

17
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,722
Oh, her.
She's detective.

18
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,610
Pain in the ass.

19
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,381
She called Lil.
She's bringing us something.

20
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,487
How are things going at home?

21
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:24,243
She went to her sister's.

22
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,257
Well, that's probably good
that she's, uh,

23
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,786
get some company
during the day, huh? / Mm.

24
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:31,270
Scotty Valens, Homicide.

25
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,189
Hey, Anna.

26
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,511
The big time looks good on you.

27
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,067
Anna says all your old CIs 
still ask after you.

28
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:42,148
Is that right? / They miss the 
steak dinners particular.

29
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,828
This is Lieutenant Stillman.

30
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,427
- Detective Mayes, 16th District.
- Well, Detective,

31
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,556
you got an angle on an old one, huh?

32
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,172
Sam Terrence. Just arrested him
on a loitering complaint.

33
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,443
Got to talking. Turns out he was just
sprung from Camp Hill after 18 years.

34
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,087
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

35
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,924
He was convicted of rape and murder.

36
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:01,318
DNA just showed they 
pinched the wrong guy.

37
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:05,333
Sam, join the party.

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,718
Hi, Sam. John Stillman.

39
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:10,182
Hey, I got to be at 
the Budget Wash on time.

40
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,896
I'll get you there.

41
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,200
These Detectives wanna hear 
about the Eve Kendall murder.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,745
Were you in the area, Sam?

43
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,296
I was collecting cans in the park.

44
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,502
Middle of the night, I get picked up
and ID'd as a killer.

45
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,257
- Who ID'd you?
- Boyfriend of the girl.

46
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:24,793
He was also attacked.

47
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:27,344
I did almost two dimes for it.

48
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:31,136
I was a young man 
when I went in there. Like you.

49
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:33,936
- This was, uh, '86?
- Lover's Lane. Teenagers.

50
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:37,179
She's raped and killed, 
he's left for dead.

51
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:41,699
The least we can do is figure out 
whose time you've been doing.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/05/23

62
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,387
Eve Kendall, 15.

63
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,486
Died from stab wounds.
No weapon recovered.

64
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,524
Boyfriend Mark Adams was attacked, too.

65
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,353
Concussion, shallow wounds.

66
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,283
Found at Lover's Lane, Fairmount Park.

67
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:28,080
Big make-out place in the summertime.

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,444
So you were there a lot.

69
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,703
How'd Sam become
the whipping boy for this?

70
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,770
He was half homeless and a boozer.

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,623
Only person in the area
Mark ID'd him from a lineup.

72
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,599
An ID we now know is bogus.

73
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,671
That plus the "shallow wounds"
makes me want to talk to Mark again.

74
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,125
Check it out.

75
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,231
What?

76
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,166
Kind of looks like you.

77
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,464
Sam told the cops about a couple parked

78
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:53,597
in a green Datsun a few spaces
away from Mark and Eve that night.

79
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,400
No follow-up.

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,675
They didn't believe him?

81
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:57,235
So maybe that's a job for you.

82
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,212
What? Tracking green Datsuns from '86?

83
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:04,059
It's glamorous, being in Homicide.

84
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,249
I know I saw that guy.

85
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,594
You got knocked out, though, right?

86
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:12,585
But I saw him. I'm positive.

87
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,124
Thing is, an eyewitness being sure

88
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:17,495
has no correlation to them being right.

89
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,282
Sam Terrence is out of jail.

90
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,612
We're looking at other possibilities now.

91
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,426
I'll help if I can.

92
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:26,496
Remember seeing anyone else 
in the park that night?

93
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,651
It was 18 years ago.

94
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,027
Maybe another couple parked nearby?

95
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,122
No. I don't remember that.

96
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,111
Were you and Eve having 
any problem before she died?

97
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,488
We were completely happy.

98
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,362
Recent fights...?

99
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:42,859
I just said we were completely happy.

100
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:46,535
Was she worried about any unwanted attention?

101
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,667
Eve got all kinds of attention,
but it didn't worry her.

102
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,730
We'll live in Paris, like expatriates.

103
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,772
You'll write plays for me.

104
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,749
And poem.

105
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:58,866
And I'll read them out loud at cafes.

106
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,034
- We'll live in a garret.
- What's that?

107
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,036
It's where artists live.

108
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:08,152
With no heat.

109
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,956
Someone's staring at you.

110
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,386
Come on.

111
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:20,855
Everyone stares, 
'cause you're so pretty.

112
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:22,531
What do we do for money?

113
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:26,395
Nothing. We hate money.

114
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,889
See you later? / Okay.

115
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,039
Bye.

116
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:42,384
What happened to you being a writer?

117
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:45,815
Family business.

118
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,837
Ever got you upset,

119
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,193
all that attention she got?

120
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:52,455
No. I felt lucky I was her guy.

121
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,483
Eve was the heartbreak of my life.

122
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,971
We were gonna be together forever.

123
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,537
First love?

124
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,408
It broke me losing her.

125
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,381
It's weird how much you look like her.

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,724
Wayne Larkin?

127
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,488
Is it about the trash?

128
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:22,027
It's about Eve Kendall.

129
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,905
She was murdered...
1986.

130
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:27,532
Oh, yeah.

131
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,026
Trying to watch the program.

132
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,052
It's the cops, Dad.

133
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,313
Outside.

134
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,484
Diabetes and gout.

135
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:38,669
So how did you know Eve?

136
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,454
We both worked at the mall.

137
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,860
We were sort of weekend friends.

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,497
In our write-up, it says you
saw her the day she died.

139
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:49,126
Uh... around 5:00 after work.

140
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,755
Saw her at the bus stop.

141
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,859
Her boyfriend Mark didn't 
pick her up after work?

142
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,747
Oh, he dropped her off a lot,
but she took the bus home.

143
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,640
She talk about her boyfriend to you?

144
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,541
Yeah. I guess he was pretty possessive.

145
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,899
Really? / Yeah, but I don't think
the feeling was mutual.

146
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,272
She was still, uh,

147
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:10,638
you know, looking around.

148
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,231
You work till 11:30?

149
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:17,732
Yeah, 'cause after the movie,
I got to sweep up all 
the popcorn and leftover junk.

150
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,648
That's so late.

151
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:21,913
You're a Summer.
You should wear baby pink.

152
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:25,737
I don't mind. 
I like being at work.

153
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,811
You know, I-I can get you in free.

154
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,562
Yeah?

155
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,855
Yeah. Tonight even, 
if you want.

156
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:34,935
Top Gun. 7:00 and 9:30.

157
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,555
Maybe.

158
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,298
Remember me?

159
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,500
Yeah.

160
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,102
Peach-banana, well-blended.

161
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:52,744
You move pretty good.

162
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,322
Thanks.

163
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,314
You sing, too?

164
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,357
Yeah, I sing.

165
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,885
So you ever gonna take me up on my offer?

166
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,134
You mean about 3-2-1?

167
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:04,357
Yeah. It's a hot place.

168
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,821
I don't have I.D.

169
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,891
I'll get you in.

170
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,054
Can my friend come?

171
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,906
Sure.

172
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:15,182
How's tonight?

173
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:23,088
My mom leaves for work at 8:00.

174
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,894
So, who was this guy?

175
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:31,619
Worked in the music store.

176
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,268
I guess they met at the food court.

177
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,650
Do you remember a name?

178
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,697
You know, I want to say Max, uh...

179
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:41,289
but it was a pretty long time ago.

180
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,281
Mark has this girl up on a pedestal.

181
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,255
She was everything to him, his one and only.

182
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,027
But he apparently wasn't hers.

183
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,935
Sounds like the older dude 
took her out at least once.

184
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:53,236
Hmm, a week before she bought it.

185
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:54,843
So, either Mark was totally in the dark,

186
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:57,445
or he knew about the extracurriculars.

187
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,299
And maybe did something about it.

188
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,681
Him being possessive.

189
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:04,607
Oh, 16 years old, I find out 
my girl's stepping out on me?

190
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,277
That feels like the end of the world.

191
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,514
Pretty vicious crime for a teenage doer.

192
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:11,911
Wouldn't set any records, Lil.

193
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,424
Must be Eve's mom.

194
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:19,229
She was a super nice kid.

195
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:20,586
No enemies.

196
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,761
Any strange behavior from 
her those last few weeks?

197
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,328
Strange behavior was constant.

198
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,078
One thing was a little off.

199
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:29,474
She wanted to borrow $200.

200
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:31,717
Wouldn't say why.

201
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,698
What did you think of 
her boyfriend Mark?

202
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,607
Nice. Especially for a rich kid.

203
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:37,922
He treat Eve okay?

204
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:40,108
Yes, called about four times a night.

205
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,725
Like he was checking up on her?

206
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,701
I just took it as kids in love.

207
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,283
Did you ever hear of a guy named Max?

208
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,932
Oh, you bet I did.

209
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,902
That jerk came to my house!

210
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,034
Don't forget to call before you go to sleep.

211
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,436
What? 
You tummy hurt?

212
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:01,288
No. I don't know.

213
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:05,058
- Need me to stay home, baby?
- No, Mom, go.

214
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:13,820
Uh... Good evening.

215
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,039
Yes?

216
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,234
Is Eve here?

217
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,152
Who are you?

218
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:20,366
I'm Max... Tanning.

219
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,842
Well, turn around Max.

220
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:22,755
Mom!

221
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,233
How old are you?

222
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,115
Um...

223
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:27,862
'cause she's 15!

224
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:31,077
Ok, no harm, no foul.

225
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,293
Walk away.

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,639
Mother!

227
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:41,217
You can wait makeup... / Why?

228
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,218
You don't know how you look to the world!

229
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:44,580
What are you talking about?

230
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,574
'Cause you're young.

231
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:49,091
But not so young that people 
don't see you and think things.

232
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:50,887
- I can handle it, Mom.
- And want things.

233
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:54,403
- You don't even understand.
- I can handle it!

234
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,426
Did Mark know about this guy?

235
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,926
I don't know.

236
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:02,808
There was a lot 
I didn't know with Eve.

237
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,475
She was in that hard teenage stage.

238
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,442
I'm familiar.

239
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:14,349
I was just waiting till 
she got... to her twenties.

240
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,294
We could be friends again.

241
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:17,787
Right.

242
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,702
But we never got there.

243
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,757
If I'm 15-year-old girl,

244
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:29,667
why do I need $200?

245
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,936
And why not get it from 
the rich boyfriend?

246
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,310
Maybe it had something 
to do with this older guy.

247
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,467
You mean some she didn't 
want Mark knowing about?

248
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:40,245
Her mom said Eve was feeling 
queasy that night creepo came over?

249
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:41,391
Pregnant?

250
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:42,569
Maybe he knocked her up.

251
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,735
She can't tell her mom 
or home-sliced Mark.

252
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,276
Autopsy didn't show that.

253
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:47,686
Well, let's double check.

254
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,625
Well, that would give motive 
to the older guy...

255
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,950
say she wanted to keep it.

256
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,402
Or Mark, same motive.

257
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:56,511
Let me go back to him. 
Solo.

258
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:59,612
I'd better zip. 
I'll go down with you.

259
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,343
My boss sends his regards.
Lieutenant Doherty.

260
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,390
Yeah, we worked the streets together.

261
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,182
And if you got an extra desk around here,

262
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,630
he'll recommend me for keeps.

263
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,000
Subtle, Mayes.

264
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,534
You two want her to find Creepo?

265
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,401
So, Eve being pregnant?

266
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,538
It's impossible.

267
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:23,300
How come?

268
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,931
We hadn't gone all the way yet.

269
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,297
That garret in Paris, 
that was gonna be the place.

270
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:31,272
But if there was another 
guy in the pictures... / No, no.

271
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,093
There was, Mark. 
Someone named Max.

272
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,885
There was no other guy.

273
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:38,107
Yeah, you don't... didn't know Eve.

274
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:40,554
I know what it's like being 15.

275
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,621
How flattering it is to have 
an older guy giving you attention?

276
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,987
- Eve wouldn't have cheated on me.
- And what if she did?

277
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,093
What would you have done to her?

278
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,906
I didn't kill her.

279
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,356
I loved her.

280
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,004
People kill people they love.

281
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,417
I got attacked myself, 
for God's sake.

282
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,177
She was murdered. 
You had minor wounds.

283
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:59,854
Do you have a soul mate?

284
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:02,335
'Cause if you did, 
you would understand Eve and me.

285
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,808
I understand you were 
controlling with her.

286
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:08,646
So you've never been in love like that.

287
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:11,912
Mark?

288
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:15,518
You'll picked them up? / Yeah.

289
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,578
Five O'clock.

290
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,442
Uh... we've been having a rocky time.

291
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:24,644
She senses the truth.

292
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:27,233
Which is?

293
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:32,884
That I loved Eve more than anyone.

294
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,173
Vaguely familiar.

295
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:49,086
1986.
Worked at the Smoothie Spot.

296
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,643
You went to her house one night,

297
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:53,612
her mom made you for the sleazebag
you were kicked your ass out.

298
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,393
Oh, her.

299
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,816
One of the many youngsters in your past?

300
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,424
I met her at the food court.

301
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:01,931
Struck up a conversation,
and eventually

302
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:03,668
I asked her
did she wanna go dancing.

303
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,986
Is that all you were after,
a dance partner?

304
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,385
Did I find her attractive?

305
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,720
Yes.

306
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,476
Did I know she was 15?
No.

307
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,802
So you made a date with her.

308
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,792
Hey, let's not make her 
the babe in the woods

309
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,765
and me the Big Bad Wolf here, okay?

310
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:16,996
Sounds accurate to me.

311
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:19,133
I made an honest mistake.

312
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:22,698
Her mom flew in on 
the broomstick, I split.

313
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,699
Hour later, who shows up at the club...

314
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,549
Max.

315
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,366
Hi.

316
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,514
Well, look  at that.

317
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:35,435
You made it.

318
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,459
Yeah.

319
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,123
My mom finally left.

320
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,233
No problems getting in?

321
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,621
They didn't even ask.

322
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:44,984
The world smiles on pretty girls.

323
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:47,031
Uh, you remember my friend Carrie.

324
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,151
How you doing? / Hi.

325
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,687
Let me ask you something.

326
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,811
You ever think about making a video?

327
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:54,025
What do you mean?

328
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,760
You've seen MTV, right?

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,645
Cyndi Lauper, Madonna.

330
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:58,771
Belinda Carlisle.

331
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,024
'Cause I think you got something.

332
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,226
Really?

333
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,753
My store in Atlantic City,

334
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:04,800
we have this sound booth.

335
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,505
We could book some time, 
make a demo, see how it go.

336
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,265
I've never been to Atlantic City.

337
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm going next weekend.
I'm staying with my cousin.

338
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,085
Think about it.

339
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,326
Come on, let's dance.

340
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,616
Danced a few dances,
then I lost her.

341
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,167
She left with her friend.

342
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,882
You didn't take her to Atlantic City?

343
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:34,141
Nah.

344
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:38,036
- That was just dumb talk.
- Did she know that?

345
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:42,474
Hey, how much did it cost, 
renting that sound booth?

346
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:45,406
200 bucks a session.

347
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,280
The autopsy's conclusive.

348
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,352
Eve wasn't pregnant. In fact,

349
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,183
she was probably 
a virgin before the rape.

350
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:53,517
Well, that backs up Mark's claim.

351
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,658
- And, I guess, Max's.
- What's his story?

352
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:59,568
Well, he and Eve talked about making
a demo video, price tag, 200 bucks.

353
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:00,823
Oh. What kind of video?

354
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:03,254
Singing and dancing, 'cause maybe
she was the new Madonna.

355
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,911
Oh, that'll work on a 15-year-old.

356
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:07,815
Vera found Eve's friend Carrie.

357
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,086
He's upstairs with her now.

358
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:13,941
Well, maybe she knows where Eve 
came down on Max versus Mark.

359
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,445
I remember Max from the music store.

360
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,432
Him and Eve have something going on?

361
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:22,387
She had a boyfriend, Mark.

362
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:23,852
We've met him.

363
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,152
Yeah, she really loved him.

364
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:28,588
So why's she sneaking out at night
to go meet Max?

365
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,087
We were kids, you know.

366
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:34,306
Max says he never saw 
Eve after that night at 3-2-1.

367
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,354
He didn't mention Atlantic City?

368
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:38,207
Said that idea never took off.

369
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,819
No, they were going.

370
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,262
It was all she talked 
about the next day.

371
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,415
Thanks, Wayne.

372
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,939
And don't tell about Atlantic City.

373
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,658
I don't think it's a good idea, Eve.
I don't trust that Max guy.

374
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,055
Me, neither.

375
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,669
Well, he wants me to make a video.

376
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:59,543
You know what he really wants.

377
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:02,378
Come on. / Personally, 
I think he's sleazy.

378
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:04,629
Why do you want to do 
that to Mark, anyway?

379
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,729
I'm not doing anything to Mark.

380
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:08,956
I think he just wants 
to make a move on you.

381
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,732
Well, I wouldn't let that happen, okay?

382
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,493
You want to go do something...

383
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,059
the three of us?

384
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,821
Well, I'm meeting Mark.

385
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:22,997
But you and Carrie should go.

386
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,052
Her boyfriend's like the 
nicest guy in the whole school.

387
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:43,308
Yeah, I've seen him.
He brings her to work sometimes.

388
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:47,299
I could get us free into the movies.
Top Gun.

389
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,403
I already saw it.

390
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,284
Me, too.

391
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:57,313
You ever just want to leave?

392
00:18:57,313 --> 00:19:00,846
Just go away, forever?

393
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:05,583
Drive, and drive,
till you get to California?

394
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,805
Not really.

395
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:13,293
Wanna hang out?

396
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,430
Okay.

397
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,772
We both told Eve not to go,

398
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:24,894
but, well, she kept saying 
she could handle it.

399
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,817
Well, what kind of car 
did Wayne drive?

400
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:32,437
This beat-up old Datsun.

401
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:38,569
Carrie said that Wayne from the mall
drove a green Datsun in '86.

402
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:43,230
A '78 B-210 was registered to 
a Jim Larkin. Probably his dad.

403
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,620
The same type of car Sam thought 
he saw the night Eve was killed.

404
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,870
Hey.

405
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,528
Don't look so wonderful,
cops comin' here for me.

406
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:56,283
I badged the boss. 
Told him what it's about.

407
00:19:56,283 --> 00:20:00,172
Want you to look at some pictures, Sam.

408
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,795
That's the guy in the Datsun.

409
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,152
You sure?

410
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,201
I mean, I don't wanna say definitely but...

411
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,831
You think you saw him before.

412
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:11,820
That night.

413
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,969
It's what my mind is telling me,

414
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,489
but I wouldn't swear to it.

415
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,770
But your gut reaction is 
this kid was there that night.

416
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
With a heavy-looking girl.

417
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,805
Heavy, huh? / But I couldn't put 
my hand on a Bible and say it.

418
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,767
I better jump back in here.

419
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:49,671
An eyewitnesses puts you 
at the scene, Wayne.

420
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:51,465
- What do you mean?
- Lover's Lane.

421
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,265
You were there that night...

422
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,763
in your Datsun with a girl.

423
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:56,602
No.

424
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,265
A big girl.
Like Carrie.

425
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:00,858
That's crazy.

426
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,356
See, I think you had it bad for Eve.

427
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:06,171
But you didn't have a shot there,

428
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:08,730
so you went for the friend.
That's common enough.

429
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,141
- I gotta be at the airport.
- So, you go parking with Carrie.

430
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,393
But she's not really rocking your world.

431
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:16,753
After a few Tall Boys, 
you're feeling pretty loose.

432
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,416
And there's Eve with Mark 
just a few spaces over,

433
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,786
doing stuff she'd never do
to Wayne Larkin.

434
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:24,056
I was never at Lover's Lane with Carrie.

435
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:25,493
You can polygraph me.

436
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,537
You hung out with her the weekend before.

437
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,637
Carrie told us.

438
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,511
We watched TV.

439
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:33,111
I didn't dig her,
she didn't dig me.

440
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,294
It was a nonevent.

441
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,584
Were you pissed off about Eve
going to Atlantic City, Wayne?

442
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,150
I thought it was a bad idea,
but it was her life.

443
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,286
- So you didn't try to stop her?
- I helped her.

444
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:47,956
She borrowed 200 bucks,
so she could run off 
with that statutory rapist.

445
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:49,180
You loaned Eve the money?

446
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,127
And that guy Max was so sleazy,

447
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:56,279
he wouldn't give it 
back to me after she died.

448
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,441
There was no trip to Atlantic City.

449
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,695
Yeah, but there was supposed to be.

450
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,080
Eve even gave you the money.

451
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,030
- She was a kid.
- That wasn't stopping you.

452
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,004
You had it all set up
for a Saturday night score in A.C.

453
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:10,365
I'm telling you, she was a kid.

454
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:11,460
You liked kids.

455
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,442
That's why you hung out at 3-2-1.

456
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:16,232
Too bad that joint got shut 
down for serving to minors.

457
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:19,217
Where do you hang out now,
high schools?

458
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:22,012
I didn't do anything to that girl.

459
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,543
I'm the one who called it off.

460
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,578
You ready?

461
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,326
I'm ready.

462
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,616
What's the sleeping bag for?

463
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,620
Well, we're staying over, right?

464
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,298
Yeah, you're not gonna need that.

465
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:48,558
Is there a guest room?

466
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:49,938
No.

467
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:53,436
Then...

468
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:55,115
where am I sleeping?

469
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,431
Eve, we're going on a trip here.

470
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:59,047
Together.

471
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,477
Yeah, I know.

472
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,765
Okay, you a grown-up or not?

473
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,839
'Cause if not, you should stay here.

474
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,637
Go have hot fudge sundaes with
your girlfriend, you know. Play dolls.

475
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:16,109
You wanna go with me,
you gotta be an adult.

476
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:18,013
So you tell me.

477
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,890
You a kid?

478
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:23,781
Or are you a grown-up?

479
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:34,512
I guess I'm gonna need 
my 200 bucks back.

480
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,741
The money's already spent.

481
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:37,734
But...

482
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:39,784
It's spent.

483
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:43,960
Didn't get the booty you wanted,
figured you were owed something?

484
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,290
Sounds more like pretty 
theft than calling it off.

485
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,414
The point is, we didn't 
go anywhere that day.

486
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:52,738
And that was the last I ever saw her.

487
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:57,085
So the D.A.'s really enjoying

488
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:01,632
all the publicity on him 
blowing the Kendall case.

489
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,364
That's his problem.

490
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:04,825
Yeah, and mine,

491
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:08,159
if he ships me off to Welfare Fraud.

492
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,556
For what?

493
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:13,829
For associating with the troublemaker.

494
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,092
What, your dealer?

495
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:28,552
Hi.

496
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:31,686
Hi. / I'm sorry.

497
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:34,046
I just needed to...

498
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:36,962
I looked you up.

499
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,354
I-I keep thinking about her.

500
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,308
I'll just be five minutes.

501
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,263
She'd hate who I am now.

502
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:00,762
Workaday.

503
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,606
Bourgeois.

504
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:04,004
Practical.

505
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,157
Yeah.

506
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,596
But we wanted... 
we wanted exciting lives.

507
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:10,651
Like yours.

508
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:15,651
Oh, it's, uh, not so exciting. / No?

509
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:22,868
No. It's more like I watch other 
people's lives from a front row seat.

510
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,699
Are you who you thought you'd be?

511
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,522
I mean, when you were 15?

512
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:29,955
No. No, I...

513
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,436
I had a whole other plan for 
what I wanted.

514
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:35,987
And?

515
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:41,097
It was impossible.

516
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:48,002
Well, I'm glad you came along.

517
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:51,084
I mean, I feel... I feel awake again.

518
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:55,963
You've been living a life...

519
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,243
No...

520
00:25:57,243 --> 00:26:01,128
I've been going through paces.

521
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:04,765
Like it was all forgotten,
buried away with her, but

522
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,318
now...

523
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:13,075
- I remember everything.
- Floods back, huh?

524
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:17,502
Like it was yesterday.

525
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:25,939
I still love her.

526
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,025
Mark...

527
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:31,641
Wendy knows and I-I...

528
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:32,952
I couldn't stay there tonight.

529
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:36,258
I just, I just wanted to be with...

530
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,474
with her.

531
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:45,550
And I found myself coming to you.

532
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:55,292
Oh, crap.
It's... it's 3:00.

533
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:56,823
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

534
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,677
- I.I lost... I lost track of time.
- Well, you're busy.

535
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:02,457
You're busy, so I'll see you
tomorrow. / Kite...

536
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:05,653
I'll see you tomorrow.

537
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:12,062
We got a new theory, Carrie.

538
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,604
You and Wayne.

539
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:15,062
Me and Wayne, what?

540
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:17,715
You were both nursing 
some hard feelings towards Eve.

541
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:19,169
Him 'cause he was so hung up on her,

542
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:20,766
and you 'cause she got all that attention.

543
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:24,560
Maybe you too got tired of her
being the queen bee all the time.

544
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,572
Started talking revenge.

545
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,735
I didn't talk to Wayne about anything.

546
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:32,050
I know what it's like being 
the fat kid in high school, Carrie.

547
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,436
It's a misery.

548
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,557
It's not great.

549
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,071
Changing for gym class 
in front of everybody.

550
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:40,754
Going to pool parties
and wearing your shirt the whole time.

551
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:43,718
Girls like Eve prancing around
in bikinis, getting ogled.

552
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:47,636
Always their friend,
never the girlfriend, right?

553
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:52,095
That could lead to some dark thoughts.

554
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:55,845
Maybe Wayne did something... 
but not me.

555
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,556
His car was seen at Lover's Lane,
night of the murder.

556
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:00,995
Two people inside.

557
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,687
We were thinking it was you with him.

558
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:06,813
You must be joking.

559
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,862
I hated Wayne.

560
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:12,874
Oh, what was to hate?

561
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:20,261
I love this part when the pizza 
comes to Mr. Hen's class.

562
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:22,812
Yeah, it's funny.

563
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:33,666
Oh, Dad, I thought you were asleep.

564
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,155
How's it going?

565
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:40,571
Good.

566
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:41,980
You seen this before.

567
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,038
Yeah.

568
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:46,091
Come in here.

569
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,974
I got something better on.

570
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:51,087
- I don't know.
- Brings the beers with you.

571
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:53,874
No big deal.

572
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,368
Are you coming?

573
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,983
I really wanna watch this.

574
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:10,632
Can't you ever bring a good one?

575
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:20,573
What happened in the bedroom?

576
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:23,611
What do you think?

577
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,006
And you didn't report it?

578
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,804
"Mom, could we call the cops?

579
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:37,311
'Cause I got drunk with some guy,

580
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:39,956
and then his dad said 
to come into his room..."

581
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,043
Right.

582
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:45,358
And there's the humiliation factor.

583
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:48,955
After he finished,

584
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,473
he told me to get my giant ass out.

585
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,680
You bring girls home to your dad 
as a regular thing, Wayne?

586
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,152
We've been talking to Carrie Plummer again.

587
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:11,645
- I should be working.
- Forget work.

588
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:14,513
He made me.

589
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,654
Made you what?

590
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:19,962
Get girls. / You were 18, Wayne.
That's an adult.

591
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:23,601
He terrorized me my whole life.
He still does.

592
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:26,795
You still go strolling for girls, 
bring 'em home to dad?

593
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:29,089
No. That stopped.

594
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,076
When?

595
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:33,641
After Eve.

596
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,692
You brought Eve home?

597
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,371
My dad's gonna kill me.

598
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:40,440
Come on, Wayne.

599
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:45,479
The right thing is to tell.

600
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:48,840
Win or lose, I should tell.

601
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,688
That day, when I saw her 
at the bus stop.

602
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,165
Thought you left already.

603
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:04,662
Yeah.

604
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,580
What about Atlantic City?

605
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,183
I didn't go.

606
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:24,943
So you're not gonna make that video?

607
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,981
I gotta make it up to Mark.

608
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:34,992
Do I tell him and ask to be forgiven?

609
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:40,190
Or do I never let him know 
how stupid I was?

610
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:44,404
Don't ask me.

611
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,909
Could you give me a ride, Wayne?

612
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:52,717
I gotta be home. 
My dad's medication time is soon.

613
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:55,466
Okay, I'll go with you 
and then you can drop me off.

614
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:57,264
I have to change to meet Mark.

615
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,689
It's probably not a good idea.

616
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:03,357
Why not?

617
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,246
How about we go away?

618
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:10,079
What?

619
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,663
Drive and drive, as far away as 
we can go towards California.

620
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:18,352
What are you talking about, Wayne?

621
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:21,178
Taking you to California.

622
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:23,406
Wouldn't you like that?

623
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:27,979
'Cause I would. 
I would love that.

624
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,843
That's crazy.

625
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:39,508
Yeah, 'course it is.

626
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,963
Hop in.

627
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,102
After Carrie, 
Dad wanted a good one.

628
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,829
So you brought him Eve.

629
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:55,687
Usually I could only get 
girls from the theater to come back.

630
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,665
Girls I let in for free, you know?

631
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:02,647
They were mostly homely and all.

632
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,207
But dad got real excitied 
when he saw Eve.

633
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:07,109
And he did to her what he did to Carrie.

634
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09,413
He tried.

635
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:12,328
She called him names,

636
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:15,877
ran out of there,
said she would tell the cops.

637
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:20,090
And that got him mad like I never seen.

638
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,879
So what did he do about it?

639
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:23,899
I can't say any more.

640
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:30,166
He'd kill me. 
I don't wanna talk anymore.

641
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,073
Remember that fat girl, 
Sam thought he saw with Wayne?

642
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:36,013
We think it was actually Pops Larkin.

643
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,331
The guy is Jabba the Hut with a mullet.

644
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,093
From the back, at night...

645
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:42,468
And you think they were targeting the Eve?

646
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:44,400
Wayne brought her home earlier that day.

647
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,637
Jabba tried to grope her, 
she didn't go for it.

648
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:48,531
Sassed him pretty good.
Said she'd rat him out.

649
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,797
So he and Wayne went driving 
that night, found Eve and Mark.

650
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,236
Where is this Jabba?

651
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:55,145
Drunk in front of the tube probably.

652
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,759
He don't leave the hut.

653
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,206
He does now.

654
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,334
You guys go ahead.

655
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:12,975
So, thanks and sorry about the...

656
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:15,117
That's okay.

657
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:21,285
I've made a mess of my marriage,
and your situation.

658
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:22,370
I said it's okay.

659
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,051
And I don't know what I'm going to do.

660
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:28,279
'Cause this-this Eve thing...

661
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:35,211
Mark, she was as sweet as 
you remember.

662
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:38,319
But she was mixed up, too.

663
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,716
Like any 15-year-old.

664
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:42,665
You're talking about that older guy.

665
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:45,758
I'm just saying even if she had lived,

666
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:49,029
you still might not have 
the life you talked about.

667
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:53,479
'Cause you were kids 
when you dreamed it up.

668
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,364
Maybe.

669
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,234
Or maybe...

670
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:03,585
maybe she was the best thing 
that ever came my way,

671
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:06,945
and nothing that good is possible.

672
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:10,709
Now, let's say that's true.

673
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:13,959
But you are here.

674
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:17,297
She's not.

675
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:21,982
No. But...

676
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:27,630
I'm not her.

677
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,245
No.

678
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:36,251
I gotta be someplace.

679
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:55,244
I'm really sorry.

680
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:57,795
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

681
00:35:59,263 --> 00:36:00,605
What happened with that guy?

682
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:04,356
Oh, he left. 
Five minutes after you did.

683
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:08,010
You got a funny definition of five minutes.

684
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,842
It was work, Kite. / Really?

685
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:11,369
Was he, was he, um. confession?

686
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,676
You know how the job is.

687
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:14,553
Yeah, the job.

688
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:16,642
The job.

689
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:20,769
That's always going to be the thing.

690
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:21,854
What does that mean?

691
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:23,855
We all got jobs.

692
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:26,124
We don't all put them ahead of 
every other things in our lives.

693
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,301
Look, this guy left his wife.

694
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:31,715
And came to you.

695
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,036
And there you were.

696
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:40,338
He was in a crisis. / Look, Lilly.

697
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:45,566
You want save people at 3:00 
in the morning, great.

698
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:48,116
God bless.

699
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:51,449
I know I screwed up.

700
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:56,414
It's just who you are, you know,

701
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,984
and-and I admire it.

702
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,971
I do.

703
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,869
But, uh,

704
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:13,389
I don't wanna live like that.

705
00:37:19,593 --> 00:37:23,582
I'll see you, okay?

706
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:32,036
Wayne's in trouble?

707
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:33,504
You're both in trouble.

708
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:34,487
What did I do?

709
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:37,017
I don't leave my place,
I got the gout.

710
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,704
This dates back to when you 
did leave, once in a while.

711
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:43,453
August, '86.
Lover's Lane.

712
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:45,978
I don't know what you're talking about.

713
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:48,094
The rape and murder of Eve Kendall.

714
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:49,690
Your boy's been talking.

715
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,019
Wayne is a liar.

716
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,652
Carrie Pummer's been talking, too.

717
00:37:53,652 --> 00:37:56,171
About you raping her when she was 15.

718
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:58,009
A lot of girls been around here.

719
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,422
Anything that happened was voluntary.

720
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:03,694
Really? / They were cows.

721
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:04,841
Should'be thanked me.

722
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,699
Who else was gonna give it to 'em?

723
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,880
You got personality plus there, Jimbo?

724
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,165
Lay of the land, Jim.

725
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,502
We got sperm from whoever 
raped and killed Eve.

726
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:15,111
We got three bags of your 
beer bottles in the hall out there.

727
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:18,102
We compare DNA from your saliva
on them bottles to the spunk?

728
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:23,201
End of you being free to sit 
your fat ass on that couch all day.

729
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,284
- Where the hell is Wayne?
- Locked up.

730
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:26,957
I'm gonna kill that stupid kid.

731
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:31,760
Might as well give it up, Jim
Curtain's falling.

732
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:40,524
They both should have died.

733
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:43,141
But Wayne, he was so weak.

734
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:45,983
He couldn't pull off his part.

735
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:50,518
Call me disgusting?

736
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,612
I'll show her disgusting.

737
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,540
Let's just go home, Dad. / Oh, no.

738
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,033
Girls thinks so much of herself.

739
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,874
We're gonna pull her down off 
her high horse.

740
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,161
Then we're gonna give it to her good.

741
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,752
Can't you just forget it?

742
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:10,146
I'll meet another girl...

743
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:13,160
No, no, we're getting this one.

744
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,458
Here.

745
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,223
Take care of the kid.

746
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:33,529
What the hell?

747
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:37,901
Remember us,
you haughty little bitch?

748
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,203
- Wayne?
- Kill the kid, Wayne.

749
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,230
- Wayne, what are you doing?
- Take the bottle and kill him.

750
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,625
Come on, Dad... / Shut up!

751
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,880
I got the girl.
Deal with him.

752
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,139
- Mark! No, Wayne. No!
- Shut your mouth!

753
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,049
Kill him, Wayne.

754
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:53,155
Don't you hear me?
Don't be weak!

755
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:56,193
Mark!
No! No!

756
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:28,391
# Steve Nicks의 'Leather and Lace' #

757
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,461
# Is love so fragile... #

758
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:41,544
# And the heart so hollow #

759
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:43,923
# Shatter with words... #

760
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:47,794
# Impossible to follow #

761
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:50,969
# You're saying I'm fragile... #

762
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,784
# I try not to be #

763
00:40:52,784 --> 00:41:00,295
# I search only... 
for something I can't see #

764
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:03,213
# I have my own life... #

765
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:12,270
# and I am stronger than you know #

766
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,702
# But I carry this feeling #

767
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:18,613
# When you walked into my house #

768
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:24,619
# That you won't be walking out the door #

769
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,573
# Still I carry this feeling #

770
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:31,060
# When you walked into my house #

771
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,805
# That you won't be walking out the door #

772
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:43,466
# Lovers forever... face to face #

773
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:46,521

777
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:58,215
# Give to me your leather... #

778
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:02,773
# Take from me... my lace #

779
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:10,068
# You in the moonlight #

780
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:12,930
# With your sleepy eyes #

781
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,018
# Could you ever love a man like me #

782
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:22,249
# And you were right #

783
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:25,566
# When I walked into your house #

784
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:31,085
# I knew I'd never want to leave #

785
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:34,192
# Sometimes I'm a strong man #

786
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:36,855
# Sometimes cold and scared #

787
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:40,578
# And sometimes I cry #

788
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:50,326
