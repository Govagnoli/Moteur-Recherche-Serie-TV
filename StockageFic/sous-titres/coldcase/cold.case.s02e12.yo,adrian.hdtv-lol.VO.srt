I'm okay, I'm okay.

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm not going down, Mo.

Attaboy, Jerry, attaboy!

17
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:24,174
C'mon, now!

That's it! That's it!

19
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,215
Stop it! No more!

20
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:39,688
I love you, Jerry.

21
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:44,305
Look, you're killing him!
Don't you see?

22
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,433
Doctor!

23
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:57,859
We need a doctor!

24
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:30,876
I arrived for morning visits when
Sonny had taken the turn for the worst.

25
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,219
Sonny Carroll?

26
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,417
Yes. / He has information on prize
fighter who was killed?

27
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,519
That's right.

28
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,449
Sonny hasn't made a last confession.

29
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,023
He wanted to talk to you first.

30
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,256
Sonny? / Hmm?

31
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,151
The police are here.

32
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,243
This is detective Rush and
lieutenant Stillman.

33
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,011
Hi, Sonny.

34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,935
'Course you'd have to
be a pretty young gal.

35
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,111
Serves me right.

36
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:07,809
Sonny, you officiated in
a boxing match back in 1976?

37
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,202
And that kid died in the ring.

38
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:12,008
Who died?

39
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,009
Jerry Stone.

40
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,052
What a gutless wonder.

41
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,341
Jerry was gutless?

42
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,456
No, me.

43
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,576
I should have stopped the fight.

44
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,086
Stopped it because Jerry was hurt?

45
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:27,119
Real bad.

46
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,098
Why didn't you?

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,822
My hand was in the pot.

48
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:35,760
Someone paid you off, Sonny?

49
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:39,290
Fifteen hundred dollars.

50
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,413
That was the deal.

51
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:45,811
To not stop a fight that should
have been stopped?

52
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,224
Sonny?

53
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:54,618
Do you really think he'll forgive?

54
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,912
So, someone wants to do Jerry harm.

55
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:17,073
And pays Sonny $1,500 to let the fight
go on longer than it should.

56
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:19,621
But, Sonny didn't say who.

57
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:23,917
And he's not going to.

68
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,168
Hey.

69
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,329
How's it going?

70
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,604
What's up?

71
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,800
On my way in.
Thought I'd stop by. I called, but-

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,930
Nah. I must have been
in the shower.

73
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,198
Hit your cell phone a couple of
three times, too.

74
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:16,565
Yeah, my cell...I think I left it at work.

75
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,412
Mind if I come in?

76
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:23,176
Yeah, okay. If you want.

77
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,193
Have a seat.

78
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:33,320
What's up with your furniture?

79
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,651
What do you mean?

80
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:37,180
Your setup is horrible.

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,763
Couldn't be more...

82
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:42,437
- awkward.
- I was about to skip some rope.

83
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,227
Gotcha.

84
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,123
So, how long have
you been doing this?

85
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:51,493
Since, uh... pee wees?
Wrestling.

86
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:55,164
No, I mean...
Pushing back the furniture.

87
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,252
Ah, So, I don't like the gym.

88
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:59,747
What? Too much room?

89
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,905
Nah, too many people.

90
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:07,032
Listen, Scotty, I, uh-

91
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,051
Just wanted to say
when my wife died...

92
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,853
Well, I've been where you've been.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,476
Yeah, I know.

94
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,169
So, if you ever want to talk...

95
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,213
Guess you'll let me know.

96
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,971
Jerry Stone.
Twenty four.

97
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:44,297
Died in the ring after going 15 rounds
with Maurice "Mad Mo" Bell.

98
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:47,668
Autopsy showed massive swelling
on the brain as cause of death.

99
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,960
So no question the punches
he took killed him.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,949
Top Dog Boxing Club.
December 19, 1976.

101
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,428
Rocky versus Apollo, the real thing.

102
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,835
Hmm, what's that about?

103
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,433
The idea of the fight was to try
and recreate 'Rocky',

104
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,291
- the hot movie at the time.
- Sort of gimmicky, huh?

105
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,294
Ha, supposedly it
lived up to the hype.

106
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,454
'Till someone got killed.

107
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:10,253
Nick, the other fighter "Mo".
Was he questioned first time around?

108
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,916
The assigned put him through
his paces but...

109
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,703
boxer dies in the ring,
what are you gonna do?

110
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:17,580
But knowing the referee was on
the take, that changes everything.

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,502
So we figure out who paid Sonny.

112
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:22,714
Maybe Gina will know.

113
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,512
- Who's that?
- Sonny's daughter.

114
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,186
And Jerry's girlfriend.

115
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,951
Says here, she was ringside
when Jerry died.

116
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,476
So Gina looks on as her own dad

117
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:33,097
allows her boyfriend to
get beat to death.

118
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:35,924
Maybe it explains
why she wasn't ringside today.

119
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:38,088
She wasn't at the hospital?

120
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,153
Start with her.

121
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,943
Jerry was short on talent.

122
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,459
Big on heart.

123
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,292
He said that's
why they picked him for the fight.

124
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,793
Because they knew he'd never quit.

125
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,048
No matter how badly he was hurt.

126
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,998
No, he'd stay in and
take the punishment.

127
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,599
Like Rocky did.

128
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,811
Now, you add a referee who's
willling to let that happen.

129
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:13,907
Gina, any idea on who could
have paid your dad that money?

130
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,326
No.

131
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:18,823
Well, how about someone
who had a problem with Jerry?

132
00:08:18,823 --> 00:08:20,792
Besides Sonny you mean? / Yeah.

133
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,010
Nah.

134
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:25,212
So, Sonny didn't care for Jerry?

135
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:29,149
At fifteen, he made it very clear
that I wasn't to see him.

136
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,700
He said he was a bum.

137
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,918
How so?

138
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,446
He droped out of school, didn't work.

139
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:38,600
But he could always hustle up
money to drink.

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,477
So, how did you two got together?

141
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:44,795
Just another Friday night
going nowhere, and...

142
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:48,526
Then I saw something
my father couldn't.

143
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,466
♪ Orleans  "Dance With Me" ♪

144
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,123
Drinking those eggs were so gross.

145
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,797
What about his apartment?

146
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,043
Yeah! That too.

147
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,853
Isn't that Jerry Stone?

148
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,011
Shh.
Hi, Jerry.

149
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,487
Hey.

150
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,867
Oh my gosh, what happened
to your face?

151
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,131
My face?

152
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:15,674
- Gina here can't stop looking at it.
- Okay!

153
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:19,095
Hey, I'll see you in a minute.

154
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,590
So, did you like the movie?

155
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,343
Uh, the love story part.

156
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,068
You sorta look like Adrian.

157
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,855
I do?

158
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:36,033
Me, I've seen the flick three times.

159
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,628
Yeah, Fifteen bucks for a locker
and a corner man...

160
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,731
Five dollar charge for shower and towel.

161
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:46,565
Hmm, very true to life.

162
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:51,951
So, uh...
my looks are comin' on, huh?

163
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:56,238
I said you looked, different.
That's all. / Yeah?

164
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,942
'Cause I feel different.

165
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,436
Oh?

166
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,268
This movie's got me thinking,

167
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:08,691
If some bum wants to be president
in the United States,

168
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,491
he really can be.

169
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,061
President, huh? / Ha, ha.

170
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,631
Well, I guess I'd better work one
of the few fights first.

171
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,692
My record's not so hot.

172
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:29,857
I gotta go do my roadwork.

173
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:33,989
Jerry.

174
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:42,709
Ah...Are you looking for
your own Adrian?

175
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:45,465
Are you for real?

176
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:47,455
Uh-huh.

177
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:57,149
So, that was the beginning of me
and Jerry.

178
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,425
And the end of you and Sonny.

179
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,242
Yeah...I told him that Jerry
had changed.

180
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,376
I said there was no stopping him now.

181
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:07,618
But Sonny didn't believe it?

182
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,432
Gina, just so you know...

183
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,629
Your dad was genuinely sorry
about Jerry.

184
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:22,690
Yeah. Too bad he didn't feel that way
before he let Mad Mo kill him.

185
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,313
Detective Will Jefferys, Mo.

186
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,683
And my partner detective Vera.

187
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:32,196
Where you all park car, man?

188
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:34,368
Up on the corner, we're good.

189
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,062
Yo, Booger.

190
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,774
Some good looking out 
for Philly's finest.

191
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,196
You snug as a bug now, baby.

192
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,380
Let's talk about Jerry Stone.

193
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,342
Come on.

194
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,071
At the weigh-in you said
you were gonna murder Jerry.

195
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,765
For real, and you did.

196
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:55,243
Hey, hey, hey. Just talking bads, man.

197
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:56,759
Selling up tickets.

198
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,064
What about the press conference

199
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,168
when you were talking about
some black and white stuffs?

200
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,224
Ah, just pointing out the differences.

201
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,669
Our people was into James Brown.

202
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,562
Jerry Stone and you all might have
rather been square dancing,

203
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,006
not any racist.

204
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:10,383
It is a little bit.

205
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:12,609
Still, it don't mean I murdered him.

206
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,375
Mo, we looked into
your juvenile records.

207
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,581
Arrested nine times
before you were fifteen.

208
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,785
Two years in the lockup for
putting step-pops in coma?

209
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,911
Those records were
supposed to be sealed.

210
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,363
Don't worry.
We taped 'em back up.

211
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:27,329
I did't even know who Jerry Stone was.

212
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,217
I- I didn't want to take
that fight in the first place.

213
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:30,184
Why not?

214
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:34,820
Cat was what? 15-18-3..
something terrible like that?

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,704
What's beating a chump like
that gonna do for me?

216
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,205
So why did you fight him?

217
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:39,525
Tommy Sugar.

218
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,194
The promoter of the fight.

219
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,932
Man could sell you a house
in the Atlantic Ocean.

220
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,272
♪ Parliament  
"Give Up The Funk" ♪

221
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,573
That's him in the maroon trunks.

222
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:58,403
Don't nobody care about these cats.

223
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,477
What? No, no- what, wait a minute!

224
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,500
Look, how many fights
you've won in a row?

225
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,337
All of'em.
And 21 out of 22 was knockouts.

226
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,857
And what one of 'em
was against a top five contenders.

227
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,909
Hey, ain't no top five giving me 
a fight. man.

228
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:09,948
You wanna know why?

229
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:11,648
Why? / Publicity!

230
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:14,498
You are a wrecking machine
but nobody knows you.

231
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:17,527
But if I get down with this fight?
They will.

232
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,157
And fighting this fool's gonna
raise my status?

233
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:21,152
C'mon.

234
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:24,621
Let me introduce you to one of
the great bleeders of all time.

235
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,415
Jerry Stone.

236
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,202
I've opended up faces many a time.

237
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:33,623
But if he bleeds like this tonight
imagine what you'll do to him.

238
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:42,160
It's like you said.
Nobody cares about this cat.

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,609
I know I don't.

240
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:47,908
But everybody,
is gonna care about you.

241
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,248
Yeah.

242
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:51,622
C'mon, Mo.

243
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,712
Huh?

244
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:53,720
Yeah!

245
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,075
Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,079
So you agreed to the fight and
took Jerry apart.

247
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,851
The ref should've stopped.

248
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,073
I could tell why
the boy's brain got wet

249
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:09,035
I'm killing him, and he's hollering.
He took the ring back!

250
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,435
This kinda nonsense.

251
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,599
The thing is, Mo.
Your career didn't rise.

252
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,848
It went downhill after that fight.

253
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:18,231
Killing somebody has a way
of throwing a man off-track.

254
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,788
Not for Tommy Sugar.

255
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:23,321
He's been Phily's top boxing
promoter the last 25 years.

256
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,926
Well that's some truth,
and here's some more:

257
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,807
The night Jerry Stone died,

258
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,543
Tommy Sugar was born.

259
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:46,883
It was 1976. The bicentennial.

260
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:50,062
And 'Rocky' was
as American as it gets.

261
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:52,076
And you saw a way to exploit that.

262
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,600
Saw opportunity.

263
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,726
For one and all.

264
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,902
That kind of timing don't come twice.

265
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,022
So the pressure was on.

266
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:01,255
- This fight had to live up.
- No doubt.

267
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:04,219
One thing for an underdog to go
15 rounds on the silver screen,

268
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,179
another to make that
happen in real life.

269
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,985
I tribute to the young man who fought.

270
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,552
And you did nothing to help it along?

271
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,284
Like what?

272
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:17,049
Jerry would bleed a lot.

273
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,385
Which was a good thing, right?

274
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,140
But if you were trying to
remake 'Rocky',

275
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,352
you need Jerry to go 15 rounds.

276
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,348
So you don't want too
much of a good thing.

277
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:27,767
So maybe as insurance you paid
the referee to keep it going.

278
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,483
No matter what.

279
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,541
Well, Sonny took a deal like that?

280
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,442
Yep.

281
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:36,473
Ha, ha, ha- I wish I'd known
he was open for business.

282
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:40,680
You know, where you ought to
be looking is the C.Y.O.

283
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,815
Catholic Youth Organization.

284
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:44,771
Where I plucked Jerry from.

285
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:46,540
A half a dozen fighters
came to me

286
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,578
crying the blues
after being overlooked.

287
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:51,010
So one of these sore losers
from the C.Y.O.

288
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,700
pays Sonny 1,500 dollars to see
Jerry take the beating of his life?

289
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,707
Your best fighters,
always hold a grudge.

290
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,810
The C.Y.O. was 
at it's height in the 70's.

291
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,855
Instead of a kid sucking on cigarettes
all day long he had a place to go.

292
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,702
And Jerry Stone participated
in the boxing program?

293
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:19,344
Jerry would serve mass for me
on Sunday mornings

294
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,115
and then fight for me
on Sunday nights.

295
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,926
Which eventually lands him
this bout with Mo.

296
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:25,134
Right.

297
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,879
Heard not everyone was
overjoyed by that.

298
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,281
You gotta be remembered that

299
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,852
these kids had their noses
pressed right up against it.

300
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,547
And along comes Jerry,

301
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:36,884
He's got a chance
at a real professional fight.

302
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:40,395
Anyone so jealous they might wanna
see real harm come to Jerry?

303
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,604
Pay the ref off to see that happen?

304
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:45,531
Ah, deep down, these guys
knew they were not better than Jerry.

305
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:47,856
Just a bunch of ham and eggers.

306
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,340
- Except, uh- one of 'em, I guess.

307
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,174
- Who?

308
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:53,354
Bucky Lowsen
Best fighter we had.

309
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:54,594
Better than Jerry?

310
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,179
They wanted more of an underdog.
He had too good a record.

311
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,911
And how'd he deal with that?

312
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:00,680
Bucky didn't like coming
in second to Jerry

313
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,238
that seem to be happening quite a lot.

- You should talk to him.
- I did.

331
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:41,677
My only way in that ring is
if you were out.

332
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,830
I'm sorry. I'm staying put.

333

What are you talking about?

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,949
Jerry purchased a fancy
engagement ring.

340
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,720
Seems to think he's marrying Gina.

341
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,596
Bucky, give it a rest.

342
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:12,682
Maybe you fighting Mo
ain't such a bad thing.

343
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:14,500
After he puts you in a coma,

344
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,926
guess whose brawny shoulder's
gonna be there for Gina to cry on.

345
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,651
So, Buck and Gina had history.

He'd been carrying a torch
for her since the fifth grade.

349
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,445
How do you know that?

350
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,177
Well, around here if you don't get the
story on some kid after the mass?

00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,786
You believe your butt
you would at the bar.

352
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,195
So between losing both the fight
and the girl to Jerry.

353
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,677
Hmm, Buck was having a rough go.

354
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,310
Alright Scotty, I'll see you then.

355
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,407
Valens?

356
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:54,201
Yeah. / He alright?

357
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,713
We'er gonna grab some drinks.

358
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:57,831
Good. Doing better than yesterday.

359
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:58,998
You talked to him?

360
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:00,481
Yeah.

361
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,499
Buck Lowson's got a record.

362
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,333
Two days before the fight,

363
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,145
Buck robbed a convenient store.

364
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,935
This says he was arrested in '78.
Not '76.

365
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,542
It took that long to catch him.

366
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,079
How much did Buck get away with?

367
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,347
Two thousand and a thing
of peanut butter.

368
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:16,456
And two whole years
to spread it around.

369
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:20,376
Yeah. But maybe only took two days
before he burned all 1,500 of it.

370
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:23,933
Right. Fifteen hundred.
Sonny's asking price.

371
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,583
I don't know what you're talking about!

372
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,609
Buck, I might even believe you
if not for the timing, I mean.

373
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,303
You never stole anything else
in your life.

374
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,753
That's the god's honest truth.

375
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:41,873
- Nothing before that day or after.
- But that day is the problem, Buck.

376
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,697
Because it was two days
before the fight.

377
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,412
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

378
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,814
Start with the money.

379
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:49,930
What d'you do with it?

380
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,968
Buck, we know you wished Jerry ill.

381
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:55,893
And that you and Gina go way back.

382
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,533
Let him call a lawyer.

383
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,892
I don' want a lawyer.
I can't afford one.

384
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:04,749
Fine. I'll make sure
you get a PD.

385
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:06,269
If you're lucky you might even
get a good one.

386
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,185
You think a public defender's
gonna care about me?

387
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:09,630
Alright, maybe not. But, Buck.

388
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,261
If you're not gonna talk about the money,
what are we supposed to do?

389
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:16,368
Besides, if you're so innocent,
what are you hedging for?

390
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,255

Mo's taking a dive first round,

It won't be a real fight?

408

That's why I ain't busting

415
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,760
There're some real dough
to be made first.

00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:13,242
Gina couldn't resist a sure thing.

417
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:14,869
She was a gambler?

418
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,911
I robbed that store
so I could get her betting money.

419
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,677
Did you tell her how you got it?

420
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:21,403
No. I wanted to impress her.

421
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:23,745
Not tell her I was scum.

422
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,554
Had it bad for her, huh, Buck?

423
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,000
My whole stupid life.

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,684
So Gina acts all broken up for Jerry
that the fight's gonna be a fake.

425
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,964
But dries her eyes pretty quick.

426
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:37,343
And places her own bet on it.

427
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,286
Hey, boss.

428
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:49,108
- Can I talk to you for a minute.
- Scotty, hey, sure.

What happened in that interview
was 100% the wrong way.

430
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:57,329
I mean, thumping on anybody.
Doesn't matter who.

You can't do it.

00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:01,268
Okay.

00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:05,690
I assure you, it will not happen again.

00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:19,520
Well, I was hoping the uh-,
suspension could be lifted...early.

437
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,994
I didn't suspend you Scotty.

438
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:24,831
I encouraged you to take time off.

439
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:28,082
I'd like you to encourage me

00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,250
Great.

442
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,640
Sorry, Scotty. I can't do it.

Not...not that good.

450
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,095
Hey.

of your life, Gina.

454
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,393
He was.

455
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:27,152
So why let him go ahead with the fight
you knew was rigged.

456
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:30,186
'Cause you had money on that fight.

457
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,943
Yeah, I did.

458
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:35,808
You took the dough from Buck and
the twenty to one odds that came with it.

459
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,245
Thirty to one, by the time
I placed my bet.

460
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,972
Hmm, couldn't resist it, huh?

461
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:43,545
Have a bit of a problem.

462
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:46,417
So all that talk about Jerry's big heart,

463
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,711
and how there's no stopping him.

464
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,903

No!

466
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:55,148
But why should all the other shlubs
make money off of Jerry and not us?

467
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,687
So you did it for the both of you?

468
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:59,083
Yeah. / Why are we gonna believe you?

469
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,547
Because I did tell Jerry and it cost me.

470
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:07,069
- Nervous about tomorrow?
- No.

00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:09,269

I thought you believed
in what I was doing. / Jerry,

492
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,558
we're stuck. And when we are
fifty we will still be stuck.

00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,423
We're not gonna get a break
like this again.

494

That's why I want this fight.

497
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,366
To prove it.

498
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:07,314
I guess I should take that back.

499
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,649
We see it all so different now.

500
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,623
Hmm, short engagement.

501
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,933
To make matters worse, I had to
go talk Frank Shavers what I'd done.

502
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,398
Who's Shavers?

503
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,106
From the old neighbohood
I worked in his bingo parlor.

504
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:42,020
If anyone had a bet on this fix,
it was him.

505
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,185
So you told him
that Jerry knew about it.

506
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:46,962
And to take his bet back
before it was too late.

507
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:48,546
What did he say?

508
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:51,835
There is no taking bets back.

509
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:58,965
So, Frank. You've been
big money on this fix,

510
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,458
then Gina opens up her mouth to Jerry.

511
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,215
I wasn't pleased.

512
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,991
So did you retaliate?

513
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,307
How would I have done that?

514
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:10,039
How about paying the referee
1,500 bucks to not stop the fight.

515
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,094
No matter how bad off Jerry was.

516
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:13,714
Getting me what?

517
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:16,091
Jerry ends up maimed or dead,

518
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:18,451
The boxing world gets the message:

519
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,478
Don't mess with Frank Shavers.

520
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:24,533
Ha, ha, ha. I'm not a thug,
I'm a businessman.

521
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,623
And it was a bad day at the office.

522
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,757
So you never tampered with Sonny?

523
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:31,149
I never suspected anyone had.

524
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:33,239
Until now.

525
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:35,720
We're listening.

526
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,127
Jerry lasted fifteen rounds.

527
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,333
That's incredible, really.

528
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,412
But what's more incredible is,

529
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:46,858
Only one person bet on
Jerry to do just said.

530
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,969
There you go Frank.

531
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,486
It finally hit ya, huh?

532
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:04,365
What's that?

533
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:09,995
Three years from now, Mo Bell may
be heavyweight champion of the world.

534
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,607
That's what you're tangling with.

535
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:26,441
There's no shame in knowing
when to walk away.

536
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,323
No?

537
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:30,945
It's the same in respect to Gina.

538
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:33,173
Return the ring Jerry.

539
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:35,714
Let my daughter be.

540
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:41,350
Drink in the night before the fight.

541
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,003
Put it down.

542
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:54,025
Every reflex has to be right,
your mind clear.

543
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,653
Father, it don't matter anymore.

544
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,205
- What are you, freezing up?
- No!

545
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,352
Well then, fight!

546
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:03,488
Then you'll have tomorrow night
for the rest of your life!

547
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,972
- You really think I can do it, father?
- Son.

548
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,938
I got money on ya.

549
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,814
You too, father?

550
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,552
You bet on the fight?

551
00:30:13,552 --> 00:30:16,073
Now I need you in that ring.

552
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,862
Father... / Son.

553
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:22,099
I've raised you from a pup.

554
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:26,578
If you won't do it for yourself,
do it for me.

555
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,706
So, father needs Jerry to
go the distance.

556
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,517
That night, seized Jerry's wobbly.

557
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:40,785
I didn't stick around but,

558
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:44,528
Father was huddled up
with Sonny when I left.

559
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:47,380
Maybe father bought
some insurance from him.

560
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,095
Made sure his 'pup'
got to the finish line.

561
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:55,113
Putting money on Jerry not to win,

562
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:57,254
but to make it fifteen rounds?

563
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:59,310
That's a pretty specific bet, father.

564
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,334
That's because Jerry set
that goal for himself.

565
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:02,450
I thought he could make it.

566
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,689
And your winnings must've been sweet.

567
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,864
I've threw in the towel for Pete's sake.

568
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,491
Yeah. With twenty seconds remaining.

569
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,189
Because of what I saw in his eyes.
Jerry always looked bad.

570
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:14,268
But this time I could see
he was cooked.

571
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:18,949
Or maybe throwing that towel
was just an act. Huh, father?

572
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:20,022
Look.

573
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:23,439
I can't force you two to believe me.

574
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,721
Did you know the fight was fixed?

575
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,920
Fixed?

576
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,163
Mo made a deal to let Jerry
to win in the first round.

577
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,446
And Jerry knew about it.

578
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:32,789
No kidding?

579
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:35,086
But didn't wanna go along with it.

580
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:37,572
I wouldn't think he would.

581
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:39,608
And if so, that explains why...

582
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,831
Why what?

583
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,301
That's why round one.

584
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,792
He's been standing around for two minutes!

585
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,212
- What the hell's going in out there?
- C'mon! C'mon!

586
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,969
C'mon, hit me!

587
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:06,219
Oh, wonderful. The boo birds.

588
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:08,885
C'mon, throw him a punch.

589
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,664
C'mon!

590
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,440
Show me something, chump!

591
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,886
- You know what, Mo...
- Don't talk! C'mon.

592
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,340
C'mon!

593
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,770
Stop it, now!

594
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,597
Well, you're gonna fight me now, Mo!

595
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:25,370
- What are you doing?
- Give me water.

596
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,608
What is your mind mush?

597
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:31,601
Want water? I'll give you
your damn water, huh? Huh?

598
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,592
You've got the rest of your life
to make eyes at that girl.

599
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:35,875
- That's not happening.
- What are you talking about?

600
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,386
I took the ring back.

601
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:39,495
Alright, fine. Come here.

602
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:40,351
Get up.

603
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:41,352
You, wake up!

604
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:43,016
Okay, You get it on with this guy!

605
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:45,069
- Get in there.
- Now you want a fight, huh, father.

606
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,754
Well, take a look!
'Cause we got one.

607
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:58,627
So in the entire first round
Jerry never threw a punch.

608
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:02,211
Making it impossible
for Mo to fake a Knock-out.

609
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:05,713
I told Jerry I put
some money on him but,

610
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:08,113
He must have thought
I'd taken this other bet.

611
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:10,434
The fix.

612
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:14,289
That poor kid.

613
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:20,489
In the end he must have thought
even I didn't believe in him.

614
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,033
Hey.

615
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:32,824
Hey. My man.

616
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:34,339
Where've you been?

617
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:37,014
Ah, per usual long day.

618
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:40,264
Well, you're here now.
We're celebrating.

619
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:43,059
We got a cause or
are we better without?

620
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,117
I'm back on the job next week.

621
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,833
No kidding? Yeah?

622
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,189
Way to go. / It's good right?

623
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,218
Tops.

624
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:51,969
Tops, brother. Tops.

625
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:54,277
What?

626
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,992
Just that simple?

627
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,475
Be simpler if I could get a roll in here.

628
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,942
Yo, Christina.

629
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:06,437
I'll go again, and get Nicky, too.

630
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:07,870
How you doin'?

631
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,227
Good.

632
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,389
Didn't know you worked here.

633
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,175
Yeah, it's fun for now.

634
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:17,075
Although I find some of the guys
who come in here are sort of...half ass.

635
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:18,285
No kidding.

636
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:20,122
Half ass, huh?

637
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:24,136
Uh, but that was before
you two came in.

638
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,577
Perfect.

639
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:27,916
I got it.

640
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,601
Thank you, kind sir.

641
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,709
You know, taking it back a sec...

642
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,664
You're telling me how happy I'm back.

643
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,612
Not asking how I'm doing.

644
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:48,968
Thanks for that.

645
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,725
When the hard stuff happens,

646
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,816
I say walk it off anyway you can.
Whatever.

647
00:34:58,582 --> 00:35:01,226
You're the goods, Nicky.

648
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:04,825
But what you can't do?

649
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:09,627
Is Rush's sister.
You know what I mean?

650
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:13,813
Oh, what do you think?
What are you talking about?

651
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:15,416
Hey, Scotty.

652
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,044
Serious.

653
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:20,788
Anyone but that, right?

654
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:48,066
Mo said Jerry kept yelling
he took the ring back.

655
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,836
Thinking he was talking
about the boxing ring.

656
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:54,634
But now we think Jerry meant the
engagement ring he bought for Gina.

657
00:35:54,634 --> 00:35:56,278
From Jimmy the jeweler.

658
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,503
Jimmy still in business? / Well,

659
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,637
in the day of the fight
Jerry took the ring in

660
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:01,179
and asked for the money back.

661
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:02,393
Well, how much was it worth?

662
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,621
Eighteen hundred.

663
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,768
But Jimmy wouldn't give him that.

664
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:07,828
He said that the ring had depreciated
over three days he'd had it.

665
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:09,508
So what did Jerry get for?

666
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:11,085
Fifteen hundred.

667
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,596
Even.

668
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,738
We know who paid off Sonny, Mo.

669
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,207
Oh yeah?

670
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:24,233
Yeah.

671
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:26,669
Jerry.

672
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,841
Now, how does that make sense?

673
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:33,083
Jerry knew you would open up
his face bad.

674
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,818
And the way he bleeds,
he figures the ref'll T.K.O. him.

675
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:39,691
It did pour out, sure enough.

676
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:43,504
He wanted to prove
he'd do the whole fifteen with you.

677
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,888
Yeah, it sounds like old Jerry.

678
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,396
Mo, could some of the things
he'd be saying

679
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,470
during the fight have been
meant for Sonny,

680
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,016
and not you?

681
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:55,282
Yeah, didn't make sense
coming my way.

682
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,769
I'll tell you what else.

683
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:00,211
I've never seen a guy change
so much over the course of a fight.

684
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:01,346
You mean Jerry?

685
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,636
No, I meant Sonny.

686
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:06,912
Before the fight he had
no ounce of respect for that Jerry.

687
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,304
But by he end?

688
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,869
Brother had tears in his eyes.

689
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,051
Jerry, I gotta call it.

690
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:32,487
No.

691
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,244
You can't.
The deal was a deal.

692
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,396
Attaboy, Jerry! Attaboy!
C'mon, now!

693
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:48,982
You're my great white hope!
Attaboy!

694
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,578
I gotta call it Jerry!

695
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:01,442
I didn't like you wanted.
Please don't take from me this...

696
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,009
Please.

697
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:20,275
That's it!
That's it!

698
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:21,987
Stop it! No more!

699
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:23,916
No, I took the ring back!

700
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,938
- No more, Jerry.
- I took the ring back!

701
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,291
You gotta stop! Please!

702
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:30,930
A deal's a deal.
