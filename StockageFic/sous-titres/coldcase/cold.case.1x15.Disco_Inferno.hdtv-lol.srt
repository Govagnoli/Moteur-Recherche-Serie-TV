자막제작 - NSC 자막팀 
(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,470
10 minutes to the biggest dance 
contest South Philly's ever seen.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,947
So get those platforms polished
'cause it's gonna be far out.

5
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:18,602
The Bell's giving one 
thousand bucks to the winner.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,836
You heard me. 
One thousand big ones!

7
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,821
Outta sight!

8
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,964
Gas and Power guys 
were fixing a leak,

9
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,562
found partial remains 
about six feet down.

10
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:32,692
In an old disco?

11
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,846
Was an old disco, The Bell.

12
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,581
Off Lansing Boulevard, real eyesore?

13
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:37,690
That's the spot.

14
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,959
22 people were killed 
there in a fire, 1978.

15
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,671
Ruled as arson.

16
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,805
23rd was presumed dead,
remains were never found.

17
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,567
You thinking this must be the guy?

18
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,771
John Doe.

19
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,036
That's all that's left of him?

20
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,154
Skull's all I need to get an ID.
Man had excellent teeth.

21
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:55,438
If he burned up in the fire, why 
didn't we find him back then?

22
00:02:55,438 --> 00:03:00,076
Well, apprently he was deep 
underground where the VIP room was.

23
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,614
Plus, what is that?

24
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:05,991
Slug's been rolling 
around in his brain pan.

25
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:08,578
Right between the eyes.

26
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:10,188
Shooter must have been close up.

27
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:12,066
Can we get rifling off this slug?

28
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,084
My guess is it's a .38.
Should have distinct markings.

29
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,476
This guy was probably shot 
before the fire ever got to him.

30
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:20,120
Well, maybe our doer started 
the blaze, covered his tracks.

31
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,016
Hide one murder, cause 22 others.

32
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,088
We don't got a cold one here.

33
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,226
We got 23 of them.

34
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,910
Cold Case 1x15

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/02/22

43
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,038
Dental records were conclusive.

44
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,855
This is our John Doe.

45
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,668
Benjamin Issac Rosen.

46
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:08,108
Twenty-two.

47
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,667
I remember the news 
coverage of The Bell fire.

48
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,032
Cryin' families, burned bodies.

49
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:15,291
Bulldozers come in quick, 
demolish the place?

50
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,125
Yeah. What was left standing 
was considered a safety hazard.

51
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,122
So maybe they did a rush 
job finding all the remains.

52
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,635
Explains why they didn't find him.

53
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,892
You, uh, ever hang out 
at this disco, boss?

54
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,982
Oh, not me.

55
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:32,079
But I think Jeffries was a beat 
cop in South at the time.

56
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,035
I wonder what he did Saturday nights.

57
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:38,441
The Bell wasn't just a disco, 
it was the disco.

58
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,234
Lines around the block to get in.

59
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,633
Lot of feathered hair, 
gold chains, polyester...

60
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,874
Sounds like you got 
some familiarity there, Will.

61
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,646
I was there once.

62
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,133
William Disco Jeffries.

63
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,846
Come on, Will, bust a move for us.

64
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,574
Yeah, do the hustle, baby.

65
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,445
You know, if it's all the 
same, I'd rather not.

66
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,531
Those were regrettable times.

67
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,495
The arson report says the 
blaze started in the White Room.

68
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,339
Do you know what that was?

69
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,699
VIP lounge, where all the 
cocaine was snorted.

70
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,884
And where's Ben Rosen's 
remains were found.

71
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,241
- So, maybe he started the fire.
- Right after he got shot in the face.

72
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:12,974
That's a point.

73
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:15,486
So who was with Ben 
in the White Room?

74
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:18,108
Chief suspect in the arson 
was the owner of the place.

75
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,398
Neil Chaney.

76
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:21,517
Torched his own club 
for the insurance?

77
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:23,308
You'd think he'd wait 
till after hours.

78
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,968
Looks like they dug, but 
didn't get far with that theory.

79
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,172
We got partial rifling 
on the bullet.

80
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,218
It was a .38. / Good 
enough to find a match?

81
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:34,151
Yep. We find the gun 
that matches this slug,

82
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,139
could lead us to the doer.

83
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,053
I'd call that new direction.

84
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,525
Vera, Disco Will, have a 
conversation with Neil Chaney.

85
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,911
- Meantime... 
- We'll go to the Rosens.

86
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:50,786
You found Benny,
after all these years?

87
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:57,175
I always hoped, prayed, he got 
out of that conflagration somehow.

88
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:00,480
Ran away or something.

89
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,372
Foolish. I know.

90
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:04,698
Benny lived at home with you?

91
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,668
He was going to go to dental school.

92
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,455
Top of his class.

93
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:11,373
Smart. Sweet.

94
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,338
He have any enemies you know of?

95
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:16,341
I thought he died in the fire.

96
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:21,001
I'm afraid he was murdered, 
Mrs. Rogen, before the fire started.

97
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,423
Murdered?

98
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,001
Was he in any kind of trouble?

99
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,046
How should we know?

100
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:31,249
Benny was an open book before he 
started playing that so-called music.

101
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,846
After, he shut us out.

102
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,787
He knew we disapproved.

103
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,635
Why shouldn't I have disapproved?

104
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,945
That disco ruined his life.

105
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:46,432
We, uh, kept some of 
his things in his room.

106
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:49,681
Maybe you'd like to see?

107
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,127
Salutatorian of 
his high school class.

108
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,677
Adorable, right?

109
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,384
There something you 
wanna tell us, Myra?

110
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:18,319
Something you didn't want 
your husband to hear?

111
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,152
No, of course not.

112
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:23,904
'Cause I got the feeling there was.

113
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:29,194
We know this is difficult.

114
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,882
Doesn't have to leave this room.

115
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,777
There was something.

116
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,155
It's something I never told my husband.

117
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:44,265
What was that?

118
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:49,563
I came home from temple early 
one night, on account of my arthritis.

119
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,575
This was a week before the fire.

120
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:54,083
And, uh...

121
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,195
I saw them together.

122
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:01,628
My Benny, and a shiksa.

123
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,685
Like you.

124
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:32,765
Mmm, not here, baby. / Come on.
My folks won't be back for hours.

125
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,609
But if we want to win this 
competition, we got to practice.

126
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,246
I don't got the rhythm like you do.

127
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:41,183
You got it where it counts, baby.
You're far out.

128
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,755
When you gonna tell your 
parents we're engaged?

129
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,047
Soon.

130
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:48,193
You are such a foxy mama.

131
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,070
Benny...

132
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,604
Hey, you know I wanna marry you,

133
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:56,992
spend my whole life 
dancing with you.

134
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:03,300
We don't have to make it 
now if you don't want to.

135
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:09,363
We'll practice, 
then we'll make it, huh?

136
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,451
I love you, hot stuff.

137
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,707
They were in love.

138
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:19,736
At least my Benny had 
that before he died.

139
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:23,177
Did Benny ever talk about 
his wedding plans?

140
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:28,236
He was probably afraid to.
His father would have hit the roof.

141
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,091
You know what happened 
to this girl, Sonya?

142
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,507
She got burned in the fire.

143
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:35,626
I visited her once 
at Saint Ignatius,

144
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:38,324
she was all doped up.
Never knew I was there.

145
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,578
And your husband still 
doesn't know about her?

146
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,007
He needs more heartache?

147
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:49,167
It's bad enough feeling his son 
betrayed him over disco.

148
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:01,005
Sonya Witkowski?

149
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes.

150
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,242
Detectives Rush and Valens.

151
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:07,679
We're here about Benjamin Rosen.

152
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,922
Benny?

153
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,477
I'll be right back.

154
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,964
I lost Benny in The Bell fire.

155
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,650
Part of his remains were 
recently found, Sonya.

156
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,839
It appears he was killed
before the fire started.

157
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,529
Someone killed him?

158
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:35,365
I'm afraid so.

159
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,802
We understand you two were engaged.

160
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:42,228
We were gonna get married 
after the dance competition.

161
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,636
That was such a long time ago.

162
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:49,179
Was there anything unusual going on 
in Benny's life, right around then?

163
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,832
Fights? A threat?

164
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,995
No. I mean...

165
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,893
You sure he was murdered?

166
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:59,531
Anything you can tell 
us could really help.

167
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:04,900
A couple of days before 
the dance contest,

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,436
I got there early to practice...

169
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:28,768
Hey, foxy mama, let's hustle.

170
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,106
What did Chaney want?

171
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:32,477
Nothing.

172
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:35,573
- Didn't look like nothing.
- Are we talking or are we dancing?

173
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:37,469
You deal blow for Chaney, 
Benny, I'll dump your ass.

174
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:39,770
I'm not dealin' blow.

175
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,872
I swear.

176
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:44,356
You wouldn't lie to me?

177
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:46,887
I'd rather die.

178
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,403
Hey, after we win that 
thousand bucks, baby,

179
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,368
let's elope. 
We'll go to the Manhattan,

180
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,637
get married at Studio 54.

181
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,688
We gotta win first.

182
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:04,099
We'll win. You're the best 
disco dancer in Philly.

183
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,300
Philly? Is that all?

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,222
In America. The whole world.

185
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,495
He was the love of my life, 
you know?

186
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:16,907
The real deal.

187
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,663
What were Benny and 
Mr. Chaney fighting about?

188
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,169
I don't know.

189
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:26,199
Benny used to give private dance 
lessons to some of Chaney's clients,

190
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,005
but it seemed like 
something more serious.

191
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:32,371
Are you sure it ain't possible
Benny was dealing for him?

192
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,186
He said he wasn't.

193
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:39,617
On the off chance that he was, Sonya,

194
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:43,181
you think Chaney was the kind of 
man who could murder someone?

195
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,689
I know he had a gun.

196
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,923
Used to show it off,
like some kind of big shot.

197
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:54,070
We're still looking for Neil Chaney,
but he did have a permit for a .38.

198
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,777
Which he fired in '77.
Shot a burglar at The Bell.

199
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,842
- A year before Benny was shot.
- File's coming over from South.

200
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,868
We find the slug 
he shot at the burglar,

201
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,442
match it to the one 
we got on this job...

202
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,664
Makes Chaney a good bet for the doer.

203
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:09,997
We're talking about finding a bullet
fired 26 years ago from a gun

204
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,790
we don't even know exists anymore.

205
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,771
Registered to a man we can't find.

206
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,083
Yeah.

207
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,265
The word "longshot" comes to mind.

208
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:18,715
We like a challenge.

209
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,839
Well, you got one.

210
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:33,063
File from South IDs this guy 
Chaney shot as Mark Rigley.

211
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,437
Tried to rob a disco at closing.
Chaney popped him.

212
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,053
Shooting was ruled self-defense.

213
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:38,874
Maybe Rigley knows what 
happened to the slug.

214
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,021
He doin' time someplace?

215
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:43,582
Uh-uh. Custodial detail at 
the River Rink, Penn's Landing.

216
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:45,597
Know how we been having 
trouble findin' Chaney?

217
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:48,691
It's 'cause County's six months 
behind processing death certificates.

218
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:49,834
Chaney's dead?

219
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,897
Three months ago.
Cirrhosis of the liver.

220
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,531
Crap.

221
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:57,152
So what?
We still have 23 unsolved murders.

222
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,162
We can't talk to the father,
we'll settle for the son.

223
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:00,019
He's not dead, is he?

224
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,089
No. Paul Chaney owns 
a shop in Center City.

225
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,160
Good.

226
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,785
Out on the street, boss.

227
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,548
Excuse me just one second.
Enjoy yourselves.

228
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:22,462
Whassup, folks?

229
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,241
You want a pipe?

230
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,162
Depends what's in it.

231
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,528
Tobacco, the new marijuana.

232
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,191
That's far out, Paul.

233
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,818
Tobacco's legal, remember?

234
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,767
Hey, you wanna check 
the pipes, be my guest.

235
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,886
- We ain't narcs.
- We're homicide.

236
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:40,416
Homicide?

237
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,014
What do you want with me?

238
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,139
Your father. 
He had a permit for a .38.

239
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,686
We thought you might know 
where that gun is now.

240
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:52,548
Uh, excuse me. You mind just 
stepping over here for a second?

241
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:56,615
Why? What's this about?

242
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:57,901
The Bell.

243
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:01,152
A man was killed there that 
night before the fire broke out.

244
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,701
And you want to pin it on my old 
man who's trying to rest in peace?

245
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:07,302
- We're trying to solve a murder.
- Don't you mean murders?

246
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:09,824
I been through this a hundred times.

247
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:13,649
23 people burned to the crisp.
Everybody blamed my dad for it.

248
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,354
That's why he drank himself to death.

249
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,396
You don't think he was responsible?

250
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,761
My father loved The Bell.

251
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,105
The idea of his torching 
it is just craziness.

252
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:26,140
So what about that .38, Paul?

253
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,505
I threw it into the Delaware, 
like, a decade ago.

254
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:33,002
I was worried my dad was 
going to turn it on himself.

255
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:35,506
You remember a guy 
named Benny Rosen?

256
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,905
Yeah, yeah, sure. 
Benny the Rose.

257
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,230
Everybody knew him.

258
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,721
Someone killed him that night.

259
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,094
Shot him.

260
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:45,124
No.

261
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,265
Well, come on.
It wasn't my dad.

262
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,802
I was by his side the whole 
night, at the judge's table.

263
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:54,078
Who else at that disco 
had it in for Benny?

264
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,846
Benny was king.

265
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,752
People worshipped him. 
'Specially the women.

266
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,755
The guy was a real Don Juan stein.

267
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,685
He caught up in any 
romantic triangles?

268
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,879
Nah, ha got a serious girl.

269
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,709
But you know, them two 
had a fight that day.

270
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:15,188
Now I know about this 'cause I was
doing something you might think unsavory,

271
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:19,156
but try to remember, I was 
just a horny kid at the time.

272
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,742
Oh, yeah,

273
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,703
do it for me, foxy fox.

274
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,664
This is the ladies room, Benny. 
Get the hell out! / Sonya, don't cry.

275
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:36,313
You're a jerk, you know?

276
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:38,748
I'm just having second thoughts 
about eloping. / Yeah, yeah.

277
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,875
It's putting too much 
pressure on winning.

278
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,101
I don't want it to effect our dancing.

279
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,805
You don't wanna elope 'cause 
you're afraid to marry a shiksa.

280
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,499
That ain't true.

281
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:49,782
I thought you said you'd rather did than 
lie to me? / You know how my father is.

282
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:52,779
It's 1978, for God's sake.
We can do what we want.

283
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,486
I know, but he'd kill me.

284
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,784
Well, waiting is killing me.

285
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:03,894
So you got a choice to make.
It's either him or me.

286
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:11,340
I should kill you, 
making a slut out of me.

287
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,847
I was a virgin before I met you!

288
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:22,882
Oh, men, what an idiot that guy was.
Turning away a piece of ass like that?

289
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,109
Believe me, I wouldn't have.

290
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,222
I believe you, Paul.

291
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,296
Mark Rigley?

292
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:37,335
- Who's askin'? 
- Philly P.D.

293
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,560
Your parole officer said 
we might find you here.

294
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,666
My crummy boss telling lies again?

295
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,312
What?

296
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,002
This is about him and that 
borrowed car incident, right?

297
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,776
That was two months ago.

298
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,549
- It was an emergency.
- No, it's not about that.

299
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,147
Just walkin' the straight 
and narrow here, man.

300
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,699
Pushing a broom for minimun wage.

301
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,498
Mark, in 1977 you were 
shot at The Bell disco?

302
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:59,875
Yeah. So?

303
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:04,833
We were kinda hoping that you kept that 
slug maybe as a suvenior or something.

304
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,823
We're trying to match it to 
a bullet on another case.

305
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,125
You bet I know where that slug is.

306
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,329
Right here.
For 27 years.

307
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,670
Sets off metal detectors like crazy.

308
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,335
The docs couldn't take it out?

309
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:23,300
Not back then.
Maybe now, modern medicine.

310
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,912
You'd be willing to give it a go?

311
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:27,955
I'm civic-minded.

312
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:30,567
There's nothing I wouldn't 
do to assist Philly's finest.

313
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,660
'Course, Philly's finest gotta assist me.

314
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,832
Assist how?

315
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:38,152
How much you think it's 
worth going under the knife?

316
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,354
A couple grand?

317
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:42,448
That's mighty civic-minded of you, Mark.

318
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,844
Capitalism made this 
country great, my friend.

319
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:47,033
That two grand?

320
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,262
That ain't gonna happen.

321
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,257
Then no deal.

322
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:56,153
You guys wanna buy my ass 
bullet, you know where I work.

323
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,289
You lied to us, Sonya.

324
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,001
Lied?

325
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,083
You said you and Benny 
were gettin' married,

326
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,555
but you broke up with him that night.

327
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,778
In the ladies room.

328
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,342
No.

329
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,878
I mean,

330
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,777
we would have worked it out.

331
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,520
"I should kill you, 
makin' a slut outta me."

332
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,318
Two hours later, Benny ends 
up with a bullet in his head.

333
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:28,252
Benny was the love of my life.

334
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,272
How do you know what I said, anyway?

335
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,299
Where were you when 
the fire started, Sonya?

336
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,455
On the floor.

337
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,656
It was Doreen blabbin', wasn't it?

338
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:40,368
That nosy bitch knew 
everything 'bout everything.

339
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:41,397
Who's Doreen?

340
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,677
Doreen Di Nova.

341
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,449
Had a real thing for Benny.

342
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:49,864
- Always trying to steal him for me.
- That right?

343
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:53,124
She was competitive 
with me over everything.

344
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:56,567
Benny, dancing, you name it.

345
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,072
She in the dance contest that night?

346
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:03,167
Yeah. Her and her partner Ken 
were our main competition.

347
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:07,213
She would have done anything to win.

348
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,746
Last chance for a practice dance.

349
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:17,535
One hour till starting time.

350
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,458
You heard of me, baby, one hour.

351
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,779
Oh, my heels.

352
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,434
That's okay. 
I got another pair.

353
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,275
Come on, Benny. 
Dance with me.

354
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,521
- No. I got a partner.
- It's not too late to switch.

355
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,663
We won last year. We 
could do it again this year.

356
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:44,214
- I'm with Sonya now, Doreen.
- I'm better than her.　　　　　

357
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:45,661
That don't matter. 
I love Sonya.

358
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,328
And I love Kenny.
But you and me, we could go places,

359
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:51,077
win real competitions in 
Manhattan and the like.

360
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,233
Get it outta your head.

361
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,223
It's not gonna happen.

362
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,921
Hey, Doreen.

363
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,916
Got your headlights on, I see.

364
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,450
Why you got to be so selfish, Sonya?

365
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,413
You already got Benny in the sack.

366
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,110
Why can't I have him 
on the dance floor?

367
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,058
Why should I?

368
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,298
'Cause you can't keep 
up with him and I can.

369
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,771
- I ain't heard no complaints.
- I ain't made any.　　　　　

370
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,234
Fine, be that way.

371
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,957
You're not gonna be 
the king forever, Benny.

372
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:14,006
A lot could happen between 
now and the contest.

373
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,118
What is that supposed to mean?

374
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,609
It means I'm going 
home wearing that tiara.

375
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,437
- Problem, baby?
- No, there's no problem here.

376
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:23,059
Come on, hot stuff.
You're too foxy to fight.

377
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,195
- Polack. 
- Slut.

378
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,447
"A lot could happen between 
now and the contest."

379
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,892
- And that's a quote.
- You think it was a threat?

380
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:37,908
I just know she was dying to be 
dancing queen two years running.

381
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,427
- Doreen Di Nova?
- Yeah?

382
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,382
We need to talk to you 
about Benny Rosen.

383
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:51,251
Benny the Rose? Ooh.

384
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:53,153
That's a blast from the past.

385
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,567
You remember threatening him?

386
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,979
What?

387
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,187
Gloria, hang on a second.

388
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,434
I need a smoke.

389
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:19,179
You been talking to 
Sonya, huh? Right?

390
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,073
She a fatty now or what?

391
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,568
- You make good on that threat, Doreen?
- 'Cause Benny was murdered that night.

392
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,875
Oh, yeah? Well, that's news to me.

393
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,284
Where were you when the fire started?

394
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:33,173
On the floor, with my partner Ken.

395
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,899
What, did Sonya tell you I whacked Benny?

396
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,077
You denying you made a threat?

397
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:40,678
I might have said 
something as a psychout.

398
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,061
To win the contest?

399
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:47,211
Yeah. A thousand bucks was 
like a million to us back then.

400
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:49,963
And Ken needed that money, bad.

401
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,824
Why's that?

402
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,839
This is ancient history, right?

403
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,080
I can't get in trouble for 
breakin' any narcotics laws?

404
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,328
We're homicide.

405
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:05,269
Well, back then, coke 
was the drug of choice.

406
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,687
Hey, Hoover, save a bump for me.

407
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,364
Don't worry, baby, I got more.

408
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,070
Damn!

409
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,229
You're out.

410
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,430
You snorted it all?

411
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,089
Crap!

412
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:29,165
I'm in trouble, baby. 
Real trouble.

413
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:30,191
What do you mean?

414
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,843
I was supposed to deal that all that blow.
I'm into Chaney for thousands.

415
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:37,177
Well, you should have thought of that
before you snorted up all his merchandise.

416
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,553
I'm screwed. 
Chaney's gonna kill me.

417
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:48,286
You guys got the studio upstairs reserved?

418
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,970
That's right.

419
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,564
Well, if you ain't gonna use it,  
I thought maybe I'd get in some practicing.

420
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,656
We're gonna use it.

421
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:02,153
Doreen, that stuff throws off 
your timing, makes you sloppy.

422
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:05,017
If I were you, I'd be worried 
about Sonya's two left hoofs

423
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,877
and not my timing.

424
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:09,469
You used to be good... dedicated.

425
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,074
How come you don't practice 
no more like you used to?

426
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,129
What do you care, Bagleboy?

427
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:16,903
We're still gonna wipe the 
floor with you and Sonya.

428
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:28,446
I guess I should've realized 
Ken was an addict, but...

429
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:31,121
at the time everybody was snorting
like there was no tomorrow.

430
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:32,534
You still in contact with Ken?

431
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:36,955
Nah. Fire busted us all apart.

432
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:40,713
Burning of The Bell was the 
day disco died in South Philly.

433
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,509
Was Ken an anti-Semite 
along with being an addict?

434
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,651
Instead of Benny the Rose, 
he called him Benny the Nose, so...

435
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:50,208
So, Ken could have done 
something to Benny that night.

436
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:54,807
Maybe to knock him out of the contest, 
win that grand to pay off his coke debt?

437
00:24:55,475 --> 00:25:00,641
Though Sonya says you were the 
one who was so desperate to win.

438
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,211
Well, that figures.

439
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:06,771
I mean, me and the Polish American 
Princess weren't exactly soul sisters.

440
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,549
But I wasn't a coke fiend like Ken,

441
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,619
and I wasn't into Chaney 
for thousands of dollars.

442
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,174
The bullet's still in him?

443
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:24,411
Says it's a pain in his ass, literally.

444
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:27,238
- He'll only cooperate for a price.
- What price?

445
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:29,770
- Neighborhood of two grand.
- We don't live in that neighborhood.

446
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,222
Can't we compel him to 
give us the bullet?

447
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:34,493
- Get a search warrant?
- Check with the lawyers.

448
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,333
Doreen's partner, Ken Mazzacone,

449
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,264
served a stint at Camp Hill 
in '82 for dealing coke.

450
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:42,728
Went straight, got a license 
with the city, drives a cab now.

451
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:43,705
Want to go see him?

452
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,951
- Where are you with Doreen and Sonya?
- Both got motive, both got alibis.

453
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:49,539
They say they were on the dance 
floor when the fire broke out.

454
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,903
Witness statements 
from '78 back that up?

455
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:53,294
Yeah, I'm on it.

456
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:54,930
You two, see if you can 
find this cab dirver.

457
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,999
Lil, go visit ADA Kite

458
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:01,414
and find out about that search 
warrant for Mr. Rigley's backside.

459
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,434
Gotta take the first hack in line.

460
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:16,852
You're the hack we want, Ken.

461
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:19,680
Do us a favor, step on out of there.

462
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:27,210
You remember "Benny the Nose", Ken?

463
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:30,522
From The Bell?
Yeah, I remember Benny.

464
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,432
Turns out he was murdered 
before the fire broke out.

465
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:36,101
- That's a shame.
- Ain't it?

466
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:39,230
- What's it got to do with me?
- We heard you didn't like him.

467
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,094
That a crime? He was uppity.

468
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:42,366
'Cause he was a jew?

469
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,399
'Cause he was a drag.
A real Goody Two-shoes.

470
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,025
Wouldn't deal coke for Chaney, right?

471
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:50,422
Relax. This isn't drug bust.

472
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:51,627
Well, yeah.

473
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,752
Chaney didn't like a lot 
of people telling him no.

474
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,069
He liked you, though.

475
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:58,097
Hey, I ain't denying I 
made a little extra cash,

476
00:26:58,097 --> 00:26:59,837
selling merchandise for Mr. Chaney.

477
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,962
Except you used more than you sold.

478
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,651
Ended up owing Chaney a lot of moeny.

479
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:06,670
Heard you had a real love affair 
going with the nose candy.

480
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,084
Yeah, well, I'm off of that particular 
diet plan now, as you can see.

481
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:11,342
Thousand bucks, though.

482
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,000
Go a long way to paying off your debt.

483
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,094
All you had to do was 
eliminate the competition.

484
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,368
I've eliminated nobody. 
Didn't need to.

485
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,838
I was just as good a 
dancer as Benny was.

486
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,254
We heard Benny was the king.

487
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:22,954
Then you heard wrong.

488
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:25,753
Where were you when 
the fire broke out, Ken?

489
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:29,109
I was on the floor, 
warming up with Doreen.

490
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,971
Who's the rabbi?

491
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,238
That's Benny's dad.

492
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:56,614
- You sure? 
- Yeah, Mr. Rosen.

493
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,592
He comes into the cleaners sometimes.

494
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,749
- I'm gonna go say hello.
- Why?

495
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,492
Because he's looking for Benny,

496
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:04,868
and I'm gonna point him 
in the right direction.

497
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:07,350
Mess with The Nose's head.

498
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:13,968
Mr. Rosen, Doreen Di Nova,
from the Fluff and Fold.

499
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:17,271
- Have you seen my son? 
- Sure,

500
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,978
he's in the White Room. Come on.

501
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,409
Know why they call it the 
White Room, Mr.Rosen?

502
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,891
'Cause that's where they do the blow.

503
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,242
Cocaine.

504
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,752
You'd better stop talking, young man.

505
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,318
Or?

506
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:35,128
You don't wanna know "or".

507
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:38,202
Right in there.

508
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:41,734
Yeah, say shalomy to Benny for us.

509
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,284
Man was pissed going into that room.

510
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:48,960
I wouldn't wanna be 
Benny at that moment.

511
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,534
And you're positive 
it was Benny's father.

512
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:55,977
Hey, who else would be at The Bell,
hanging out with a Frisbee on his head?

513
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,387
- Not a chance.
- Don't say that, Kite.

514
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:03,605
No judge is gonna sign a search warrant

515
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,900
for a guy's body cavity to remove
a bullet. Just won't happen.

516
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,164
- So that's it?
- That's it. No sale.

517
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,862
- Out of luck.
- Try again tomorrow.

518
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:13,426
Just like the exhumation.

519
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,742
You're still smarting about that?

520
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:18,789
We're supposed to be on the same 
team here. / We are.

521
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:24,051
And my job, as your teammate, is to
let you know what's legally plausible.

522
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:25,124
This isn't.

523
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:29,690
How about the city offering 
some cash as incentive?

524
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,149
What i... what is this case anyway?

525
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:35,954
It's a... disco murder.

526
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,912
Disco? / Mm-hmm.

527
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:40,892
Lookit.

528
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:43,661
# Well, you can tell by 
the way I use my walk #

529
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,916
# I'm a woman's man, no time to talk...#

530
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,470
- Stop that, Kite.　　　　
- We should go dancing.

531
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,711
We should go dancing.

532
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:50,529
No... no.

533
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,932
I'll take that as a maybe.
Huh? Whoo!　　　　　　

534
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,411
- # Huh, huh, huh, huh... #
- Kite, honestly...　　　　　

535
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:59,772
- # In love... #
- this could be a deal breaker.

536
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:05,747
Eh, this, uh...

537
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:09,570
this guy, the, uh...
with the slug in his ass,

538
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,616
is he in any trouble with the law?

539
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:14,150
Out an parole for a B and E.

540
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,789
Let me talk to his parole officer.

541
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,948
See if he'll go for reduced parole in 
exchange for getting that slug taken out.

542
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:22,993
Do I have to do anything in return?

543
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:25,271
Dance.

544
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:32,376
Why didn't you tell us you were 
at the disco that night, Mr.Rosen?

545
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:36,462
I didn't see how it mattered.

546
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:39,969
Your wife know you went
to see Benny that night?

547
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:44,003
In orthodox temples, 
men and women sit apart.

548
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,734
I was gone and back 
before the service was over.

549
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:49,999
She didn't know.

550
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,124
What did you say to your son?

551
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,995
- That's private.
- Not good enough, Mr.Rosen.

552
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:57,725
Don't you wanna know who killed 
your boy? The 22 other people?

553
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:00,731
- Unless you already know.
- We know you got a temper.

554
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:02,440
And how betrayed you felt by Benny.

555
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,104
You think I killed my own son?

556
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,157
You had opportunity and motive.

557
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,888
You disapproved of him. 
You said so yourself.

558
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:12,831
For good reason.

559
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:19,807
Dad.

560
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,039
What are you doing here?

561
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:27,847
How can you pray in this cesspool?

562
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:30,657
What's it matter where I pray, 
huh, as long as I pray?

563
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,267
And what are you praying for?

564
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,087
To win a ridiculous dance contest?

565
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,406
Or to get your hands on more blow?

566
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,482
I don't do that, Dad.

567
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,603
Come to temple with me.
It's Friday night. The Sabbath.

568
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,513
I'm not gonna temple.

569
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:48,065
I'm not gonna 
dental school either, Dad.

570
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:54,301
You choose this degradation 
over your heritage?

571
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,363
This is my heritage now, Dad.

572
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:58,694
Disco. / Disco's a fad.

573
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:01,514
Your family, the temple, 
that's your life.

574
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,656
Disco's my life, Dad.

575
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,838
All right? It's not a fad.

576
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,910
It's here to stay.

577
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:12,041
And so am I.

578
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,223
In fact...

579
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,177
I'm gonna marry my dance partner,

580
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:19,183
the girl I love.

581
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,833
The shiksa.

582
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:33,900
You do and you'll never 
step foot in my house again.

583
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,091
Fine.

584
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,857
Fine.

585
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:50,165
Then you're no longer my son.

586
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:56,728
I renounce you.

587
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:01,195
It's why I didn't tell you.

588
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:04,076
Why I never told my wife.

589
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:09,574
Those were the last words
I ever spoke to my son.

590
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:15,558
"I... renounce... you."

591
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:21,010
Where'd you go after you left 
the White Room, Mr.Rosen?

592
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,689
I went back to the temple.

593
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:28,596
And while I was praying, 
my son was murdered,

594
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:32,061
burned to death.

595
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:46,388
Kite did us a solid, swinging 
that deal with Rigley.

596
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:47,573
Rigley went for it pretty quick

597
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:50,012
when he found out he 
could miss a day of work.

598
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:52,341
Sweeping up cigarette 
butts in 20-degree weather

599
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:55,809
or taking an easy outpatient procedure.
I can see taking curtain number two.

600
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,185
Slug's in pretty good 
condition, considering.

601
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,720
Is it a match to Benny's bullet?

602
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,598
Congratulations, Detectives.

603
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,702
You have twins.

604
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:07,472
Nice.

605
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:10,278
16 witness statements say 
Chaney was at the judges' table,

606
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:11,694
all the way up until the fire.

607
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:13,605
His gun, but he didn't use it.

608
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,725
What about our two dancing 
queens, Sonya and Doreen,

609
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,211
and the cabbie, Ken Mazzacone?

610
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,257
Alibi's held up. People saw 
them all on the dance floor.

611
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:23,776
And we verified David Rosen was back 
in temple before the fire broke out.

612
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:25,638
Who are we overlooking?

613
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:29,288
Witnesses put Chaney at the judges' 
table, but what about his son, Paul?

614
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:30,873
No statements about his whereabouts.

615
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:33,195
Just his own, right? Said he 
was with his father all night.

616
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:35,332
A father who's conveniently dead.

617
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:37,618
Little weasel like him, he'd know 
where his dad kept his gun.

618
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,364
And he'd have access to the White Room.

619
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:41,901
Only one problem, motive.

620
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:44,367
Why would Paul wanna 
kill Benny Rosen?

621
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:47,933
Paul Chaney was a little perv.

622
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,278
He have any beef with Benny?

623
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:52,674
Paul kind idolized Benny.

624
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,201
Wanted to dance like him.

625
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:57,272
He any good?

626
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:58,639
Total klutz.

627
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,274
He was always showing 
off for Benny, "Watch me"

628
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,466
like an annoying kid brother, you know?

629
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:07,923
He show off for Benny 
the night of the fire?

630
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,649
Earlier that day he did.

631
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,675
We were rehearsing a number...

632
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:38,995
Hey, Benny, can I cut in?

633
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,907
We're kind of working 
on a move here, Paul.

634
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:43,775
I know, the Argentinean Tango.

635
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,535
I can do it.

636
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:47,463
Watch me.

637
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,641
That's not bad.

638
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:54,633
Really?

639
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:56,416
Think I could dancer one 
day like you, Benny?

640
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,045
Yeah, Paul. Just keep practicing.

641
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:03,710
I will. 'Cause, one day, 
I'm gonna be the king like you.

642
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:06,556
Hey, Doreen.

643
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:09,547
Benny says I'm a good dancer.

644
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:13,313
Don't let it go to your head.
He thinks Sonya's good, too.

645
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,069
Dance with me, Doreen.

646
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,883
Yeah, all right.

647
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,671
Come with me.

648
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:59,584
Why would a disco queen like 
Doreen let Paul feel her up?

649
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,316
Owner's son, maybe.

650
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,255
Where was Doreen taking the kid?

651
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,641
Toward the White Room.

652
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:10,607
Me and that little twerp?

653
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,251
What, are you nuts?

654
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:15,216
According to Sonya, you guys 
were all over each other.

655
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,974
He was all over me, more like it.

656
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,705
Why'd you let Paul grope you like that?

657
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:24,333
- I fet sorry for him.
- You take him back to the White Room?

658
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,552
We talked to your dancing partner Ken.

659
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:29,300
Oh, yeah?

660
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,652
How's he?

661
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:32,309
Fat.

662
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:33,510
Ken says he can't remember

663
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,413
you being on the dance floor 
with him before the fire started.

664
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,540
I don't believe this.

665
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:46,035
You're trying to pin 
Benny's murder on me?

666
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:47,528
You got motive.

667
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,580
And without an alibi,
you got opportunity.

668
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,397
Unless you give us 
good reason not to...

669
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:52,512
We're gonna have to arrest you.

670
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,901
The hell you are.
I didn't kill Benny.

671
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:58,986
Then who did?

672
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,012
I don't know.

673
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,818
I swear.

674
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,192
I just wanted to win.

675
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:15,157
Here's the deal, you little horndog.

676
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:16,592
I'm listening.

677
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,487
Benny always comes in here 
right before dancing, right?

678
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,600
Right.

679
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,565
While he's doing whatever he does,

680
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,459
you sneak in wearing a ski mask,

681
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,505
whack him one on the knee.

682
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:30,608
Use a baseball bat, a tire iron, 
anything that'll do the job.

683
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,955
And you'll let me make it with you?

684
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,250
You knock Benny out of the contest,
I'll let you do whatever you want.

685
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:44,500
The only thing the little twerp 
was supposed to do

686
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,576
was wallop Benny on the leg,

687
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,172
put him out of commission.

688
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:50,672
But instead he killed him.

689
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:52,508
Then torched the place.

690
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:55,721
I don't know what 
Paul did or didn't do.

691
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:59,421
I was on the dance floor 
like I told you.

692
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,733
Oh, God.

693
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:07,449
I didn't want any permanent 
harm to come to Benny.

694
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,762
But the thought of that 
talentless bitch Sonya

695
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,683
winning the contest 
and wearing the tiara.

696
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,395
I couldn't let that happen.

697
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:18,415
You gotta understand

698
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:20,286
I was better than her.

699
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:22,377
Way better.

700
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:27,334
23 counts of murder 
in the first degree, Paul.

701
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,311
I want a lawyer.

702
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:29,751
I don't blame you.

703
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,558
Won't make a difference.

704
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:33,817
We got physical evidence.

705
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:36,491
That's the slug from 
Benny Rosen's skull.

706
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:40,015
That's the slug from your dad's gun,
one you threw in the Delaware.

707
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:43,486
Maybe you forgot,
you shot a burglar back in '77.

708
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:46,037
They're a perfect match, Paul.

709
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,245
So?

710
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:54,411
So we know the bullet that killed 
Benny came from your dad's gun.

711
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:55,957
Which you had access to.

712
00:39:55,957 --> 00:40:00,096
Plus Doreen told us 
about your little deal

713
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:03,660
knock Benny out of the contest,
get some action in returen

714
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,304
except you knocked him out permanently.

715
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,377
How do you live with yourself, Paul?

716
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:09,356
Knowing you killed the 
disco king you worshipped,

717
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:11,031
not to mention 22 other people?

718
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:15,774
23 if you count your dad
who drank himself to death.

719
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,918
I didn't kill those people.

720
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:23,190
Forensics says you did.

721
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,428
So does Doreen.

722
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,626
It wasn't my fault.

723
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,504
Whose was it?

724
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:33,381
It was...

725
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,323
it was Benny's fault.

726
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:30,078
Paul, what the hell?

727
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:33,056
Benny, I can explain.

728
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:36,670
Get off of me, you little twerp, 
before I kick your ass.

729
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,082
What are you calling me that for, Benny?

730
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,952
All I ever wanted to do was be like you.

731
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:47,819
You, like me?

732
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,597
You're the worst disco dancer in Philly.

733
00:41:57,443 --> 00:42:00,653
You think you're such hot stuff,
hogging up all the foxes for yourself.

734
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:04,411
Well, you ain't such 
hot stuff now, are you?

735
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:54,390
