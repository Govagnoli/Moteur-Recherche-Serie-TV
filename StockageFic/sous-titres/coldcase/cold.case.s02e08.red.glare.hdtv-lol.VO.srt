April 4, 1953

4
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,786
We have a new student
in class today.

5
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,276
His name's Robert.

6
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:30,805
And he's just moved 
here from st. Louis.

7
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:32,854
Since he's coming on late,

8
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:34,539
he'll need a study buddy.

9
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,999
Any volunteers?

10
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:39,739
Hmm?

11
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,490
That's swell,
Norman, thank you.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,190
Now, uh,

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,149
I gather you're all curious what 
brings Robert to Philadelphia, so...

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,059
Robert?

15
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,151
Go ahead, son.

16
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,376
My daddy's got a new job.

17
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,091
We had to move.

18
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,543
He's in a band.

19
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,042
There's a club here
wants him to play.

20
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:13,837
I got one of his records.

21
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:18,486
That's him there.

22
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,038
He plays drums.

23
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,794
Is he gonna be on bandstand?

24
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,940
Does he know Perry Como?

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,823
I don't think so, but...

26
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,665
he jammed with Louis Armstrong once.

27
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:32,100
Mr. Garvey,

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,737
if Norman doesn't want to 
be his study buddy, I will.

29
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:36,534
No way! You didn't raise your hand.

30
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,050
Neither did you, fatso.

31
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,129
Now, now, there's plenty of time
for everyone to get to know Robert.

32
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,692
Good morning, children.

33
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,974
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Garvey,
but there's been a...

34
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:51,444
a mix-up.

35
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,387
Robert. Get your things
and come with me.

36
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,586
What's all this?

37
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,236
- The boy's at the wrong school.
- I don't understand.

38
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,947
Elliot, look at him.

39
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,201
What's it matter?
He gets along well...

40
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,640
It matters plenty.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,903
Now, don't go making trouble.

42
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,786
I wouldn't want to
lose my best teacher.

43
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,029
Robert.

44
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,271
Name's Howard Garvey.

45
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,164
He's seeing this
court-ordered shrink.

46
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,792
Of course they get to 
talking about his father.

47
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:17,945
And?

48
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:22,153
The guy always heard his dad 
was a drunk, deserted the family.

49
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:24,878
Find out something new?

50
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,186
Yeah. The truth is, he was 
killed in Fairmount park, 1953.

51
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,368
Huh. So why the cover story?

52
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:35,225
Well, he's in my office, Lil.
You can ask him yourself.

53
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,667
I'll, uh, grab Scotty.

54
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,576
You can't be here.

55
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:49,162
Nice to see you too, Lil.

56
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,990
Yeah, you can't be here.

57
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:54,286
- I just want to talk.
- Christina.

58
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,554
Boss has something.

59
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,027
I don't put a lot of stock
in head doctors,

60
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,200
but I'm under orders.

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,752
And this guy had to check
my family's medical history.

62
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,075
For emotional disorders.

63
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,348
Depression, whatever.

64
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,663
I guess it's hereditary.

65
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:26,032
Or you thought maybe
your dad had it, too?

66
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,048
Yeah.

67
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:31,105
But if he did, well, that beat-down
in the park got him first.

68
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,282
Why do you think your mom
kept the murder a secret?

69
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,527
Don't know.

70
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:41,517
But the medical examiner's
report is clear-cut.

71
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,830
You, um...

72
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:47,185
have an accident, Howard?

73
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:51,159
No.

74
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:55,504
That was me.
That's why the court-ordered doc.

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,660
What does your family say
about your dad now?

76
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,630
Called my mom for the 
first time in 15 years,

77
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,500
see if maybe dad wasn't
a bum, after all. / And?

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,638
Said she'd call me back
after cribbage.

79
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,341
That was last week.

80
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,791
Got any siblings?

81
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,643
A brother. Dean.

82
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,705
Lost his number, long time back.

83
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,773
I don't even know
where my dad is buried.

84
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:22,620
If we do this, Howard,

85
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,947
we're gonna need you around.

86
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,327
I'm not going anywhere.

87
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:31,963
Sure about that?

88
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,362
I'm sure.

100
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,498
Said go ahead without her.

101
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,413
Elliot Garvey,

102
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,349
4th grade teacher,
found beaten to death,

103
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,870
no weapon, no suspects.

104
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,627
Car had two slashed tires,
a mile from the scene.

105
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:34,996
"Next" what?

106
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:39,089
They found a blade broken off
in one of the tires.

107
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,481
There's an engraving,
or part of one.

108
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,842
Looks like a bird wing, letter B.

109
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,866
Could be military.

110
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,571
See if we can source that logo.

111
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,401
Yeah.

112
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,135
And Garvey had a record.
Marijuana possession.

113
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:52,424
Busted in a raid two months
before he died.

114
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,467
715 north 33rd.

115
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:57,349
Mantua, in the 50's, that was
the other side of the tracks.

116
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,619
Poor, and all black.

117
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,774
So what's a white schoolteacher
doing there?

118
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:01,881
Buying?

119
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,610
And that's the secret
mom kept for 50 years?

120
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,649
Lot of information,
not a lot done with it.

121
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,741
Only a few interviews.

122
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:11,605
No neighborhood surveys.

123
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:15,200
Looks like they stopped working 
this job after a couple of weeks.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,456
So this one didn't go cold,

125
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,622
it started that way.

126
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,813
I knew you'd still be here.

127
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:38,271
I knew you'd come find me.

128
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,782
I'm going through a bad breakup.

129
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,139
I need a place to think things out.

130
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,393
What's wrong with New York?

131
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:51,893
This guy is...

132
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:55,508
it's not safe in New York.

133
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:59,968
I can't help you, Chris.

134
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,551
Hey, our guy had an arrest in Mantua.

135
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,435
Thought we'd go over to the address.

136
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:07,285
Yeah...

137
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,598
Yeah, good.

138
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,127
Hey. / Hi.

139
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,479
So, is there any way I...

140
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,213
Looking for Renaldo Copely.

141
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,419
We buried dad in January.

142
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,358
Something I can do for you?

143
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:46,783
Looking into an old murder, 1953.

144
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:48,564
Think your dad knew the guy.

145
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,821
'53? You're kidding.

146
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,771
Victim's name was Elliot Garvey.

147
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,517
Got pinched here in a drug raid.
You remember anything like that?

148
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,044
There were a lot of raids back then.

149
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,742
None of them legit.

150
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,799
All these arrests on
your dad's sheet,

151
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,454
any of them legit?

152
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:04,985
He was an activist.

153
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,049
Got locked up every other week.

154
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,149
Activist...

155
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,453
Little thing called civil rights?

156
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:13,122
Your dead guy was probably 
here for a meeting.

157
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,208
Don't suppose you remember him.

158
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,500
Didn't see a lot of 
white folks back then.

159
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,302
Ones I did...

160
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,789
made an impression.

161
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,612
Every train car, washroom, 
and lunch counter

162
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,265
is legally segregated in the south.

163
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:40,238
So I brought my family north.

164
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:44,364
And up here, we found
de facto segregation.

165
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:45,347
I'm Reina.

166
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,267
Elliot Garvey.

167
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,064
- Friend of Harlan's.
- This country is stuck...

168
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,014
Welcome. / in the 1860s.

169
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,440
England and France integrated 
their schools years ago.

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,983
Lots of folks are still fighting
the civil war down south.

171
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,435
Can we, uh, appeal to the mayor?

172
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,585
He's like all the politicians, Elliot.

173
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,229
"Change must be gradual."

174
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:06,597
The emancipation proclamation
was issued 90 years ago.

175
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:08,634
That's gradual enough.

176
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:14,119
Integration in classrooms won't 
happen unless we force it.

177
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,938
What do you say, Mr. Garvey?

178
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:27,238
Well, I, I, uh, don't know
about Europe or politicians...

179
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:30,627
but what I do know
is that this nice boy

180
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,916
got kicked out of my 
classroom last week,

181
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,961
and it just didn't seem right.

182
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:53,698
So...

183
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,601
these drug raids were just 
an excuse to break up the meetings.

184
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,872
They never ran out of excuses.

185
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,015
Who were the guys
taking down plates?

186
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:01,960
Who you got?

187
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,548
Cops, klan...

188
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:06,154
most people weren't real 
hot on integrating.

189
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,111
Any threats?

190
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,489
Guy burning a cross
on the porch, that qualify?

191
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,823
Wouldn't have burned
a cross on his porch.

192
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,427
For him, they'd have
done other things.

193
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,039
White man up here?

194
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,795
Means he's a sympathizer.

195
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,267
Made him a target, too.

196
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,193
Close game.

197
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:39,163
It's those aluminum bats.

198
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,185
When I came up,
they were all wood.

199
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:43,130
Had to work for an RBI.

200
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,073
That's kind of what we want
to talk to you about, Dean.

201
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,928
When you came up.

202
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,307
We're looking into
your father's death.

203
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:52,959
I don't like to talk about that.

204
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,055
Take after your mom.

205
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:57,635
You talked to her?

206
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:58,986
Tried.

207
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,067
Hit the retirement home this morning,

208
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,136
but she wouldn't come 
out of her room.

209
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,010
What's the big secret, Dean?

210
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,826
50 years, what does it matter?

211
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,619
We hear he got in
with some activists.

212
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:08,986
Activists. Right.

213
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,806
Maybe murdered over his involvement.

214
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,616
You make him out to be
some kind of hero.

215
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:18,683
- Took a lot of courage.
- He wasn't a hero.

216
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,356
Integration wasn't important?

217
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:23,117
Integration was a front.

218
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,167
Front for what?

219
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,588
Dinner, Harley.

220
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,956
Mr. Jenkins let the colored 
boy come back?

221
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,998
No. Shipped him off to Emlen.

222
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,542
That's rotten.

223
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,875
First thing every morning,
the children ask where Robert went.

224
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,641
Dean, about ready.
Wash up.

225
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:44,919
Already did, pop.

226
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,466
Mmm. What'd you put on this?

227
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,344
Something I picked up in Chinatown,
they call it soy sauce.

228
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,685
Chinatown?

229
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:53,807
Little adventure never 
hurt anyone, hmm?

230
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,991
Elliot!

231
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,468
- I saw that.
- You did not. Sit down.

232
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,806
So, Heather, you working at your
dad's soda counter this summer?

233
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:07,584
Yeah, that's right.

234
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,752
And going to the drive-in
with me every saturday night.

235
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:12,375
Maybe you should work, too, Dean,
instead of loafing your time away.

236
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,746
Ma, I got baseball.

237
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,675
And his trip to Washington.

238
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,490
I can't believe you're
gonna meet Mr. Eisenhower.

239
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,301
All I ask is you get a photo 
of you shaking his hand.

240
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,691
Elliot Garvey?

241
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,316
That's right.

242
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,740
Federal bureau of investigation.

243
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,739
Consider yourself served.

244
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,997
House un-American activities.

245
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,972
My father was no hero.

246
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,228
He was a communist.

247
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,632
All right, if Garvey
was a communist,

248
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,701
then your suspect pool
just got a deep end.

249
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,107
Well, figured it wasn't
the most popular club.

250
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,975
Better dead than red.

251
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,605
Maybe someone took that literally.

252
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,103
Got subpoenaed mid-May,

253
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:09,057
and he ends up dead
a month later, June 19.

254
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,889
He was supposed to 
testify the next day.

255
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,604
And we really think this guy
got killed over politics?

256
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,024
Joe McCarthy had people
crazed, Scotty.

257
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,779
Communism had overthrown 
China, Korea.

258
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,693
He had everyone convinced 
we were next.

259
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,743
Now, here's something.

260
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:26,776
Rosenbergs got the chair
at sing-sing in '53, June 19.

261
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:28,635
Same day as Garvey's murder.

262
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,148
Explains the touch-up on his car.

263
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,860
"You're next." / Yeah.

264
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,882
Much as I hate to say it, it could 
explain the soft investigation.

265
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:38,929
What, you think the
cops tanked the case?

266
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,675
Well, people didn't want
commie killers in prison,

267
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:42,586
they wanted them in office.

268
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,122
I'll put in a call to the bureau.

269
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:46,260
They kept files on all of them.

270
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:50,548
Been looking for a military 
match on that blade.

271
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:52,647
Got a hot bowl of nothing.

272
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,685
We'll take another crack at the wife.

273
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,022
Secret's out, maybe she'll talk.

274
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:04,907
Hey, your sister still in town?

275
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:07,529
How'd you know she's my sister?

276
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:09,166
I talked to her.

277
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,238
I don't recommend that too much.

278
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:19,283
Looking for a Mrs. Lang?

279
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,403
That's me.

280
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,794
Lilly Rush, homicide.

281
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,576
We'd like to talk to you
about Elliot.

282
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,447
I told the other ones,
I don't want to talk about that.

283
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,722
It's been 50 years.

284
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,995
When do you think might be good?

285
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,604
We're going to the Rodin.

286
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,802
The statues ain't going nowhere.

287
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:40,010
Neither is Elliot.

288
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,829
Your son Howard asked us
to look at the case.

289
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,585
He was referred to us
after his suicide attempt.

290
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,216
You didn't know?

291
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:57,789
I tried to make Howie forget
about his father.

292
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,457
I remarried.

293
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,757
Thought we could be a family again.

294
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,390
He didn't forget.

295
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,194
It was such a...
painful time.

296
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:10,436
I never wanted Howard
to have to know.

297
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,563
That his dad was a communist?

298
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:14,439
Elliot wasn't a communist.

299
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,924
Well, the feds came after him.

300
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:20,250
Yes, because he went to some
school integration meetings.

301
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,202
That's it?

302
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:23,857
That's all it took in those days.

303
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,530
Things took a steep dive after that.

304
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:41,341
Honey. You're early.

305
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:43,635
Here, let me take that.

306
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,714
I went overboard
and bought prime rib.

307
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,525
Don't be sore.

308
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,031
What is it?

309
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,670
Jenkins suspended me.

310
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,867
Whatever for?

311
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,436
He heard about the subpoena.

312
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,743
They can't do that to you.

313
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,401
But it's done.

314
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,478
There's a stop on my next paycheck.

315
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,903
Our bills will go past due.

316
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:14,467
I know.

317
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,063
Well...

318
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,280
it's ridiculous.

319
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:23,509
It's all a misunderstanding.

320
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:28,988
What are you doing?

321
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,957
We don't need prime rib.

322
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,054
In fact, most of these things,
we can do without.

323
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,195
He says it's just temporary.

324
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,519
I'm sure it'll all be fine.

325
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,901
It wasn't fine.

326
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,243
I take it he didn't get
his job back.

327
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,895
It was the beginning of the end.

328
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:56,440
Neighbors started to shun us.

329
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,102
The market wouldn't sell to us.

330
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:01,353
How'd Elliot handle it?

331
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,192
He got quiet.

332
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,528
Kept everything inside.

333
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:07,049
Well, you must've talked about it.

334
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,595
Not really.

335
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:12,343
The wall went up between us.
That was that.

336
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:15,314
Anyone he might've opened up to?

337
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,119
Our friend Harlan, who brought him
to that meeting in the first place.

338
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,621
Harlan. / Sealey.

339
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,607
Taught at Haverford.

340
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:39,033
The irony was, I was the 
dyed-in-the-wool communist.

341
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:42,458
Elliot just thought integration
was an okay idea.

342
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,052
So why'd they go after him?

343
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,941
First rule of a witch hunt.

344
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:48,813
Don't limit yourself to the witches.

345
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,091
Or maybe they wanted to roll him.

346
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,656
Elliot's FBI file says they 
were trying to get him to spill

347
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:55,130
who else was at those meetings.

348
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,642
Why do you think he lost his job?

349
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:57,732
They were ruthless.

350
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:01,163
But somebody kills him the night 
before he was supposed to testify.

351
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,387
So whoever he was gonna give up
might've had motive.

352
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:07,319
Oh, you don't have 
to tell me about that.

353
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:08,571
Were you named?

354
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:09,748
More than once.

355
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,746
But not by Elliot.

356
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,101
When they were done with me,

357
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:17,485
it was 12 years before I could 
get another teaching job.

358
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:20,326
- That's rough.
- Ah, I got off easy.

359
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,873
The Rosenbergs, 
they paid a real price.

360
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:27,147
And Elliot, that same night.

361
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,769
The third execution.

362
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,316
So you think they were related?

363
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:34,645
We're talking fanatics.

364
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:38,078
Any fanatics in particular
might've gone after Elliot?

365
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:41,890
There was an incident 
at a ball game.

366
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,281
Polio took my chance for sport.

367
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,131
But I've always loved to watch.

368
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:08,565
Hey, pop. Mr. Sealey.

369
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,266
How you feeling, Dean-o?

370
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:11,840
Not so hot.

371
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:15,805
They're saying this pitcher's throwing
fastballs right out of the majors.

372
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,089
Boy can really hum them in, huh?

373
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,654
He's just about leading
the whole world in home runs, too.

374
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,741
What do they say about his uniform?

375
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,265
Uniform?

376
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:28,228
Well, you figure he puts it 
on one leg at a time?

377
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,179
Yeah.

378
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,122
Yeah, I'll bet he does.

379
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:36,988
Maybe if you swing a hair sooner,
you might put some wood on the ball.

380
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:38,560
Hey, Garvey!

381
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,063
You missed the sign on the way in.

382
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,646
No parking on the grass,

383
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,740
no hooch on the field,

384
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,429
and no reds in the bleachers.

385
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,083
That's bunk, Wade.

386
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,000
Let me put it simple.

387
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:55,310
We don't want your boy
on the field with ours.

388
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,862
Come on, this is screwy,

389
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:59,665
You're already a disgrace
to the country.

390
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,017
Don't be one to your own kid.

391
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:05,831
Go on, son, go warm up.

392
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:10,270
You're cruising for
a bruising, pinko.

393
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:12,384
Dad...

394
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,497
Come on, let's just go.

395
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:17,435
No. We stay.

396
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,455
You better look around.

397
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:22,577
Not a soul here is
gonna stand behind you.

398
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,541
He took Dean and left.

399
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,174
I'd have done the same.

400
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,372
Ribble meant it.

401
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:43,193
He was an ignorant, violent man.

402
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,806
But when Elliot was killed,

403
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:47,510
you didn't report this Ribble 
guy to the police?

404
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,550
That would have been pointless.

405
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,987
Wade Ribble

406
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,073
was the police.

407
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,250
Wade Ribble had some IAB file.

408
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,775
Excessive force, false 
imprisonment, animal cruelty.

409
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,265
Shot the neighbor's dog.

410
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,601
Nice.

411
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,504
But you better have evidence
before you accuse a cop of murder.

412
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,716
You're the one thought they 
pulled up short on the case, boss.

413
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:19,362
That's a far cry from sweeping 
a homicide under the rug.

414
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,761
Hey, boss.

415
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:21,574
Morning.

416
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,330
What about the other angle?

417
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,066
People at the meetings?

418
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:28,353
Had a lot to lose if Elliot
named them when he testified.

419
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:30,933
That makes the timing of
his death pretty conspicuous.

420
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:31,963
You get names?

421
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:33,442
Sealey gave us a few.

422
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:34,927
All of whom are dead.

423
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:36,151
Ditto for Ribble.

424
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:39,612
But there's a restraining order in the
file from a lawyer named Bloodworth.

425
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:42,295
Telling officer Ribble
to step off Elliot.

426
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,909
Martin Bloodworth?

427
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:45,120
You know him?

428
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,907
I knew him.
He died last year.

429
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,624
If they were drawing up papers,
it was serious.

430
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:51,620
It's not the kind of thing
his wife would forget.

431
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,212
Wade Ribble was a menace.

432
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,757
And we obviously couldn't go
to the police about him.

433
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,631
So your lawyer filed
the restraining order.

434
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:03,082
Yes, and looked into his whereabouts
the night Elliot died.

435
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,362
What'd he find out?

436
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:08,941
Ribble was in Harrisburg, at 
the state baseball championships.

437
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,907
So there's an alibi.

438
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,277
Elliot said

439
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:18,602
the only thing Wade liked more than
berating pinkos, was berating umpires.

440
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:21,480
Do you know what Elliot was planning
on telling the committee?

441
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,782
Well, I know what
they wanted him to do.

442
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,262
They had a list, ten names.

443
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,207
All they wanted to hear was, yes,

444
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,602
these people were at the meetings.

445
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,890
But Elliot wouldn't do it?

446
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:37,597
Said he didn't want to ruin lives.

447
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:40,524
But that ruined ours.

448
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,645
Remember any names from that list?

449
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:45,187
Only one.

450
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,843
A name I've tried to forget.

451
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,591
Garveys'.

452
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:01,505
Yes.

453
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,613
Oh, hello.

454
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,294
I'll have to phone you back.

455
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,157
Let me guess.

456
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,499
The woman with the accent.

457
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,066
Barber shop closed today?

458
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:21,060
No.

459
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,657
They wouldn't take him.

460
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:24,667
Not them, too.

461
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,160
Hey, mister, pick that up.

462
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,232
What for? I don't need it.

463
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:33,051
What's that?

464
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,367
I'm not going to Washington.

465
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:37,615
- Of course you are...
- I'm not an eagle scout anymore.

466
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:39,477
- They just told me.
- They give a reason?

467
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,872
Yeah. One guess.

468
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,363
I'll be at Heather's.

469
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,618
We're pariahs, Elliot.

470
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:56,033
All you have to do is give 
those names, and it will stop.

471
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,312
These feds with their scare tactics,

472
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,477
going to the neighbors,
they're bullies.

473
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:04,396
- I don't give in to bullies.
- You can't beat them.

474
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:14,459
- It's because of her, isn't it?
- What?

475
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,749
She's on the list.
You're protecting her. / Kay...

476
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,425
- Is she more important than us?
- Of course not.

477
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:22,490
Then name her.

478
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,398
Her name was Reina Kraus.

479
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,191
She was at those meetings?

480
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:34,669
And she was Elliot's mistress.

481
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:36,071
You hear that from him?

482
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:37,537
I just knew.

483
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:41,278
She was so beautiful,

484
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,357
exotic, worldly.

485
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:47,094
How's a simple housewife
compete with that?

486
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:48,264
Excuse me.

487
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,018
Wasn't expecting you, Howard.

488
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:57,182
Dean called. 
Said she was here.

489
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:03,819
Hi, mom.

490
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,446
Hi.

491
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:09,087
Your mom's been real helpful.

492
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:11,229
They say you've had some troubles.

493
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:12,491
That surprise you?

494
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:15,832
Howard, I'm sure your mother did
what she thought was best at the time.

495
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:18,416
Telling us dad abandoned us?

496
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,630
Like some deadbeat?

497
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,807
You're too young to remember 
the shame...

498
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,087
That's crap, mom.

499
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,949
You're the one who dug
this up, Howie, not me.

500
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,264
How else was I supposed to find
out what happened to dad?

501
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:31,480
She was trying to protect you,
Howard.

502
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:38,976
Well, she did a bang-up job.

503
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,562
Let me see, Howie.

504
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,552
Two...

505
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:03,507
three...

506
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:06,162
and exhale.

507
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:13,094
This last one is shavasana,
or corpse pose.

508
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,351
You're the detective?

509
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:20,405
Is there somewhere we can talk?

510
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:28,652
We got out of Prague in '44.

511
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:32,953
My father wanted me to live in
a country without oppression.

512
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:35,052
Little did he know.

513
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,423
Ironic, I know.

514
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,914
You spend a lot of time
with Elliot Garvey?

515
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:43,877
As much as I could.

516
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:45,918
How long was the affair?

517
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:48,072
There was no affair.

518
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,709
His wife says otherwise. / No.

519
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,242
We took walks,

520
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,396
we talked,

521
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,902
that's all.

522
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:01,152
The fact that you were on 
the list, Reina, gives you motive.

523
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,031
But I could never have hurt Elliot.

524
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,581
He meant too much.

525
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,890
Some of us will be downtown tonight.

526
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,184
For drinks.

527
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:14,002
I don't know if I can make it.

528
00:28:14,002 --> 00:28:15,252
Why not?

529
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:17,991
It's complicated, with Kay.

530
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,798
She wants me to cooperate.

531
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,954
What do you want?

532
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,867
I want to do right.

533
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:28,934
So what is that?

534
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:31,259
To me, it's saying no.

535
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,256
No one knows what the future is,

536
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:36,578
but I think the world will look 
back at McCarthy as a disgrace.

537
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:37,990
That's hard to believe.

538
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,774
If you're asking for permission to
name me, I can't give it to you.

539
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:51,927
Kay thinks this is about you.

540
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:55,020
That there's something between us.

541
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:59,014
There is.

542
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:04,231
I knew at the meeting that night,
what you said, so genuine...

543
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,749
Reina...

544
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:09,613
Tell me you don't feel what I do.

545
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,658
Say something.

546
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,264
I believe in marriage.

547
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,854
He was true to her.

548
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:29,378
Which made me love him even more.

549
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:32,220
Do you know what he was going
to do, when he testified?

550
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,155
I'd like to think the right thing.

551
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,049
For you or for his family?

552
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,751
For him.

553
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,943
Who were the other names
on the list?

554
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:04,364
Cute cats.

555
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,815
Kind of tweaked, but...

556
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:08,874
What are you doing here?

557
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:12,259
I don't know where to go.

558
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,461
Trains to New York are still running.

559
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,089
I told you, I can't go back.

560
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:21,055
And I told you, you can't stay.

561
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:27,675
Lil...

562
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,056
it was nine years ago.

563
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:36,311
Can we get over this?

564
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:39,040
I don't know, Chris.

565
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,747
You have to forgive me sometime.

566
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,085
Would you?

567
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:46,976
No.

568
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:50,658
Okay.

569
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,425
Just so you know...

570
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:57,423
I like being back here.

571
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:01,713
So I'll be around.

572
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:04,207
It's a big city.

573
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,624
Rush got the names
from that french lady.

574
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:12,782
She's Czech.

575
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:14,127
Whatever. We got the list.

576
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,500
But we don't need it.

577
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,004
Mrs. Lang said something about scouts.

578
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:20,557
Got me thinking about our broken blade.

579
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,072
I ain't looking at any more logos.

580
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,924
This "B" here? / Yeah?

581
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:28,477
BSA. Boy scouts of America.

582
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,586
We're looking for a boy scout gone bad?

583
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:33,055
He was an eagle scout, actually.

584
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:35,504
Till he got his wings clipped.

585
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,322
'53 was a tough year for you.

586
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:45,604
Bounced off the baseball team,
cub scouts didn't want you.

587
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:46,852
Eagle scouts.

588
00:31:46,852 --> 00:31:49,515
Right. That's like the elite.

589
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:52,500
The eagle scouts become CEOs,
cabinet members.

590
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,045
They ain't stuck calling
strikes in juco ball.

591
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,540
Quite a turn your life took.

592
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,820
Those are the breaks.

593
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,447
All because of your dad.

594
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:02,048
Makes what you did
almost justifiable.

595
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,314
I didn't do nothing.

596
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:05,913
You followed him that night,
you slashed his tires.

597
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:07,320
Made it so he had to walk home.

598
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,161
You knew he'd go through
the park. / No.

599
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,855
- It was an ambush!
- You're wrong!

600
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:14,847
They got a merit badge
for premeditated murder, hmm?

601
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:29,664
I didn't kill my dad.

602
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:32,501
So explain that knife.

603
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,126
I trashed the car...

604
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,462
but I was only trying to scare him.

605
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,424
Why?

606
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:43,411
Because he was supposed
to testify the next day.

607
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,478
Can't you people leave me alone?

608
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,751
Oh, my god!

609
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,517
Dean?

610
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,376
Dean, stop.

611
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,305
Relax, it's okay, son.

612
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:14,593
I don't really want you dead.

613
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,428
I know.

614
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:16,587
I just...

615
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:19,017
just I wanted you
to be scared, and...

616
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:20,128
Son, it's okay.

617
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,747
It's not okay!

618
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,284
Just, just do what 
they want, would you?

619
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,787
Dean, they're asking me
to hurt people.

620
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,884
Son, I swear, later on, 
you'll understand.

621
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:32,806
Later's gonna mean nothing for me!

622
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,692
The girl I want to marry
even deserted me.

623
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:36,659
Heather?

624
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:37,679
Dean, don't go.

625
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,884
- Listen, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be sorry!

626
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:43,044
Fix it!

627
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:03,771
It was my fault.

628
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:08,997
He wouldn't have been in
that park if it wasn't for me.

629
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:11,972
Your dad's friend, Reina,

630
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:16,281
you said she and Harlan Sealey
were holding hands?

631
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:17,807
Yeah.

632
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:21,440
Sounds like Harlan and Reina were close.

633
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,156
Close enough Sealey
should've mentioned her.

634
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:26,054
He knew she was at those meetings.

635
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:28,030
So he's covering for her.

636
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,414
But why?

637
00:34:31,454 --> 00:34:33,274
You had the pick of the crop,

638
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:35,117
didn't you, Reina?

639
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,326
With Elliot, Harlan.

640
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,259
What do you mean?

641
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:41,501
But you also had a problem.

642
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,461
If you were named, you'd be deported.

643
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:44,690
Yes.

644
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,419
Yeah. Forgot to mention that.

645
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,720
How is that relevant?

646
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,782
I'm guessing that's why
you loved Elliot so much.

647
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,631
Why you couldn't allow him
to name you.

648
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,575
You were looking out for number one.

649
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:59,262
I would have gone to Siberia
if Elliot asked me to.

650
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:01,678
Yet you were cozying up
to Harlan Sealey,

651
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:04,002
not a mile from where
Elliot was killed.

652
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,445
If I was so scared of being deported,

653
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:08,118
I would have married Harlan.

654
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,439
Did he ask you?

655
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,547
Yes.

656
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:13,550
But he was a...

657
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,337
he was a man of words.

658
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:20,693
I wanted the real thing.

659
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:22,789
You wanted Elliot.

660
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,538
Did Harlan know that?

661
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,690
It was obvious.

662
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:33,544
And he knew Elliot might
give your name to the committee,

663
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:36,734
sending you back to Prague.

664
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:51,694
You gave us a lot, Mr. Sealey.

665
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:54,474
Names from the meetings,

666
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:56,692
a dirty cop... / all of whom are dead.

667
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:58,006
And innocent.

668
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,040
But thanks, anyway.

669
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,838
I'm sorry nothing panned out.

670
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,473
Well, Reina Kraus is still around,

671
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:08,751
but you didn't mention her.

672
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,741
Reina had nothing to do
with Elliot's death.

673
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:12,949
But she did.

674
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,184
She was the reason.

675
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:16,627
You wanted to marry her.

676
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:21,874
I plead guilty to being
a young man in love.

677
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:25,478
Must've hurt knowing
she loved Elliot.

678
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:26,937
What about Harlan, here?

679
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,716
She said he was a man of words.

680
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:32,441
All talk, no action.

681
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:35,005
- That's tough luck.
- I didn't begrudge Elliot anything.

682
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:38,764
No? Even though he was the one 
standing up to the feds, the hero?

683
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,223
And the one getting the girl?

684
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:43,157
The girl Elliot might give up 
to the committee the next day.

685
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:47,281
Elliot hadn't decided
on anything that night.

686
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:51,759
How do you know?

687
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:54,077
I mean, either you're 
some kinda psychic...

688
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:56,725
or you were with him that night.

689
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:04,584
They're not gonna put me away.

690
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,798
I only have a few years left.

691
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:10,157
Then you can decide right now

692
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:12,667
how you're gonna live them.

693
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:18,442
It wasn't just Elliot
that died that day.

694
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:20,901
A whole family died, too.

695
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:23,379
You want to be a man of action?

696
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,142
This is your last chance.

697
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,671
Those refused to admit 
any wrongdoing

698
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:35,374
and they claimed their innocence
right up till the end.

699
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:37,156
And that's the news from sing-sing.

700
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,779
Officially, then, and at long last

701
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:42,700
atom spies Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg are dead.

702
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:55,631
So terrible.

703
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:02,705
It's too bad that Elliot
didn't make it tonight.

704
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:04,947
He has a lot on his mind.

705
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,279
Naturally.

706
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,829
I'm going home, Harlan.

707
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,229
Good night.

708
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:14,501
Good night.

709
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,349
There you are.

710
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:32,264
Missed you.

711
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:33,451
Evening, Harlan.

712
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:37,409
That's some nasty business here, huh?

713
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:40,010
May have to arrange for a tow.

714
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,940
Come on.

715
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,247
I'll walk you home.

716
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:45,927
In case they come back.

717
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,463
They're not coming back.

718
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:51,640
Well, can't be too careful.

719
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,301
Big day tomorrow.

720
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,211
Yeah.

721
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:08,535
If I were a gambling man,

722
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:11,565
I wouldn't dare sit down 
at the table with you tonight.

723
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:15,241
I have a lot to think over.

724
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,241
There's not a soul out here with us.

725
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:20,080
We could talk it through.

726
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,419
I'm all talked out, Harlan.

727
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,909
Might help.

728
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:25,686
Even a good man sometimes folds.

729
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,114
Listen, Harlan, you 
don't have to worry.

730
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,582
You're not on the list.

731
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,861
Then what's to think over?

732
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,483
Reina is on the list.

733
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:36,364
Yeah.

734
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,719
What about her?

735
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,506
Will you name her?

736
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:42,221
Kay wants me to.

737
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,572
And?

738
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:45,718
However, my conscience 
says not to.

739
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:46,685
So?

740
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,118
So I...

741
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:51,186
I don't know what I'll do.

742
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:52,660
What are you doing?

743
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,654
You can't give her up.

744
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,262
- Get ahold of yourself!
- You can't!

745
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,267
I never said I would!

746
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,572
I can't take the chance.
