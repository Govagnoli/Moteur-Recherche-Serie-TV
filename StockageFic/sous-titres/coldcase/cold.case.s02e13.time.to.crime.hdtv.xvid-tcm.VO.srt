00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,913
August 9, 1987

4
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:12,038
Higher. Mommy, higher!

5
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,500
Do an underdog, mom.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,582
All right, Miss Fish.

7
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,105
One underdog coming up.

8
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,430
No!

9
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,360
Kayla.

10
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:08,425
Baby, wake up.

11
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:10,309
Wake up for mommy.

12
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,006
Please.

13
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,125
Kayla!

14
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,093
Nick.

15
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,823
Record lows out there, Scotty.

16
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,221
Yeah.

17
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,768
Hey, Lil.

18
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,294
Kinda chilly in here, too.

19
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,011
I hear you went to
Christina's bar.

20
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:23,909
Yeah?
From who?

21
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,465
From her.

22
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,298
Me and Nicky went for 
a couple of beers.

23
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:32,000
Not like we knew 
she was working there.

24
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:33,497
Ain't that right?

25
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:35,207
Gospel.

26
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,686
- I ain't interested in your sister, Lil.
- Good.

27
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,146
'Cause she's a train wreck.

28
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,997
Okay.

29
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,955
- And she didn't hit on you?
- No.

30
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,242
You know the Mayor's 
gun recovery program?

31
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,410
Turn in a weapon,
get a pair of sneakers?

32
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,680
This kid from Strawberry Mansion turned it 
in a month ago for a pair of Allen Iverson.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,600
And FIU finally got around to it?

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,027
Tunrs out the gun got
a body on it.

35
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:05,876
Drive-by shooting, 1987.

36
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:07,757
- The job ever come in?
- Unsolved.

37
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,973
- Victim was a six year-old girl.
- And this is what killed her?

38
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,663
Rifling matched the projectile
found at the scene.

39
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:17,366
This is Jason James
and his son Jason Jr.

40
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:20,232
Stupid here's the one who took my gun 
without permission, turned it in.

41
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,233
How was I supposed 
to know it was hot?

42
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,071
Saying I did.

43
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,076
Mr James, how long did you 
own this gun?

44
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:26,645
Five years.

45
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,174
Bought it at a gun show,
Barearms Bonanza.

46
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:31,308
- Got proof of that?
- Nah.

47
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,918
But I remember the guy
I bought it from.

48
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,819
Uncle Sam Murray.
Wears that crazy hat and everything.

49
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,517
Gun's got a history, Mr James.

50
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,650
It killed a little girl.

51
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,691
So maybe it was a good thing
I turned it in.

52
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,927
- Take off those shoes.
- Dad, it's snowing outside.

53
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,764
Get 'em off.

54
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,676
You ain't profitting off
of someone getting killed.

55
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,625
How much you pay for this, 
back in 2000?

56
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,277
89 bucks.

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,713
That's cheap.

58
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,513
Well, it was used.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2005/01/30

69
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,022
Drive-by at Langston Hughes Park.

70
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,356
There at that time was 
a drug war over turf.

71
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:39,949
Kayla Odoms was hit on a bullet 
ricocheted off the basket ball pole.

72
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,474
Yeah, it got her on the chest.

73
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:45,312
Cops in '87 figured the real target 
was one of the players or onlookers.

74
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:48,908
Two of the spectators were ex-cons, 
one was a known drug dealer,

75
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:51,044
six others was petty records
at the scene.

76
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,818
It's a big suspect pool.

77
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:58,125
911 caller, Rodney Johnson calls it 
in from a pay phone three blocks away.

78
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,718
Three blocks?

79
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,340
Cell phones were science fiction
in '87, Scotty.

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,791
Got anything on the car?

81
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,903
B's, two door sedan.

82
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,539
No ID on the make or plates.

83
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,568
I'll send Vera and Jeffries
to talk to the family.

84
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,627
We'll go see the gun dealer,
who sold the MAC to Jason James.

85
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,265
Yeah, this Uncle Sam character.

86
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:18,742
What do you guess the time
to crime was on this weapon?

87
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:19,979
Less than a week?

88
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,441
What, for a MAC-10?

89
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:25,558
I bet someone bought that bad boy,
used it on a crime that very day.

90
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,943
We lost Kayla 18 years ago.

91
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:33,987
Why we gotta relive it now?

92
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,122
Mom, they got a good lead
with this gun.

93
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:38,987
Let's start with you, Mr Odoms.

94
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,938
Where were you when
Kayla got shot?

95
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:43,598
I was driving a cab,
till one thirty.

96
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:44,966
And you, Darnell?

97
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,355
Home, watching TV.

98
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,810
The man you see here,
he was just a pup back then.

99
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,184
Turned 12 that day.

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,092
Kayla was killed on your birthday?

101
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:56,195
Do you know, she'd be 24 now.

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,702
Can you remember who was 
at the park that night, Mrs Odoms?

103
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:03,162
I just remember Kayla talking
the blue streak on those swings.

104
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,086
That girl, she could talk.

105
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:08,441
So I wasn't paying much
attention to anyone else.

106
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,643
Till after...

107
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,011
You think Darnell liked 
the fishes I gave him?

108
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,273
I know he did.

109
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,821
You don't think he'd mind
I named them for him?

110
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:19,010
He can change them
of he wants to.

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,141
No, he can't.

112
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,431
Gourmis gotta be called Kissy-face,
because the way their mouths go.

113
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,203
You know what Darnell 
wants to be when he grows up?

114
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,050
- What?
- An ichthyologist.

115
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,131
- Ichthyologist?
- Yeah, fish doctor.

116
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,480
- Where do you get these words?
- From Darnell.

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,848
He's really smart.

118
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,803
Higher, mom. Higher.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,469
- Do an underdog, mom.
- All right, Miss Fish.

120
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,853
One underdog coming up.

121
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,969
No!

122
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:02,221
Kayla!

123
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,645
Baby, wake up.

124
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,209
Oh my god.

125
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,204
Don't touch me.

126
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:13,836
Nobody touch me.

127
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,304
Hey, someone call an ambulance.

128
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,937
Ain't no phone working 
around here.

129
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,063
Besides it ain't no use anyway.
The girl's dead.

130
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,294
She's not dead.

131
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,421
- She's gonna wake up.
- I'll find a phone, all right?

132
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,690
Just.. don't worry.

133
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:29,776
Please.

134
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:32,073
Kayla!

135
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:37,002
I didn't let her out of my arms till the 
paramedics got there thirty minutes later.

136
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,670
What were you doing at 
the park at ten p.m.?

137
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,161
It was stifling that night.
Me and Kayla couldn't sleep.

138
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:48,047
We went out for a walk.

139
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,768
If we just stayed home,
Kayla would be alive.

140
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,625
You couldn't have known
what was gonna happen that night.

141
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,765
I've been telling her that
for 18 years.

142
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:58,753
We both have.

143
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:01,188
Don't matter.

144
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,827
It's still my fault.

145
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:06,277
Always will be.

146
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:23,059
Well, here's a handsome couple.

147
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,599
- Uncle Sam Murray?
- Let me guess.

148
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,086
Firearm for the missus.

149
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,651
Strictly safe defense.

150
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,876
Am I right?

151
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,816
You sold a MAC-10 to a man
named Jason James five years ago?

152
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:37,193
I've been selling quality firearms
for close to 20 years.

153
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,247
You can't expect me 
to remember one sale.

154
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,456
Well, that's why we brought this.

155
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,130
You recognize him?

156
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,252
He do something wrong?

157
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,018
Gun did something wrong.

158
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,553
Little girl was killed with that.

159
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,645
Hey, that ain't my fault.

160
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,072
I'm a dealer.
I don't gotta do background checks.

161
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,881
Where did you get the gun?

162
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,804
You saying I had something 
to do with the shooting?

163
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,900
Maybe.

164
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,368
If you owned it in '87.

165
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,402
That is a wild accusation.

166
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:03,670
I resent it,

167
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,175
I abhor it,
I deny it.

168
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,637
Hey, Uncle Sam.
Listen up.

169
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,275
You had the gun at 2000.
We gotta trace it to '87.

170
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,923
So where and when did
you get the MAC-10.

171
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,794
I got it in '99.

172
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:18,735
Keep going.

173
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:22,961
I was visiting my dad at the Delaware
Downs housing projects.

174
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,951
Don't shoot, players.
I'm unarmed.

175
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,452
You with the housing 
authority, mister?

176
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,235
Can't say that I am.

177
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,478
Wel, you ain't no ganster, so...

178
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,448
Put that thing down, son.

179
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,068
Now.

180
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,661
Are you crazy, boy?

181
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,027
This is a real gun.

182
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:02,548
Ain't no bullets in it.

183
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,300
What do you call those?

184
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,830
Where the hell did you get this?

185
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,896
- I ain't telling.
- Give it back!

186
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:12,494
You lucky to be alive, 
you know that?

187
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:17,115
Now git! Before I really bust 
a cap in your scrawny asses.

188
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:24,392
Those boys came this close 
to meeting their maker.

189
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,291
This close.

190
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,790
You didn't tell their parents?

191
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,086
No.

192
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,179
Kids ran in the apartment across 
the hall and slammed the door.

193
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,985
Slammed it, huh?

194
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,750
So you just walked on out of there?

195
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,491
Those kids were lucky
I showed up when I did.

196
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:41,887
Lucky for you, too.

197
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,178
Free gun and all.

198
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:44,909
Hey, I saved their lives.

199
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,106
And made 88 bucks to boot.

200
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,430
They're gouramis,

201
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,203
you don't have them yet.

202
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,230
I know.
Thanks.

203
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,950
Dad helped me pick
them out.

204
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,677
They're gonna be all right
in this heat?

205
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,545
For an hour, sure.

206
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,867
If they're not, Darnell
can fix 'em.

207
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,610
He's gonna be a fish doctor.

208
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,707
There's something going down.

209
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,127
We gotta enhance this.

210
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,252
The Philly PD way.

211
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:21,852
You know, any other city, they'd
have one of them zoomer sticks.

212
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:24,913
Ah, quit griping.
Your eyes are better than mine.

213
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,366
See the guy in red shorts?

214
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,548
- Yeah.
- Cedric Browning.

215
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,607
I arrested him couple of years ago.

216
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,797
Maybe this household heated
it up a little bit later that night?

217
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,584
Girls Gone Wild?

218
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,724
Video tape the Odoms family
made, day of the murder.

219
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:43,260
It was the brother's birthday.

220
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,480
You got anything?

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,874
Well, there's some kind of 
scuffle going on here.

222
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,529
We'll check it out.
Might be connected to the shooting.

223
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,027
Uh, boss had a snafu 
with the gun.

224
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:52,878
What's that?

225
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,482
Well, the serial number showed it was 
manufactured at Barkan Industries.

226
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,376
They have a record of it leaving
the factory in August '87.

227
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:00,452
Going for where?

228
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,980
The Second Amendment.
A gunshop in West Philly.

229
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,373
- So what do their records say?
- That's just it.

230
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:09,372
The Second Amendment says they never received 
the credit guns that included our MAC-10.

231
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:12,474
So that baby was born, left the
hospital, never made it home.

232
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:15,004
Maybe it was delivered to
the wrong store?

233
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,575
Or maybe someone kidnapped it.

234
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,816
The owner at Barkan Industries says 
he's gonna see through his records.

235
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:25,212
- No warrant necessary.
- What a guy.

236
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,228
Now, we gotta find out where 
that gun went, Nick.

237
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:30,997
- If it was delivered to the wrong store.
- Or if it was stolen before it ever got to one.

238
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:33,179
It sounds like fun.
Wish we can help, but..

239
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,281
- We're on the street, boss.
- Delaware Downs?

240
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,052
Uncle Sam said these kids
with the MAC went back

241
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,821
into an apartment catty-corner
to his dad's.

242
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,657
Well, hopefully the buck
stops there.

243
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:44,070
One gun can pass through
a lot of hands in 18 years.

244
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,186
All we need to know is 
who was holding it in '87.

245
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,947
Hey.

246
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,475
So Christina didn't come 
on to you?

247
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,248
- Nah.
- Not how I saw it.

248
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,636
Well, you left, Nick. 
You didn't see anything.

249
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,590
- You gotta call it off.
- Don't worry about it.

250
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,489
Serious.

251
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,963
- It's what you call 'ill-advised'.
- Hey, I'm on it, okay?

252
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:32,973
Yes?

253
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,077
Philly Homicide, ma'am.

254
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,864
We're tracking a murder weapon.
It was last seen in this apartment in '99.

255
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,101
'99, you say?

256
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,700
I was here in '99.

257
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,340
Hell, I was here in '89.

258
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,688
Feel like I've been here
since'09.

259
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:53,004
Man saw two boys out
in the stairwell playing with a gun.

260
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,382
MAC-10.

261
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,120
- And they ran into your place.
- Well, that figures.

262
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,043
Ma'am?

263
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:00,769
Those boys are my grandsons.

264
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,989
- Where'd they got the gun?
- Where I kept it under floor board,

265
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:07,460
- thinking they'd never find it.
- So that gun was yours?

266
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,058
Not exactly.
I stole it.

267
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,642
- Mind telling us from who?
- Am I gonna catch trouble?

268
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,317
Nah.

269
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,657
From a family I was working for.
This was, what, back in '93.

270
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,665
Truly,

271
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:26,179
can I have a word, please?

272
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,782
Shut the door, please.

273
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,378
Is there something you'd
like to tell me?

274
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,988
I don't think so, Eric.

275
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,484
I think there is.

276
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,580
I think you found something
under my mattress.

277
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,652
No.

278
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,365
- You're lying.
- I got vacuuming to do.

279
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,587
You're the only one who
comes in here.

280
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,835
I know you took it.
Now give it back.

281
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,375
What? / Give back to me, Truly,
or I swear to god..

282
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,235
I see these pictures you draw.

283
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,500
List of all those people 
with skulls by their name.

284
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,009
Ever hear the word privacy?

285
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,631
I ain't gonna let you
shoot up yourself,

286
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,154
this house or anyone 
else for that matter.

287
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:13,702
Then I'll just get another gun 
and hunt you down with it.

288
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,414
You can try Eric.

289
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:20,451
Just remember you ain't 
the only one gonna be armed.

290
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,441
I took that kid's gun 
for his own good.

291
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:30,062
Then my grandkids nearly 
got killed with it.

292
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,502
Any idea where Eric got hold
of that MAC-10?

293
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,955
Nope. Never had a chance to 
find it out either.

294
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:36,926
Got fired the next day.

295
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,753
No good deed goes
unpunished.

296
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:42,719
Sounds like you might've
saved some lives there, Truly.

297
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:45,733
Maybe, maybe not.
Who's to say?

298
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,057
Just finished retooling.

299
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,405
On account of the assault
weapon bans being lifted.

300
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:56,294
It's about time they stop meddling 
with the Second Amendment.

301
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:58,283
Sold many MACs back in 1987?

302
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:02,689
MACs were the weapon of choice
among certain populations back then.

303
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:05,938
You got the invoices, which stores 
the guns were shipped to?

304
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,656
All that records post '92
are computerized.

305
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:12,933
Pre '92, however..
is a different story.

306
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,843
That's unfortunate.

307
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:19,757
If in case my MACs was delivered 
to the wrong store by accident,

308
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,196
I'm not liable, right?

309
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,043
We're just looking for
the shooter, Mr Barken.

310
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,044
Yeah, unless you pulled
the drive-by in '87,

311
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,728
you got nothing to worry about.

312
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:28,586
Good, good.

313
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,957
I just make them.

314
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,525
Can't control who buys them.

315
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,661
Take all the time you need.

316
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,717
Nice guy.

317
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,550
Eric Morrison?

318
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:51,165
Yeah, I'm Eric.

319
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:52,179
Did I do something?

320
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,389
You know a woman who 
used to work for your family?

321
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,523
Truly Sinclair.

322
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:56,737
Yeah, sure.
Why?

323
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,855
Well, she says she took a gun
from you in 1993.

324
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:02,091
- Yeah.
- MAC-10.

325
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,533
- Yeah.
- How long did you own it?

326
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:07,352
Six, seven months.
Why? Is Truly in trouble?

327
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,512
'Cuz.. she kinda saved my life.

328
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:11,272
Yeah? How?

329
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:13,771
I told my parents Truly stole
money from me.

330
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,662
But she told them the truth
about the gun.

331
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,560
- But they believed you?
- No.

332
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,437
They believed her.

333
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,386
Came down on me like
a ton of bricks.

334
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,349
But Truly says she was fired
the next day.

335
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,405
Yeah, she was.
For stealing.

336
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:28,021
My parents were jerks.

337
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:31,604
So you're 16 years old. How do 
you get your hands on a MAC-10.

338
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,578
That's kind of a funny story.

339
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:36,337
Maybe not that funny.

340
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:38,008
See, we lived near this..

341
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:41,868
this riding club where I used
to draw pictures of satan and stuff,

342
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,342
freak out the riders.

343
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,201
Hasta la vista, baby.

344
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,378
Sweet.

345
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,001
- Okay, let me try.
- Wait, I wanna see what I hit.

346
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:16,158
Dude..

347
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:19,418
Check this out.
It's terminated.

348
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,981
What's that?

349
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,386
Holy crap.

350
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,818
You shot a horse.

351
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,125
Gross, its guts are 
spilling out.

352
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,804
I didn't mean to shoot that.

353
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,405
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- We can't leave it like this.

354
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,030
What are we supposed to do,
call a vet?

355
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,600
You gotta put it out
of its misery.

356
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,188
- You shoot it.
- I'm not shooting a horse.

357
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,791
Let's just get out of here.

358
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,258
- They just left it there?
- He didn't suffer long.

359
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,947
Cuz you found the gun
in those bushes?

360
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,224
I did what Chip and Dale couldn't.

361
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:07,808
You ever get your hands 
on another gun?

362
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,972
My parents started to watch me
like a hawk.

363
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:14,449
Then I graduated high school,
got away from guys like Pate.

364
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:17,336
Anger kinda just dissipated.

365
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,850
So how'd Pate come 
into that MAC-10?

366
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,873
Main Line yacht club.

367
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:25,251
Bought it from some guy
named Witherspoon.

368
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,156
At least that's what I heard
him bragging about.

369
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,576
Okay, Eric.

370
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:37,490
Hey, if you see Truly again, 
would you apologize to her for me?

371
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,590
You know, for being 
such a demented kid?

372
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,414
To tell her yourself.

373
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,595
Ain't like she lives in Antarctica.

374
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,219
That MAC-10 was not delivered to any 
gunstore in the greater Philadelphia area.

375
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,375
Yeah, and I got the 
paper cuts to prove it.

376
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,462
So it was stolen.

377
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,417
Got us thinking about who
was delivering those guns for Barkan.

378
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,962
So we checked the employment
rolls at Philly Hall '87.

379
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,701
That's cover who transported the guns?

380
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,103
Interesting name on their
list of drivers.

381
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:08,849
Rodney Johnson.

382
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,430
That 911 caller.

383
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,545
Maybe a target of the drive-by
since he was out on the court that night.

384
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,325
That's some coincidence.

385
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:19,879
Or not. / This guy transported the gun
that almost killed him?

386
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:23,376
Clincher is that guy fighting with
Cedric Browining on that video tape..

387
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,624
Rodney again?

388
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,361
One and the same.

389
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,122
Lot of roads all leading 
one direction.

390
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,832
Right to Rodney Johnson.

391
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:39,200
Talked to your old boss
at Philly Hall, Rodney.

392
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,568
Said you were fired because your cargo 
had a habit of coming in late and light.

393
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,436
Those accusations were
unsubstantial.

394
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:49,295
One of the MAC-10s you were hauling 
turned out to be a murder weapon.

395
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,164
Killed a six year old,
Kayla Odoms.

396
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,985
You remember Kayla.
You called in the 911.

397
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,166
Yeah, I remember.

398
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,299
So who do you figure 
the shooter was that night?

399
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,448
How do I know?

400
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,595
- Because you sold them the gun.
- Me?

401
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,887
You.

402
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,707
Statute of limitations 
on theftery is up, right?

403
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,989
Then I admit.

404
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,748
I moved a lot of guns.

405
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:18,365
So who did you sell one to
that might want to see you dead?

406
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:19,620
Look here,

407
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,593
my aka back then was Big MAC.

408
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:24,669
On account of how many
guns I flipped.

409
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:26,792
- How many?
- Hundreds.

410
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:31,132
And I made it a point 
of not getting to know my clientele.

411
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:34,021
Let's talk about 
Cedric Browing, Rodney.

412
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,955
- What's your fight with him about?
- Excuse?

413
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,936
At the park.
The night of the murder.

414
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,788
You were hassling each other.

415
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,847
That was a personal dispute.

416
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:45,312
He was in my face cuz his woman
was casting them ferrochromes my way.

417
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,376
And you weren't waving them off?

418
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,685
- Maybe it was him.
- Cedric wasn't the shooter.

419
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,741
He was selling peanuts
at Phillies game that night.

420
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:53,992
You get into lot of
domestic disputes, Rodney?

421
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,829
With boyfriends, husbands, maybe?

422
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:58,532
I tried not to mess with
the married ladies.

423
00:21:58,532 --> 00:22:01,606
- Tried?
- I failed on occasion.

424
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:03,925
One in particular.

425
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,176
Guess it don't make
no difference now.

426
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:08,482
- Who?
- Dead girl's mum.

427
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:10,010
Jessie.

428
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,796
Mr Witherspoon?

429
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:42,001
I'm Witherspoon.

430
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,607
Who wants to know?

431
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,368
Philly PD.

432
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:49,197
Philly PD, huh?

433
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:52,103
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

434
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,675
We hear you sold a weapon
to a kid named Pate back in '93.

435
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:59,064
'93, it's possible.

436
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:02,772
I had a small problem with
the grain industry back then.

437
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,149
How's that?

438
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,699
I needed whatever cash
I could muster.

439
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,896
So you sold a MAC-10
to a teenager?

440
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:11,921
My judgement was impaired.

441
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:13,470
So where did you get the MAC?

442
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,002
You ever heard of Chicken Little?

443
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:18,760
Cuz that night, I was Chicken Little.

444
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,130
What night would that be?

445
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,890
The night my better half 
kicked me out of the house.

446
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:26,184
I slept by the river.

447
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:55,977
Bitch!

448
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:06,720
I was sure it was my wife sending me a not-
so-subtle message to blow my brains out.

449
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,130
- When was this?
- August, '87.

450
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,989
I remember because I swore
off the hard stuff right then and there.

451
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,304
The hard stuff, mind you.

452
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:19,155
Not the entire family 
of acoholic beverages.

453
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:22,440
That look at the car you got,
you sure you were seeing it straight?

454
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,881
Yeah.

455
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,892
It was a Plymouth.

456
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:28,415
Volare.
Like the song.

457
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,617
Volare.

458
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,467
Before your time.

459
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,868
Can you remember anything
about the driver?

460
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,976
- Anything at all?
- No.

461
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:41,296
Just the car.

462
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,755
And that it wasn't my wife's.

463
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:46,807
Cuz she was on a oneway
train to Augusta that night.

464
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,715
Last time I ever saw her.

465
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:59,543
Rodney Johnson.

466
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,617
Worst mistake of my life.

467
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:03,966
Who knew?

468
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:06,479
- No one.
- You sure?

469
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,646
If you're thinking about my husband,
don't. Cuz he didn't know.

470
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,520
How can you be so sure?

471
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,299
Because I've been with him
for the last 18 years.

472
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,056
Don't you think he would've
mentioned it by now?

473
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,599
Unless he had a reason not to.

474
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,830
He didn't know.

475
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,410
And you can't tell him.
Promise me.

476
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:24,310
Sorry, Jessie.
I can't do that.

477
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,315
Why?

478
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,037
Why should he suffer now
because I was a fool 18 years ago?

479
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:31,593
Because I was lonely
and selfish.

480
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:34,913
Did you know Rodney had
other women?

481
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,388
I was stupid, not blind.

482
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,158
You saw him with 
someone else.

483
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:42,219
That day,

484
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,989
at Darnell's birthday party.

485
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:49,756
Do you think Mr and Mrs Kissyface
will have babies, Darnell?

486
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,159
No. Gouramis don't mate in captivity.

487
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,736
It's good cake, babe.

488
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:57,556
Yeah.
Thanks, mum.

489
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,742
No problem.

490
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,230
You like the mitt more
than the fish?

491
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,202
Nah. I like them both the same.

492
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:10,548
You all right?

493
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:12,871
Yeah, sure, I'm good.

494
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,756
Well, I got a double shift tonight.

495
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:18,564
You gotta go?

496
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,640
12 years old.

497
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,736
You a man now.

498
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:26,794
Happy birthday, son.

499
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,060
My birthday is coming up too.

500
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,194
Yeah, we know.

501
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:42,170
Mum, dad's leaving.

502
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,784
Don't you wanna say goodbye?

503
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,303
I was such a fool.

504
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:56,341
Thought my heart was 
actually breaking.

505
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,792
Crazy right?

506
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:04,090
Considering what God was about 
to teach me about real heartbreak.

507
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,728
It wasn't chance, was it?

508
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:08,913
You going back 
to that park that night.

509
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:13,202
Now you know why Kayla's 
dying is my fault.

510
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:15,883
Did you go to confront Rodney?

511
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:19,378
More like to kick his 
worthless ass.

512
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,324
But by the time I got there,
he was already playing ball.

513
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:23,782
So you waited.

514
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:26,694
Took Kayla to the swings.

515
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:31,229
Any justice in the world and 
that bullet would've hit me.

516
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,095
Not her.

517
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,671
Scotty.

518
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,310
Come in, it's freezing.

519
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:49,708
Nah, I can't.

520
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,065
Why not?

521
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,170
Chris.

522
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,651
That night,

523
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,185
it was a mistake.

524
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:02,560
- It was?
- Cuz..

525
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,324
- you know.
- No, I don't know.

526
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:09,179
Your sister..

527
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:12,688
It's ill-advised.

528
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:17,311
Scotty, I know what this is.

529
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,974
You're thinking about Elisa.

530
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:25,581
I can't be anything with
anyone right now.

531
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,932
- Sorry.
- Well.

532
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,172
For the record, I'm not.

533
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:35,510
Look, I don't plan on telling Lil.

534
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,707
Me neither.

535
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:40,425
It's better that way.

536
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:47,315
If you change your mind,

537
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:50,230
I'm right here.

538
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,664
Yeah.

539
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:57,284
Okay.

540
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,605
We sure Mike Odoms didn't know about
his wife's affair with Rodney Johnson?

541
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,961
Jessie says no.

542
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,515
Cuz Lil just got a DMV report from '87.

543
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,038
The car that was seen dumping
our MAC-10 off the bridge

544
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,479
was a Plymouth Volare.

545
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,711
And guess who owned 
a Volare back then.

546
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:33,215
Please don't say Mike Odoms.

547
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,472
Maybe he didn't confront Rodney
face to face.

548
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:37,330
Maybe it was at a distance.

549
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,709
So we're saying if Mike
found out about Rodney...

550
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,159
Maybe he set out to get rid of the man 
coming between him and his wife.

551
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,213
And trying to kill Rodney,
he shot his own daughter.

552
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:52,856
My wife is a good woman.
Don't try and tell me otherwise.

553
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,905
We're not saying that, Mike.

554
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:59,419
But we are saying Jessie had an 
affair with Rodney Johnson in '87.

555
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:02,608
And Rodney Johnson was
the target of that drive-by.

556
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:03,911
So what?

557
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,715
You think I tried to kill him?

558
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:08,425
My wife stepped out on me
with a low-life like Rodney..

559
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,843
Think about what you're saying
to me, detectives.

560
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,508
We're saying you had
a motive to shoot Rodney Johnson.

561
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:15,381
The oldest reason in the book.

562
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,004
Revenge.

563
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:19,771
No. You're saying 
I killed my own daughter.

564
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:23,506
I'm not gonna sit here
and take that kind of disrespect.

565
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:25,072
All right, Mike.

566
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,586
How do you explain that your car
was ID'd as the shooter's?

567
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,285
I can't.

568
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,555
I was working.
It don't make no sense.

569
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:33,915
Could someone have borrowed
your car?

570
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,497
I know I didn't let no one use it.

571
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:37,600
And Jessie would've said
if she did.

572
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,104
So who else could've 
taken it?

573
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,640
There wasn't nobody else
home to take it.

574
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:46,404
Except Darnell.

575
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:49,082
Darnell was 12 years old.

576
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:50,740
I knew how to drive
when I was 12.

577
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,729
Well, Darnell didn't.

578
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,573
now, I know that for a fact.

579
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,102
An absolute fact.

580
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:59,257
My boy did not know
how to drive.

581
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,972
You don't recognize him?

582
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:10,023
He's awfully young for
one of my customers.

583
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:13,775
Come off it, Rodney. You'd sell to 
a toddler if they had the cash.

584
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,959
Look again.

585
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:22,058
It's possible I did a business
with a boy looking like this.

586
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:23,104
Possible?

587
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:26,825
Keep in mind, I wasn't selling
at a K-Mart with them fluorescent lights.

588
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,891
Semi or full?

589
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,297
The Big MAC don't inventory semis.

590
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:33,309
Bad boys are selling all converted.

591
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,028
We'll take six.

592
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,482
You're the man, Big MAC.

593
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,306
Been a pleasure 
mercantiling with you.

594
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:56,231
I wanna buy a gun.

595
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:02,362
That's good.

596
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:05,486
Cuz I'm fresh out of 
milk and cookies, young blood.

597
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:08,202
- Have you ever seen Miami Vice?
- Crockett and Tubbs

598
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,777
Those were my boys.

599
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:12,672
Cuz the guns they use 
is the kind I want.

600
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:15,991
Choice of professional 
gangsters everywhere.

601
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:17,918
Converted MAC-10.

602
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:20,406
Fully automatic assault weapon.

603
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,280
Thirty rounds per second.

604
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,210
How much?

605
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,852
For a beginner banger like yourself
out to make his bones,

606
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:30,958
a Benjamin.

607
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,096
That's including the bullets?

608
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,375
One clip.

609
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:37,212
You need more, you come
back and see me.

610
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:46,981
This shit your luch money
or what?

611
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:49,807
Can I have my gun?

612
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:09,621
You bad, now boy?

613
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,326
So who is this boy?

614
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,094
Jessie's son.

615
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,245
Darnell.

616
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,905
Damn.

617
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,216
I didn't know Jessie had a son.

618
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,570
Why would you?

619
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,524
Considering your interest
in the women.

620
00:33:25,524 --> 00:33:28,194
You know, Kayla would be
alive today if it weren't for you.

621
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:29,086
How you figure?

622
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,993
You provided the motive
and the weapon.

623
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,955
And there ain't no 'statue' of
limitations on aiding and abetting.

624
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:37,637
Come on now. / Maybe the DA can 
bump it up to conspiracy to commit murder.

625
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:39,136
Conspiracy.

626
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,571
I didn't pull no triggers.

627
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:44,683
- Don't need to.
- Just gotta give the assist.

628
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:56,015
Mr and Mrs Odoms.

629
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,504
Figured you'd be coming.

630
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,537
And we knew why so we got
something to say.

631
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,827
Well, you don't need 
to say anything.

632
00:34:01,827 --> 00:34:03,534
I fired that gun.

633
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,754
Killed Kayla.

634
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,168
Mr Odoms.

635
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:09,330
It's too late for that.

636
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,922
Went home in my cab.

637
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,621
Got in my car and drove by the park.

638
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,910
- Shot it up.
- It's true.

639
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,276
I saw him.

640
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:22,476
I didn't wanna say anything,
cuz I love the man.

641
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,589
That true, Darnell?

642
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:29,354
You don't gotta 
confess for me, dad.

643
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:32,038
- They know.
- They don't know nothing.

644
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,168
Do you?

645
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:36,102
I wish I didn't.

646
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:39,051
I really do.

647
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,115
We've already lost one child.

648
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:50,823
You can't take away
the only one we got left.

649
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,197
Please.

650
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:54,474
- I'm sorry.
- He was 12.

651
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:57,299
Courts will take that into
consideration.

652
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:01,337
Why'd you do it, Darnell?

653
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,045
To keep them together.

654
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:07,641
How'd you know it was Rodney
coming between them?

655
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:11,402
Heard my mom on the phone.

656
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:14,591
And then at the birthday party,

657
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:16,882
I saw the way she was looking at him.

658
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,293
And I just knew.

659
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:22,620
Then I thought about 
my dad in his cab.

660
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:26,751
Working his ass off.

661
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:29,120
And when my mom told me
she was going

662
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,325
to take Kayla out 
for a walk that night..

663
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:35,402
You knew you could take the car
and no one would know.

664
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,375
If only I would've known
you were going to that park,

665
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,278
I would've never pulled that trigger.

666
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:45,128
I didn't know.

667
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:48,802
I didn't see you,

668
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:51,424
or Kayla.

669
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,012
Till it was too late.

670
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:29,070
You bad now, boy.(?)

671
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:44,329
No!

672
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,148
Kayla!

673
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:47,781
No.

674
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,250
No.

675
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,044
Wake up.

676
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,788
Wake up for mommy.
