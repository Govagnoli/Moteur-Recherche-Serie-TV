okay,this one's from me.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,990
I told you guys,no gifts.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,410
Who ever believes that?

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,920
Come on.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,530

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,260
How can you tell it's a girl,mommy?

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,410

Oh,and I'm supposedto be dieting.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,470
One of the few good perks of being this huge is you can eat like a horse.

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,260

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,480

Oh,my god.

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,080
I'm being deployed?

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,110
But you havea kid.

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,790

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,600

Probably get stationed in oneof saddam's old palace sgrilling filetsfor the generals.

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,690
Right.

32
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,860
Well,here.
I'll slice the tart.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,440

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,360
You're goingaway,mommy?

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,630
I'll be backbefore you know it.

37
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,540
In no time at all.

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,410
That veronicain the car?

39
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,760
We're on our wayto school.

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,160
She's pouting becauseI won't let her come with.

41
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,380
Eight-year-old wantsto see a crime scene?

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,960
She's a weird kid.

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,680
- Hey,boss.
- Morning.

45
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,050
We got a floater?

46
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,010
Not exactly.

47
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,440
Marine unit was doing a trawl of the delaware,turned this up.

48
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,080
Is that an arm?

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Ran the serial number.

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,830
Matches the prostheticof a missing iraq war veteran.

51
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,510
Guy couldn't catch a break,huh?

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,420
Gal.
Dana taylor.

54
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,080
Went missing three months afterreturning from the middle east.

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,610
How long could someonewith a missing arm stay lost?

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,870
You ever see the fugitive?

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,750
These things don't come cheap.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,410
It's a custom fit,titanium.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,000
Not somethingyou'd just toss.

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,090
Not on purpose.

61
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,540
So where'd the rest of her go?

62
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,790
Well,if the armwas in the river,odds are the body is,too.

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,440
Divers are coming out.

64
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,270
Not really a "bringyour daughter to work day."

Yup.

70
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,650
Asgot to wonder.

71
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,700
wonder what?

72
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,220
Remember the girl in iraq,had that guy on a leash?

73
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah.

74
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,550
what's your point?

75
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,780
I just don't get these chicks that want to tote guns and take prisoners fora living,no offense.

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,670

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,420
Joined the guard to payfor cooking school.

79
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,200
Seven and a half years into an eight-year bid.

80
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,630
Yeah.Probably never thoughtshe'd get called up.

81
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,630
Lost her right armin a grenade attackon her truck outside fallujah.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,130
Ribbon of valor for heroism-- pulled anothersoldier out of the wreckage.

83
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,480
When'd she get back?

84
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,730
June 2004.

85
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,820
Disappeared octoberthe same year.

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,780
Last to see wasthe husband,geoff.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,610
Says she went for a walkthat night,never came back.

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,960
Lame story.

89
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,970
Yeah,so lame it could be true.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,090
Though he and dana were goingthrough a rough patch.

91
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,240
So maybe she took a headerinto the river on her own?

92
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,730
Or maybe the husband pulled a scott peterson.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Valens upstairs?

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
Taking lost time.

95
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,920
Didn't say why.

96
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,360

I can't visit my own brotherwithout being abused,hmm

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,160
orange juice was sour.
We had to throw it away.

106
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,980

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,700
A lewd act with a minor.

119
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,430
Da's really gunning for him,and he's got a long listof...

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,430
witnesses.

121
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,340
Are you serious?

122
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,910
you're on the list,mikey.
你在名单上

123
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,300
That-that don't make sense.

124
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,370
- No?
- No.

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,540
But to put this guy away,they're gonna need all the ammo they can get.

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,690
Hey,god bless 'em,but I can't help.

128
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,160
Okay.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,920
- I just told 'emI'd check with you.
- Told who?

131
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,500
The peoplewho got it wrong,I guess.

132
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,650
Dana never tookoff that arm.

133
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,900
She wanted to be as normalas possible.

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,700
Like before.

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,730
Before iraq.

136
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,760
She come homedifferent?

137
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,340
If you had your arm blown off,wouldn't you?

138
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,140
Just asking a question.

139
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Yes.She was different.

140
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,190
When I got back from vietnam,my wife and I had some troubles.Adjusting.

141
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,140
We were working it out.

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,550
Till she walked out the doorthat nightand I became a widower.

143
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,490
She happen to mentionshe was headedtoward the river that night?

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,740
She used to go onlong walks alone.

145
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,390
Never said where she went.

146
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,700
Any problemswith friends,neighbors?

147
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,920
No way.

148
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,290
Fishtown'sa military neighborhood.

149
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,210
Dana went over,did her duty.

150
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,540
People respected that.

151
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,250
I hate to ask,butsuicide?

152
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,470
I thoughtwe were finding our way back.

153
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,420
Maybe dana couldn't make it.

154
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,110
Like you said,she came back different.

155
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,870
And it...

156
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,240
threw me.

157
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,720
*I know you think thatI shouldn't still love you*

158
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,780
You know whatI miss the most?

159
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,010
Your leg?

160
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,580
the chow?

161
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,800
The danger.

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,210
*Well,I'd still have felt it  where's the sense in that?*

163
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,130

164
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,390
- Hey,linds!
- Mommy!

166
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,590
*I promise I'm not tryingto make your life harder*
they couldn'tput your arm back on?

168
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,660
Or return to where we were
no,baby,they couldn'T.

170
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
It's okay.
Give your moma hug.

172
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,590
*Well,I will go downwith this ship*

173
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,770
We're all goingto get used to it.

174
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,350
Yeah,sure.

175
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,920
I don't like it.
It's weird.

177
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,540
Lindsey!

178
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,800
Hey,it's just an arm,okay?

179
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,520

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,010
*Well,I will go downwith this ship...*

200
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,890
I couldn't look at her.

201
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,090
And she knew it.

202
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,690
So,maybe that hurt enough,she put herself in the river.

203
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,140
The person who'd knowbetter than me?

204
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,610
Tommy.

205
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,470
Tommy from the hospital?

206
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,690
Yeah,he wasjust a guywe knew from the neighborhood,

207
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,330
but after whatthey went through,he was her new best friend.

208
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,280
Was he in the rpg attack,too?

209
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,700
He was the one she saved.

210
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,100
If dana had any secrets,it's tommy who'd know 'em.

211
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,140
Yasasme and dana fought in iraq,93 days and nights.

212
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,900
Brings you together,huh?

213
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,080
In a wayyou can't understand.

214
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,250
Her cell phone records showa lot of calls to you,tommy,after you both got back.

215
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,490
Includes the nightshe disappeared.

216
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,960
Uh,it's 'causewe talked every night.

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,090
It's not whatyou think.

218
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,420
We talked about the war,rehab.

219
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
Frank.

220
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,610
Who's frank?

221
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,510
Our friend.

222
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,620
Died in the attack.

223
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,510
That you anddana survived?

224
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,110
What'd youtalk aboutthe nightshe disappeared?

225
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,950
Well,the usual.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,490
Night terrors.
Seeing frank in our dreams.

228
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,270
How the thanksyou get for fightingis people back here lookingat you like you're a freak.

229
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,020
Sounds hardto live with.

230
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,150
No one else gets it,so we'd tell each other.

231
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,190
This is the straw,final straw in the...

232
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,100
I wrote the guard.

233
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah?

234
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,590
Asked them to send meback over.

235
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,690
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

237
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,090
I'm walkinggood as new.

238
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,510
Why not?

239
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,290
- you okay?
- Yeah.

241
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,080
It was just...

242
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,870
oh,dana,they're precious.

243
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,670
It's the best I can doat the moment.

244
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,850
They're sweet.

245
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,110
- Brenda?
- No.

247
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,740
Look at that face.

248
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,500
I see frankevery time I look at her.

249
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,400
Missed you at his memorial.

250
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,140
I heard it was beautiful.

251
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,910
Out on the bridge...

252
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,710
I guess you had somethingbetter to do?

253
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,890
I didn't thinkyou wanted me there.

254
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,870
Oh,you got that right.

255
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,440
So what should ihave done?

256
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,010
Just don't actlike we're friends.

257
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,890
We're not.

258
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,500
And we never will be again.

259
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,550
Brenda,you've had a few...

260
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,550
you blew it off,too,tommy,so you just save it!

261
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,360
It's hard on us,too.

262
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,140
You didn't lose anyone.

263
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,280
We lost frank.

264
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,480
You don't have a babywith no father.

265
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:26,230
I can't standto see you alivewhen he is nothingbut ashesat the bottom of that river.

266
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:35,860
*A simple mistakestarts the hardest time I promiseI'll do anything...*

267
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,780
why was brendalaying this on dana?

268
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,090
Dana was driving the truckwhen...

269
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,630
so she blames herfor her husband dying?

270
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,700
But brenda wasn'tin her right mind.

271
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,290
She was drinking all the time,and half crazyover losing frank.

272
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,870
Crazy enough to kill someone?

273
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,780
what,are you tryingto smoke us out?
A nudge wouldhave worked.

275
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,520
I was tryingto make breakfast.

276
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,320
Oh,maybe I'll takea rain check.

277
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,250
in my family,"cooked" pretty much meantwhatever was spinningunder the heat lampat 7-11,so...

278
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,140
so I guess this is it then.

279
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,890
go ahead,pack your bags and leave.

280
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,200
It's been nice knowing you.

281
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,340
Get the dooron your way out,huh?

282
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,110
Yeah,sure thing.
Adios.

284
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,940
Cut and run.

285
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,680
You wouldn't be the first.

286
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,270
Who left you,lil?

287
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,700
What?

288
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,690
My dad.

289
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,810
I was six.

290
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,840
Yeah.

291
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,750
I always thought he'd come back.

292
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:05,740
My high school graduation,I'm sitting there,looking for min the bleachers.

293
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,820
Did he show?

294
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,130
What do you think?

295
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,430
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,330
Yeah.

297
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,730
Like I said,you wouldn't be the first.

298
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:26,900
Yeah,well,you know,maybe I'll stay,see if I can't be the last.

299
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,340
We appreciate youtaking the time.

300
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,960
You said it was about dana.

301
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,890
Did you find her?

302
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,620
Her arm.

303
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,220
We're thinking the restof her might be dead.

304
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,400
you missed the sensitivitytraining,did ya?

305
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,890
Fourth of july,2004,things got ugly between you two.

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,150
I was reelingover frank's death.

307
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,570
Not for nothing,I wasa few glasses into the chablis.

308
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,010
That can fuel the fire.

309
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,820
I was grieving,not homicidal.

310
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,130
And I was homewith my six-month-oldthe night she went missing.

311
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,820
Well,a six-month-oldcan't alibi you,bren.

312
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,680
How would killing dana help me?

313
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
Wouldn't bring frank back.

314
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,440
Murder ain't logical like that.

315
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,290
Look,I apologized to her.

316
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,510
After the hangover.

317
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,630
Yeah.

318
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,800
Things got back to normalfor us again.

319
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,230
Of course,going"back to normal" not so easy.

320
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,350
No.

321
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,180
Like a lot of guys coming back,it seemed like part of danawas stuck in iraq.

322
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,250
said mr. Dalai lama  another sister'sshooting heroin tomorrow...

323
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,440
how come daddy'snot driving me to gymnastics?

324
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,350
'Cause mommy's home now.

325
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,970
And this was alwaysour thing,right?

326
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,140
Daddy always lets me situp front.

327
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,720
Why don't youbraid lucy's hair,huh?

328
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,560
So I stopped drinking.

329
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
Yeah?

330
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,330
After the wayI talked to you...

331
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,680
oh,come on.

332
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,070
It was understandable.

333
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,880
I'm goingto grief counseling,to talk about frank...

334
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,840
- missing him.
- Sure.

336
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,890
You thought about it?

337
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,590
Counseling?

338
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,850
Me?
For what?

340
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,890
Geoff says you nevereven talkedabout the attack.

341
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,460
No.

342
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,140
I'd like to knowwhat happened.

343
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,590
We were driving.

344
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,090
Like we are now.

345
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,140
Orders are you keep moving;you never stop.

346
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,010
What was frank doing?

347
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,700
He was looking out.

348
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,280
You always have to look out'cause the one thingout of placecan be the thing that...

349
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,820
"the thing that" what?

350
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,100
********* what are you doing *********

351
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,190
Mommy,don't!

352
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,490
********* kill me? *********

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,470
*****,stop!

354
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,130
********* ******freak.

355
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,420
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,810
I keep *************

357
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,330
it's okay,sweetie.

358
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,120
She's always doing that,making people mad.

359
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,470
From happy homemakerto road rage case.

360
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,570
That's quite a flip.

361
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,270
Combat vet,classic ptsd.

362
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,760
I realized that day thatthe dana I knew was gone.

363
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,150
T1I wonder who elseshe went off on.

364
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,100
Sounds like this daughtercould tell some tales.

365
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you know where my mom went?

366
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,940
We're tryingto find T.

367
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,840
That's why we're here.

368
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,450
Do you rememberwhen she came backfrom the war,lindsey?

369
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,290
Yeah,she didn'thave an arm.

370
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,870
We heard she'd getupset sometimes,make people mad.

371
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,630
Yeah.

372
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,880
Do you rememberany of those people?

373
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,940
No.

374
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,210
You won't get in troubleif you tell us.

375
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,500
Maybe one man.

376
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,830
Okay.

377
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,160
At my school assembly.

378
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,390
He sat behind my mom.

379
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,090
In this time of unrest,we honor our own war heroes,

380
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,230
who put themselves in harm's wayto keep you safe.

381
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,990
There are currently...

382
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,870
what's with you?

383
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,580
My petition to go backwas rejected.

384
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,790
I got medically discharged.

385
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,110
It was a long shot.

386
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,260
It was also my last shot.

387
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,290
- At what?
- I just...

389
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,990
got nothing,no one.

390
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,620
Here.

391
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,420
Hold this for me.

392
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,100
And her daughter is inmiss connor's third grade class.

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,010
Please welcomelindsey taylor's momcorporal dana taylor.

394
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,290
I was in iraq for three months.

395
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,700
I drove a supply truck.

396
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,980
I was scared going over,but was ready to do my duty.

397
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,320
Then,this happened to me.

398
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,000
Now I...

399
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,850
I have confused feelingsabout the war.

400
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,200
So instead of giving youa speech,maybe I'll justtake some questions.

401
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,650
Did you ever waste anyone?

402
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,630
No.

403
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,390
But I watched my good friendget wasted.

404
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,610
His name was frank.

405
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,290
One second,he was telling a joke,and in the next,his...

406
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,660
his blood and his insideswere all over the truck...

407
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,630
all over me.

408
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,440
It's not like a video gameor a movie.

409
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,790
It breaks your heartright in half.

410
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,500
Our next guest has beenin the navy his entire career.

411
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,230
What kind of soldier are you?

412
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,070
The kind that tells the truth.

413
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,170
I'm going backfor my second tour in a week.

414
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,650
How do you thinkmy kid feels now?

415
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,000
Maybe we shouldgo,linds...

416
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,790
You should have stayedin the damn kitchen.

417
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,920
You know that?

418
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,100
You got no businesstrying to do a man's job.

419
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,680
I'm a soldier,same as you...

420
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,140
His son charlie is inmr. Levin's fifth grade class.

421
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,890
Someone oughtto teach you a lesson.

422
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,800
So please welcomelieutenant jamal ross.

423
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,950
who was this man?

424
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,690
Penny kozlowski's dad.

425
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,570
That helps alot,lindsey.

426
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,100
Maybe my mom went away'cause of me.

427
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Why would she do that?

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,700
'Cause maybe she found outI thought her arm was scary.

429
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,460
You know what,lindsey?

430
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,810
If you were my girl,I'd be so proud.

431
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,070
You would?

432
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,350
Yeah,becauseyou're brave.

433
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,560
I know your mom could see thatjust like I can.

434
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,200
Thanks a lot,sir.

435
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,160
Sounds like this kozlowskididn't like girlsfighting his war.

436
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,820
What say we find outhow much?

437
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,500
Josh kozlowski?

438
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,030
Who's asking?

439
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,730
Philly homicide.

440
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,020
It's about dana taylor.

441
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,450
Homicide,huh?

442
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,810
Not surprised,the mouth on her.

443
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,400
We heard you werea real fanof her speechat your daughter's assembly.

444
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,680
Gi janes.

445
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,590
Some jobs women just can't do.

446
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,700
Not disagreeing,but why go after dana?

447
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,110
'Cause that bitch traumatizedevery kid in the place.

448
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,850
So maybe you retaliated.

449
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,680
Agg assault does seemto be your specialty.

450
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,860
That taylor broadneeded to be shut up.

451
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,050
And if I was the one who did it,I'd tell you.

452
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,870
All the same,we got to verifyyour whereaboutswhen she disappeared.

453
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,200
I keep great calendars.

454
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,400
You tell me the date,I'll tell you where I was.

455
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,620
Deal.

456
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,920
They sayyou're onlysupposed to cutto the first five-leaf.

457
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,110
Is that right?

458
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,000
My grandma wasa green thumb.

459
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,610
Always said that's how you getdouble the bloom in return.

460
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,020
That's a good tip.

461
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,350
Got any tips for me?

462
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,220
You know yourhusband's temperall too well,I bet.

463
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,640
Got anything to add?

464
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,520
- I knew that woman. - Dana.

465
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,890
Well,I knew of her.

466
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,760
- Meaning? - I knew her husband.

467
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,700
paula,who's your friend?

468
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,770
This is geoff.

469
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,670
His wife dana's a soldier.

470
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,500
- Hi,jeff.Hi,jeff. - Hi.

471
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,510
Welcome to oursupport group.

472
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,890
Tell 'em about her.

473
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,190
Dana-- well,she's been my girlsince we were 15.

474
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,770
We got a kid.

475
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,400
Thank god 'cause that's allI have to hang onto right now.

476
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,550
I mean,I'm not even allowedto know where dana is.

477
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,280
Just that she'S...

478
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,840
over theresomeplace.

479
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,600
I worry all the time and...

480
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,880
I...I guess,just feel kind of lost.

481
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,030
Why don't we takea coffee break?

482
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,550
*Time and time again I'm half stalled*

483
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,120
helps to talk,right?

484
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,860
- Feel like a fool. - Why?

485
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,720
'Cause I'm a man,paula.

486
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,630
Sitting aroundexpressing feelings...

487
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,200
I know you're a man.

488
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:13,960
*Just give a second thought what if we don't get caught.*

489
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,900
So geoff had a side dish.

490
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,330
A lot of people have jodys.

491
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,240
Jodys?

492
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,500
Someone to keep company withtill your soldier comes home.

493
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Meaning it wasn'tserious between them?

494
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,660
Except paula's husbandkept re-upping,so she was alone a lot.

495
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,720
My opinion,she wanted something realwith geoff.

496
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,190
So his wife coming homewas a problem.

497
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,390
And when paula wants something,she's pretty determined.

498
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,250
Your husband'soverseas,paula?

499
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,600
Ass-deep in the sunni triangle.

500
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,650
Not exactly a garden spot.

501
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Desert air mustappeal to him. He keeps re-enlisting.

502
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
lonely nights?

503
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,770
I keep busy.

504
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,490
Like with geoff taylor?

505
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,850
Me and geoffmight've had a thing.

506
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,010
A thing.

507
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,240
Like an affair?

508
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,610
No,we'd get togetherand do crosswords.

509
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,720
And dana,being your friend,didn't count for much.

510
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,110
Wartime. Rules change.

511
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:32,210
So you and geoff are hitting it,then dana comes home,and he startsflying right.

512
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,620
You're out in the cold.

513
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,130
You know the old sayingabout the woman scorned.

514
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,110
Except I wasn'T.

515
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,170
The affair kept going?

516
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,160
Geoff was patient.

517
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,350
But a month aftershe came home,dana still wouldn'tlet him touch her.

518
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,560
So pretty soon,he's back in your arms.

519
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,540
And then it all blew up.

520
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,850
Button up already. Got to get out of here.

521
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,000
My house tomorrow?

522
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,920
what are wedoing,paula?

523
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,410
Living.

524
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,800
Yeah.

525
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,260
We could make it permanent.

526
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,420
Sometimes I think...

527
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,930
what,baby?

528
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,380
I get dark thoughts.

529
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,560
About changing my life.

530
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,790
no.

531
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,560
I-I thoughtyou were at rehab.

532
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,630
Lindsey's school called. She has a fever.

533
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,240
Look,dane...

534
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,460
so I've been busting my asstrying to learnhow to brush my teeth again,

535
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,000
and this is what you're doing?

536
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,690
- I'm sorry. - Yeah,me,too.

537
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,560
But,hey,let me make it right.

538
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,180
I'll pack up and get lost. Leave you to it.

539
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,790
- That's not gonna happen.
- And I'll take lindsey with me,

540
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,370
'cause there's no way I'm letting this bitchset an examplefor my little girl.

541
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,230
Dana...

542
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,970
I can't believeyou threw it all away.

543
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,530
You probably thinkI'm some bimbo home-wrecker.

544
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,990
Pretty much.

545
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,700
He was lonely. So was I.

546
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,500
And then danacleared the way for you.

547
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,620
Once she busted us,it was over.

548
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,630
Over for her,too.

549
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,480
She disappeared that night,leaving geofkind of single.

550
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,990
Like I said,that wasthe end of him and me.

551
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,080
But no worries,I've got a new jody now.

552
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,540
Congratulations.

553
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,130
You can go,paula.

554
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,140
Didn't geoff say his little girlwas all he had to hang onto?

555
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,340
Yeah.If dana was gonna leaveand take the kid...

556
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,470
maybe those dark thoughtsgot the best of him.

557
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,370
didn't tell us about your girlfriend,jeff.

558
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,940
excuse me?

559
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,720
***** Paula.

560
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
Sounds likeyou found out anyway.

561
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,520
Didn't want to sharethat piece of the puzzle?

562
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,140
Would you?

563
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,040
If a murder copwas asking,yeah,I'd come clean.

564
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,820
Ashamed enough of something,you do a lot to hide it.

565
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,220
Not to mention it gives youmotive for offing your wife.

566
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,390
I didn't kill dana.

567
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,510
I loved her.

568
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,740
You lovedyour daughter,too,and dana wantedto take her away.

569
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,380
Look...

570
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,310
whatever punishment I had comingmy way,I was gonna take it.

571
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,540
But something good actuallycame out of all that crap.

572
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,380
Oh,yeah? What?

573
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,620
We finally talked about it.

574
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,590
About...?

575
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,380
What happened over there.

576
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,550
How's she doing?

577
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,940
Fever's down.

578
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,330
Helps her sleep.

579
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,240
She always loved this.

580
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,970
Still does.

581
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,310
You're going,huh?

582
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,290
What happened,dane?

583
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,570
I don't know.

584
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,780
It's like I lost you over there.

585
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,050
I'm sorry.

586
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,560
Look,I'll goif that'swhat you want.

587
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,910
But first...

588
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,920
tell me...

589
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,060
what happenedover there,when you got hurt.

590
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,690
- You don't want to know.
- Yeah,I do.

591
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,510
You'll hate me.

592
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,290
I could never hate you.

593
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,170
that ribbon of valor--I don't deserve it.

594
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,390
Why not?

595
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,450
What happened to frankwas my fault.

596
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,710
how's that possible?

597
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,440
We'd just madea delivery.

598
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,710
We weredriving back...

599
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,780
frank was tellinga stupid joke,and then suddenly,there was something in the road.

600
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,590
- Someone. - Who?

601
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,830
a little girl.

602
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,520
And they tell you,you see anyone in the road,you...

603
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,890
you just run 'em down.

604
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,710
Even a kid?

605
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,520
They use kidsto get the convoys to stop.

606
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,380
but I didn't see a trap;I saw a little girl,who could'vebeen lindsey.

607
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,530
So I slowed down,and that's when we got hit.

608
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,610
Dane. Dane.

609
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,380
Typical girl soldier,right?

610
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,980
That wasn't a girl thing.

611
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,200
It-it was a human thing.

612
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,660
I would've done the same.

613
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,030
Baby,an rpgkilled frank,not you.

614
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,300
I don't want that ribbon.

615
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,870
It's keeping me in a placeI don't wanna be.

616
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,940
- So get rid of it. - And frank.

617
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,830
We gotta say good-bye to him.

618
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,820
Okay.

619
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,070
Can you stay with lindsfor a couple hours?

620
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,730
Sure. Of course.

621
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,580
I'll be right here.

622
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,690
Yeah. Good.

623
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,200
Dane?

624
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,260
You're my girl.

625
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,450
I was praying she'd come homeand want to start over.

626
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,830
But she nevermade it back.

627
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,260
You didn't go with her?

628
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,180
No.

629
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,870
So what did she mean by "we"?

630
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,200
I don't know.

631
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,510
I always assumedshe went on her walks alone.

632
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,260
tommy.

633
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,050
He didn't go tofrank's memorial either.

634
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,830
And he hadthe ribbon of valor.

635
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,530
So where would they goto say good-bye?

636
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,150
Ashes were in the river,right?

637
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
We know why dana wentout that night,tommy.

638
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,580
Oh,yeah?

639
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,360
To ditch that ribbon of valor.

640
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,690
Put the war behind her.

641
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,130
Any thoughts how shemight've done that?

642
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,310
Not really.

643
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,190
Want my guess?

644
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,620
She threw itin the river.

645
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,590
Where danaended up,too. Probably.

646
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,060
Why are you telling me?

647
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,700
'Cause she called youthat night.

648
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,950
Asked you to meet her.

649
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,800
Bring the ribbon.

650
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,150
She knew you both neededto lay frank to rest.

651
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,920
So what if that's true?

652
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,130
Seems like somethingyou'd mention,unless something wentreal wrong that night.

653
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,100
What I don't get?

654
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Dana saved you.

655
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Pulled you from that truck.

656
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,600
Why would youwant to hurt her?

657
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,530
I wouldn'T.

658
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,240
That is the last thing I'd want.

659
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,120
Well,I believe you,tommy,'cause I think you wanted moreof her than you could have.

660
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,990
What do you mean?

661
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,990
Iraq. Rehab.

662
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,570
All those late-night callswhen you got home.

663
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,600
Brings you together in a wayother people can't understand.

664
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,420
Hard not to get attachedto someone after all that.

665
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,190
But she was married.

666
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,040
Geoff was messing around on her.

667
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,110
She told me that night.

668
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,440
And you saw your opening.

669
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,270
seemed likeshe felt the same.

670
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,280
When we'd talk,you know?

671
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,670
I got her...

672
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,920
and she got me.

673
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,330
And no one else did.

674
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,230
I thought it was gonna bethe start of a new life.

675
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,630
Instead it was the end.

676
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,610
what are you doing?****** of danger again?

677
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,770
river looks beautiful from up here.

678
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,520
Yeah.

679
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,260
did you bring it?

680
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,930
what are you going to do with it?

681
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,170
Move on.

682
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,440
This is about what was.

683
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,280
Memories,right?

684
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,710
I guess.

685
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
It's time to leave 'em behind.

686
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,880
Rest in peace,frankie.

687
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,110
New chapter,huh?

688
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
Right.

689
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,190
So how about you and me?

690
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,020
You and me?

691
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,420
There's a reasonwe talk every night,dane.

692
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,900
Why we never wanna hang up.

693
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,920
Tommy...

694
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,830
we went through a lot.

695
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,730
And now it's part of our lives.

696
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,690
- I have a family. I can'T...
- he cheated on you.

697
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,030
I know.

698
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,590
And maybe we'll neverrecover from that,but we're gonna try.

699
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,680
When I'm standing right here?

700
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,440
Tommy,we almostdied together.

701
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,390
Of course thatbrought us close.

702
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,730
I got nothin' else,dane.

703
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,010
You got me.

704
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,870
- As your friend. - No.That's not enough.

705
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,130
We're vets. That's special.

706
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,130
Oh,bull. That's nothing.

707
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,890
I can'T... hold on to that.

708
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,920
We're findingour way back,tommy.

709
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,310
And we're gonna make it.

710
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
You will.

711
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,570
Not me.

712
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,940
Not me!

713
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,860
No...!

714
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,130
Dana! No!

715
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,780
Dana,no!

716
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,560
Dana!
