1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,800
Patriot pride!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,700
Patriot pride!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Patriot pride!

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Patriot pride! Come on.
Pump those legs. Patriot!

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
All right, back in formation!

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
There's no way we're not going
to make the varsity squad.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,300
We've worked so hard.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,500
You know how awesome
that would be,

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,400
hanging out with
the senior girls?

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
Going to senior parties?

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,800
Cheering in front of real people
instead of our bedroom mirrors.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
Rainey, I just
want you to know

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
that if you make it
and I don't...

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,300
Shh! That's not
gonna happen.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,300
But if it does,
I won't be mad.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,400
Celeste, shut up.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,000
We're both gonna
make it, okay?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,100
Be-Fri.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
What's up, St-End?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay. Rainey.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,300
Let's see your
varsity cheer.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,900
Ready?! Okay!

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
We is the key!

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
To take victory!

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,600
We is the key!

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
To take victory!

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, stop.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,400
Rainey, um,
what are you forgetting?

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,300
Um...

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
You're never fully
dressed without a...

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,500
Smile. Right.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,900
Sorry, I was just, uh...
concentrating.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,300
Well, don't.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,400
'Cause it makes you look like
you have a giant bloomer wedgie.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
Gather round, girls.
It's your moment in the sun.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,200
All right.

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Your new varsity members are...

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,600
Celeste Church
and Rainey Karlsen.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Thank you, everyone,
for trying out.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,300
Whoo!

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@FadeOut
Sync:FRM@LePetitPrince</font>

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
Victim's mom found graffiti
on some art.

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,800
Not graffiti,
it's part of the art.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Exhibit where visitors
write down secrets,

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
put them up on a wall.

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,800
People pay money for that?

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, it's art.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,300
If I can make it,
it ain't.

50
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you the detectives?

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, Detectives Rush, Valens.
You must be Ms. Karlsen.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes.
Rainey's mom.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
You found something
related to your
daughter's death.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,000
They said she took an overdose
of drugs accidentally.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,500
High levels of GHB and
alcohol in her system.

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Rainey didn't do
those things.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,600
It's hard to always know
what a teenager's up to.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,100
I know my daughter.
She was a good girl.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Not a follower.

60
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
Well, according
to the autopsy...

61
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,600
I know what the autopsy says,
Detective.

62
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,300
Someone murdered her.

63
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,500
And that proves it.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
"I killed Rainey Karlsen."

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,600
Could be some
kind of prank.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,400
Scotty...

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,900
that drawing.

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,600
What is it?

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Same thing they found
on her body.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,900
They never released that
to the public.

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,400
So whoever wrote that note...

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,500
Killed my daughter.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cold Case 420

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,000
 <i>Rainey Karlsen.</i>

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Junior
at Birmingham High School.

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,900
Just made the varsity
cheerleading squad,

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
popular, pretty,

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,600
lots of friends.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Who'd want to kill
someone like that?

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
I would.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,400
High school.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I loved high school.

83
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,900
Really?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,300
I was a big hockey star.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,300
You?

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
First round at state.

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,700
Scored the winning goal, MVP.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,100
Couldn't keep the girls off me.

89
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Who were you in high school,
Lil?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Definitely not
the cheerleader.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Bad girl no one'd mess with?

92
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,100
You could say that.

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,200
You, too, Miller?

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Look at you the wrong way,
get popped in the mouth?

95
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
Who says you still won't?

96
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,800
Same drawing on Rainey's body
showed up on this

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,100
from the museum.

98
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,900
We track it?

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
No luck.

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Latents checked
for prints and surveillance
footage was a wash.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
Drug panel found
high levels of GHB

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,600
in her system
mixed with alcohol.

103
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,400
GHB, the date-rape drug?

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah, but in small doses,
kids use it recreationally.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,900
Street name: Liquid X.

106
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,200
Levels were off the chart.

107
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,700
Maybe she was partying,
miscalculated the dosage.

108
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,000
Or she was drugged.

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
No evidence
of sexual assault.

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,300
So, why use it?

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Maybe the assault
got interrupted.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
She was out partying.
None of her friends saw it.

113
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Missed the afterschool
pep rally.

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Never to be seen again.

115
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Till she turns up dead
on the 50-yard line.

116
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Not likely to have booze
and drugs in your system

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,700
and be partying alone.

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Her best friend was

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Celeste Church.

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,000
If anyone knew who Rainey
was partying with that night, 

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,400
homegirl would.

122
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
I had no idea who Rainey
was with the night she died.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,600
I thought you were
best friends.

124
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,000
Had been since sixth grade,

125
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,100
the year Rainey's dad died

126
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,500
and my parents dragged me
through their nasty divorce.

127
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,500
Sounds like you had
a lot to talk about.

128
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,100
We were each other's shelter
from the storm.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
To be honest, I...

130
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

131
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Special girl?

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
A kind of girl who had no idea
how special she was.

133
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,600
Rainey bloomed junior year.

134
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,500
That what changed
your friendship?

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
High school pecking order?

136
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
No, making
the cheerleading squad did.

137
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,800
But you both made it in, right?

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Yeah, but our squad captain, 

139
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Becca Abrams,

140
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
was the gatekeeper
to all the parties

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,500
and she chose favorites.

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
I take it you
weren't one of them.
Right.

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,900
But Rainey was.

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey, Be-Fri...

145
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
think we can
sit with them?

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
It'll totally rock
if we can.

147
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, get over here.

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,100
So, I'm like, "Mom,
that's totally unfair.

149
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,900
Why can't a I have
a Beemer and a boob job?"

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
My parents just like
to deny me things.

151
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,400
Your mom would actually
let you get a boob job?

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Well, long as I asked her
in cocktail hour.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Anyhoo...

154
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,000
Celeste...

155
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,500
now that we're friends,

156
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,600
we have a secret
to let you in on.

157
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,600
Oh, cool.

158
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
In junior high,
we had a nickname for you.

159
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The Black Hole.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
'Cause you ate everything
in sight.

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,100
Isn't that so stupid?

162
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,900
I never heard anyone
call you that.

163
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
You know, I finally lost
all my baby fat.

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
I wear a size 6
at The Gap now.

165
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Ugh, I'm so pissed at them.

166
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,000
They totally resized
all their clothes to make
fat people feel good.

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Celeste isn't fat.
We both wear a size 6.

168
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,100
I mean, just 'cause
everyone else in America
weighs 5,000 pounds,

169
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,700
don't punish me.
Totally.

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Rainey...

171
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,900
you got to try this
new lip gloss.

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
It's got viper venom in it
to make your lips puffy.

173
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Puffy lips are good?

174
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
What's this about puffy lips?

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
Oh, my God, shut up, Casey.

176
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Saw you girls at tryouts.

177
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Looking hottie bo-bottie.

178
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Thanks.

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Rainey, there's
a huge kegger
this weekend.

180
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,200
You've got to come.

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,300
Um, okay.

182
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,400
Friday or Saturday?

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Um, I can't remember.

184
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Rainey, we'll let you know.

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,800
All right.
Rainey's gonna
party with us.

186
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,100
Welcome to the big leagues.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,700
On the outside,
I was this popular cheerleader,

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,300
but on the inside I was still
a fat sixth grader.

189
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
Rainey and Becca
became fast friends?

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Well, Becca had no choice.

191
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Rainey was a major threat
to her boyfriend.

192
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Yeah, but if Becca
saw Rainey as a threat,
why'd she pal up to her?

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,700
It's like when Madonna wore
that "I Heart Britney" T-shirt

194
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,800
or when Britney started
hanging out with Paris Hilton.

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,900
A ploy for a fading star
to control a rising star.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Becca wanted
to control Rainey.

197
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
"Frenemies," exactly.

198
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
And rain or shine,

199
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Becca was determined
to keep her man.

200
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,400
Determined enough
to kill Rainey?

201
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,300
The cheerleading squad
was a shark tank.

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Everyone out for blood.

203
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Sounds like Becca
was the Great White.

204
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
You think someone killed Rainey?

205
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
That's so sad.

206
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
She was such
a sweetheart.

207
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Don't you think we should maybe
actually send her the centerpiece?

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We understand
you saw Rainey as a rival.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Your boyfriend had
the hots for her.

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Please.

211
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Rainey was pretty,

212
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,500
but she was seriously clueless
when it came to guys.

213
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,200
So why invite her to party
with you?

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,500
She was a cheerleader...
Birmingham's elite.

215
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,300
It was all part
of the benefits package.

216
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,500
Doesn't mean you didn't dose
her beer at one of your keggers.

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Look, you can imagine
how bad it looked for me
when she turned up dead.

218
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Why's that?

219
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,500
Someone in our squad
ODs on drugs?

220
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,300
Not cool.

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Right.

222
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
You have any idea

223
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
who might have wanted
to hurt Rainey?

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Totally.

225
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,300
The people who always want
to hurt the good-looking
popular people...

226
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,100
sad weirdoes of the world.

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay, you are riding
your skateboard...

228
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,500
He's so hot.

229
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,500
hit a rock and go flying,
but your skateboard stops.

230
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, but isn't
he kind of old?

231
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,000
What, according to Newton's
First Law of Motion

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,900
is the rock?

233
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,200
Yes, Casey?

234
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,300
My ass?

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,900
That's a good guess,

236
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,400
but I think I'm looking
for a different answer.

237
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,000
What's up, nerd?

238
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
Rainey, did you have
a guess?

239
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,900
Um, just stretching.

240
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,800
Okay...

241
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,500
other guesses?

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,800
Uh, hello?

243
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,100
You look stupid
if you look smart.

244
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,800
Shouldn't it look smart
if you look smart?

245
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Listen, if you want to commit
social suicide
by being a big ol' loser,

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
you can go ahead
and turn in your pom-poms.

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
No, I mean, I'm sure
I would have gotten it wrong

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
or whatever.

249
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,200
Okay.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
BOY:
You're pathetic.

251
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,400
Excuse me?

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
They say men keep women down?

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,400
But you tear each other apart,
especially you cheerleaders.

254
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,900
You don't know me.
I don't need to.
You're a cardboard cutout.

255
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm an individual.
Really?

256
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,300
Nice outfit and lip goo.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,500
It's called lip gloss, freak.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Someone should
do the female race a favor

259
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
and eradicate you idiots.

260
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
And since you're spending
your life just stretching,

261
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
I'd start
with your worthless ass.

262
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Losers are so pathetic.

263
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,400
Spend all their time
projecting their ugliness
onto other people.

264
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,500
It's sad, really.

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
So you think this Joe character
killed Rainey

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
'cause he was a loser?

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,900
You've got to do better
than that, Becca.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,700
A few months after Rainey died,

269
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,600
Joe was expelled from school.

270
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,400
For what?

271
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,700
For making drugs
in the chem lab.

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
Drugs? What kind?

273
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
Rumor was...

274
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
????

275
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
VALENS:
Heard you were cooking up
some X back in the day.

276
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Of course that was the rumor.

277
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,700
Rumor?

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
You were expelled for drug use.

279
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,100
Not liquid X.

280
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
I got caught
smoking pot on the bleachers
for the fifth time.

281
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,000
Wasn't a rumor
that you threatened Rainey.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Told her you'd eradicate
her worthless ass.

283
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,000
Look, I was an outcast
in high school...

284
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,100
by toting around my <i>Zen and the</i>
 <i>Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,</i>

285
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,000
thinking I could change
the world by provoking dialogue.

286
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,700
That explains
that away.

287
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,300
Well, maybe you
took out some of that

288
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,400
adolescent angst
on the popular girl.

289
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
I was wrong about Rainey, okay?

290
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,500
You didn't think
she was cardboard cutout?

291
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
I thought
she was better than those bunch
of morons she hung with.

292
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Morons like Becca?

293
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
And Casey.

294
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
You think he had something
to do with it?

295
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Guy'd stop at nothing
to get in her pants.

296
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,300
You shouldn't assume
I'm an idiot

297
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,200
because I'm a cheerleader.

298
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,300
You're right.

299
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,000
Pigtails and short skirts
usually equal genius.

300
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,700
An unbalanced force.

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,800
What?

302
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,000
That's the answer.

303
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,900
An object at rest
has to stay at rest

304
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,700
and an object in motion

305
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
tends to stay
in motion

306
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
unless acted upon
by an unbalanced force.

307
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,500
Newton's First Law of Motion.

308
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,400
If you're not an idiot,
why act like one?

309
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
You wouldn't understand.

310
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Wouldn't understand a little
thing called "peer pressure"?

311
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Offer me drugs.

312
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,000
What?
Just do it.

313
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,100
You want drugs?

314
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,900
No!

315
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,100
And that's how you deal
with peer pressure.

316
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,500
It's just...
it's like they belong,

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
you know, with their cool
uniforms and their pom-poms.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Everyone knows
who they are,

319
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,800
wants to be
their friend.

320
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Maybe it's stupid and shallow
to want that.

321
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
No, sounds like
what we all want.

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
Rainey, you better
be on that kegger
on Saturday.

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
Casey, what are you doing?

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,300
What about Becca?

326
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
That old jock mattress?

327
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,500
Get your hands
off of her, you tool.

328
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Who the hell are you?

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Guess I'm no one.

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,700
You saying Casey drugged Rainey?

331
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
It is his style.

332
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,700
Meaning?

333
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
You'll never guess who was
brought up on date rape charges

334
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
his sophomore year at college.

335
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Mr. Big Man on Campus himself.

336
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,200
Those date rape charges
were dropped.

337
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
You're not supposed
to ask me about that.

338
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
We'll ask whatever
we damn want, Casey.

339
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,500
You got a real problem
with keeping that thing
in your pants, huh?

340
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,100
What kind of questions is that?

341
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
Well, we know you had the hots
for Rainey Carlson.

342
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,000
So? She was tight.

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,300
Where were you
the night Rainey died?

344
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,100
My parents were
out of town.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
I threw a kegger. There were,
like, a hundred people there.

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
We're gonna need those names.

347
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Fine.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
The point is
you pursued Rainey.

349
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,900
Wanted to get
your rocks off.

350
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm not saying
I wouldn't hit that.

351
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,100
Sure, I tried.

352
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,200
She told you to get lost.

353
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,500
Wasn't me she told to step off.

354
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Shh.

355
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,400
BECCA:
All right, juniors.

356
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Congratulations
on your first game.

357
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
You were awesome.
Thanks, Becca.

358
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm so excited.
Now...

359
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,000
We have a little tradition.

360
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
We all did it after
our first varsity game.

361
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,600
Now it's your turn.

362
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,500
To do what?

363
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Kiss.

364
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,300
Each other.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
But there aren't
any guys around.

366
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,400
Isn't that kind of lame?

367
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,400
Excuse me?

368
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,400
Lame? It's a frickin' tradition.

369
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,900
I don't want to, Becca.

370
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,700
Really?

371
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Well, you do what I say.

372
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I say "kiss," you better kiss.

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Let's just do it.
It'll be stupid.

374
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
That's exactly the point.

375
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Come on! That
ain't no kiss!

376
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Let's see some tongue action!

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
(chanting):
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!

378
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!
Tongue! Tongue!

379
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,700
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!

380
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,500
Hey, hey, where do you
think you're going?

381
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
You didn't roll
the dice yet.

382
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
What? Let go of me.

383
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
???

384
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Oh!

385
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,300
Coach Pruitt?

386
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
You're an adult.

387
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,500
You're supposed to protect us!

388
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
No, look, Rainey,
this is all in good fun here,
okay?

389
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,400
I wonder if Principal Palmer
thinks it's in good fun.

390
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
You threatening me?

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,200
I doubt she'd want a perv
like you teaching us.

392
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,400
You are way out
of bounds, young lady.
You know what I'm saying?

393
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
It was just a little hazing.

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Rainey couldn't deal.

395
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,100
Coach Pruitt was in
the girls' locker room?

396
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
Sure, he let us in the gym.

397
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,200
Bought us beer
from time to time.

398
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Totally cool guy.

399
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
And Rainey threatened
to rat him out?

400
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
She was uptight.

401
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,300
Girls I'm with need
to know how to party.

402
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,000
If she went to
the principal,

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
it would have meant
Pruitt's job,
his future.

404
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,700
So maybe he shut her up
before she had the chance.

405
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,800
??????

406
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
You must be Lamont's parents.

407
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
He's a great kid.
I just wanted to discuss
his homework environment.

408
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,600
Detectives Miller,

409
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,300
Jeffries. Homicide.

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,200
We're investigating
the murder of Rainey Karlsen.

411
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Rainey, that was, uh...

412
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Ten years ago.

413
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,000
My first year of teaching.

414
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Understand she caught you
playing peekaboo

415
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
in the girls' locker room.

416
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Threatened to tell
the principal and
ruin your career.

417
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
Well...

418
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
fortunately, she
never reported me.

419
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
That <i>is</i> fortunate--
for you.

420
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
She did, however,
teach me a valuable lesson.

421
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,100
And that was?

422
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,900
It was time
for me to grow up,

423
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,100
stop trying to be friends
with my students.

424
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
And that's relevant
to her murder...

425
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,600
how?

426
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,200
It happened the day
of the pep rally.

427
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,700
The one Rainey missed.
Yeah.

428
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,900
Morning after, they...

429
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,400
found her body.

430
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,000
So what happened?

431
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Rainey blew her top.

432
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,600
She wasn't gonna take it
anymore.

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
We all know that
force is a vector.

434
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
You can see here
that that's represented
by these arrows.

435
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,400
If a table didn't push back
with the equal force gravity
exerts on the book,

436
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
it would go
right through the table.

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Quit your sniveling.

438
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,900
Last year I rolled a 12.

439
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,500
GIRL:
That's why books don't go
right through tables.

440
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,900
Pretty weird, if you ask me.

441
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,400
Um, that was good,
Doreen.

442
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,100
Go ahead and sit down.

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Becca, you're next.

444
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,000
Friction.

445
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,900
It's a real downer.

446
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,100
How do you fix it?

447
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Lubrication.

448
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Ooh!

449
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
???

450
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
What?

451
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
How was that
a real presentation?

452
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,700
She doesn't even have a
poster board. Why is that okay?

453
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I mean, it'd be great
if she were a playmate
and this were the Playboy Mansion,

454
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
but this is supposed to be
a physics class.

455
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,600
I know I'd <i>rather</i> be
at the Playboy Mansion.

456
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,400
We're supposed to actually
be learning things.

457
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,200
All right, Rainey,

458
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,600
you've made your point.

459
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Why should I
listen to you?

460
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,500
'Cause you're the teacher?

461
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,800
You're a joke.

462
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll give you detention,
young lady.

463
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,900
No way.

464
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm not afraid of you.

465
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
You tell him,
Rainey.
Joe,

466
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,700
drawing on your desk,
that's vandalism-- detention.

467
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Don't turn this on him
just so you can feel

468
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,700
in charge while you let your
buddies do whatever they want.

469
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,500
You're pushing it.

470
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,500
Joe is the only real person
in here!

471
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
Rainey...
The rest of you are just...

472
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,300
pod people!

473
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm out of here!

474
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,800
Someone needs to take
a chill pill... bo-kay?

475
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,900
Bo-kay that!

476
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Rainey called me out.

477
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,900
And she was right.

478
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,300
Joe went after Rainey?

479
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,700
He find her?

480
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
I don't know.
I never saw her again.

481
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Funny how Joe forgot
to mention any of this.

482
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,900
You said... Joe did a lot
of drawing on his desk.

483
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Yeah.

484
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Kid fancied himself
a angst-ridden Picasso.

485
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
You still have that desk?

486
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,700
Is this a public school?

487
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Uh, it's, uh,

488
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,300
one of these over here.

489
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,400
Look familiar?

490
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,700
Recognize this?

491
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
Yeah, it looks like
my handiwork.

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,100
What about this?

493
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,500
You were with Rainey
the night she died.

494
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,500
You wrote your secret
in the museum; you killed her.

495
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah.

496
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
I wrote it. It was me.

497
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,800
Are you admitting to the
murder of Rainey Karlsen?

498
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Yes.

499
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,600
Just like that.

500
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,600
You did it?

501
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,500
Yeah.

502
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
You want to tell us why, Joe?

503
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
People kill people all the time
for no reason.

504
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
But Rainey
stood up for you.

505
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,400
Told Coach Pruitt
to s

506
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,300
You didn't drug Rainey
with GHB, did you?

507
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,100
No.

508
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Then why admit to it?

509
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
It's our ten-year reunion.

510
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
No one thinks about her...

511
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
cares about her.

512
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
No one but you.

513
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,100
It's my fault she died.

514
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm the unbalanced force.

515
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,100
If it weren't for me,

516
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
she'd be alive today.

517
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Hey.

518
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,500
Been looking
for you everywhere.

519
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,400
And the one place
you're not is the pep rally.

520
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,900
Yeah.

521
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm not going.

522
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Does that mean
you're quitting?

523
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm already in trouble
with Becca.

524
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,600
If I quit,
she'd turn everyone against me.

525
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
I'd go through
the rest of high school

526
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
being...

527
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,400
A nobody?

528
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,300
Yeah.

529
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,400
(laughs):
Wha... What are you doing?

530
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,900
It's an atom.

531
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,500
Or the universe.

532
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,100
Or high school.

533
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,000
So that's what
it looks like.

534
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,800
You don't want to be
these orbiting dots,

535
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,600
because then you
get all tangled up

536
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,200
in... the beginnings
and endings of things,

537
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
and you bump into other dots.

538
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,300
What do you want to be?

539
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,700
The center.

540
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Grounded...

541
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,100
and observant.

542
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,300
Still.

543
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,500
And....

544
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,800
um...

545
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,600
when bodies fall out
of the gravitational pull

546
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,500
of a larger body,

547
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,200
that's when they become
their own center.

548
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,200
I like that.

549
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I draw it a lot.

550
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,700
To remind myself.

551
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,400
Does it work?

552
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah.

553
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,400
I mean,sometimes.

554
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,200
It can be lonely.

555
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,100
Can two centers be friends?

556
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,800
I'd like to think so.

557
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,500
I'm gonna quit
the cheerleading squad.

558
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
You're better than them, Rainey.

559
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,700
I'm gonna go to tell Becca
right now.

560
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,300
Before I lose
my courage.

561
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,100
Hey, Rainey,

562
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,300
remember, it's just
high school.

563
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,100
Yeah.

564
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,300
It's just high school.

565
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I was wrong.

566
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
It wasn't just high school.

567
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,500
Same night Rainey died,

568
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,500
she told Becca
to shove it.

569
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,200
And you never told the cops?

570
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
I was the bad druggie kid,

571
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,300
voted most likely to serve time.

572
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,100
If you said you were with
Rainey the night she died,

573
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,200
you'd be the scapegoat.

574
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
No one would've believed
it was Becca.

575
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
She was the Queen Bee.

576
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I'll handle this.

577
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
This is a special night for me.

578
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,700
It's my ten-year reunion.

579
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Can't your stupid investigation
wait until tomorrow?

580
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,300
Tough to say good-bye
to the glory days, huh, Becca?

581
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
What's that
supposed to mean?

582
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Your life peaked
at the high school prom.

583
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
Everything
since then...

584
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
it's been all downhill.

585
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I happen to be perfectly happy.

586
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Is that why you can't hold down
a job?

587
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,200
Why at 28, you've had two
failed marriages?

588
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,200
Going on three?

589
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,700
Little fish
in a big pond.

590
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
That's why
this night means so much.

591
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,900
You get to be Great White Becca
again.

592
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I don't have to listen to this.

593
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,200
The old Becca would
have never run away.

594
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,900
You ruled this school.
When you said "Jump,"
they said, "How high?"

595
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
Being popular was
a full-time job, 24/7.

596
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,900
Then Rainey comes along.

597
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Tells you to take your pom-poms
and shove 'em.Excuse me?

598
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
I rescued that toe-bag
from Loserville.

599
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
I don't think so.
No?

600
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
She was going to quit the squad.

601
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Show the world
what a loser you were.

602
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,000
News flash: I am not a loser.

603
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,200
I showed that bitch
who was boss.

604
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,800
You know, Rainey not
showing up for the pep rally

605
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
really screwed our formation.

606
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,200
Our totem pyramid
was lopsided without her.

607
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,500
She's totally
out of line.

608
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
So what are you
gonna do about her?

609
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,500
You know what I need
from you bitches?

610
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,800
More complaining.

611
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
I'll deal with her,
all right?

612
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
But for right now...

613
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I have a surprise for you.

614
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
We're gonna party hardy
tonight, bo-kay?

615
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,100
All you need is one
drop. Seriously.

616
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,600
What is it?

617
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,000
Liquid X. 

618
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
It'll make you feel
like ten times
as drunk.

619
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
And that's good news
for you, Celeste.

620
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Fewer calories.

621
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,100
Well, look who
decides to show.

622
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Thanks for ruining
formation, Rainey.

623
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,800
You rock. And P.S.:

624
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,100
that stunt you pulled
in class? Not cool.

625
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm quitting.

626
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,500
What?

627
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
No, you're not. Nobody quits.

628
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Well, I am.
Rainey, no.
You can't.

629
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,600
Celeste,
it's okay.
You can quit, too.

630
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
But I don't want to.
Get a grip, Celeste.

631
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,500
No one's quitting.

632
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,900
Do you know how lucky you are
to be on this squad?

633
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,000
How many girls would die
to shake your pom-poms?

634
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,800
Let them.

635
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I don't want it

636
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,900
if it means the
prize is being you.

637
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,900
Being me?

638
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,400
You're the meanest,
most manipulative, most...

639
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,700
vapid person I
have ever known.

640
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Every girl wants to be you

641
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,300
because every guy in school
wants to bang you.

642
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,300
Good luck holding onto that
for the next 40 years

643
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,500
because that's all you have.

644
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,300
I want something more.

645
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,700
Don't move a muscle, bitch.

646
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,800
Grab her!

647
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,000
Right now!

648
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,800
You know, Rainey,
you skipped out on hazing.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,600
I think it's time
you had your fair share.

650
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,500
Get off me!

651
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,700
Give me a drink.
Get off me!

652
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Now, Celeste!

653
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,500
Come here!

654
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
What's wrong with her?

655
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
She only had one beer!

656
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,000
We're out of here, Celeste.

657
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,700
She's your friend.
You clean this mess up.

658
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,400
I taught that twit
who was boss: me.

659
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
You left Rainey on the field
with Celeste?

660
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah.

661
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,000
Those two losers
deserved each other.

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,500
And Celeste handed
you the drink?

663
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
You sure about that, Becca?

664
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Look, I-I don't know
what Thunder Thighs did.

665
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Okay? And frankly,
I don't care.

666
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,400
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
a full evening to attend to.

667
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,000
Don't move a muscle... bitch.

668
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,700
Surprised to find
you here, Celeste.

669
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Everything looks so small.

670
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,200
Back then, it all
seemed so important.

671
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,800
Making peace
with the past?

672
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
That why
you came back?

673
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,100
Make peace
with Rainey?

674
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Crap.

675
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,500
I was almost happy.

676
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,200
You were never
happy back then.

677
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
That why you drugged
your own beer?

678
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
I just wanted to fit in.

679
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,900
Be popular.

680
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,600
To be liked.
Instead, they used you.

681
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Humiliated you.

682
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,100
Rainey didn't. She
stood up for you.

683
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,900
She was your best friend.

684
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,100
Rainey left me

685
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,900
in that locker room...

686
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,800
alone.

687
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,000
What happened?

688
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,900
In that locker room.

689
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
I just want to forget it.

690
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,100
Please.

691
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,700
Rolling the dice...

692
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
wasn't just kissing,

693
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,300
Celeste,
was it?

694
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,600
Rainey found out.

695
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,600
she was gonna destroy the squad.

696
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,500
You couldn't let her do that.

697
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
I'd given up everything
to be a cheerleader.

698
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,300
I paid too high a price.

699
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,500
Come on. You have
to get help, Rainey.

700
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
We have to get help.

701
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,900
Wow. I'm really sick.

702
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,700
That was my beer and it had
a whole bottle of X in it.

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,700
We need to go now.

704
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,000
What? Why would you
drug your own beer?

705
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,400
I just wanted to check out
for a little bit.

706
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Check out?

707
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,800
You mean like... kill yourself?

708
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800
No.

709
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,700
Forget it, Rainey.

710
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,100
Just forget it.

711
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,300
Real friends don't do
the things they do.

712
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,700
Let's walk away, Celeste.

713
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,700
Walk away?

714
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,100
Like what you did to me
in the locker room?

715
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm so sorry.

716
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,500
I heard you had
to kiss ten guys.

717
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,900
It wasn't kissing, Rainey.

718
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,100
When I tell my mom...
No, you can't tell.

719
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,200
It's gonna be over.

720
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,900
Over?

721
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,900
There'll be no
more squad anymore.

722
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,600
But without a squad,
what will I do?

723
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Anything you want.

724
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You're funny.

725
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,900
You're smart.

726
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
But the squad's all I've got.

727
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,100
I'm popular now.

728
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,100
And people like me.

729
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
And I'm finally...

730
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,700
somebody.

731
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,100
You always were
somebody, Celeste.

732
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,300
To me.

733
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
I can't give it up now.

734
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,800
After all I've been through.

735
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
All I've done.

736
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,700
It's all I have, Rainey.

737
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,300
I feel really sick.

738
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,200
Maybe you should
call an ambulance.

739
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,300
I'm gonna tell my mom
what they did.

740
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
I already called
an ambulance, Rainey.

741
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,700
You did?

742
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Yeah.

743
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,300
They're coming any minute now.

744
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,400
Don't you worry.

745
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Thanks, Be-Fri.

746
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
You're my
best friend.

747
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,700
I think
I hear sirens.

748
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Me too, St-End.

749
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,300
Joe's right.

750
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
You can see it all
from the center.

751
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm gonna go to sleep now, okay?

752
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Okay.

753
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,100
("High and Dry"
by Radiohead playing)

754
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
* Two jumps in a week *

755
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,300
* I bet you think
that's pretty clever *

756
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,900
* Don't you, boy? *

757
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,200
* Flying on your motorcycle *

758
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,500
* Watching all the ground
beneath you drop *

759
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,100
* You'd kill yourself
for recognition *

760
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,800
* Kill yourself
to never, ever stop *

761
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,500
* You broke another mirror *

762
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,000
* You're turning
into something you are not *

763
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,700
* Don't leave me high *

764
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,700
* Don't leave me dry *

765
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,300
* Drying up in conversation *

766
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,100
* You will be the one
who cannot talk *

767
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,400
* All your insides
fall to pieces *

768
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,800
* You just sit there wishing
you could still make love *

769
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
* They're the ones
who'll hate you *

770
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,300
* When you think
you've got the world *

771
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,500
* All sussed out *

772
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,200
???

773
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,300
* You will be the one
screaming out *

774
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,800
* Don't leave me high *

775
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,100
* Don't leave me dry *

776
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,300
* Don't leave me high *

777
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,800
* Don't leave me dry *

778
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,700
* Don't leave me high *

779
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,500
* Don't leave me high *

780
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,400
* Don't leave me dry. *
