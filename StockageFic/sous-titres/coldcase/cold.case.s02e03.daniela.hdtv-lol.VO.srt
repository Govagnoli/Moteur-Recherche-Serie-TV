Help a girl get home, papi?

4
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:35,912
See my bag got stolen and I need
some bread to get on the bus.

5
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,773
You got some change to
spare for a bus ticket?

6
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:40,085
You know, get myself home?

7
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,746
Man, you gotta be jiving me.

8
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,380
Go on, get out of 
the way, baby girl!

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,127
Let Marquette do her thing!

10
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,558
You better split!

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,469
- He get you bad, baby girl?
- Mellow out, Marquette.

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,355
- I'm cool.
- Oh, no, you ain't.

13
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,859
Don't get in close till
they slide you the bread.

14
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,783
Give them half a chance, cats'll
cop the merchandise for free.

15
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,706
This merchandise ain't for sale.

16
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:04,932
Well, it might make life
easier if it was.

17
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:07,259
Who you saving yourself for, huh?

18
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,139
Shining knight on a white horse?

19
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,711
Maybe I am.

20
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,618
Take me far away from here.

21
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:13,817
And go where?

22
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:15,568
Anywhere I want.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,096
Mamacita!

24
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,113
Hey, mamacita!

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,415
Looks like your knight's
calling, baby girl.

26
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:28,708
Help a girl out, papi?

27
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:32,034
See, my ma's real sick
and I gotta get home.

28
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:34,723
I just need some bread
to get on the bus.

29
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:22,059
You buy, Scotty?

30
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,134
I'll buy, even though it's your turn.

31
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:30,945
- You're detectives, correct?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:34,233
Where do I go if I know something?

33
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,330
About what?

34
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,129
My husband.
Low-rent son of a bitch.

35
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,066
I just told him to pack his bags
and get out of my house.

36
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,957
I'm filing for divorce.

37
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,775
Because he hit you?

38
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,981
He visits prostitutes.

39
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:50,259
He's has a fixation
with that type of thing.

40
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,926
We can't arrest your husband 
for that, ma'am.

41
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:56,362
I can't believe 
I married that pervert.

42
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,419
We can arrest him for assault.

43
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,117
If you're willing to press charges.

44
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,091
I told you why I'm here.

45
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:06,714
And I told you what we can do
and what we can't.

46
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:11,393
Maybe this will change your mind.

47
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:14,312
I found it in that 
bastard's belongings.

48
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:17,468
Daniella. She one of the 
prostitutes he frequented?

49
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:20,736
No. She's the girl he murdered.

50
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,177
Ex-wife on the warpath.

51

makes a hell of a snitch.

Never found a body.

77

Yeah, but with all the skull
and brain matter in there,

78
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,728

Get the date on that film?

81
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,966
AV confirmed the year is 1979
off a piece of film leader.

82
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,409
Waiting on what month.

83
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,365
You remember this Jane doe
from '79, boss?

Garbage bag full of rose petals, sure.

Job went cold day one.
No id, no body, nothing.

She earn those bruises, John?

94
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,863

It was a game.

98
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:20,320
Ask the girl yourself.

99
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:24,187
Can't. She's dead.

That's your problem, John?

Those charges were dropped.

We scored a joint, then we drove

Finally, we ended up at her place.

141

She was alive when we left.

143
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,883

she wasn't a whore,

149
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,723

out of the car to score,

150
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,664

Hey, man, let go of her.

178
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,880
Do it!

179
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,328
Get off of me.

180
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:58,887
Don't touch me!

181
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:02,037
You whore! 
You stinking cesspool!

182
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:03,717
Be cool, man! Be cool, man!

183
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,070
Keep filming or I'll
blow her head off!

184
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,554
Okay, man. Just don't 
do anything stupid.

185
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,818
I'm on film, right?
You got me on camera, right?

186
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,628
Right. I got you.

187
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,018
You're gonna die.

188
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:15,452
Oh, you're gonna die!

189
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,249
Please don't hurt me.

190
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,033
Tao tao mao, mamasan!

191
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,939
Tao tao mao! / John!

192
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:23,705
John!

193
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,523
What, don't you get it?

194
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:37,990
Come on, man.

195
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,143
The best movie ever made!

196
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,343
Tao tao mao!
Tao tao mao!

197
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,091
You're crazy, man.

198
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,953
Okay hint.

199
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:49,068
Russian roulette in the rice paddies.

200
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,745
Get out of here!

201
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,882
Get out of here! Get out!

202
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,476
- She can fight.
- Get out of my place!

203
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,396
- Okay.
- You're a jerk, man.

204
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,649
Come on. Come on!

205
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,506
Get out of here!
Go! Get out of here!

206
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,333
Let's go.

207
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,908
We went home, and that was it.

208
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,715
I never saw that girl again.

209
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,856
What about John?

210
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:23,334
Kind of stopped 
hanging out with him.

211
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:25,680
Beginning of the end of
the friendship, you might say.

212
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,438
He said he got some play 
from Daniella that night.

213
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,255
Yeah. But John always 
said a lot of things.

214
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:34,665
That girl was just a scared kid.
she wasn't a pro.

215
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:38,093
You think John might've gone
back, finished what he started?

216
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,037
Ever go back there yourself, Chris?

217
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:42,398
For what?

218
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:43,778
She's a pretty girl.

219
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,287
Maybe you couldn't 
leave that alone.

220
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,583
Think I might've blown my
chances that night, don't you?

221
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,161
Stanley kubrick dug up
the rest of his film.

222
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,992
- Had the negative in his basement.
- Brought it in an hour ago.

223
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:01,329
AV transferred it to video.

224
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,594
So this pick's up right after the psycho
boy supposedly shot Daniella.

225
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:14,285
Like they said, 
she was alive when they left.

226
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,158
The film was a fake.

227
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:20,573
Vera tracked down the lab records.
It was processed in march 1979.

228
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,520
And Jane doe's trash bag
turned up in May.

229
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,598
Two months after 
the film was made.

230
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:26,547
So maybe these 
boys aren't the doers.

231
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,112
Well, Jeffries and Vera found 
Daniella's apartment a half hour ago.

232
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,532
They got CSU with them.

233
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,845
Oh, it could be 
a wild-goose chase, Scotty.

234
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,754
The connect to 
Jane doe is looking thin.

235
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,971
Want me to give them
the heads up, boss?

236
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,559
Yeah.

237
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,079
Hey, Jeffries.

238
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,847
Looks like this job
might've died on us.

239
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,734
That's not all that died.

240
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,445
We just luminoled the scene.

241
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:48,901
It's a bloodbath.

242
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:04,875
Last known resident in that basement 
was a Daniella, no last name.

243
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,677
Landlord said she 
disappeared May 1979.

244
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:09,868
Same time Jane doe's
belongings were found.

245
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:13,663
DNA from the blood in the floorboards
matches the blood in the trash bag.

246
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,905
- So Daniella's our Jane doe.
- Yeah.

247
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,450
Keeps our two filmmakers in the mix.

248
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,537
How about this landlord for the doer?

249
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,361
Guy volunteered 
his prints and blood.

250
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:25,225
- We'll run them for a match.
- Any shell casings at the scene?

251
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:28,128
Nah, doer was real careful.
Waed the blood off the walls pretty good.

252
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:31,898
I want to drill this landlord,
find out where Daniella came from.

253
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,086
Nowhere.
Same place she disappeared to.

254
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,112
She didn't grow up in the bus depot.

255
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:39,008
Check prostitution arrests
around the depot in '79,

256
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,254
find someone who knew her,
maybe they know her story.

257
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,479
You got it, boss.

258
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,259
Place was never 
no more than storage.

259
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:52,384
I turned it back after Daniella left.

260
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:59,561
You said Daniella disappeared
some time in mid May?

261
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,437
You recall the exact date?

262
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,824
One day she's here 
and next day gone.

263
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:06,860
Took most of her stuff so 
I figured she'd run off again.

264
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,692
- She was a runaway?
- Hung at the old bus depot.

265
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:11,477
That's the kinda tenant
I had in those days.

266
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,835
- Know where she came from?
- Nope.

267
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:16,544
Hear any gunshots coming 
from her apartment ever?

268
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,113
Round here, 
gunshots are like sunrise,

269
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:21,528
an everyday sort of thing.

270
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,530
Ever see these kids hanging around?

271
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,657
Daniella already had a man.

272
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:32,787
- What do you mean?
- Some crazy latin who shacked up here.

273
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:36,819
Always yelling at her like she'd 
downed the last taco or something.

274
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,827
You ever get a look at him?

275
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,579
Heard him, though, loud and clear.

276
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,662
Every weekend, like clockwork.

277
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,773
You got someone staying in there,

278
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,148
- you owe more rent.
- Nobody's staying.

279
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:03,076
Just heard chico going off.

280
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,508
I'm barely getting by.
I can't pay more rent.

281
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:07,531
Well, then he ain't staying here.

282
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,564
He'll be out.

283
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:11,281
By tomorrow.

284
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:22,696
What was this boyfriend's name?

285
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:25,214
Edwin... Eduardo.

286
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:28,979
I seen Daniella bring in mail 
for him from time to time.

287
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:31,313
She end up giving him the boot?

288
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:34,129
No. Heard him back here
the very next weekend.

289
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,499
You ever try for a piece
of her latin ass?

290
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,895
Make up for that rent
she couldn't pay?

291
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,451
You can't blame me for trying.

292
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,146
She was something.

293
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,949
Yeah. A desperate kid.

294
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:50,288
I wasn't gonna do nothing to her ain't 
already been done a million times before.

295
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:56,170
He's a real Romeo, that one.

296
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,613
Looks like magazine pictures
taped up on the wall.

297
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,449
Wonder who put them up?

298
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,158
Romeo sure didn't.

299
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:07,043
Daniella?

300
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:10,514
No windows in this place.
Gotta look at something.

301
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,254
Maybe these were her windows.

302
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,252
I was lucky.
Got out while I still had my teeth.

303
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:30,651
Now I'm helping other working girls
do the same, one soul at a time.

304
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,397
According to arrest records,
you worked the bus depot back in '79.

305
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:37,317
Did you know a girl named Daniella?

306
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,189
Daniella?

307
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,637
- Yeah.
- Have any idea where she came from?

308
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:43,446
Not from here.

309
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,319
Daniella was...

310
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,225
She was a shining star.

311
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:50,770
- Didn't belong on the streets?
- Nobody belongs there, baby.

312
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,118
She's dead, isn't she?

313
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,965
We think she was murdered in '79.

314
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:01,504
I told myself she got out
when she stopped coming around.

315
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,483
Always said she would.

316
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,373
Funny how things work.

317
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:12,374
So what else can an old whore do 
for you fine-looking gentlemen?

318
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:15,189
You ever see these
two around the depot?

319
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:20,690
Looks like every other white boy trolling
around for colored tail back then.

320
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,053
Daniella never gave none of that up.

321
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:24,617
So she wasn't hooking at all?

322
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:27,392
Uh-uh, baby. No way.

323
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,657
♪ Anita Ward 의 'Ring My Bell' ♪

324
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,966
Get some bread for this ring,

325
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:38,107
get that jive turkey
landlord off my back.

326
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,236
- Who's that?
- You high again, Marquette?

327
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,727
I told you about him.

328
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,003
Not him. Him...

329
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:46,239
Edwin castillo.

330
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,483
Nobody.

331
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:50,985
He, your man?

332
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,685
Oh, you can tell
Marquette, baby girl.

333
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,023
Some cat from a long time ago.

334
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:00,004
From home?

335
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,500
He follow you here?

336
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,179
He follows me everywhere.

337
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,755
He gonna be mad 
you selling his ring?

338
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,315
He ain't the real thing.

339
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,521
Know what you mean, baby girl.

340
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,626
Guess old Edwin 
didn't scratch her itch.

341
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,077
Did you ever meet him? 
This Edwin?

342
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:32,476
Daniella was real secretive-like
with them guys in her life.

343
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,702
What guys?

344
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:38,189
This one and, and that other one
always picking her up from the depot.

345
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,506
Red camaro kid, what I called him.

346
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:43,409
Never saw his face,
just that fine-looking ride.

347
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,179
I thought you said
she wasn't hooking.

348
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,029
Well, hooking ain't what
that was about, baby.

349
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,995
Shoulda seen Daniella's face
when he'd drive up.

350
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:55,225
Looked like she was falling in love
for the first time, every time.

351
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,099
Daniella had a live-in 
boyfriend, latino guy,

352
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,940
and this camaro kid on the side.

353
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,610
So we're thinking a love
triangle got her killed?

354
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,317
One theory.

355
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,163
You ran boyfriend's name
through autotrack?

356
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,187
No hits.

357
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:10,404
Edwin castillo,
Edward, Eduardo...

358
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,965
guy ain't in the state of PA.

359
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,103
Maybe loverboy got rid of him, too.

360
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,894
Hey. What do you got?

361
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,682
1979 camaro registrations,

362
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:22,122
and you'll never guess 
who owned one.

363
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,453
Meet the camaro kid.

364
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,355
Me and her had a thing.

365
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,563
So what?

366
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:36,762
A thing?

367
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,695
We hear Daniella was head over heels.

368
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:41,050
One-way-street kind of thing?

369
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,299
I was a kid. So shoot me.

370
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,156
You lie to us once, makes 
me think you'll do it again.

371
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:50,025
It isn't the kind of thing
that you tell the world.

372
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,400
We ain't the world.

373
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,323
We're homicide.

374
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,091
After that night, I went back,

375
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,054
to say I was sorry.

What?

381
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,679
It's on your wall.

382
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:28,317
And the Eiffel tower, and the 
leaning tower, what you call it?

383

384
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,374
Yeah, that.

385
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm gonna see those places one day.

Yeah, well... good for you.

387
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:39,058
So are you.

388
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,126
That's why you put 
them up on your wall.

389
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,361
So what?

390
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,240
I'm sorry about last night.

391
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:55,801
Okay.

392
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:04,527
New York's only a few hours 
away so if you're not busy...

393
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:07,558
maybe... sometime...

394
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,560
I mean, only if you want to.

395
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,079
We can...

396
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,719
go see the Eiffel tower or something.

397
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,649
You mean the Empire state building.

398
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,740
Yeah, that.

399
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,662
Okay.

400
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,695
Okay.

401
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,214
And that's how it started.

402
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:32,146
How long did you see her for?

403
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,047
Two weeks and then it was over.

404
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:35,321
My pops would have killed me

405
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,963
if he found out I was 
dating a Puerto rican girl.

406
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,601
Class act, your pops.

407
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,716
You don't know my pops.

408
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,403
I was a wonder bread kid
from the suburbs.

409
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:46,794
It never could have worked.

410
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:49,355
Ever meet Daniella's boyfriend,
the guy she lived with?

411
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:51,588
She never told me about a guy.

412
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:55,156
You ever take her to see
the Empire state building?

413
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,040
Yeah.

414
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:59,380
It seemed like her home
had bad memories for her.

415
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,077
Daniella was from New York?

416
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,979
Across the river. Jersey city.

417
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:05,113
Why'd home have 
bad memories for her?

418
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,752
I never asked.

419
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:18,848
No missing persons report in Jersey
matching Daniella's description.

420
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:21,312
How about the boyfriend?
You autotrack him in Jersey?

421
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,749
- Looking.
- My bets are on him for the doer.

422
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:27,622
Goes from yelling to a more
direct kind of communication.

423
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,810
My bet's on lover boy Chris.

424
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,309
Because he lied?

425
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,291
Because what gets you in the end

426
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,096
is what you love.

427
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,408
Maybe.

428
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,995
Found the boyfriend.
Edwin castillo.

429
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:42,473
1202 fifth street, Jersey city.

430
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,224
New jersey.

431
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,144
Si?

432
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,956
Detective Rush, 
Philadelphia homicide.

433
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:04,613
It's about Edwin castillo.

434
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,292
My baby's dead?

435
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,828
That's not why we're here.

436
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:12,527
- Then where is he?
- That's what we wanted to ask you.

437
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:17,707
I haven't seen Edwin in 25 years.

438
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:23,323
He ran real wild as a boy.
We fought.

439
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,327
But I always thought
he'd come home one day.

440
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,798
Well, we need to 
find him, Ms. Castillo.

441
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,242
Why?

442
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,926
We think he was 
involved with this girl.

443
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,698
Do you recognize her?

444
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:45,313
Ms. Castillo, you know this girl?

445
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,670
Girl?

446
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,209
That's my son.

447
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:51,330
That's Edwin.

448
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:05,678
So she was a he?

449
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,154
Right.

450
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,046
That's impossible.
Look at her.

451
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,311
You mean him.

452
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:13,133
Makes motive that 
much stronger for Chris.

453
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,534
Fall in love with a girl
and finding out she's a guy.

454
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,172
Or his pal John.

455
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,296
He got a piece of that, too.

456
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:21,931
Oh, I want to be there
for that interview.

457
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:25,454
Love, Daniela.

458
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:27,751
Even as a kid, he was
signing his name as a girl.

459
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:29,280
Mom give you these?

460
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,656
She and Edwin would fight day and night
about him wearing make-up, jewelry.

461
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,749
He ran away after one
too many screaming matches.

462
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,580
The fights continued over the phone.

463
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,946
- The arguing the landlord heard.
- Yep.

464
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:43,775
Yeah, mom always figured
Daniela would, uh, grow out of it.

465
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,534
You mean Edwin.

466
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,066
Whatever.

467
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:51,146
Will, you remember Jay lambert,
the firearms instructor at the academy?

468
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:53,833
Oh, goes by Jillian now.

469
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,083
What, the perm?

470
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,656
The perm was a man?

471
00:24:57,656 --> 00:25:00,118
- Yes, sir.
- Your kind of girl, Vera.

472
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,035
She's better looking.

473
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:13,101
See me.

474
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:18,090
We got to talk more 
about Daniela, John.

475
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,337
And what you got off of her.

476
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,257
She was a talented girl.

477
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,749
Except she was a guy.

478
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:26,909
- And I'm the queen of England.
- Well, your highness.

479
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:32,012
Meet Edwin.

That isn't possible.

Kind of explains her talent 
on your joystick, huh?

484
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:46,108
So...

485
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,784
Cassie was right.

Did Chris know?

515
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:29,441
Go ask him your own damn self.

516

And for the record...

517
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:34,298
I made that up about,

I never touched that.

You can't have it both ways, John.

521
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:53,501
Lie twice.

Three time's the charm.

523
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,146
I didn't lie.

524
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,709
You weren't with 
Daniela for two weeks.

525
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:02,136
It was a lot longer than that.

526
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,976
And then you found out the truth.

527
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,553
- I didn't kill her.
- You mean him.

528
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:13,612
Your friend Cassie was figuring it out.

- The corsage.
- She made you.

Unless you went back.

665
00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:42,477
All she wanted was for 
the world to see her as a girl.

666
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,020
- Like you did.
- Until your pops found out.

667
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,725
And then you were ashamed of her

668
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,770
and hid her things so no one 
would know what she was,

669
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,890
and tossed her away
like a piece of trash.

670
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,029
