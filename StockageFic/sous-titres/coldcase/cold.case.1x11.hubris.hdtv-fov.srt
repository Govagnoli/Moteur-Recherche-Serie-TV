May 11, 1995

3
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,238
Detective Rush, cold jobs.

4
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:04,417
Uh, Roy Minard,

5
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,868
uh, Fallen from Grace.

6
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,460
Is that right?

7
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,414
Yes.

8
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:13,411
You're looking at a 
ruined man, I'm afraid.

9
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:15,491
Wanna sit down?

10
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:16,339
Thank you.

11
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,131
I was a, uh...

12
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,116
I was a professor at the University,

13
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,254
enjoying a quiet life 
of arts and sciences

14
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:29,557
when I became embroiled 
in a murder case.

15
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:33,277
My unfortunate role was as 
the number one suspect.

16
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,762
Who had the unfortunate 
role of victim?

17
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:36,538
Uh...

18
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,802
Holly Richardson.

19
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:41,318
Here.

20
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,669
She was one of my students.

21
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,927
Very promising young mind.

22
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,001
Killed on Campus?

23
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,420
Nine years ago.

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,678
Whipped and strangled 
with a car antenna.

25
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:51,824
Awful.

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,867
Well, there must have been a 
reason you were investigated.

27
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,264
And one reason only.

28
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:57,748
Holly and I were having an affair.

29
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:58,420
Ah.

30
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,953
Which I lied about at the time.

31
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,328
Why?

32
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,075
Why does a philanderer lie?

33
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,761
I was married.

34
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:10,605
Ashamed of my behavior.

35
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,792
Covering your tracks.

36
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,663
And my dishonesty on that matter

37
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:16,960
was seen as guilty in this 
far more serious charge.

38
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,366
The press went to town.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,511
My wife and child left town...

40
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,862
and I was soon relieved of 
my professorship

41
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,562
and banned from campus.

42
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,793
Well, you're here talking to me,

43
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,162
so clearly you weren't 
convicted of anything.

44
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:32,309
Not in a court of law.

45
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:33,880
And you're innocent, of course.

46
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,280
You've heard of Richard Jewell?

47
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:37,923
Yeah.

48
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,613
He and I would have a lot to talk about.

49
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,528
So why come in today, Roy?

50
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:44,072
Uh, I found this

51
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,996
in the newspaper.

52
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,139
A prostitute in Norristown

53
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,915
was killed and dumped in 
the Schuylkill two weeks ago.

54
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:51,823
Same as Holly.

55
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,609
A lot of bodies are 
dumped in the river.

56
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,634
Yes, but this one was also killed

57
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:57,939
with a car antenna.

58
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,759
I saw that and I, uh,

59
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,986
I thought maybe I've 
found my one-armed man.

60
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,544
Now you're Richard Kimble.

61
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:08,979
If there is a connection,

62
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,140
maybe you can solve two murders.

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,491
And save my life in the process.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/01/11

73
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,827
"Holly Richardson, 21.

74
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,673
Killed in West Philly, May '95.

75
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,297
14 lashes with an antenna

76
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:55,930
before he strangled her with it."

77
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,374
Little humiliation 
before the grand finale.

78
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,698
Dumped in the Schuylkill.

79
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,913
Doer was probably trying 
to wash away evidence.

80
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,547
They found semen.

81
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,576
Professor Minard's?

82
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:05,333
Yup.

83
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,595
So they did it the 
night of the murder.

84
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,211
Outside of that, what do we got?

85
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:10,550
He and Holy were at 
the same party at the...

86
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,893
Elizabethan Club.

87
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,692
Some people saw them having words.

88
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:14,627
"Words."

89
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,440
I love how them Ivy Leaguers talk.

90
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,738
They had a fight, okay, Dummy?

91
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:21,359
So that's the whole case?

92
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,138
That's about it.

93
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,159
That's nothing.

94
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,325
Why'd this guy get the pinch?

95
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,023
He lied about the affair 
till the DNA came back.

96
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:28,475
Then he changed his story.

97
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,495
How's the Norristown 
murder come into play?

98
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,679
This hooker job had 
a pretty similar M.O.,

99
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,781
the antenna, the river dump.

100
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,794
Worth getting a look 
at that Norristown file.

101
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,181
Vera won't mind taking a ride.

102
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,430
This professor still 
teaching Art History?

103
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,449
English as a second language.

104
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,765
Step or two down.

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,630
Paid a high price if he's innocent.

106
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,032
Or if he's guilty,

107
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,704
he's gotten a lot of free years.

108
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,034
So, we reinvestigate him, too.

109
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,481
Hi, we meet again. 
Excuse me.

110
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,644
Professor Minard, 
my partner Scotty Valens.

111
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,210
Hi.

112
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,221
Hi. Thank you.

113
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:01,941
You're very kind to 
call me "professor",

114
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,821
but around here I'm just "Mr. Roy."

115
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,248
Yeah, okay.

116
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:09,046
So does this visit mean

117
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:11,081
there was something to 
my amateur detective's theory?

118
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,357
We don't know yet.

119
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:15,977
I've filled a lot of time the 
last nine years

120
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:16,885
reading mystery novels.

121
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,962
I thought maybe I was 
getting carried away.

122
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,983
Well, we haven't seen the 
file from Norristown yet.

123
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,520
But we were wondering where you were

124
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:30,957
the uh, night that hooker got killed.

125
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,358
Right, um...

126
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,728
I teach here nights, 
Mondays through Thursday.

127
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,163
What night was she killed?

128
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,518
It was a Tuesday.

129
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,178
Then I was here.

130
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:50,809
22 other witnesses 
will tell you the same,

131
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,694
in broken but improving English.

132
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,145
Lying about your affair with Holly

133
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,629
got you in a lot of hot water.

134
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,910
I was arrogant.

135
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:03,181
Bill Clinton lied to America 
about the intern.

136
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,588
I lied to Philadelphia.

137
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,387
And you both got caught in the end.

138
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,906
I wouldn't do it again.

139
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,413
DNA...

140
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,975
will get you every time.

141
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,196
So when Holly was killed,

142
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,691
how were you two getting along?

143
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:20,052
Well, in my first statement,

144
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:21,698
I said things were great.

145
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,150
I know.

146
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,427
But to be honest,

147
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,826
there was some tension.

148
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,702
If I had a small dinner 
party, would you come?

149
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,315
Small, as in you and me?

150
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,701
Maybe six people or eight.

151
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,292
No, I wouldn't.

152
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,357
Why not?

153
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:45,265
Holly... there are rules.

154
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,104
Well, I wanna see you in public.

155
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,244
You can't.

156
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,906
God, don't you ever even think 
about me outside this office?

157
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,441
Sure. Thinking is perfectly fair.

158
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,147
Seeing each other outside 
of these four walls...

159
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:00,169
it's not possible.

160
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,694
What if I don't like 
those rules anymore?

161
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:09,722
Sounds like you laid 
it out pretty clear.

162
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,823
My campus and my home life 
stayed separate.

163
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,676
No contact outside of office hours.

164
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,017
Is that what you called it?

165
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,352
Not even phone calls.

166
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,243
Here's the deal, Roy.

167
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,414
If we're gonna look 
at this case again,

168
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,683
you gotta be an open book this time.

169
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:21,736
Done.

170
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,358
In fact...

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,388
Here it is.

172
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:26,489
What is it?

173
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,379
It's a list of women,

174
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,500
who were also...

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,678
Conquests?

176
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:33,168
Did you offer these names

177
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:34,506
in the first investigation?

178
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:37,023
No, I was pretending 
Holly was the only one.

179
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:39,341
They'll probably badmouth me.

180
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,305
You'll hear a lot about bad behavior,

181
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,056
but nothing that says "murder."

182
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,366
I was sick in love with that jerk.

183
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:50,868
I see you took two different art history 
courses with him, spring of '92.

184
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,300
Hm, 'cause I couldn't 
get enough of him.

185
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,680
You know how vile it is
to know you were with a murderer?

186
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,753
Why do you think he's a murderer?

187
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:00,094
I read the papers.

188
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:01,194
He told City Magazine

189
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,391
he didn't do anything 
to "hurt that girl."

190
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,478
Pretty strange word choice,

191
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,000
don't you think?

192
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,687
Was he ever violent with you?

193
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,069
No.

194
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:14,603
Possessive? Scary, at all?

195
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:15,979
No.

196
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,361
But you still think maybe 
he could have whipped

197
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,355
and strangled with 
this Holly to death.

198
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,692
I read the papers.

199
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,041
He toyed with me
my whole sophomore year.

200
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,049
Treated you bad?

201
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,833
Like a piece of ass.

202
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,736
Seduced me with poetry and wine 
during office hours...

203
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:35,329
pretended not to know me
if I saw him on campus.

204
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,945
You think he murdered Holly?

205
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,492
He got a lawyer pretty fast.

206
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,534
I'll tell you a secret, Monique,

207
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,822
that's actually the smart thing to do.

208
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:47,729
Seems like the guilty 
thing to do, to me.

209
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,601
Roy Minard...

210
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:52,767
I wouldn't say that name 
too loudly around here.

211
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,156
We need to know about 
your relationship with him.

212
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:57,931
In '94?

213
00:09:58,742 --> 00:09:59,993
I'm on the faculty now.

214
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,952
It'd be bad for me if that got out.

215
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:04,183
Is that why you kept it from 
the police nine years ago?

216
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,733
I was never asked.

217
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,599
Look, this isn't popular 
opinion around campus,

218
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,912
but Roy didn't kill Holly.

219
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,417
You don't think so?

220
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,234
He was unethical but 
he's not a murderer.

221
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,646
You didn't think he 
was unethical in '94.

222
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:19,034
I didn't really get what an abuse

223
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,971
it was until I started teaching.

224
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,451
It's just so easy to impress students.

225
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,999
And Roy's very charismatic.

226
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,498
We've met him.

227
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,008
Did you know Holly Richardson?

228
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:34,832
I tried to warn her not to 
get in too deep with Roy.

229
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,739
I talked to her that night 
at the Elizabethan Club.

230
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,930
It's not so easy seeing 
them in the flesh, is it?

231
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,509
- What?
- The wife, the kid.

232
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,102
No, it's not.

233
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:02,180
Holly, this time last year,
I was standing right where you are.

234
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,018
Did you feel like you'd 
just been hit by a truck?

235
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,068
Yeah.

236
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,252
He's happy with them.
He won't leave.

237
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,788
Why does he have affairs 
if he's so happy?

238
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,556
I don't know his psychology.

239
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,735
But there's a new girl every year.

240
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,432
And the year's almost over.

241
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,442
I think it's different this time.

242
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:31,516
I felt for her.
I, I was her at one point.

243
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:35,764
But she was upset at him...
not the other way around.

244
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,048
So after two hours of making copies

245
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:43,624
of every page from 
this Norristown job...

246
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:45,501
Stillman told us 
about the flat tire.

247
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,566
Yeah, that precinct's copier 
was from the mimeograph era.

248
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:49,735
Look, guys, it was bad luck.

249
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,793
Yeah, well, we finish 
up your dog call,

250
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,791
finally get out of 
traffic on Ridge Pike...

251
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,136
Prostitute's name was Lenore Grandy.

252
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,304
And bam!

253
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,621
And we were in the fast lane.

254
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,379
Vera, Jeffries thank you.

255
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,308
You risked your very 
lives for this job.

256
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:05,016
Hey, guys, can we talk about 
Lenore Grandy now?

257
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,628
Whipped 14 times with a car antenna,

258
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:07,756
then strangled with it.

259
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,528
And dumped in the Schuylkill.

260
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,481
That's just like Holly.

261
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,867
But here's the money.

262
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:19,048
Lonore... Holly.

263
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,233
Wow...

264
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,285
Yeah.

265
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,206
Gotta be the same doer.

266
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,638
How did no one catch this?

267
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,370
Different counties. 
Computer don't talk.

268
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,323
Roy Minard have an alibi 
for the second murder?

269
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:34,351
Teaching his class that 
night. It checked out.

270
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,226
Maybe he did get the Jewell treatment.

271
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,984
I got something we can run with.

272
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:40,736
Yeah.

273
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:41,400
Cross-referenced

274
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,161
the names from vice 
sweeps in Norristown

275
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,107
with the university alumni records.

276
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:46,092
Two hits.

277
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,544
Clarence Grimes.

278
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:49,132
Graduated 20 years ago.

279
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,301
He wouldn't know Holly.

280
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:53,020
Yeah, but Barry Tepler would.

281
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,041
He was in school same time as her.

282
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,411
He only lives eight blocks 
from where Lenore was dumped.

283
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:04,512
I don't have... people over...

284
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,241
We're here about Holly Richardson.

285
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:10,958
Don't bring her up.

286
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,855
Why not?

287
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,863
I stay away from Holly, 
just like she told me to.

288
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,983
Holly told you stay away, Barry?

289
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:19,234
She invited me home for Thanksgiving...

290
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,082
I misinterpreted her 
gesture of friendship

291
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,801
for a deeper interest,

292
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,622
but I changed my behavior 
when she relayed her true feelings.

293
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,946
Your therapist tell you that?

294
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:32,931
Or lawyer?

295
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:37,708
When she asked me to 
leave her alone... I did.

296
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:44,728
Hi.

297
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,444
What you doing here?

298
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:47,889
I go to school here.

299
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,823
Well, you don't have any 
classes in Williams Hall.

300
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,621
I wanted to see you.

301
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,682
Barry, you're following me.

302
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:56,511
I like you.

303
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,366
I'm not interested in you in that way.

304
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,172
You took me to meet your parents.

305
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,049
It was Thanksgiving.

306
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,356
You had nowhere else to go.

307
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,428
Well, can we talk about it, or...

308
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,640
No. Nope.

309
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,700
I don't wanna talk about it,

310
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,973
I don't want you to 
call me or follow me.

311
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:10,875
Uh-huh.

312
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,756
And I don't want any more letters.

313
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,350
Those are yours.

314
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,818
No, they're yours.

315
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,664
So you stalked Holly.

316
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:33,244
I pursued her with 
too much enthusiasm.

317
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,005
You still have those letters, Barry?

318
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:35,920
No.

319
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,388
You save dental reminders 
from three years ago,

320
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,240
but not those letters?

321
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:46,424
I... I was in my dorm room 
when she was killed.

322
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,855
Where were you 
when Lenore Grandy was killed?

323
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,126
I don't know who that is.

324
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,058
A hooker.

325
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:54,148
Murdered December 30th, 
eight blocks from here.

326
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,203
That's a Tuesday. 
Tuesdays I paint.

327
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:58,707
I have therapy at 5:00,

328
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:01,129
then I go to Wawa for a Red Bull,

329
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,076
uh, get a Newsweek, 
I'm home by 10:00.

330
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:06,560
Plenty of time for 
prostitute on that schedule.

331
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,782
I don't use prostitutes.

332
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:11,872
Risperdol.

333
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,994
You got schizophrenia?

334
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:15,877
Yeah.

335
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,071
Hear voices?

336
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:19,103
God talking through the garbage?

337
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:19,865
I'm better now.

338
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,085
It's tough getting better.

339
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,649
You stop, taking these, you 
can fall into psychotic behavior.

340
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:24,329
I take'em.

341
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:25,062
Well, maybe you lapsed

342
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,034
right around December 30th, 
voices started saying

343
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:27,877
you should hurt that hooker.

344
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:30,479
I don't go near those whores!

345
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,876
Yeah, he comes here all the time.

346
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,716
Hangs around and tries to talk to us.

347
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:36,512
He ever talk to your friend Lenore?

348
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,318
Oh, he especially liked her.

349
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,267
Stared at her from across the street.

350
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,614
He the one killed her?

351
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:42,793
Uh, we don't know.

352
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:45,558
I figured it was a bad John did it.

353
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:47,966
This kid was never Lenore's trick?

354
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:48,759
Mm-mm.

355
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,327
He walked up to her once, though.

356
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,230
Said he loved her flaxen hair

357
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,772
and asked would she go back with him.

358
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:55,224
- She go?
- Hell, no!

359
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:57,004
He didn't have no money.

360
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,888
Man! I never would've thought 
it could've been this creep.

361
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:02,629
We don't know that it is, Trish.

362
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,433
You know...

363
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,618
I thought you guys 
would've blown Lenore off.

364
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,822
Dead hooker, who cares?

365
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:09,644
No one's getting blown off.

366
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,742
Come here.

367
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,516
I wanna show you something.

368
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,000
Get in.

369
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,577
Hey! Not you, her.

370
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,591
Tight fit in here, huh?

371
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,734
I'm not staying anywhere right now.

372
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:45,459
Lenore and me met while we were
studying to be beauticians.

373
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,080
We hit it off right away.

374
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,384
Look. That's us.

375
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,461
Best friend, huh?

376
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:58,823
Figured you should have a real 
picture of her, not some mug shot.

377
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,448
What's this one?

378
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:01,373
Oh...

379
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,954
Lenore had this rich John.

380
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:04,167
He was gonna divorce,

381
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:07,253
so he gave Lenore the diamond earings
he had just bought for his wife.

382
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,190
Nice.

383
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,018
Yeah.

384
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,021
Instead of just keeping it for herself,

385
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,343
she gives me one.

386
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:15,572
We made friendship rings... 
but for the belly.

387
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:18,679
Lenore had the other one, huh?

388
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,815
She wore it all the time.

389
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:24,991
Any mention of a diamond belly 
ring in the Norristown report?

390
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,598
Uh, no. Doer probably took it.

391
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,689
You the Detectives?

392
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,167
Rush and Valens.

393
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,294
This is difficult for us.

394
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,079
We only had one child.

395
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,179
We understand.

396
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,777
We already know who killed our daughter.

397
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,961
Uh, we have another suspect
we wanna ask you about.

398
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,207
Hmm. Maybe I wasn't clear.

399
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,460
Roy Minard killed Holly.

400
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,740
Maybe I wasn't clear.

401
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,260
We're Homicide and
we're looking at someone else.

402
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,143
Who?

403
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,259
Barry Tepler.

404
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,983
He went to college with Holly.

405
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,478
He was here for Thanksgiving.

406
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:10,775
That kid was harmless.

407
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,062
Mr. Richardson, 
if someone else is responsible,

408
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,652
- don't you wanna know that?
- I know who killed Holly.

409
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:17,575
A father knows.

410
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,577
Well, Barry was infatuated 
with your daughter.

411
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,237
So was Minard.

412
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,469
I'll come back early,
if you break the rules

413
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:29,862
and come see a movie with me in public.

414
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:32,595
I gotta go. My mom has the cake out.

415
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,153
Is that for me?

416
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:36,792
Yeah.

417
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,387
A ticket to Paris?

418
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,163
- Who was that on the phone?
- A friend from school.

419
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:50,516
A man called for you earlier.

420
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,766
Dad, I'm not a kid.

421
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,067
Then talk to me like an adult.

422
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:02,236
Um... he is my art history professor.

423
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,665
He seduced her.

424
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:09,660
He fell in love with her... 
and who wouldn't?

425
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,488
She was just so damn special.

426
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,798
Thought you kept your 
home and campus life separate, Roy.

427
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,781
Not even a phone call. 
Ain't that what he said?

428
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:19,449
That's right.

429
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,961
Except you called 
Holly on her birthday.

430
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,162
At her parents' house.

431
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,320
That's right. I did.

432
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:28,067
Open book.

433
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,416
- You remember, Roy?
- I'd forgotten about that.

434
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,552
And maybe you were a little more invested
in Holly than you're telling us.

435
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,698
You got some other motive here, Minard?

436
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:39,692
My motive was to get my life 
and my career back.

437
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,436
As far as the phone call's concerned,

438
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:45,835
Holly... insisted that I 
call her on her birthday.

439
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,753
Said if I didn't, 
she was gonna call me.

440
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,704
So what? You said your wife 
knew about the affairs.

441
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,504
Knowing about it in 
the back of your mind

442
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,098
and hearing a girl's 
voice on the line...

443
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,664
they're two differnt things.

444
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,600
Holly told her dad she broke
things off with you in April.

445
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,262
But you were still 
going strong in May.

446
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:05,934
You'd tell your dad the truth 
about your sex life?

447
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:07,318
What's all that?

448
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:14,137
Two hundred and twenty-eight...

449
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,882
articles on Roy Minard...

450
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:18,658
Murderer.

451
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:25,143
The President's Award 
for Outstanding Lecturer.

452
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,060
Why can't they put that on the news?

453
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,404
People like a story.

454
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:33,202
You're a postmodernist.

455
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,015
A what?

456
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:38,082
Well, that's the crux 
of the theory, anyway.

457
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,947
Social construction of reality.

458
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,278
What are you talking about?

459
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:43,103
Society needs a narrative.

460
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:45,517
You know, given seemingly 
random facts and events,

461
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:48,799
we need to weave them into a story.

462
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,505
Otherwise, the world 
wouldn't make any sense.

463
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:55,637
I can see that.

464
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:59,453
How do we process
this beautiful young girl dying?

465
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,591
We can't.

466
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,867
Not without a perpetrator.

467
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,554
And so, if one isn't 
obvious, we find one.

468
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:06,681
We assign the blame.

469
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,132
It makes the story complete.

470
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:10,501
It's an action-- explanation.

471
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,777
Order restored.

472
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,407
Why people gotta believe in God, too.

473
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,817
Mm-hmm. Exactly.

474
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,914
Too many unanswerables without Him.

475
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:22,841
Makes some sense.

476
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:26,615
Well, I'd be even more fascinated
if I weren't the foil of it all,

477
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,078
but, yes, it does.

478
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:30,897
It makes some sense.

479
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,194
Kite!

480
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,430
Uh, office is closed, Rush.

481
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,597
Seven O'clock?

482
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:44,450
Yeah, well, spare me 
the Homicide mantra:

483
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,940
"When your days ends, 
ours just begins."

484
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,315
- It's true.
- Yeah, I've seen the T-shirt.

485
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:53,090
I don't know what I'd do with myself
if I went home at 7:00.

486
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:57,318
Uh, you remember the 
Holly Richardson job?

487
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,547
Yeah, everybody wanted that one.

488
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:01,330
Why? There's nothing on it.

489
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,569
Pretty Ivy League girl, 
philandering professor,

490
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,369
kind of case gets you on Court TV.

491
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:08,076
Where you'd look like a fool,
'cause the commonwealth had crap?

492
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,541
I guess. Have you eaten?

493
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:12,100
Look, I need a search warrant 
on this kid Barry.

494
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,549
Do you know any Norristown DA's?

495
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,225
- 'Cause I haven't eaten.
- I need it right away.

496
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,133
This kid knows we're looking at him.

497
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,458
Sit with me. We'll run the case.

498
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,449
Or we can do it tomorrow.
I've got, like, 15 minutes at 4:30.

499
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:34,922
Barry Tepler fits for both jobs.

500
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,842
Oh, I got a narrative on him.

501
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:37,981
A what?

502
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,739
A story that adds up.

503
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,591
He had it bad for Holly, right?

504
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:43,214
Gets rejected by her.

505
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:46,026
Then he's hanging around this hooker
Lenore the last few months.

506
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,367
Who he claims he didn't know.

507
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,080
Who also rejected him.

508
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,148
Both girls are end 
up dead in the water.

509
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,334
Well, if he's so in love with'em,

510
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:54,460
why no sexual element to these murders?

511
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,441
Well, Barry's schizophrenic.

512
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,636
A lot of people with that 
condition, no sex drive.

513
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,101
And the voices you here, 
they're powerful.

514
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,911
They tell you to kill 
someone, you do it.

515
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,415
You're, uh, knowledgeable, huh?

516
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,912
Yeah.

517
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,979
I know someone.

518
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:13,868
Where's Lil?

519
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,353
Asking a warrant for Barry's.

520
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:17,947
To find the hooker's belly ring,
those letters to Holly.

521
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,045
Maybe he starts owning up.

522
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:21,639
All right.

523
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:22,411
Good night, Scotty.

524
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,172
Yeah.

525
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,657
So Roy Minard is innocent after all?

526
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,149
Hard to assume anything

527
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,196
but this Barry kid makes...

528
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,388
more sense.

529
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:38,259
So what's he like Minard?

530
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:40,744
Kind of a cad.

531
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:42,424
But a charming one?

532
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:44,022
I guess.

533
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:49,107
So you figure a guy's bad news
if he mixes work and pleasure?

534
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:51,208
I don't have a big opinion on that.

535
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,111
Hmm.

536
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:56,311
So, uh, I'll call this 
Norristown guy in the morning.

537
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,851
How come we always talk about work?

538
00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:59,339
'Cause we work together.

539
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,973
Well, tell me something personal.

540
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:01,948
No!

541
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:03,808
Why not?

542
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,404
Come on, Rush. Why not?

543
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,029
Because...

544
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,119
I'm bad at that, and...

545
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,397
I gotta go.

546
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:17,044
Well, let me walk you.

547
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,320
- I'll be fine! I'm packing.
- Uh, watch...!　　　　　

548
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,162
You know... stand still, okay?

549
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,205
What are you doing?

550
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,154
I'm gonna kiss you.

551
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,018
No.

552
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,412
Just give it a try.

553
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:35,865
Come on...

554
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:36,929
Come on, Rush.

555
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,821
All you, all you gotta 
do is stand there.

556
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:39,851
Don't panic.

557
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:41,897
It's over in three seconds.

558
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:16,306
Um...

559
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,986
So sit with that overnight and, uh...

560
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:24,972
see how it settles in.

561
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,706
Everything has its place.
Everything has its...

562
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,158
Everything has its place.

563
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:51,772
Read the warrant;  we got a right.

564
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,694
Why are you doing this to me?

565
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:55,623
What did I do wrong?

566
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:56,286
You lied about that

567
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:58,809
flaxen-haired hooker,
asking her home and all.

568
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,045
I just wanted to paint her.

569
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:06,918
Pay dirt.

570
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:10,576
Guess you lied about having 
these letters to Holly, too.

571
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,545
Please don't take those.

572
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,229
Got to read'em, Barry.

573
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,421
They sent you to ruin my life.

574
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:21,080
I know...

575
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:24,018
they watch outside in the shadows,

576
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,219
in the closet, behind the coats...

577
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,573
Stress is bringing on an episode.

578
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:28,754
You think I can't hear them?

579
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,669
Take him out for some air, will you?

580
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:31,618
That high pitch? Huh?

581
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:33,748
Like a whistle?

582
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,827
That tries to make you crazy?

583
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:42,783
What's it say?

584
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:48,572
"To my Holly:

585
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,556
If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool

586
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,412
for wise men know well enough

587
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,514
what monsters you make of them."

588
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:57,698
Some kind of poetry?

589
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,998
Maybe Shakespeare?

590
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,379
No belly ring at Barry's?

591
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,555
Mm. Turned his place inside out.

592
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,110
Maybe sold it for cash.

593
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,937
"Who set this

594
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:10,660
ancient quarrel new abroach?"

595
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,638
What the hell? I thought this was 
about a girl on a balcony.

596
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:14,314
Just find the quote 
from Barry's letter.

597
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:15,280
Well, hold up.

598
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,273
"Is your name Shylock?"

599
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:18,762
That's not the quote.

600
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,146
I know-- it's just the first thing

601
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:21,891
I've understood in about an hour.

602
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,380
It's here, in Hamlet.

603
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,532
Thank God.

604
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:25,826
"If thou wilt needs marry,요

605
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:27,010
marry a fool;

606
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,939
for wise men know well enough 
what monsters you make of them.

607
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:33,853
To a nunnery, go, and quickly, too."

608
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,880
Hamlet says it to Ophelia.

609
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,573
Looks like it was a 
one-sided kind of love.

610
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:40,602
He rejects her.

611
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:42,808
- But Barry was the one rejected.
- Right.

612
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:45,142
Flip to the back.
How's it end?

613
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,524
Uh, she... goes mad and drowns.

614
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:51,556
Both our vics were found in the drink.

615
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:54,149
The "drink"?
You the Bard now?

616
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,854
Monster could mean... Barry's illness.

617
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:59,231
- He blames it on Holly?
- Let's find out.

618
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:01,923
About that belly ring, Scotty's right.

619
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:04,747
Barry could've sold it, you wanna check
consignment and pawn shops?

620
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:08,076
Yeah. Once I'm finished with 
this scintillating play.

621
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:11,101
Selling or buying?

622
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:12,172
Buying.

623
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:15,035
Pawn shop on the corner said
you might have what we want.

624
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,532
Don't give that Schmuck your business.

625
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:19,371
The schmuck that has this...

626
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,536
diamond belly ring...

627
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,822
is the one gets our business.

628
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,630
Just got some vintage cufflinks.

629
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,389
The belly ring.

630
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:28,316
That's all we want.

631
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:29,622
You're missing out, fellas.

632
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,219
They're tigereye.

633
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,077
Yeah.

634
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,831
This what you had in mind?

635
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:38,020
Yeah.

636
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:39,935
Exactly.

637
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:41,319
Nice stone. Two carats.

638
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,243
How much?

639
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:44,275
Ten Bens.

640
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:45,596
Call the seller--

641
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:48,209
tell him to come down here
and collect his dough.

642
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:52,956
So you saw you and Holly as a kind of
modern-day Hamlet and Ophelia, huh?

643
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:53,699
So?

644
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,285
That didn't end well
for that chick in the play, Barry.

645
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,057
Didn't end well for Holly, either.

646
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,389
It's just a letter.

647
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:04,458
"Wise men know well enough 
what monsters you make of them."

648
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,290
You saying she made you into a monster?

649
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,269
No, passion. Passion is the monster.

650
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,208
I just...I...

651
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,206
I wanted to get her attention,

652
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,233
show her I was sensitive.

653
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,116
Not like that old... 
guy she was seeing.

654
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,863
Oh, you knew about Minard?

655
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:23,401
He shouldn't date students.

656
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,383
It's not an equal relationship.

657
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,012
So when Holly was stupid enough

658
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:31,630
not to be moved by 
your borrowed poetry...

659
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,125
Throw those letters back in your face.

660
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,712
When she stayed in her unequal 
relationship with Minard,

661
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:37,381
and told you to leave 
her the hell alone,

662
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,434
you wanted to punish her.

663
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:39,287
Followed her that night,

664
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,454
snapped off an antenna, 
then whip, whip, whip,

665
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:42,751
strangel, strangle.

666
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:43,994
Splash.

667
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,516
I saw her that night.

668
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:54,554
But I only talked to her.

669
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,435
Are you okay?

670
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:01,465
Mm-hmm.

671
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:04,934
Well, I know I'm... 
I'm not supposed to come near you...

672
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,440
No, it's all right, you can.

673
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,526
I, uh...

674
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:14,716
Oh.

675
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:19,603
What happened?

676
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:25,117
I found out what a bitch I am.

677
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,704
You're not a bitch.

678
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,980
I saw Minard's wife... and their kid.

679
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,747
They're real.

680
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:36,014
I pretended they weren't, but...

681
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:37,294
they're a family.

682
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,200
Guy's not right for you anyway.

683
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,822
Oh. Well, he doesn't think so.

684
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:43,371
He wants to stay together.

685
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,776
Really?

686
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,654
But, you know, the truth is,

687
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:51,651
I don't care about him.

688
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:54,704
I was just playing a game,

689
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:57,321
but I... I don't love him.

690
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,424
Maybe...

691
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:05,807
Maybe you could love me.

692
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,318
No.

693
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:11,850
I'll never love you, either.

694
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,494
Girl you love says that to you,

695
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:26,548
and you just... get up 
and go back to the dorm?

696
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:27,579
Yeah.

697
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:29,799
We didn't hear it like that, Barry.

698
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:34,151
We heard Holly was pissed off 
at Minard after that party.

699
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:35,593
Lil.

700
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:42,838
What's going on?

701
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:44,241
Holly's mother called.

702
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,429
I won't fight you.

703
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:51,773
I don't care how many 
times you hit me,

704
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:53,401
- Mr. Richardson.
- I'm not gonna hit you back.

705
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:55,095
This won't solve anything.

706
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:56,521
You won't take care of this guy,

707
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:57,118
I'll do it myself.

708
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:59,306
I am taking care of it. 
I'm reinvestigating.

709
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:01,239
Holly was an innocent girl,

710
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,014
and this bastard...

711
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,617
- took advantage...
- I was wrong.

712
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,224
Okay? I shouldn't 
have been with her.

713
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:08,500
You have every reason 
to hate me for that,

714
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,773
but I did not hurt Holly.

715
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:11,023
Don't say that.

716
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,717
I know you did it. I know it.

717
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,156
Please let me handle this.

718
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,330
I miss her.

719
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:23,745
I know.

720
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:33,346
Holly was special.

721
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,283
M-Maybe you don't 
wanna hear that from me,

722
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,871
but she talked about you all the time.

723
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:39,725
She adored you.

724
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:49,071
I know he did it.

725
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,257
Whoa.

726
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:02,176
Hey...

727
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,782
- Did you get that warrant okay?
- I did.

728
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:07,292
- All right.
- Thanks. / Yeah.

729
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,709
I guess we won't talk 
about the other thing.

730
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:09,901
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay

731
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,152
Shut up.

732
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:18,201
Who's this?

733
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,259
Jesus Torres. Ex-con.

734
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,696
Tried to sell Lenore Grandy's belly ring.

735
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,287
What's he sayin'?

736
00:33:27,277 --> 00:33:29,645
Some not so nice about Vera's sister.

737
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,806
Well, looks like you 
got two suspects now.

738
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,961
This ring belonged to Lenore Grandy,

739
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,984
the hooker you killed up in Norristown.

740
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:43,660
I tell you,

741
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:48,267
told you, I didn't kill no one.

742
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,633
What's your parole officer
gonna think all about this?

743
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:55,484
Six months out and you already
got ties to two murders.

744
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:57,075
Two?

745
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,414
Yeah. Lenore Grandy, two weeks ago,

746
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,868
Holly Richardson in '95. Same doer.

747
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:05,301
They say "Jesus has 
not adjusted to life

748
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,518
after prison the way we had hoped."

749
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:12,820
Maybe I took the diamond.

750
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,299
Now, that's a start.

751
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:16,239
Yeah, but it ain't like you say.

752
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:16,673
Hmm.

753
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:19,286
What is it like?

754
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:22,982
I go to the river.

755
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:26,307
I find the girl dead already, in the water.

756
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,404
I see the ring.

757
00:34:28,914 --> 00:34:31,519
I think, she don't need it now, right?

758
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:32,965
Nah, she's iced.

759
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,319
That's all I do.

760
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:36,326
I steal from someone 
don't need it anymore.

761
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:42,982
Now, here's my vision for 
what happened, Barry.

762
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,358
You met Lenore in your hood,

763
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,166
fell in love with that flaxen hair,

764
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,374
which was a lot like Holly's...

765
00:34:48,374 --> 00:34:49,656
Holly was a honey blonde.

766
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:52,677
...and thought, "Well, 
here's a Holly look-alike,

767
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:54,163
and she's just a hooker.

768
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:56,536
Maybe I can get this one."

769
00:34:56,765 --> 00:34:58,853
I just wanted to paint 
Lenore; I'm a painter.

770
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:00,901
But then she gives you the high hat.

771
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,720
Rejected by a whore.

772
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,412
That's humiliating.

773
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:05,657
The last straw.

774
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:06,715
So you figure, let me

775
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:09,358
give this bitch the same treatment 
I gave Holly.

776
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,709
I gotta show you something.

777
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,290
You study the pre-Raphaelites 
there, Jesus?

778
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,997
Que? What?

779
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:37,890
John Everett Millais 
one of your favorites?

780
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,803
It's called "Ophelia".

781
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,364
I never saw that.

782
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,668
But you do recognize that, uh,

783
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:49,164
Lenore was posed just 
like poor Ophelia here.

784
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:52,293
I don't know nothing about paintings.

785
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,524
No?

786
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:57,917
All I did was steal the ring.

787
00:35:58,044 --> 00:36:00,131
She was layin' in the water...

788
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:02,185
lyin' in the water already dead.

789
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,447
Say that again.

790
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,982
She was lyin' in the water dead.

791
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,695
- Chickens lay.
- People lie.

792
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:12,584
You take ESL with Mr. Roy?

793
00:36:12,924 --> 00:36:14,237
No. Nah.

794
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:17,360
It's easy to prove, Jesus.
There's a registry for that.

795
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,989
You and him made a deal, didn't you?

796
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:23,453
Murder for hire gets you the death penalty
nine times out of ten, Jesus.

797
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,973
Lucky part for you is,
we want Roy more than you.

798
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:28,698
Tell your side,
we tell the DA you cooperated.

799
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:48,687
I done this before-- 10,000.

800
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:51,126
I can't do ten. Five maybe.

801
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:55,436
Come on, it... it's a hooker.

802
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,409
It'll be the easiest 
money you've ever made.

803
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,660
It's so easy, you do it,

804
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,493
and it'll cost you nothing.

805
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:07,424
I have to be in class
to establish my alibi.

806
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:11,817
Okay.

807
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,772
I do for six.

808
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:18,807
All right, but remember, 
you stick to the script.

809
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:21,343
Everything's gotta be done exactly
like the way it was last time.

810
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:23,322
- Comprende, Jesus?
- Si.

811
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:27,499
I end up teaching this 
pathetic class, and, uh...

812
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,432
it was all to meet you, my friend.

813
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,274
That's destiny.

814
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:35,407
I'll be back after this...

815
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:38,405
where I belong.

816
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,930
Minard, what's destiny?

817
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,932
It's what sets you free.

818
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:45,295
I thought it was truth.

819
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:46,798
The truth sets you free.

820
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,664
No. It's destiny. Trust me.

821
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,806
He only pay me $3,000.

822
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:59,312
So I figure I deserved the jewelry.

823
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,186
Seems only fair.

824
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,905
Back inside the Ivy walls.

825
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,367
Yeah, lunch with the dean.

826
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,787
I don't wanna appear too hopeful,

827
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:13,886
but the head of my old department

828
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:15,255
in stepping down in the fall.

829
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:17,237
Getting your name cleared 
would help a lot, huh?

830
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:17,999
It couldn't hurt.

831
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,296
So you'd be glad to know 
we have someone in custody.

832
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:22,482
No.

833
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:23,245
Who is it?

834
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:24,501
Jesus Torres.

835
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,351
A student in your ESL class.

836
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:31,706
Jesus... No, I'm sorry,
that doesn't ring a bell.

837
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:32,947
That's not what he says.

838
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,846
He says you told him you killed Holly.

839
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:39,040
What? / And hired him to kill
Lenore in a copycat killing.

840
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:43,503
That... that's absurd.

841
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:44,121
Well, I know you are

842
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,465
the brilliant professor, 
and we're just dump cops...

843
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:47,314
I don't think you're dumb.

844
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:49,231
...who couldn't possibly 
have heard of Ophelia.

845
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,154
I don't think you're dumb.

846
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,866
I just think you're falling for a story.

847
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,775
Almost, Minard.

848
00:38:57,577 --> 00:38:59,352
I almost fell for your story.

849
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:01,603
But your boy Jesus
screwed up your plan.

850
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,682
And he got greedy, 
stole some off the body.

851
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:05,761
Led us back to you.

852
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,397
Jesus is a lifetime criminal

853
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,034
with a third-world education.

854
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:11,258
I thought you didn't know him.

855
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,509
You have his word against mine.

856
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,056
It hardly makes a case.

857
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,704
No. But the second body being 
posed just like the first,

858
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:20,993
that makes my case.

859
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:22,771
Public didn't know those details.

860
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,135
Only Holly's killer did.

861
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:27,853
And who's gonna believe a dummy like
Jesus ever studied art history.

862
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,795
I had to regain my station.

863
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:46,538
And Jesus offered a way to do that.

864
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:48,459
You knew about Barry's 
letters to Holly.

865
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:50,056
Calling her his "Ophelia".

866
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,667
She showed me a few of them.

867
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,970
Pillow talk, if you will.

868
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,065
So you just needed to find 
another girl to link Barry to.

869
00:39:59,853 --> 00:40:03,275
Make it look like she was 
his second Ophelia.

870
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,607
Frame him for both.

871
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:08,304
Guy's just a schizo, 
what's his life worth, anyway?

872
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:10,572
I contribute.

873
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,254
Don't look at me like 
I'm some kind of monster.

874
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:16,963
Holly shares some of the 
blame of this, too.

875
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:18,178
Oh, really?

876
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:20,749
What'd Holly do?

877
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:23,763
She made me love her.

878
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:50,032
You left angry...

879
00:40:50,892 --> 00:40:52,063
I could tell.

880
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:54,928
What? What's wrong?

881
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:56,826
Nothing's wrong.

882
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,760
It's just over.

883
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:02,180
What makes you say that?

884
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:04,373
You have a wife.

885
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,088
Then I'll leave her for you.

886
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:11,555
No.

887
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,059
I will. I will.

888
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,608
I really will.

889
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:17,757
I thought I loved you, but 
it was only in a childish way.

890
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,373
You know, this hard-to-get act
is a little juvenile for you.

891
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:23,813
You know, I just wanted to have fun.

892
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:25,863
I didn't even think about your family.

893
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:26,579
Hey...

894
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,956
Did you hear what I just said...
that I love you?

895
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,368
Well, I don't love you.

896
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:36,056
- I don't love anyone.
- Except yourself.

897
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:39,470
Yeah, and you love you, 
and that's why we get along so well.

898
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,992
I say when it's over.

899
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:56,117
I make the rules.

900
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:18,866
I decide.

901
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,211
I decide!

902
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:28,363
I decide!

903
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:38,891
I decide.

904
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:26,329
#  Oasis의 "Don't look back in anger" #

905
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:33,468
# Slip inside the eye of your mind #

906
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:36,990
# Don't you know you might find #

907
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,976
# A better place to play #

908
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:45,126
# You said that you'd never been #

909
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:48,709
# But all the things 
that you've seen #

910
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,873
# Will slowly fade away #

911
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:58,301
# So I start a revolution 
from my bed #

912
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:04,132
# Cos you said the brains 
I have went to my head #

913
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:10,302
# Step outside the 
summertime's in bloom #

914
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:13,301
# Stand up beside the fireplace #

915
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:16,271
# Take that look from off your face#

916
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:24,025
# You ain't ever gonna 
burn my heart out#

917
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:32,890
# My soul slides away, #

918
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,814
# but don't look back in anger #

919
00:44:35,814 --> 00:44:39,418
# I heard you say #

920
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:44,859
# My soul slides away, #

921
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:47,900
# but don't look back in anger #

922
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,320
# Don't look back in anger #

923
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,682
# I heard you say...#
