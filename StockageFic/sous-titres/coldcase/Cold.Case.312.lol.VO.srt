00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:01,553
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:12,965
May 13, 1994

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,526
Dawn, what a paper you wrote
What a

4
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:21,538
You don't smoke, not you

5
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,062
Detention

6
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:34,940
Bad attitude Mr Lidvac, dentention

7
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,420
What are you doing in here?

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,349
Studying

9
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:51,284
Detention this afternoon

10
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:02,789
That took some work

11
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,876
Uh, yeah Sir

12
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:08,728
- How'd you get it all up there?
- Glue stick

13
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:10,950
Glue Where'd you get that?

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,007
This is thethe one who

15
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:16,233
Suicide He commited suicide

16
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,060
And this is school property

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,653
Detention this afternoon

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,503
SUICIDE

19
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,344
DAWSON, T

20
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,142
What did Brahman have to say?

21
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,835
- Uh, new info on a case
- Which?

22
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,375
Kid named Trevor Dawson

23
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,808
Died in '94, falling from the roof
of his high school

24
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,636
- Accident?
- Northwest handled it as a suicide

25
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:40,308
This note was found on Trevor's body

26
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:44,059
'I want my parents to know
that I don't regret what I'm doing

27
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:48,205
It may seem extreme but it's the best
for everyone Trevor Dawson'

28
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,335
Suicide note
Sounds straightforward

29
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,318
Well, only now we have the other half

30
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,542
Custodian at Trevor's high school
just died Landlord calls the cops

31
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,505
when he finds the guys apartment
full of creepy high school memorablilia

32
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:02,334
- Including this
- May 13th, '94

33
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:06,305
- 'This is TD writing from a scary spot'
- It's the same handwriting

34
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,047
'I want you to know that I'm in danger,

35
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:11,710
if something happens to me today
please tell my parents I love them'

36
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,467
This new note ends there

37
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,981
Well, put the two pieces together

38
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,548
Same page, ripped in half

39
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:21,519
Top of the note, Trevor says he's in danger
He knows he's gonna die

40
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,989
What kind of kid was this?
He was one of the bad crowd?

41
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,892
No record, no drugs

42
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:28,491
So why would someone
want to kill a high school kid,

43
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,057
no record, no drugs, nothing?

44
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:34,936
And why would a high school kid, no record,
no drug problems wanna kill himself?

45
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:14,043
So yesterday, I look over
and I see a telephone message for Miller

46
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:18,236
Today, gone
Whisked away

47
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,746
It's crazy

48
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,198
'Cause of the content

49
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:26,383
It says 'Veronica,
about Wednesday night'

50
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,933
Veronica?

51
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:32,085
Wednesday night is the only night
Miller can't work, strict rule

52
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,445
I don't know, man

53
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,545
I wanna know

54
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,857
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

55
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,825
All right, what do you got?

56
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:43,174
Well the day he died Trevor Dawson
was in afterschool detention

57
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:45,347
at Westmorland High from 3 to 6

58
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:48,130
Autopsy puts his death just before 6

59
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,721
What did the other kids in detention say?

60
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,762
Dawn Hill, Borris Lidvac,
Raquel Montero,

61
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,523
all of them said Trevor slipped out
just before detention's over

62
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:58,446
A few minutes later they're leavin',
he's dead in the parking lot

63
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,062
Worth throwin' into them again,

64
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:03,079
they're not teenagers anymore,
could be more forthcoming

65
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,582
Was there a teacher
watching this detention?

66
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:08,051
Mr Ade Monte
Died in a car wreck, 2002

67
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:10,910
Back in '94 he tells the kids
he's steppin' out a couple minutes,

68
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,971
falls asleep in the teacher's lounge instead

69
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,997
Anything helpful on
the school security tape?

70
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:18,850
Tape runs out before
Trevor leaves detention

71
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,377
Gives you the chilling glimpse
back into high school, though

72
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:26,221
Pretty much it for the whole tape
Sittin', eyeballin' each other

73
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:28,120
We should visit Trevor's parents,

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,923
let them know we're lookin' into this again,
and be sensitive

75
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,771
Don't wanna get their hopes up for nothin'

76
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,851
You think the murder angle
will het their hopes up?

77
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,610
Well they lose their son either way,

78
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,364
but then being a murder means
maybe it ain't their fault

79
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,670
It's his handwriting, it is

80
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,957
'I am in danger'

81
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,736
Does it mean anything to you,
Mr and Mrs Dawson?

82
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:58,419
I don't know who he could be in danger from
but I do know that it never made sense to me

83
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,134
That Trevor would kill himself

84
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:03,577
He never said anything like that?

85
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,752
Well he didn't say too much
to us anyway around then

86
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:07,902
He was in a phase, yeah
Moody

87
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,885
Lock himself up in his room
But, to go that far,

88
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,862
he would've really had to've been hurtin'

89
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,639
And we would've seen that

90
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,187
What was it like for Trevor at school?
Any enemies? / I don't think so

91
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:26,072
He didn't really have any friends
He didn't fit the popular mold

92
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,844
He was the creative type
That's why

93
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:31,428
- Very sensitive
- Very / How do you mean?

94
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:33,914
You know this Kurt Cobain
from the band Nirvana?

95
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,631
Killed himself Yeah

96
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,726
After he did, Trevore wouldn't leave
his room for a week

97
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,881
A few weeks after that, he died

98
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:45,936
We tried to be caring about
this Cobain thing but

99
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:48,584
Well I myself didn't totally get it

100
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:52,939
Trevor's spray painting has left me
with a major cleaning job on my hands

101
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,195
Not to mention the landscaping
that Trevor set on fire

102
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:59,399
Flech Kinelli kicked my candle over

103
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,565
It wasn't me,
I was making the memorial

104
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:05,616
- What were you thinking?
- Chuck!

105
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,331
Kurt Cobain died, Dad

106
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,920
Is he a friend of yours?
What happened?

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,487
It's one of his rock stars,
killed himself

108
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:14,516
The one who wears
all the layers of clothes

109
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:18,110
Oh, great, that's great

110
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,927
- Why are you acting out?
- I'm not

111
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:23,344
You risked getting expelled for a guy

112
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:26,724
who wears makeup, gets high on drugs
and takes his own life

113
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,218
This is your hero?
Huh?

114
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:31,760
- I mean I know you don't like sports
- Please

115
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,151
If you're using drugs,
let's just deal with it

116
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,773
It's the music, OK?

117
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:43,106
It's his songs,
it's not drugs Mom

118
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:50,784
The first time I ever heard his music
is the first time I felt I wasn't alone

119
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:56,902
You are not alone, Trevor

120
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:04,294
It's on his senior page

121
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:07,387
Kurt Cobain

122
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,617
Trevor Dawson
Falling from heaven
KC 2/20/67-5/4/94

123
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:13,307
- Can we uh, take this?
- Yeah

124
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:17,800
You know I was big on Led Zeppelin
but I never would've offed myself for him

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,939
You see what I mean?

126
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,973
So you never bought that it's
pushing Trevor over the edge?

127
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,259
After he died, our phone bill came back

128
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,366
and there was page after page of him
calling some teen hotline

129
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,277
Crisis hotline kind of thing?

130
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:34,495
That was the one thing that made us think
maybe he was really havin' dark thoughts

131
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:38,531
But it was too late by then, obviously

132
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:45,373
The teen hotline Trevor called
wasn't just for suicidal kids

133
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:47,201
It was for any kind of crisis

134
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,665
So he could've talked about
what he was in danger from?

135
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,921
Possible but they can't
give out transcripts

136
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,760
Protecting caller privacy

137
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,132
I got the call logs from the months
before Trevor's death Look at this

138
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:04,234
- One of the volunteers is names Dawn H
- Like Dawn Hill

139
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:08,024
Is this the same girl who was in detention
with Trevor the day he died?

140
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:12,744
- I bet they're one, the same
- I wonder if that's a coincedence

141
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:15,214
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania

142
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:20,085
Yes
That was me

143
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:23,264
I talked to Trevor Dawson
on the teen hotline Once

144
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,426
You were trained to talk to kids
who were suicidal?

145
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,453
Kids in any kind of crisis

146
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,222
Pretty coincedental ou and Trevor
winding up in detention together

147
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:36,506
- The one time I ever got detention
- Was the day Trevor died / Yeah

148
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:37,899
So you two knew each other?

149
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,301
Not really
Teen hotline was anonymous,

150
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:43,151
first name basis only,
very strict rules about that

151
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:45,667
But you knew he was the same Trevor
that day in detention?

152
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,206
I figured it out  But I don't think
he knew I was the same Dawn

153
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:52,612
Trevor wrote a note that day
Said he was in danger

154
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:55,252
Danger?
Really?

155
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,628
He didn't talk about that?

156
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,364
You mean on the teen hotline?

157
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,047
Not that I should tell you, but no

158
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,885
- What about in detention?
- We didn't talk

159
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:08,666
- Nobody said anything?
- Nothing of substance

160
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:13,128
It wasn't like 'The Breakfast Club'
it was like high school

161
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:21,953
What is that?

162
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:25,536
College book It has like every college
and what you need to get in

163
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:29,138
Can I see it?
What do you need? Money?

164
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:34,674
Grades Activities
Good SAT scores, arts, leadership stuff

165
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,363
SAT scores are racist
Did you know that?

166
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:44,586
I got a 1420 / And I got an 1180
so I guess there goes that theory

167
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:48,246
No way, this place has classes
on Japanese poetry

168
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:52,359
- Then you should apply
- It's 20,000 a year to go there

169
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:55,952
Well maybe if you'd done better on
your SATs you could get a scholarship

170
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,669
- at whatever
- Yeah, whatever

171
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:02,403
You guys, please don't talk
You know the rules

172
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:07,831
I had those loafers when I was in like,
the second grade / Girls

173
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,478
You have a little lipstick,
like all over your face

174
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:14,142
No! Does that mean I'm not pretty?

175
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,545
Does this mean I'm cut
from the dance squad?

176
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,258
Mr Monte, if you had to choose
which one of us could be your kid,

177
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:23,829
- would you choose me or Dawn?
- Mr Lidvac, silence

178
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,643
- He didn't want to hurt your feelings
- Hah

179
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,872
You know what you need, Dawn?

180
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:30,818
To get high

181
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,440
Come over to my place,

182
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,770
I can have my mom call your mom
and say it's OK for you to sleep over

183
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,532
- She'll do it
- Why must you do this every time?

184
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:45,861
I'm going to the teacher's lounge
to get an aspirin While I'm gone,

185
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:52,204
do me a favor and just consider why it is
you insist on being cruel to one another

186
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,579
Because it's high school
and we hate ourselves

187
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,444
Mr Dawson, the corner

188
00:11:57,444 --> 00:12:02,747
You know you're being recorded,
so behave

189
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,489
So, the detention monitor

190
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:14,797
- He made Trevor sit in the corner?
- Yeah

191
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,591
I think so

192
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,024
That's what you said

193
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:21,931
Well, then yes
If I remember correctly

194
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:25,821
Why does that mean something?

195
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,265
Thanks for your time, Dawn

196
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:38,432
The Trevor Dawson on this tape is not sitting
in the corner where Dawn said he was

197
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:41,474
If he moved after ten minutes,
this tape won't show it

198
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,531
- This tape runs for three hours
- Sort of

199
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,849
Take a look

200
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:52,164
See here?
This girl's got her hands folded

201
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:54,778
- What happened there?
- It's a cut

202
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,157
- What do you mean?
- This tape runs on a loop

203
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,463
First ten minutes over and over

204
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:01,363
How'd this get missed in '94?

205
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,399
It's good work
Well orchestrated

206
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,198
Well orchestrated meaning
they sit still on purpose?

207
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,930
That's why the tape works

208
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,671
So the kids were in on faking the tape

209
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,195
Which means they were all in
on faking their alibi

210
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:16,412
The loop tape makes it look like they were
all sitting in detention, quietly studying

211
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:20,267
Not pushing Trevor Dawson off the roof

212
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:29,472
Looks like those kids in detention cooperated
to make the fake the security tape

213
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:32,656
Conspiracy to keep anyone from seeing
the hours before Trevor Dawson died

214
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,828
Why would those kids wanna kill Trevor?

215
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,758
Well kids in detention are
usually troubled types

216
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,627
Who knows what's brewin'
in the hormone addled brain

217
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:42,630
Take a look at their files

218
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,716
One of them has a record

219
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:46,426
Borris Lidvac

220
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,801
Assortmnt of drug related charges

221
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,262
Plus 9 months for DVD piracy

222
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:56,260
The kid's got technical know-how,
let's see if he'll own up to makin' this tape

223
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,375
Hey, Vi
Hi

224
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:04,548
I know, I know, I'm sorry
How'd it go?

225
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:08,752
Borris Lidvac?

226
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,240
Philly PD

227
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,091
She's gonna be all over
the manager about this

228
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,581
Your boss know you got
a record, Borris?

229
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,251
Yeah Must disclose

230
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,411
Here at the Dunkin glaze
we don't discriminate

231
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,400
What about a murder charge?

232
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,946
- That something that'll get you fired?
- I'm guessin

233
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,518
Then maybe you feel like tellin'
us the truth about Trevor Dawson?

234
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,907
Kid did himself, didn't he?
Jumped off the roof

235
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,550
Oh, we got another idea
We think you,

236
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,272
Raquel Montero and Dawn Hill used
detention as an alibi so you could off Trevor

237
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:43,148
Whoa, I encourage you to
not let your imagination spin out of control

238
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,237
I knew the kid from detention

239
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,855
Didn't have some murderous
relationship with him

240
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,159
You were the only one in that room

241
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,075
who knew how to mess around
with electronics, make that tape

242
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,417
The reason that keeps
popping in our head

243
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:57,172
is you didn't want anyone to know
you were throwin' Trevor off the roof

244
00:14:57,172 --> 00:15:01,576
- I made the tape to cover my ass
- For what?

245
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:06,940
Trevor and I snuck out of detention to pilfer
sulphuric acid from the chem classroom

246
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,012
Why'd you need sulphuric acid?

247
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,630
I was gonna make extasy

248
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,015
You're a model citizen there, Borris

249
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,956
Well I didn't have a lot of follow
throughs back then,

250
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:21,571
so I never did it, rest assured,
but that's why I made the tape

251
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,733
Why'd the girls go along with it?

252
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,945
Raquel did whatever Trevor did

253
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:29,861
and Dawn didn't really know
what was going on

254
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:40,453
All these labels are like scientific
and I can't read any of them

255
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:44,313
Dawn, do you know the chemical formula
for sulphuric acid? / Can you find it?

256
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:48,228
How are you guys sure Monte is
passed out? / I cannot get caught

257
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,616
Relax, Hill

258
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,653
Look at this

259
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,896
Yes, dude, take that

260
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,103
Are you out of your mind?

261
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:03,063
- Uh, yeah cause I need a ciggy
- Put it out

262
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,862
You're gonna get us caught

263
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,700
Keep it down, Montero

264
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,931
You know what they're sayin'
about your hero, Trev?

265
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,207
What?

266
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:23,629
That Courtney did it to him
because he wanted a divorce

267
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,213
She's crazy

268
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,507
I love her She's like '
You're never leaving me'

269
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:30,681
I'm just really freaked out about
what we're doing I know it's scary

270
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,961
Like if you just like moved
on from me or what?

271
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,471
There's nothing to move on from

272
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:40,438
You are such a liar
Seriously!

273
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:44,143
I held you in my arms and
we listened to Kurt and you, you cried

274
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,616
That's the day he died, Raquel

275
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:50,484
I can't believe I ever told you to hang on
like I cared if you lived or died

276
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:53,561
I take it back

277
00:16:56,537 --> 00:17:00,119
You're a crazy bitch

278
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,084
Raquel Montero was a crazy bitch

279
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,585
She got a thing for Trevor?

280
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,084
Thought she was the Courtney to his Kurt

281
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,656
Where'd you all go
after the science room?

282
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,731
We went our seperate ways
a little before 6

283
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,696
when we knew Monte'd
come back and check on us

284
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,503
How'd you know he'd do that?

285
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,826
That was his detention routine

286
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:21,824
Excuse himself, booze up,
snooze, wake up at 6

287
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,335
Where'd Trevor go?

288
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,656
I left campus to stow the pilfered
materials away in my house

289
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,922
When I came back to detention,
Trevor was already dead

290
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,068
Do you think he could've been with Raquel
while you were at home?

291
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,459
She was pretty good at being
where he was, any given time

292
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:39,721
You know what they say about Courtney

293
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,368
Hello, there

294
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,531
Are you two from the neighborhood?

295
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:51,014
Raquel Montero?

296
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,660
You remember a kid named Trevor Dawson?

297
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,381
I'm in the middle of work here

298
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:59,570
And we're in the middle
of a murder investigation

299
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:06,060
I thought Trevor committed suicide

300
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,777
We know about the tape, Raquel

301
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,943
We know you ??? stay
in detention that day

302
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:14,919
which means you have no alibi
for when Trevor died

303
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,878
Nothing like cops yelling at you
to make you feel 16 again

304
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,090
The way we hear it you were
obsessed with Trevor

305
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,289
Thought you were
the 'Courtney to his Kurt'

306
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:25,711
Who told you that?

307
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,453
It was Borris Lidvac, wasn't it?

308
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:30,011
I can feel it pretty bad at that age

309
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,015
Gettin' rejected by a boy you like

310
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:35,046
And when the boy you like would rather
kill himself than kiss you?

311
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,483
That feels bad, too

312
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,925
So what did you do?

313
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,286
Wrote in my journal and cried
I never pushed anybody

314
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,738
So you weren't afraid of
Trevor moving on then?

315
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:45,175
Afraid for him

316
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:47,686
Afraid of that bitch Dawn Hill
pulverizing his heart

317
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,187
Dawn Hill?

318
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:53,817
Dawn Hill was Trevor's
secret girlfriend in 1994

319
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:59,436
Oh, yes, you heard me
Secret

320
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,621
- Hey, don't be so loud!
- Yeah

321
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:04,860
You're gonna wake up Monte

322
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,301
and then we're all gonna have detention
until we're like dead

323
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:12,312
- Think he bothers ???
- Definitely

324
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:17,613
Principal Wallas made me take down Kurt
so I put this up instead

325
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:20,167
- See how beautiful you are?
- Oh, my God

326
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,694
Take that down
People will see it

327
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,018
- Why does that matter?
- You know why

328
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:26,814
I can't remember

329
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,861
It has to be just us

330
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,823
Hello?
Yeah I know, too

331
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,247
And you won't tell

332
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,448
I'm blocking all of this out, believe me

333
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:38,167
I don't wanna live a lie anymore

334
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:42,801
Being with you is the most real thing
I've ever felt and I'm psyched about it

335
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:45,498
What's between you and me is a secret

336
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,926
Drama~

337
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:50,895
Yes!

338
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,704
I told you Reith Tyson had a gun

339
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:54,998
Yes, you did

340
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:58,097
My Dad's got a gun but it's like,
old from Spain

341
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,238
I'm taking it

342
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,340
What?

343
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,178
What's between you and me
is a secret / Dawn I

344
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:09,578
And it needs to stay that way
or we're dead

345
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:12,606
You're dead

346
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:24,611
Why would Dawn want a gun?

347
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:27,547
I don't know
But girlfriend was worked up

348
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:30,410
None of Dawn's friends knew
she and Trevor were together?

349
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,183
No That was her whole thing,
reputation, reputation, reputation

350
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,668
You think she would kill
to protect her reputation?

351
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,346
It's what you live and
die by in high school

352
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,619
Excuse me, please

353
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,809
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hi, uh, yeah

354
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,598
Trevor was pushed, not shot

355
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:53,221
Holding a gun on a guy is
one way to get him off the roof

356
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,558
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania

357
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,103
It's one thing when a 17 year old
keeps her boyfriend a secret from her friends,

358
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:03,994
but a 30 year old keepin' it
from the cops? / I'm 28

359
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,561
Oh, you're too old to not know
what you're dealing with Dawn

360
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,726
Lying to the police in
a murder investigation

361
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,905
- You push him, Dawn?
- No

362
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,353
Maybe it just was an impulse

363
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,976
Kid pissin' you off,  thought the world's
gonna know about you two,

364
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,191
maybe you're just worried it gets out

365
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:20,699
Don't talk about it like that, alright?

366
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:24,565
Like what? / Like it didn't mean
anything when it meant everything

367
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,981
What was a girl like you
doin' with a gun?

368
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,406
I never used that gun

369
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:30,096
Not even when to protect your reputation?

370
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:34,258
I didn't care about my reputation,
I wasn't ashamed of Trevor

371
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:37,328
I loved him, he's the one that
thought I should have a gun

372
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,323
OK, Dawn, why is that?

373
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:44,071
I told him something
that put him in danger

374
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:47,367
I didn't mean to but
I had to tell somebody

375
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,216
What?

376
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:53,385
What was happening to me

377
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:57,007
Tell us

378
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:03,802
We met on the teen hotline in March

379
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:11,077
We talked once and then everyday after that
he'd call at the same time and I'd answer

380
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:13,823
I miss his voice

381
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:17,192
I listened to it

382
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:20,330
You're right He had a great voice

383
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,984
You know that song,
'Jesus Don't Want Me For A Sun Beam'?

384
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:26,961
It's kind of what it's like

385
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:29,554
That's how you feel?
Tell me

386
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,907
It's like about how like

387
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:36,540
like even God wouldn't want
you in heaven, you know

388
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,049
- Like nobody thinks anything of you
- I do

389
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,872
You don't know me though

390
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:49,174
Believe me,
you wouldn't

391
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:53,262
In English class, freshman year,

392
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,448
Miss Kapechi read some of these poems
that were supposed to be anonymous,

393
00:22:56,448 --> 00:23:01,188
about walking in the parking lot
and running your hands along the fence,

394
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:07,464
your fingers going numb and just wishing
that the rest of you would go numb, too

395
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:10,804
I knew it was yours because
I saw the drawings in the margins

396
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:14,272
and that's what you drew
all over your desk

397
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,416
When you sat behind me

398
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,795
Dawn Hill?

399
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:22,894
- You're Dawn Hill from my high school?
- Yeah

400
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:25,762
And I think you're a really
great artist and writer, Trevor

401
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:29,006
and I thought you could
even go to art college

402
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:32,897
God I'm hangin' up

403
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:34,219
Please, don't

404
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:37,077
You of all people, I mean you're like

405
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:38,703
You don't understand

406
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:42,533
You think I'm different from you
But I'm not

407
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,956
- I think those things, too
- No

408
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:49,278
About not being able to
go on another day

409
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,004
But you're Dawn Hill

410
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,872
You're gonna have some perfect life

411
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,496
Will you please just listen to me

412
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:58,284
and don't hate me for
what I'm telling you

413
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:01,790
Yeah

414
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,124
I'm scared To go home

415
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:14,315
I'm scared because my step-father
is someone who

416
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,848
I don't know what's wrong with him

417
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:20,119
What, Dawn?

418
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,278
I'm afraid I'll never be able to say

419
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,966
'I love you' to anybody

420
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:33,409
Because that's what he says to me

421
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:39,296
And he smells horrible

422
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:43,278
Like, so drunk

423
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,578
and when my Mom washes
my night gown she goes,

424
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:51,513
'Have you been drinking?'

425
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:56,800
And I just want to say to her

426
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,305
'It's your husband

427
00:25:01,305 --> 00:25:05,436
He's been in my bed'

428
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,198
Dawn

429
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:11,420
Yeah

430
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,170
Do you hate me?

431
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:21,102
No I wanna see you In person

432
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:27,183
That's why you had the gun
Your step-dad

433
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:29,274
But I couldn't even bring it
into the house

434
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,731
Did your father know about Trevor?

435
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,677
My step-dad didn't want me
to have boys in my life,

436
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:37,116
he was very possessive

437
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:38,662
So they never met?

438
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,638
I hope not

439
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:42,637
Trevor talked about it sometimes

440
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,994
What do you mean?

441
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:47,062
He thought he could reason
with my step-father

442
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:50,615
A sweet naive kid sitting down
with a monster

443
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,936
I thought I'd made him happy

444
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:57,513
Give him a reason to live, but

445
00:25:57,513 --> 00:26:00,568
Trevor's parents never knew
about me either

446
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:05,374
They never knew that
somebody loved him

447
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,046
Dawn's step-father is Phillip Hill

448
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,877
Owns half the commercial
real estate in Roxborough

449
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,686
You get anything from DHS?

450
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,191
If he was abusing his step-daughter,

451
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,820
no one who could've helped
her knew about it

452
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,522
Thought I might've had
too much time on my hands,

453
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:23,860
flippin' through this thing but
look at this

454
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,508
'Falling from heaven'
What's that?

455
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:30,921
Not sure
But check this out

456
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,547
Raquel's page, senior message

457
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:37,552
'But beautiful we three are'
Gibberish

458
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,566
Now look at Borris Lidvac's page

459
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:41,571
'Goodbye forever bloody'

460
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,626
Put it all together starting
with Borris, you got

461
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,928
Goodbye forever/
bloody but beautiful/

462
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:48,626
we three are/
falling from heaven

463
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:50,732
The three of them Falling

464
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:53,297
Bloody but beautiful
Talkin' about death

465
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:55,168
These three?
It's suicide

466
00:26:55,168 --> 00:27:01,375
They're predicting it
We three are falling from heaven

467
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,842
- It's a pact
- Trevor, Borris, Raquel

468
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:08,605
Trevor's the only one
who took the plunge

469
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:12,142
You three all go up on the roof,
let Trevor jump and then call psych?

470
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:13,839
I wasn't there, man

471
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,324
What'd you have that made you want in
on the suicide pact?

472
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,612
I was depressed

473
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:21,795
What?
You don't remember high school?

474
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,785
Talk to me about the pact, Borris

475
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:25,585
Why'd you put it in the yearbook?

476
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:28,214
- So we wouldn't back out
- Didn't work though

477
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,930
I didn't have the stones

478
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,576
Kept thinkin' about
my Mom seein' me

479
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:33,849
with my eyes glazed over
and my head cracked open

480
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,745
I got caught up

481
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:38,840
Suicide, it seemed romantic, I guess

482
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,230
So you backed out of the plan
And Trevor didn't / Not exactly

483
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,963
That's what happened
Trevor was commited to it, I wasn't

484
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,204
What do you mean, Raquel?

485
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:51,220
I should say first,
I'm not guilty of anything

486
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,990
- Uh-huh
- The suicide pact was in the winter

487
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,077
By the time spring came,
Trevor had met Dawn

488
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:59,745
- And the plan changed
- Keep goin'

489
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,361
The lovebirds made a pact
Brought us in on it

490
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,943
What kind of pact?

491
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:07,125
It wasn't to kill ourselves

492
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,287
It was to kill him

493
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,920
I feel sick

494
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,910
- Me, too
- Yeah, me too

495
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,436
It's OK, baby

496
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,279
He's gonna be gone

497
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,188
After tonight, your step-father's
gonna be gone

498
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,547
What if he grabs the gun?

499
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:34,110
The first thing I do when I go in there,

500
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,183
is point it at his face and tell him
this is what happens

501
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,833
- when you're not worthy of life
- Here, gloves

502
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,593
You guys, you don't have to do this

503
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:47,021
All I have is just one more year
and if I can just make it to college

504
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,348
Yeah but what if he visits you, Dawn?

505
00:28:49,348 --> 00:28:51,494
And it won't stop

506
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,121
Well, what if something goes wrong?

507
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:54,938
I'll let'em know

508
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:57,091
Just in case something happens to us,

509
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:02,712
if your step-father hurts us
or if we get arrested

510
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:09,402
'This is TD writing from a scary spot

511
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:11,814
I want you to know that I'm in danger

512
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,822
If something happens to me today,

513
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,863
please tell my parents I love them

514
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:18,910
I want my parents to know
that I don't regret what I'm doing

515
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:24,788
It may seem extreme but it's best
for everyone Trevor Dawson'

00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:27,111
You know with my Mom?

517
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:31,698
Yeah I can drink,
I can toke up in front of her,

518
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:36,332
but sometimes I feel like
if I were to put a gun to my head,

519
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,172
and she couldn't care about that either

520
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:42,349
I'm willing to take whatever
consequences there are, Dawn

521
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:45,021
Me too, baby

522
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,389
- Let's do our fingerprints
- You're burning them off?

523
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:50,243
Yeah Maybe we should
just wear gloves, man

524
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:51,643
That's what professionals do

525
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:55,146
You guys, I don't have my inhaler,

526
00:29:55,146 --> 00:30:00,027
you know I seriously can't
even breathe right now

527
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:03,147
What you want me to go to
the crime scene and just pass out?

528
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:05,843
- I can't go
- Stay with Dawn

529
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:08,902
OK I just I mean I really shouldn't go

530
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:15,974
Whatever! It's time
Trevor

531
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:26,567
I love you

532
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:49,161
I faked my asthma attack

533
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:53,908
I didn't like, wanna be
like dead or ???

534
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:55,908
I wanted to live

535
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:59,598
So that was the note everyon thought
was Trevor's suicide note?

536
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,673
It was in case something went
wrong with the plan

537
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:03,598
So you and Dawn stayed back?

538
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:07,208
Borris and Trevor took the gun
and went to kill Dawn's step-dad

539
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:09,835
But Phillip Hill is alive

540
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:13,979
And that was the last time I saw Trevor

541
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:22,641
This kid, Trevor Dawson was pushed
from the roof of his high school

542
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,755
I'm not talkin' to you without my lawyer

543
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:27,987
He was your step-daughter's boyfriend

544
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,110
You got the wrong kid

545
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,462
Dawn didn't do the boyfriend thing

546
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:34,505
Focused on academics

547
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:37,954
Oh, I'm sure that's why
she didn't do the boyfriend thing

548
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:39,625
I don't know what you mean

549
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,450
He knew your secret, Phil

550
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,663
What you were doin' to that girl

551
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:45,598
And now I know

552
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:48,642
It'd be a lot harder to pick me off

553
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:51,428
Lawyer

554
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,084
What is this?

555
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,959
Dawn wants to know
what happened that night

556
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,736
What do you know about that?

557
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,459
Those were my friends

558
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:19,320
Come on Dawn Do you have any idea
what those boys did to me?

559
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,996
What they were going to do to me?

560
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:25,174
I gave them the alarm code

561
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:28,034
Trevor was at your house
the night he died, Phillip

562
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:30,180
And you went without a scratch

563
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,570
Never called the cops either

564
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,045
Maybe becayse whatever
Trevor did to you,

565
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:36,267
it wasn't as bad as what you did to him

566
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,662
It was for my family, what I did

567
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,344
How does that work?

568
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:42,872
Not calling the police

569
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:45,118
Because I didn't want it
to get back to my family

570
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,782
Have their hearts broken

571
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:50,300
The lies those punks were
spewing about us

572
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,582
You're a parent man

573
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:55,954
Somebody's dad

574
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,677
You're supposed to love them
and protect them

575
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:03,781
and give a crap if they live or die
or if they're hurting

576
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,672
Your kids didn't ask to me born

577
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:09,730
You did it to them

578
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,897
You brought 'em here
and now you don't care if they fail!

579
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:15,777
You ignore them!

580
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,652
You raped them!

581
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,486
They need you, man

582
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:23,205
You're supposed to care!
And you don't!

583
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:27,062
Stop it man, stop! Stop!
Please!

584
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:28,737
I don't wanna do this

585
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:33,686
Get away from me!
I'm doin' it!

586
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,499
Look, I love your step-daughter
more than anything in the whole world

587
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,863
And that's why I'm taking
here away from you

588
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:41,988
Because that's what you
do for someone you love

589
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:45,965
You pretect them from pain!

590
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:48,672
Can't do this man, it's messed up

591
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:51,470
Let's go

592
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:02,120
Not cool, man

593
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:06,886
That kid was a maniac, Dawn

594
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,477
And you did the right thing

595
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:10,500
And stayed with me

596
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,935
Because we're family

597
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:17,533
You sure you didn't find those kids
at the high school later, Phil?

598
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,691
I was tied up till the housekeeper came

599
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:24,065
Dawn You didn't see the boys
after they came back from your house?

600
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:27,769
Borris He said Trevor had jumped

601
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:31,920
So Borris was the last to see

602
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,598
I want you to know,

603
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:41,066
I don't blame you Dawn for tellin'
those boys what you did

604
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,620
You were young

605
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,799
And you took that away from me

606
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:53,793
Goodbye, Phillip

607
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:03,223
Don't think you can walk out
of here and relax, Phil

608
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:10,385
You'll see me again
I promise

609
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:22,236
- We didn't hurt Phillip Hill
- I don't care about that guy, Borris

610
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,651
We want to know what happened
between you and Trevor

611
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,699
After he didn't let you kill Phillip

612
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:30,568
Even though we backed out
I think it messed with his head

613
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:34,629
- How close we came
- Why do you think that?

614
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,894
He got all quiet

615
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:41,039
Thinkin' about his own parents

616
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,586
Rage he had about them

617
00:35:42,586 --> 00:35:45,573
But that was you

618
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:48,122
You were talking about you

619
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:51,468
I mean you're the one who's mother
wouldn't care if you put a gun to your head

620
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,629
But Trevor was gonna go off with Dawn

621
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,836
I mean he had plans
His parents cared

622
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,529
But you had no one

623
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:01,109
And the only plan you had was a suicide pact
with a kid who was gonna leave you

624
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,935
because he'd found a way to be happy

625
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:07,264
Which I never did, FYI

626
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,760
Trevor said hang in there

627
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,968
You'll find a way

628
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:15,830
But I can't

629
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,075
It should've been me

630
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,247
Who died up there

631
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:23,628
Is that what you thought?

632
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:27,207
That's the truth

633
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,335
It was supposed to be me

634
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,038
Hey, Borris!

635
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,636
Hey, Borris!
Stop, man

636
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:34,858
We gotta go back to the pact

637
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,673
This is so screwed up

638
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,134
We didn't do anything, man

639
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:41,750
We have nothing to run from

640
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,429
I gotta get out

641
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:45,350
I gotta get out of my life

642
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,970
You know what I mean

643
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,024
Yeah, but I'm over that

644
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,248
I don't wanna be like
some screwed up guy

645
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,402
with like death everywhere, you know?

646
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:57,320
I thought you were depressed

647
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,746
I'm gonna go get my car
right now with Dawn

648
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,366
and I wanna hold her
and I wanna talk to her all night

649
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:15,022
And I know you think that's gay
but I just wanna be here

650
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:22,737
You know, I just wanna like,
I don't know Love somebody

651
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:25,639
I want things, man

652
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,406
Like life things

653
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:32,137
If I jumped off this roof right now

654
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:37,238
and I was lying dead down there
with blood all over me

655
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:39,312
Man, I think about my mom

656
00:37:39,312 --> 00:37:41,443
- She wouldn't care
- Don't say that

657
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:45,470
She wouldn't
She hates me

658
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,422
Well then she's a bitch man!
Because you are a good guy!

659
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:54,950
- I'm such a screw up!
- No you're not! You're smart!

660
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,708
- You gotta endure, man
- No

661
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,238
You gotta hang in there

662
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,974
- Nobody wants me around, man
- That's not true man,

663
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:04,590
I know what you're thinking
but it's not the case

664
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,237
Yes It is / No it's not!

665
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:13,361
