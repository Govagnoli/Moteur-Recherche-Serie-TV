00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,370
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,440
September 23,1995

3
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,400
- yo,is that thing on or what?
- Yeah,yeah,dawg,look at that red light.

4
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,020
- See it?
- yet.

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,570
yo,what's up,mamacitas?

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,190
Oh,shwing!

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,830
stop being a reject.
Give me that.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,390
you're about to enter another dimension.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,150
It's a dimension not only of sight and of sound...

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,530
but of tweakers,preps,horny housewives and morons galore.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,730
It's the ninth circle of hell.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,450
The sweaty armpit of suburbia.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,310
You've just crossed over into...

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,340
- the mall.
- The mall.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,390
- Shop till you drop.
- Right on.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,760
eenie,meanie,miney,mo.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,920
Catch a tiger by its toe.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,220
If he hollers,let him go.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,330
Eenie...
meanie...

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,220
miney...

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,210
mo.

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,650
looks like it's homeslice's lucky day.

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,100
Ah,dope.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,150
a regular saturday afternoon in america's town square.

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,140
The city is still reeling  weeks after two teenage gunmen
opened fire at the woodland valley mall,

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,380
killing 15 bystanders before taking their own lives.

27
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,730
The lieutenant still got you in deep freeze,lil?

28
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,250
The man knows how to hold a grudge.

29
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,160
This about that fugitive,what's his face?

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,970
It's joseph,and it's past tense,the fugitive part.

31
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,040
Is that a fact?

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
At least from what I hear.

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,620
I wonder where he's,uh,docking his tugboat these days.

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,710
You got me.

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,030
Okay.
So,scotty,you coming with tonight?

36
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,590
- Why,what's up?
- Nurses.

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Nice.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,850
Oh,milking that newfound bachelorhood,huh?

39
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,940
Every drop.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,210
- Morning,boss.
- Scotty.Nick.

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,150
Boss.

42
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,530
You remember the coulter-hanlon job back in '95?

43
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,320
Two kids opened up with a shotgun and a tec-9 in the mall?

44
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,490
Yeah.
Took forever to process the scene.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,020
The doers offed themselves after taking out,what,uh,15 people?

46
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,900
The contractors renovating the air vents found a video camera.

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,540
And?

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,250
Well,it looks like it was used to film the massacre.

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,280
Yo,what's up,mamacitas?

50
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,210
Oh,shwing!

51
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,280
stop being a reject.
Give me that.

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,930
A real laugh riot,these two.

53
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,780
The survivors say they busted a gut the whole time they were mowing folks down.

54
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,860
Hell of a thing to get on tape.

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,610
Still The only footage that exists.

56
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,660
No working surveillance cameras in that wing of the mall,only at the two exits.

57
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,810
The survivors never mentioned the kids having a video camera.

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,500
A lot of times in shootings like this,people's memories are shaky.

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,370
One witness claims the gunmen were wearing red baseball caps,another swears they were yellow.

60
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,800
Killer kids.
First this then colombine.

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,090
Glad I don't got kids.

62
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,950
I thought I saw something.
Rewind it.

63
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,740
Right there.

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
Did you see his face?

65
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,070
Neal was handing off the video camera.

66
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,430
So what?

67
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,290
Who was he handing it to?

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,970
Everyone.

69
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,190
the third shooter?

"I am the destroyer,"the apocolypse,"the widowmaker."

74
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
I am a rifle,I am a gun.

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,950
"Look down the barrel of my hate,we're going to have some fun."

76
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,150
Words to live by.

77
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,370
Cameron's journal,two days before the shoot-out.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,370
And neal's artwork broadcasting their intentions loud and clear.

79
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,040
According to classmates,everyone knew the game plan.
The boys talked about it 24/7.

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,660
But no one believed them.

81
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,220
Whatever happened to kids punching each other out?

82
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,140
Now they're mowing each other down.

83
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,820
And we still don't know why.

84
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,590
Childhood buddies,uh,juniors at lakefield high
at the time of the killing.

85
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,860
On weekends,neal pushed a broom at the mall.

86
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,510
Cameron was a counter boy at the cinnamon king.

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,170
Well,maybe our third shooter works at the mall,too.

88
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,410
Stashes a video camera after the rampage,gets out of dodge.

89
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,140
Where'd the camera come from?

90
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,890
Running the serial numbers.

91
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,010
According to the boy's computer logs,"the destroyer"
and "the apocolypse" were monikers they used online.

92
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,540
Big fans of the game called  renegade massacre.

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,620
What all young minds should aspire to.

94
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,430
If cameron was "the destroyer" and neal was "the apocolypse,"

95
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,450
who's "the widowmaker"?

96
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,410
- Our third shooter.
- The name doesn't come up in the logs.

97
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,860
Well,let's check with the parents,
could have went to school with him.

98
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,310
Bring in the survivors,too.
See what they remember.

99
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,300
Cameron's folks are still in town.
Neal's family relocated to georgia two years ago.

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,640
If I were them,I'd run for the hills,too.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,870
I knew my kid wasn't the ringleader.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,960
Cameron was always well-behaved.
He was polite.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,580
He was more of a follower,really.

104
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,990
He play a lot of online video games,mr.Coulter?

105
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,460
I tried to get him into sports,but...

106
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,140
he never took to them.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,910
You familiar with a game called  renegade massacre?

108
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,850
It's just a game.

109
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,750
Did neal and cameron ever play online games with other kids?

110
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,140
All the time.
Dayton moore was one.

111
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,170
Dayton moore?
He was one of the survivors.

112
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,090
He used to live down the block--
the three of them were thick as thieves until high school.

113
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,920
He's a real bossy kid.
He bullied cameron and neal all the time.

114
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,810
Right.
Thanks for your time.

115
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,240
You're going to interrogate him,aren't you?

116
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,780
We'll be in touch,mr.Coulter.

117
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,470
It's easier for you to pretend we're monsters,isn't it?

118
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,380
Excuse me?

119
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,060
Just like the newspapers did.
The tv.

120
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,890
What everyone forgets,that day we lost a child,too.

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,550
My wife,her name is jackie.
She's in there.

122
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,050
Please,help,my daughter's in there!

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,320
The survivors are coming out.

124
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
Coming out.

125
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,840
Oh,my god,they're coming out!

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,910
Mommy!

127
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Dayton!

128
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,570
Dayton!

129
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,420
Oh,baby.

130
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,510
There'S...

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
there's more coming out,right?

132
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,570
There's got to be more coming out,right?

133
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,600
Are you the parents of cameron coulter?

134
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,530
Yes,we are.

135
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,510
- You need to come with us.
- Why?

136
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,780
No,we...
we've got to wait here for cameron.

137
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,320
We think your son might have been involved.

138
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,990
What?

139
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,340
No,no,no.
You're-you're mistaken.

140
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,980
My boy's not involved!

141
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,910
Jim,what is goingn?

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,240
Oh,jim.

143
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,350
everyone blamed us.

144
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,600
We were just an ordinary family...

145
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,620
just like your own.

146
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,210
Ordinary families don't have military assault rifles at home.

147
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,800
A man has a right to his hobbies.

148
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm a hunter.

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,080
What kind of animal do you hunt,with a tec-9 semiautomatic?

150
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,430
Ld"could you leave that door open?

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,900
Me and closed rooms don't really mix so well.

152
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,380
Sure.
Detectives rush,miller.

153
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,280
Always looking for the exit,huh?

154
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
11 years later,you'd think I'd be over it.

155
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,200
You grew up with cameron and neal?

156
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,370
In grade school,that's pretty much it.
Why?

157
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,430
You like playing games online,dayton?

158
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,210
No,not really.

159
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,300
The game  renegade massacre?
Ring any bells?

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,500
I don't know.

161
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,340
How about "the widowmaker"?

162
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,940
That was my online id.
I gamed every once in a while,so what?

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,040
- Then why lie?
- Because I stopped playing with those psychos way before...

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,230
- the,the,uh,incident.
- Why?

165
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,200
To them it wasn't just a game,it was...

166
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
it was practice.

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,610
So maybe a closet geek like yourself got caught up,too.

168
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,390
- Took it past role-playing,made it real.
- Look,lady,I was a jock--

169
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,510
pick of the high school litter.
I didn't need a fantasy life.

170
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,240
You did online.

171
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,630
The last thing I needed was to be seen in public with those freaks.

172
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,500
check out butter face.

173
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,520
Everything's hot,"but her face."

174
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,110
*********and what do I get  for my pain?

175
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,900
Bet clearasil's making a killing off of him.

176
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,950
Come on,man,leave the dork alone.

177
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,470
Whatever.

178
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,680
********

179
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,220
got something for you.

180
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,210
- what?
- You missed a fry,dude.

181
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,830
what fry?

182
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
that one.

183
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,940
whoops.

184
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,390
you know,
you are one talented litter getter.

185
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,070
someone should take an uzi to this freaking mall.

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,910
what do you think...

187
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,570
dudes?

188
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,140
when did this happen?

189
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,540
Uh,a few months before they went ballistic.

190
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,500
I was a jerk.

191
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,350
We all were.

192
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,740
Maybe if we hadn't,then,you know,none of this would of happened.

193
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,130
He killed a lot of innocent people.

194
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,780
You're not responsible for that.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,310
Then who is?

196
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,230
they look so normal.

197
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,620
Are thosthe kids who did it?

198
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Yeah.

199
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,080
Some of the victims,too.

200
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,150
Went to the same school.

201
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,720
Could be the third shooter's in here.

202
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
You getting any closer to finding him?

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,640
Most time,the doer's already in the box.

204
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,890
Really?

205
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,690
Yeah.

206
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,830
Really.

207
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,540
Aren't you going to put that away?

208
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,510
- No.
- Why not?

209
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,750
'Cause...

210
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,820
it helps me remember.

211
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,950
Keeping photos of the victims up there.

212
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,040
Remember what?

213
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,330
you must of had my photo up there,too.

214
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,910
No way.

215
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,610
rush.

216
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,910
Been going through the security footage from the mall.

217
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,970
Okay.

218
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,050
- There's something you got to see.
- Be there in a few.

219
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,850
I'll be a couple hours.

220
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,070
Sorry.

221
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,800
You got to do what you got to do.

222
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,880
you might as well get some sleep now.

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,310
Why's that?

224
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,270
'Cause you won't get much later.

225
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,710
Only two ways in or out of this part of the mall.
Security cameras were at each exit.

226
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,290
So,we can see who went in with cameron and neal.

227
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,920
Nope.
Crowd's too thick,couldn't even spot the boys.

228
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,200
What about who came out after the shooting started?

229
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
Take a look.

230
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
3:05,the shooting begins.

231
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Trapping 40 civilians inside that wing.

232
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,200
And our third shooter.

233
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,070
The rampage continues for 15 minutes
and ends when swat shows up right here.

234
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,530
So how'd our third shooter get out?

235
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,930
That's what we were wondering.

236
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,000
Well,maybe our guy offed himself.

237
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,530
Got caught in the cross fire.

238
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,680
Cameron and neal had the only self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

239
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,140
So,if our third shooter isn't one of the dead...

240
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,780
he's posing as one of the survivors.

241
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,200
They're interviewing survivors all morning, no dice.

242
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,220
Still Keep at it,one of them's got to have seen something.

243
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,680
A lot of blacked out memories.
Tough going back.

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,870
The bottom line people don't want to remember.

245
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,310
Hey.

246
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,250
Late night with the nurses?

247
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
Somebody's got to play doctor.

248
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,740
What have you got,nick?

249
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,240
Lead on the video camera,traced it back to
an electronic store at the mall.

250
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,840
Turns out it was stolen a few days before the attack.

251
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,740
Great.

252
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,990
One of our survivors,a kid named davie schulman,
was a stock boy there.

253
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,290
You have a talk with him?

254
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,740
Miller's on it.

255
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,230
Well,meanwhile,let's keep interviewing the rest of them.

256
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,730
Scotty,you got a minute?

257
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,420
Get the door,huh?

258
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,320
Detective renaldi at west,you're familiar right?

259
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,540
Yeah,sure.

260
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,920
He gave me the heads up on a job they been working.

261
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,130
Okay.

262
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,430
A coach at A...
community boxing program,early 80s.

263
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,770
A pedophile.

264
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,930
Is that right.

265
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,830
Your brother's name came up.

266
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,620
What,mike?
What's he got to do with it?

267
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,050
Well,it says here he was in the program when he was 12.

268
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
So what?

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,870
Well,one of the guy's former students is going to testify,
says he should,too.

270
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,750
He's got it wrong.

271
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,660
- Well,you might want to take a look.

272
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,700
Like I said,boss,my brother's got nothing to do with it so--

273
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,970
the guy's still out there by the way,coaching.

274
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,670
Until this thing goes to court.

275
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,100
No harm in looking,right?

276
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,880
I kind of lost my trust in people after that.

277
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,170
I guess that's why I ended up here.

278
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
We're talking to all the survivors davie.

279
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,840
There might have been a third shooter.

280
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,970
Third shooter?

281
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,590
You see anyone else that day?
With cameron and neal.

282
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,950
I barely remember anything.

283
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,610
Flashes,sometimes.
It was so loud.

284
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,840
The gunfire.

285
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,340
I didn't know bullets could do that to people.

286
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,390
It's not like in the movies.

287
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,300
No,it's not.

288
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,860
I don'T...
you really like to talk about it?

289
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,380
The third shooter was using a video camera.

290
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,550
It was stolen from the store you worked at.

291
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,600
Got something to share,davie?

292
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,800
- You think I stole it.
- Did you?

293
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,040
No.

294
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,660
But you know who did.

295
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,990
Davie hey,what's up?
Papi chulo.

296
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,430
Hey.

297
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,940
These are cool video cameras.
Maybe we can make some porn.

298
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,790
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

299
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,300
I got to have one,make a distraction for me,okay?

300
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,400
A distraction,like-like what?

301
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,810
Like,throw up or something.

302
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,290
just kidding,davie.

303
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,050
they should get a room.

304
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,710
He was a jerk to you,T.
Screw him.

305
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,580
Zack's not that bad.

306
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,260
Then why's he act like he doesn't even know you.

307
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
'Cause I'm the hit and run queen.

308
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,650
Quit talking about yourself like that.

309
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,930
Just thought he'd be different,I guess.

310
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,210
What a sucker.

311
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,860
maybe you deserve
someone who treats you better.

312
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,350
someone like...
who?

313
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,320
anyway,I'm out of here.

314
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,150
Uh,what about the video camera?

315
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,890
What about it?
What,you think I'm klepto or something?

316
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,590
See you...
see you later,I guess.

317
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,040
Not if I see you first.

318
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,340
Thank you.

319
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,650
tina was a lost kind of soul.

320
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
She wouldn't of hurt anyone.

321
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,730
You keep in touch?

322
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,280
I dropped out of school after,you know,
we kind of drifted apart.

323
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
Thanks for your time,davie.
If you think of anything else...

324
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,500
here's my card.

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,720
I was a bad girl,desperate for attention.

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,320
Shoplifting was means to an end.

327
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,340
How'd the video camera you stole end up in those boys' hands?

328
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,990
What are you talking about?

329
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,690
Cameron and neal used it to film their shooting spree,tina.

330
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,590
What?
Are you sure?

331
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,010
You knew them,right?

332
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,190
From high school.
Yeah,but...

333
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,140
those guys were seriously damaged goods.

334
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,630
Talked about killing all the time,everyone knew it.

335
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,670
Maybe we should have listened to them,huh?

336
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,650
Tell us what happened to the video camera.

337
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,400
I got busted,okay?

338
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,130
- Security guard took me to mall jail.
- Then what?

339
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,250
He threatened to call my folks but hell
if i was going to let that happen.

340
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,420
quite the little klepto...

341
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,730
ain't we?

342
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,110
so...

343
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,810
what are you going to do about it...
big boy?

344
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,140
What do you think I'm going to do about it...

345
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,100
girlfriend?

346
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm going to call your parents...

347
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,360
that's what.

348
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,860
Yo,barry.

349
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,930
You stay put.

350
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,880
The mall's entire surveillance system.

351
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,880
Lay of the land.

352
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,810
so you can see everything from here.

353
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,980
Half these cameras are for show.

354
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,830
A.K.A. "Dummies."

355
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,430
What about the cameras on the second level?

356
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,370
Yeah,the ones near the escalators.

357
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,360
100% fake-o'S.
Management's a bunch of tight wads.

358
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,660
So you could basically take a machine gun
in this place and nobody'd ever know.

359
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,330
Or care.

360
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,580
Just imagine the look on all their faces.

361
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,880
That'd be something to see.

362
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,180
All those happy little folks.

363
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,760
Not so happy no more.

364
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,300
Why was he showing them the mall security system?

365
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,210
'Cause he was a loser or desperate for attention.

366
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,140
What happened to the video camera?

367
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,370
He never ended up calling my parents.
Guess he pocketed it for himself.

368
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,310
Barry lewis?

369
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,240
- Yeah,that's me.
- Philly P.D.

370
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,990
Here about the mall shootout back in '95.

371
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,040
That's not something I spend a lot of time reminiscing on.

372
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,450
Wonder why you never mentioned swiping that video camera.

373
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,410
Video camera?

374
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,450
I love it when they play dumb.

375
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,790
The camera you used to film your little shoot-out.

376
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,040
Whoa.

377
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,670
Hold up there,now.
I was shot,if you don't recall.

378
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,490
Great way to take the stink off,what with your condition and all.

379
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,470
What exactly are you accusing me of?

380
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,420
Being a mall rent-a-cop on a power trip.

381
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,780
Planning a massacre with two whacked-out assassins.

382
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
And filming it.
That about covers it.

383
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,620
Those kids stole that camera off my desk.

384
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,970
How convenient.

385
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,740
Still doesn't explain why you were
showing them the surveillance system.

386
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,810
they gave me respect.

387
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,590
So you gave two sociopaths the keys to the kingdom?

388
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,370
Didn't matter in the end.

389
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,010
Me showing them the system.

390
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,360
What do you mean it didn't matter?

391
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,680
Those kids weren't trying not to be seen.

392
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,140
They wanted to be on camera.

393
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,560
Why would they want that?

394
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Same reason everybody else does.

395
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,970
Fame.

396
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,090
smile for the camera,sucker.

397
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,930
Hey...

398
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,520
hey...

399
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,350
hey...

400
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,680
let him bleed.

401
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,950
Hey.

402
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,770
Hurry.

403
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,540
look at me.

404
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,410
Come on.

405
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,800
No,wake up,wake up.
Look at me.Look.

406
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,460
I ca...
I can't feel nothin'.

407
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,680
Hey,hey,where's your wallet?

408
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,840
What?
Huh?

409
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,190
Your wallet.
You got your wife's picture in here or your kids?

410
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,600
You think about them,'cause you can't die.

411
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,920
I don'T...
I don't got nobody.

412
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,830
- sorry.
- No,no.

413
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,140
Then you got to live.
Okay?

414
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,810
Okay,you got to live.
'Cause if you get out of here,

415
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,040
then maybe you can find somebody,okay?

416
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,330
You just got to live.
okay?

417
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,880
I-I-I did this.

418
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,060
All of it.

419
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,560
It's all my F...
it's all my fault.

420
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,860
I thought I was gonna die.

421
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,310
What that girl said pulled me through.

422
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,070
What did that kid mean,"I did this,all of it"?

423
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,050
you got me.

424
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,000
Could be he's our third shooter.

425
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,700
Makes sense.
'Cause I certainly wasn'T.

426
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,340
- You know,you guys can't keep me in here.
- Oh,we can do whatever we want,dayton--

427
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,990
cowe'"a the police.

428
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,200
Still We know what you did.
You told barry and tina about it.

429
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,230
you know,I don't have to be in here.
I'm leaving.

430
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,440
Sit down.

431
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,960
You're about to enter another dimension.

432
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,550
It is a dimension not only of sight but of sound.

433
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,130
Full of tweakers,preps,
horny housewives and morons galore.

434
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,180
- It is the ninth circle of hell.
- Turn that off.

435
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,020
You played  renegade massacre for hours with those boys.

436
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,110
It was just a stupid video game.

437
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,500
Maybe playtime got boring after a while.
Maybe you needed the real deal.

438
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,250
- Were you in on their plan?
- No!

439
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,060
- Sure about that?
- I'm leaving.

440
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,760
Come here!
Is this...

441
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,610
is this a game to you?

442
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,550
Turn it off.

443
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,430
Please.

444
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,450
please.

445
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,560
I tried to stop them.

446
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,260
I knew it was wrong...

447
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,060
what they were gonna do.

448
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,750
- Cameron and neal.
- No.

449
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,460
Who?

450
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,380
Zack...

451
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,900
and the others.

452
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,880
Your friends?

453
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
What'd they have to do with the shooting?

454
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,510
'Cause of what happened earlier that day.

455
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,380
I tried to stop them.

456
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,080
Maybe if I had...

457
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,640
none of this would have happened.

458
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,760
- what's going on,man?Teddy said...
- shh!

459
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,150
What's up,dudes?

460
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,700
who's your daddy now?

461
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,200
Whoa,hold up there.

462
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,310
- Where do you think you're going to?
- Stop it!

463
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,390
- Leave her alone.
- Shut up,faggot.

464
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,870
No.
Stop it!

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
Stop it!

466
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,130
No!

467
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,780
- Giddyap!
- Stop!

468
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,200
No!
No!

469
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,140
Stop it!
Get off of me!

470
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,200
No!
No!

471
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,400
Stop it!
Get off!

472
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,290
- Tina!
- Davie!

473
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,400
Davie!

474
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,080
Davie!

475
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,100
Davie!

476
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,900
I'll kill all of you!

477
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,370
- I tried to stop them.
- I'm gonna put a bullet into all of your heads.

478
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,120
I tried.

479
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,100
I did.

480
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,580
When did this happen?

481
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,020
An hour before the shooting started.

482
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
A bullet in all their heads.

483
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,700
You wanted them to pay.

484
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,920
Don't blame you.
Someone did that to my girl...

485
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,940
forget about it.

486
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,260
So you reached out to cameron and neal.

487
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,540
Everyone knew their plan,knew they had guns.

488
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,330
And you had all the motive in the world.

489
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,920
- I didn't do anything.
- Now,come on,davie,

490
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,820
these guys mauled the girl you're in love with?

491
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,950
You got to settle the score.

492
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,320
Must have hurt...

493
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,930
being in love with someone...

494
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,520
who didn't love you back.

495
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,050
Yeah,it did.

496
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,940
But maybe if you saved her from the big bad wolves,

497
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,000
- she would?
- I didn't save her.

498
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,090
You tried.

499
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,090
No...

500
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,010
you don't understand.

501
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,120
I would have done anything for tina...

502
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,460
'cause all I ever wanted was for her to like me...

503
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,920
but I let her down when she needed me the most.

504
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,440
tina?
Are you okay?

505
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,180
No,uh,just don't touch me.

506
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,870
Sorry.

507
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,950
I just don't want to be touched right now.

508
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,230
you want a frozen yogurt or something?

509
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,830
we should go to the police.

510
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,300
The police?

511
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,820
They'll arrest zack a-and all of them for--

512
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,650
for what they did to you.

513
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,030
you still like him?

514
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,890
- No,it's not that.
- Then what?

515
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,490
well,I mean,it's just that zack...

516
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,880
he didn't force me,you know?

517
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,490
why are you looking at me like that?

518
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,100
davie?

519
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,680
Maybe...

520
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,440
maybe going to the cops isn't such a good idea.

521
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,100
It isn't?

522
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,130
You said so yourself.

523
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,130
You let him do it.

524
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,440
Kind of like you let everyone...

525
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,360
do it.

526
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,120
so what's the big deal?

527
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,050
tina?

528
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,700
Tina?

529
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,060
I should have stopped her.

530
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,420
- But...
- you didn'T.

531
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,300
I didn't believe anything bad would really happen.

532
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,180
No one did.

533
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,600
the boss and lil just headed over to the mall.

534
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,040
The mall?
Why?

535
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,630
Tina walked in a few minutes ago...

536
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,470
with a gun.

537
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,430
You got the area cleared?

538
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,720
She'll be killed if they go in.

539
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,880
She's armed,lil.
I don't have a choice.

540
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,620
- Let me talk to her.
- No way.

541
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,040
Tina doesn't want to hurt anyone but herself.

542
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,020
If she raises the gun,I'm not holding them back.

543
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,800
All right,let her through.

544
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,960
Heads up,guys.
There's one of our coming in.

545
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,850
I'm going to sit down.

546
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,460
If that's okay with you.

547
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,510
Steady...

548
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,610
I know why you're here,tina.

549
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,810
I know what happened to you.

550
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,410
I haven't set foot in this place for...

551
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,220
for 11 years.

552
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,650
The same music,the same kids,the same heartbreak.

553
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,790
Nothing changes.

554
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,940
No.
It doesn'T.

555
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,420
I should have done this a long time ago.

556
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,620
Like cameron,neal.

557
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,530
So when does it end?

558
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,480
The violence.

559
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,120
I wanted to hurt them like they hurt me.

560
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,050
I have to pay for what I did.

561
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,260
No.

562
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,180
For every gun that's fired,

563
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,770
someone can't be in a closed room

564
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,610
or walk or see their child again.

565
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,790
It's not just you who pays,tina.

566
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,100
It never is.

567
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,670
I know.

568
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,540
Give me the gun.

569
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,000
Give me the gun.

570
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
They were little kids,they were moms and dads

571
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,970
and they never hurt anybody.

572
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,550
And it didn't matter to cameron and neal.
They were human time bombs.

573
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,070
Just waiting to go off.

574
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,640
I lit the fuse.

575
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,340
Want to make a porn film?

576
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,510
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

577
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,970
Girlfriend's seriously tweaked.

578
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,990
Or I could film you...

579
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,090
killing everyone.

580
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,540
You're always talking about it,right?
So do it already.

581
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,560
Okay,let's get out of here.

582
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,130
What,are you scared or something?

583
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,710
What about I kill you first?

584
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,070
Then who's going to make you famous,big boy?

585
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,150
Girl's got a point.

586
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,350
So what's the plan?

587
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,380
Kill 'em all.

588
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,280
Kill everybody.

589
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,650
Get the camera.

590
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,410
did you see his face?

591
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,550
Everybody.

592
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,210
this is it,bro.

593
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,810
Roll credits,dawg.

594
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,710
the end.

595
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,250
please...

596
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,310
wake up.
