00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,655
Keep those arms out of that water, private.
- May 15, 1999 -

3
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:09,400
I do not want to see your elbows touch.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,923
Do you understand?

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,388
Sir, I can't...

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,576
Can't?

7
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,949
Can't is not in your vocabulary.

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,209
Failure is not an option.

9
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:25,159
Failure is not an option, Private Kasher.

10
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,684
Do you understand me?

11
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:27,914
Sir, yes, sir.

12
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:29,736
60 seconds.

13
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:32,505
Go. 59, 58,

14
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,375
57, 56, 55,

15
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,947
54, 53, 52...

16
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,347
Private Kasher?

17
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:45,884
Private Kasher!

18
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,949
Private kasher?

19
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,319
The tenth time you checked that thing.

20
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,076
Oh, she was supposed to call at 9:00.

21
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,271
Elisa.

22
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:29,226
- It's 9:07.
- Well, she's seven minutes late.

23
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,947
That a regular thing?

24
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:34,993
- Elisa calling in?
- No, no. It's a...

25
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,627
Yeah. I mean...

26
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,264
she was doing so good,
and then I don't know.

27
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:41,316
I don't know what's happening.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,096
Where were you?

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,387
Lil, questioned documents kicked
this one over.

30
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,212
- Want us to take a look.
- Cold job?

31
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,690
Doesn't match any live ones.

32
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,321
It was mailed anonymously into homicide.

33
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,020
Letterhead's from the Wilkes
military academy for boys.

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,845
The boot camp boarding school
in Roxborough?

35
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,052
Mm-hmm. State run,
scared straight central.

36
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:05,496
Parents who can't control their
bad boys, dump them there.

37
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,571
- What is it?
- Some kind of list.

38
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,526
"The plan."

39
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,223
"Number one: Ignore."

40
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:12,895
"Number two: Reward."
"Number three: Secret."

41
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,325
"Number four: Test."
"Number five: Escalate."

42
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,170
"Six..."

43
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,876
"Destroy."

44
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:20,664
What the hell.

45
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,038
It could be some kind of shorthand?

46
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,690
Question is, what for?

47
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,155
Mailed into homicide.
What else?

48
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,570
- Documents went over it?
- No fingerprints.

49
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,007
Sender didn't even spit on the seal.

50
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:33,950
"May 15, 1999."

51
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,025
- "Nash."
- Well, maybe Nash is the writer.

52
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,129
Or the victim.

53
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:47,812

00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:14,116
So the doer's feeling the guilt.
Mails it in.

64
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,843
Or some bystander finds it.

65
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,307
Wants to do the right thing.

66
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:18,571
It could be a frame job.

67
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:20,391
Why send it five years after the fact?

68
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,180
The problem is we got no murders

69
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,780
under hundred some years Wilkes
military academy's been around.

70
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,023
No body with a Nash toe tag...

71
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:30,044
It wasn't classified as a homicide.

72
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:34,002
"Accidental death.
Wilkes military academy, may 15, 1999.

73
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,460
Nash cavanaugh. 35 years old."

74
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,602
Hmm... drowning.

75
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,457
Guy was liquored up good.

76
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,513
Blood alcohol content .30.

77
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:46,536
Questioned documents took
a stab at who sent this "plan" in?

78
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,913
Handwriting analysis suggests
a kid wrote it.

79
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,429
Other than that, we got nothing.

80
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:55,821
A night duty sergeant,
James Creighton, found the body.

81
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,803
Maybe we start with him.

82
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:04,066
Cavanaugh's death was
classified as accidental.

83
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,972
We conducted our own investigation.

84
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,476
And now, we're conducting ours.

85
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:12,134
Well, sergeant Creighton was the duty
sergeant on rounds that night.

86
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:14,614
- Tell them what you know, Creighton.
- Sir, yes, sir.

87
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:16,494
I found lieutenant Cavanaugh at 06:00.

88
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:18,758
negative vital signs, no response to CPR.

89
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,817
Creighton was in Iraq.

90
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,275
Earned the bronze star.

91
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:25,589
Ever seen this, colonel?

92
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,614
No.

93
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,980
How about you, sergeant Creighton?

94
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,472
I never seen that, ma'am.

95
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,093
Ignore, reward, secret, test,
escalate, destroy...

96
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:38,234
- that mean anything to you, colonel?
- Nothing at all.

97
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:41,576
Were you aware that Nash
was a drinker, colonel?

98
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,727
It never interfered with his duties here.

99
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,196
The lieutenant was respected.

100
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,759
Knew how to deal with slop.

101
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,724
Slop?

102
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:48,970
The kids who come here.

103
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,775
Drug addicts, hoodlums,
cons in the making.

104
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,839
Nash turned slop into men.

105
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,355
"Can't" is not in your vocabulary!

106
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,877
Failure is not an option, private Kasher.

107
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:01,215
Do you understand me?

108
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,816
60 seconds!

109
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:07,280
59, 58, 57,

110
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,790
56, 55, 54...

111
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,726
Private Kasher?

112
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,806
Private?

113
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,205
Is there a problem here, lieutenant?

114
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,637
No, sir.

115
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,267
Then carry on.

116
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,531
Private Lasalle, get him out of here.

117
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:28,179
Dismissed!

118
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,535
Passed.

119
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,994
But I didn't do , sir.

120
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,744
You never will.

121
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,591
Please, just give me
one more chance, sir, please...

122
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:47,505
I can do it.
I know I can, sir! Please!

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,251
One more chance, sir.

124
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,426
Please, I can do it.

125
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,182
I know I can.

126
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,082
Please, sir.

127
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,424
"From the child, comes forth the soldier."

128
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,113
Cavanaugh made that happen.

129
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,830
By almost drowning a child?

130
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,849
Private Jerry kasher was and
always will be a bad seed.

131
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,003
Not even Cavanaugh could change that.

132
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:18,578
This private Kasher,
he ever make any threats on Nash?

133
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,203
No. But he threatened other cadets.

134
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,680
- How?
- Torching their bunks...

135
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,906
with them in it.

136
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:30,042
Private Kasher's got 30 some hours
to walk off before graduation.

137
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,353
Private Kasher!

138
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,251
- Walk off?
- Tour of punishment.

139
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,940
Front and center!

140
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,896
You need some weaponry 101,
private? / No, sir.

141
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,518
Detective Rush, Valens.
Philadelphia homicide.

142
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,190
These people are here to ask you
some questions.

143
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,092
Answer them.

144
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,496
Gung-ho jarhead.

145
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:58,001
We're here about Nash cavanaugh.

146
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,531
Gung-ho jarhead number two.

147
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,638
We hear you had a beef with him
in swimming class.

148
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,969
Almost drowned you.

149
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,009
Guy just wanted me to be all
that I could be.

150
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,843
- Got you pretty pissed off.
- Just enough to kill him?

151
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,969
That's not how it was.

152
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,190
I just wanted another chance.

153
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:20,638
I can do it, sir.

154
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,258
One minute, sir.

155
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:25,325
I can do it. Look.

156
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,594
Go.

157
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:51,946
Time.

158
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,693
Didn't think you had it in you, buddy.

159
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,396
You proved me wrong.

160
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,580
For that, you get the prize.

161
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,574
What was the prize?

162
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,860
His respect.

163
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,479
Nash was proud of me.

164
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,645
That was important to you.
Him being proud of you?

165
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,919
Only time anyone ever was.

166
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,376
So what changed?

167
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,687
- With what?
- With you.

168
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,023
Nothing.

169
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,636
Nothing changed.

170
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:31,682
My folks, uh, mailed me one way,
parcel post,

171
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:35,124
No return address to this armpit.

172
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,203
I was always trouble.

173
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,389
Kid's gone to the dark side.

174
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,289
But back in the day, it sounds like
he kind of worshipped Nash.

175
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,958
Didn't hate him.

176
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,756
Well, maybe Nash had other enemies?

177
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:51,028
Could be.
Guy was a hard ass.

178
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,035
Got a hold of private Kasher's
medical records.

179
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:54,583
Might shine a different light.

180
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,548
Few months prior to Nash's death,
multiple visits to the infirmary.

181
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:00,177
Kid was throwing up drunk.

182
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:02,715
Drunk? He was 13 years old.

183
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:06,129
Half the academy's students enter the
school with drug and alcohol problems.

184
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,782
The place is on 24/7 lock-down.
No way those kids could get booze.

185
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,942
But an adult could.

186
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,300
And we know who our resident
drinker on campus was.

187
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,656
Nash cavanaugh.

188
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,004
Where'd you get the alcohol, Jerry?

189
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,738
Boozehound Nash,
he ever pass on the love?

190
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:24,771
What do you mean?

191
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:28,136
Where'd you get the booze? / Maybe
you were sipping a nip from the Nash stash?

192
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:30,274
That the real reason you were
trying to get in good with him?

193
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:34,464
He gave it to me!
I never asked for it!

194
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,566
That was the prize.

195
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,679
Didn't mean to scare you, buddy.

196
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,697
Yes, sir.

197
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:55,063
I mean, no, sir.

198
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:58,314
- I'm not scared.
- Of course, you're not.

199
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,260
For what you did today.

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,088
- Your reward.
- Sir?

201
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:05,829
You're a man now.

202
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,086
You made me proud, being
a winner out there.

203
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:09,650
You pass go.

204
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,877
Collect your reward.
Drink up.

205
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,061
Not just anyone gets this reward.

206
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,416
I save it for the winners.

207
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,492
For my special boys like you, Jerry.

208
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:30,767
Thank you.

209
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,331
I mean it. Sir.

210
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,473
Let's keep this our secret, okay, buddy?

211
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,600
Just you and me.

212
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,945
Sir, yes, sir.

213
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,734
Our secret.

214
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:47,143
Your secret?

215
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,458
Ignore... reward...

216
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,325
secret.

217
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,108
It's the plan.

218
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,159
Nash ignored you in the pool.

219
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,010
Rewarded you with the booze.

220
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,465
Made you keep a secret.

221
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,616
What other secrets did he make you keep?

222
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:09,003
Drawing you in,
keeping things quiet...why?

223
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:14,216
What kind of secrets do
a 35 year old man and a boy have?

224
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,458
It wasn't a murderer's plan, was it?

225
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,005
It was a pedophile's... / He deserved
to die for what he did to me!

226
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,557
Sit down!

227
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:26,032
I did it! I killed him!

228
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,385
- You killed him.
- Yeah!

229
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,709
I killed that sick pervert.

230
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,109
- By yourself.
- I did it!

231
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,941
- Did you write the plan?
- Yes!

232
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,751
What'd you do with it?

233
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:44,977
Answer us.
What did you do with the plan?

234
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,089
Ripped it up.

235
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,317
Threw it away.

236
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,299
That a fact.

237
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,545
If Jerry didn't send us the plan,
then who did?

238
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,900
He confessed to the murder, Lil.
We got to call the D.A.

239
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,283
Nah, I don't buy it, boss.

240
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:07,191
The kid was an 80 pound weakling in 1999.

241
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:11,189
No way he drowned a 200 pound
adult male on his own.

242
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:19,284
- Won't change his story.
- At least now we got motive.

243
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,119
Victim was a pedophile with a plan.

244
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,203
For waging physiological warfare
on a 13 year old boy.

245
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,816
Pedophiles are prolific.
Nash would've had other victims.

246
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:29,697
Maybe Jerry had an accomplice.

247
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:32,712
Academy's infirmary records.

248
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:36,669
Colonel gave them up without a warrant.
Real cooperative guy.

249
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:37,838
Elisa? What's wrong?

250
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:41,679
Medical records of 7th graders
in Nash's swim class, 1999,

251
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,040
same year as Jerry.

252
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,021
I check for symptoms of sexual abuse.

253
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,504
All I came up with was this.

254
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:50,574
Private RJ holden, reported by a night
duty sergeant for bed-wetting.

255
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,832
Started when he was
in Nash's swim class.

256
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,749
Bedwetting at age 13?

257
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:57,971
Could've been a symptom of stress,
or sexual abuse.

258
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:01,103
Night duty sergeant reported it,
James Creighton.

259
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:03,884
Well, we'll go back to him,
see if he knows about RJ.

260
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,198
I got to...

261
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,446
I got to go.

262
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:08,999
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

263
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,608
- Uh, hey, I, I'm sorry, boss.
- Just go, Scotty.

264
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,816
How long has Elisa been out
of the hospital?

265
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,295
A month, two.

266
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,213
The six P's,
and don't you ever forget them.

267
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:29,078
"Prior preparation prevents
piss poor performance!"

268
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,687
Grandma's slow, but she's old!

269
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,420
Sergeant Creighton?

270
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,806
Lieutenant Stillman, philadelphia homicide.

271
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,068
- Sir.
- Sergeant.

272
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,881
We're here about cadet RJ holden.

273
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,336
The bedwetting report you filed
when he was 13.

274
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,080
Yes, ma'am. I surely remember that.

275
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,502
Sergeant, what was the nature of RJ's
relationship with Nash cavanaugh?

276
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,783
Relationship, sir?

277
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:53,675
Lieutenant Cavanaugh abused
at least one boy at this school.

278
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,890
Sexually.

279
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,099
Did you know about that, sergeant?

280
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,601
No, ma'am, I did not.

281
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,240
Did you ever talk to RJ
about the bed-wetting problem?

282
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,586
It's not my duty to talk
about the problem, sir.

283
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:07,070
Then what was your duty, sergeant?

284
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,896
To end it.

285
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:12,292
Piss the sheets,
you walk the yard, private.

286
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:16,939
Don't you go all crybaby on me now.
Do I look like your mama, private?

287
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,023
He grabbed me.

288
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,760
What?

289
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,761
- He grabbed me.
- What are you talking about?

290
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:30,058
Lieutenant Cavanaugh...

291
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:36,126
he grabbed my... my thing.

292
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,818
- Are you a faggot?
- Sir?

293
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:42,019
- Are you a faggot?
- No, sir.

294
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,584
I asked you a direct question,
I expect a direct answer, private.

295
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,775
Are you or are you not a faggot?

296
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,610
I am not a faggot, sir.

297
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,520
So we don't have a problem then,
do we, private Holden?

298
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,551
No, sir.

299
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:02,526
Disciplining the plebes was my job.
I did what I thought was best.

300
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,127
Disciplining them?

301
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:07,016
Sergeant, RJ was a 13 year old boy
asking for help.

302
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:10,432
Is that the approach that earned you
the bronze star?

303
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,035
These boys are liars,
cheats and drunks.

304
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:20,519
Slop, sir. Just like I was
when I came here as a boy.

305
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,771
The bronze star, sir?

306
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,064
The academy earned that.

307
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,641
Made me a man.

308
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:32,144
What Nash did to RJ,
did that make him a man, sergeant?

309
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,175
Elisa?

310
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,293
Elisa?

311
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:50,793
El?

312
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,724
The Giant Came Back

313
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,478
Can't say I remember that conversation
with sergeant Creighton.

314
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,408
Sorry, ma'am.

315
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:12,099
You told him that lieutenant
Cavanaugh touched you, RJ.

316
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,327
Like I said, don't recall the convo.

317
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:16,292
What about the bed-wetting?

318
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,626
You recall that, RJ?

319
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:20,564
Now that would be memorable.

320
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,008
Can't say I do, ma'am.

321
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:25,225
- Your file's got the records.
- Then someone made a mistake.

322
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,545
I don't think so.

323
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:30,404
- So blondes think now, ma'am?
- Watch your tone, son.

324
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:32,780
Best defense is a good offense, right, RJ?

325
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,729
Whatever, ma'am.

326
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,484
Take the focus off of you.

327
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:39,444
What Nash did to you.

328
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,399
RJ, we know about Jerry.

329
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,761
Jerry?

330
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,487
And what Nash did to him.

331
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:53,500
- From this.
- "Ignore, reward, secret."

332
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,294
What can you tell us about number four?

333
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:59,731
"Test."
How'd he test you?

334
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,387
You were 13 years old, RJ.

335
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:08,560
What Nash cavanaugh did to you was wrong.

336
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,380
I'll tell...

337
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,394
you.

338
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,722
All right.

339
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,496
Sit down, son.

340
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:29,733
I'm not a fag.

341
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,141
It's all right, RJ.

342
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,912
I'm not a fag.

343
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:37,525
Got to make sure you get in
some extra hours of practice.

344
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:38,503
Yes, sir.

345
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:39,717
Meet's coming up in a week.

346
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,826
And you are going to make the top ten
this time, buddy.

347
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,371
But we have got to keep this on the D.L.

348
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:47,914
We don't want anyone to think
I'm playing favorites here.

349
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:50,984
Sure.
I mean, yes, sir.

350
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,650
Just like the beer, this is our secret.

351
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,108
Just you and me.

352
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,505
You haven't told anyone about that,
have you?

353
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:03,765
No, sir.

354
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,664
Of course you haven't.

355
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,382
Or I would've heard.

356
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:11,541
You passed the test.

357
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,907
Keeping our secrets.

358
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,561
You got an A+, buddy.

359
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:27,506
You didn't think I was going to hurt you,
did you?

360
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,629
Of course you didn't.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,747
Now give me a big smile.

362
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:42,571
Number four: Test.

363
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,460
Make sure they don't run...

364
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,564
and I didn't.

365
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,317
Tell me about number five.

366
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,882
Escalate.

367
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,581
He'd show me porn magazines.

368
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,987
Tell me,

369
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:02,154
"you can touch yourself
if you want. I won't tell."

370
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,666
He used them on other boys, too.

371
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,758
That's how me and...

372
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:10,057
You and Jerry?

373
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,478
- I don't know any Jerry.
- Jerry kasher.

374
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,631
I don't know any Jerry.

375
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:17,826
- You were in the same swim class.
- It was me, okay!

376
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:21,832
I drowned that son of a bitch!
I killed Nash!

377
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,109
And I don't know any Jerry.

378
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,417
RJ says he doesn't know Jerry.

379
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,447
Jerry says he doesn't know RJ.

380
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,393
But both are confessing to the murder.

381
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:39,386
And neither of them seem to know
this plan was sent to us.

382
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,382
A school that size, boss,
these kids had to know each other.

383
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,831
Well enough to talk about sexual abuse?

384
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,638
Kids came from different worlds, Lil.

385
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,870
Popular athlete, loser outcast.
Nothing in common.

386
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,449
Except Nash's swim class.

387
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,812
Hey, handwriting's back.

388
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:58,251
- Neither Jerry or RJ's matched the plan.
- So there was a boy number three?

389
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:01,729
Nash being Nash, no telling
how many boys wanted him dead.

390
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:05,996
Well, maybe this third kid holds the key
how Jerry and RJ are connected.

391
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:09,810
I'll lean on Jerry again.
Short fuse.

392
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,152
Guess who I just had a chat with?

393
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,712
Private RJ holden.

394
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:27,602
He told.

395
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,687
What're you talking about?

396
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:34,346
Number five: Escalate.

397
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:39,260
The magazines Nash used. No wonder
you wanted to kill him. I would, too.

398
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,043
- RJ told you about that?
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:45,244
And that you, Jerry, were the ringleader.

400
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,910
He said you thought up the murder
all on your own...

401
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,913
It was Dominic's idea, not mine!

402
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,350
It was all Dominic!

403
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,855
Sit down.

404
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,678
Sit down.

405
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:04,640
So Dominic wrote the plan, huh?

406
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,291
How'd you guys find each other?

407
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,009
You were just kids, you know.

408
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,116
What happened...

409
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,432
It wasn't your fault.

410
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,513
He...

411
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:28,468
started with the drinks.

412
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,569
That was our secret.

413
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,900
Then came the night swims.

414
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,092
Then the magazines and other things.

415
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:48,600
And by that time, I'd kept so
many secrets I couldn't tell the truth.

416
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,272
Then tell the truth now.

417
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,162
Dominic...

418
00:21:58,002 --> 00:21:59,817
was the only one of us who had guts.

419
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:02,633
How did Dominic find you and RJ?

420
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,914
I...

421
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:09,562
took one of Nash's magazines,

422
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,373
and showed it around.

423
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:16,781
You know, I didn't mean anything by it.
I just...

424
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,660
I wanted the other kids to like me.

425
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:23,362
Her boobs...

426
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:27,981
It's huge!

427
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,166
Like balloons.

428
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,272
Yo, I didn't see miss April yet!

429
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,308
You're ripping her booty, man!

430
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,877
What the hell.

431
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,580
That's when we knew.

432
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:10,458
And that's when you made the plan.

433
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,554
To do to Nash,

434
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:15,115
what he did to us.

435
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,587
Ignore,

436
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,445
reward,

437
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,352
secret,

438
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:23,490
test,

439
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,395
escalate...

440
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,724
destroy.

441
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:38,734
Dominic lasalle.

442
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,524
Also in Nash's swim class.

443
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:45,599
Lil, you take him in interview A.
You two split up Jerry and RJ.

444
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,205
I'm here as Dominic's guardian.

445
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,475
I'd like to observe.

446
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:53,308
John, show the colonel to observation,
please.

447
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:08,413
Not exactly chomping at the bit

448
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,382
to take down another kid,
especially when the guy deserved to die.

449
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:13,840
Amen. / We got our jobs to do, Lil.

450
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,582
Let's go.

451
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,910
Wish I had called in sick today.

452
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:24,098
Yeah, me, too.

453
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,848
Scotty, is she okay?

454
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:31,852
Uh, she's... gone.

455
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:33,836
- What?
- She's not anywhere.

456
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:36,974
Not any of the places she goes
to when she gets... you know, like this.

457
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,330
library, the park, her sister's.
All day, I'm driving. I can't find her.

458
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,232
Scotty, call it in, get some help.

459
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,929
I can't call it in.
They'll make her go back,

460
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,205
and I promised her she'd,
she'd never have to go back. I promised. I...

461
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:49,261
I can't do that to her.

462
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,885
- All right. It's going to be all right.
- Playing stickball on my block.

463
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:57,293
That's the first time I seen her.
14 years old.

464
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,943
Oh, man...

465
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:02,232
just kicking it on a hot summer night.

466
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:09,939
That's the only place Elisa ever felt...
normal, you know?

467
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,312
I got to find her.

468
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:25,449
Are you sure you want my handwriting?

469
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:27,518
Hmm?

470
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:30,492
Don't you want to play bad cop first?

471
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,315
Knock me around some?

472
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:34,810
Write.

473
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:40,678
I confess. I wrote the plan.

474
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:43,015
And you sent it to us.

475
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:43,948
Why?

476
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,934
Boredom.

477
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:50,402
Military environments thrive
on the cultivation of it.

478
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:54,124
Makes warfare that much more of a rush.

479
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,251
- Really?
- You should know.

480
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,703
Dreary police academy drills.

481
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:03,032
Then you get to kill.

482
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:05,275
What a thrill.

483
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:06,702
I wouldn't know.

484
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,433
Maybe you will.

485
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,562
Like you do?

486
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,617
We killed that pervert.

487
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,854
- We?
- Me and my two buddies.

488
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:18,662
What two buddies, Dominic?

489
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,853
Me, myself and I.

490
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:23,269
Your friends are putting the job on you.

491
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,353
Jerry, Dominic.

492
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,830
You want a deal, you better jump in fast.

493
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,057
Your wife still flog the bishop,

494
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,432
or did she stop doing that
a hundred years ago?

495
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,636
My wife's dead.

496
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,294
Nine years ago.

497
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:41,980
Tell me about the plan.

498
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:47,620
Dominic figured it out...

499
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,429
what Nash was doing.

500
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,816
His plan.

501
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:56,603
What he did to you at the pool, Jerry,
he did that to all of us.

502
00:26:56,603 --> 00:26:59,284
It was like his plan all along.

503
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:03,413
- I don't get it.
- Number one: Ignore.

504
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,697
He ignored us in different ways,
made us beg for attention.

505
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:09,688
- Then he rewarded us.
- With the beer.

506
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,562
That was number two in his plan.
He made me keep it a secret.

507
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:13,492
Me, too.

508
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:15,497
'Cause it was number three:

509
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:17,768
Keeping secrets.

510
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:21,241
Then he made real sure
we never told on him.

511
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,397
I didn't. Did you?

512
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:24,254
No.

513
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:25,922
Shh.

514
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,937
Kinda like a test.

515
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,983
Right.
Number four: Test.

516
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,091
Right.

517
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:34,269
Made sure we never told anyone

518
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,957
so he could do other things
and not get caught.

519
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,760
Like show us those magazines.

520
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,475
That was number five.

521
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:43,149
- Escalate.
- What does that escalate mean?

522
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,797
To make things worse.

523
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,098
Then, the final thing... number six...

524
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:50,774
we know what that is.

525
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:53,554
You don't have to say it.

526
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:01,630
Number one: Ignore.

527
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,913
No one show up at swim class tomorrow.

528
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:13,321
We do to him, step by step,
exactly what he did to us.

529
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:17,885
So after you skipped out
on Nash's swim class, what happened?

530
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:19,744
Number two.

531
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:23,645
Whoever he came to first,

532
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:26,190
whoever he picked,

533
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,996
that kid would be the bait.
the reward.

534
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:35,042
I was just holding my breath.

535
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,428
Hoping it wouldn't be me.

536
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,346
Private Lasalle, why weren't you not in class?

537
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,028
I got busy.

538
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,542
Excuse me?

539
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,483
I said I got busy.

540
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:51,502
Wanna see what I got so busy with?

541
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,356
Got it for tonight.

542
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:57,284
For the pool.

543
00:28:57,284 --> 00:29:01,177
Will you bring some beer, sir?

544
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,916
Number two: Reward.

545
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,719
You were it.

546
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,728
RJ and Jerry are talking.

547
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:15,254
Time's a wasting.

548
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:20,398
You're playing your hand badly,
detective Rush.

549
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:27,903
See, in poker, like business or warfare,

550
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:31,062
The optimal strategy is not to have one.

551
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,608
Or, rather, not to show it.

552
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:37,597
You wear yours like a bad dye job.

553
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:43,165
Game's over, Dominic.

554
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,858
You already confessed to the murder.

555
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:48,409
So there's something that happened
that night...

556
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,289
that you don't wanna give up.

557
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,883
I wonder what that is.

558
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:58,813
Number three: Secret.

559
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:01,026
What was the secret?

560
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:04,562
Dominic was gonna get Nash in the pool...

561
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:07,217
like he did to us.

562
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:13,996
Promise to do... things with him.

563
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,924
And then...

564
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:19,441
and then everything went wrong.

565
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:22,352
Ready to get in?

566
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:27,686
Nah.
I'm a little too tired, buddy.

567
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,916
Maybe some other time.

568
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:33,408
But...

569
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,583
but I got a secret.

570
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:41,720
A real good secret... for us... in the pool.

571
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,349
Like I said... maybe some other time.

572
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:51,166
So the plan fell apart.
Nash left.

573
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,887
No. He didn't.

574
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:58,010
You got him back in the pool?

575
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:04,818
How'd you do that?

576
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,597
How'd you do that, RJ?

577
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:11,252
How'd you get Nash into the pool, Jerry?

578
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:14,224
How'd you do it?

579
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:34,219
Dominic, whatever you had to do...

580
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,939
it wasn't your fault.

581
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:43,221
- What you did...
- Number four: Test.

582
00:31:43,414 --> 00:31:45,526
Make sure that he doesn't run.

583
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:47,565
But I can't let the plan fail.

584
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:50,095
So I beg him.

585
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:53,853
"Please," I said.

586
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,983
"Please."

587
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,747
Like I said, some other time.

588
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:01,225
Please?

589
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,342
Please?

590
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:19,241
Only if you smile.

591
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:32,500
Number six: Destroy.

592
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,251
"From the child, comes forth the soldier."

593
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:41,761
That's what he would say
when he was done.

594
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,822
And I would just go away in my mind.

595
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:52,029
Not this time.

596
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,711
Not this time.

597
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:00,468
From the child, comes forth the soldier.

598
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,464
Isn't that right, buddy?

599
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:11,700
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

600
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,777
Don't let your elbows touch the water,
private! 60 seconds! Go!

601
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:18,013
Can't is not in your vocabulary, cadet!

602
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:19,493
Failure is not an option!

603
00:33:19,493 --> 00:33:23,918
You're special, a real winner,
my special boy!

604
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,924
You like this, don't you!

605
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:27,581
Don't pretend you don't like it!

606
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:30,842
Destroy, destroy, destroy!

607
00:33:36,657 --> 00:33:38,418
Somebody's coming.

608
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:48,910
They shouldn't go away for this.

609
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,898
Hmm. They confessed murder one.
What are you gonna do?

610
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,117
Maybe the guy slipped, fell,
and hit his head, boss.

611
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,870
- I could see that.
- Accidental death.

612
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,644
My pen ran out in there,
didn't get that last part.

613
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,904
I think we could all use
a scotch right about now.

614
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:04,329
Anyone hear from Scotty?

615
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:05,312
Not me.

616
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,051
You sent it in, you frigging rat!

617
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:08,817
Hey, knock it off!

618
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,489
You frigging liar!

619
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,993
Gun!

620
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:18,458
- Don't you touch me!
- Dominic!

621
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:20,313
Dominic! Listen to me.

622
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:21,429
Dominic!

623
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,913
- Dominic, put the gun down.
- Don't nobody touch me!

624
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:25,415
Listen to me.

625
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:28,420
Dominic, listen to me.

626
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,179
It's gonna be okay,

627
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,731
I promise you.

628
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,781
I promise you, Dominic.

629
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,083
It's going to be okay.

630
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:40,542
- Put the gun down.
- Listen, I wrote it.

631
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:44,031
The plan, I wrote it!

632
00:34:46,273 --> 00:34:48,120
But I didn't send it.

633
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,563
Put the gun down.

634
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:51,609
Dominic!

635
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:54,305
I didn't send it.

636
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,052
No, Dominic!

637
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:59,295
No!

638
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:08,331
I talked to the hospital.
It's looking bad.

639
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:11,821
But they can't say for sure right now.

640
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,495
If Dominic didn't send the plan...

641
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:17,288
then who did?

642
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,806
It's over, Lil.

643
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,795
Let's go home.

644
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,926
I've been looking for you all day.

645
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,434
Everywhere I'm looking for you.

646
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,284
God, Elisa.

647
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:46,889
I'm sorry.

648
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:48,628
You okay?

649
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:51,297
Hey. Talk to me.

650
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:53,691
They came back, Scotty.

651
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:55,924
The giants.

652
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:56,815
I know what you're thinking,

653
00:35:56,815 --> 00:36:01,397
I know you think that
I didn't take my meds, but I did.

654
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:02,938
And they still came back.

655
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,150
Well, we'll get stronger meds.

656
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,824
We'll talk to the doctor to see whatever
to save. / That's what we did last time.

657
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:11,043
It's what we do all the time,
and it doesn't get better.

658
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,157
Maybe it just doesn't.

659
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,653
I'm gonna go stay at my sister's for a while.

660
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:28,686
- That's what you want to do, do it.
- I don't know what else to do.

661
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,703
Do you?

662
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:38,719
Shirts two, skins zero.

663
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,375
There ain't no skins.

664
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,457
You know? You see that?
I mean, just... just look!

665
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:45,037
I meant before, when we were kids.

666
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:48,853
Let's go, Elisa. / Skins make
a comeback in the last inning.

667
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,824
Do you remember?

668
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:51,685
No.

669
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:57,047
Triple play.
Scored by Scotty valens.

670
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:06,855
I don't remember.

671
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,933
I do.

672
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:15,539
- That was a long time ago.
- Not so long ago, Scotty.

673
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,314
Not so long ago.

674
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:33,319
Dominic's in the ICU.

675
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,093
No word yet.

676
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:39,081
Last thing he said before
he shot himself was...

677
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:41,383
he didn't send the plan.

678
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:42,748
Then who did?

679
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:44,764
Was there someone else in
on this besides the three of you?

680
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:45,877
No, just us.

681
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,010
But someone else knew.

682
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,572
We lost it that night.

683
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:50,748
The plan?

684
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,083
It was in Dominic's pocket.

685
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:55,699
- He stuck everything in his pockets.
- Dumbass.

686
00:37:56,948 --> 00:38:02,923
And then it was gone after... the pool.

687
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:04,843
It was gone.

688
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,723
Where'd it go?

689
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:14,540
What?

690
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,409
- The plan! It was here.
- You put in your pocket?

691
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:20,786
You dumbass! / Shh!

692
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,700
Okay, it's okay.

693
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,213
Listen up, here's what we do.

694
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:28,055
Never tell.

695
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,322
No matter what happens.

696
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:33,513
If we're ever caught,
each man takes the fall.

697
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:35,262
By himself.

698
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,073
Alone.

699
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:39,291
Like a soldier.

700
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:47,829
- Never tell.
- Never tell.

701
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,503
Never tell.

702
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,233
He went back to the pool that night.

703
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:57,397
- Dominic, to look for it.
- Did he find it?

704
00:38:57,397 --> 00:39:00,334
We never talked about it.

705
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,301
Like it never happened.

706
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:07,525
And after a while,
it felt like it never did.

707
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,420
He should have this, not me.

708
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,236
For what he did, what they all did.

709
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:39,986
Took more guts than I ever had.

710
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,391
"From the child comes forth the soldier."

711
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:48,835
That's what Nash always said.

712
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,411
After.

713
00:39:56,817 --> 00:40:00,540
You were a lifer at the academy.

714
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,473
In Nash's swim class, long ago.

715
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:06,329
Not so long ago.

716
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,338
You were the duty sergeant that night.

717
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:13,028
You found Nash's body.

718
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:21,062
And the plan. / The world had to
know what he did to them.

719
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:23,930
- To me.
- That's why you sent it in.

720
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,799
But why now, Creighton?

721
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,074
The last class of Nash's victims.
The last to bear witness.

722
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:34,078
Nash's secret would go away with them.

723
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:38,354
- You couldn't let that happen.
- I didn't let that happen.

724
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:42,477
No, you didn't.

725
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:48,025
Why are you here?

726
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,056
You let these boys go, I'll tell you.

727
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:55,515
Depends on what you have to tell me.

728
00:40:55,515 --> 00:41:00,968
I watch boys.

729
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:03,285
Just like Nash did,
I watch boys,

730
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:09,215
and I know that I'm becoming him.

731
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:12,202
Please put me away.

732
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:14,027
Stop me.
Let them have their lives.

733
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:18,585
Let them become men.

734
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:23,651
- Just let them go.
- How can I?

735
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:27,996
- They killed a man.
- No, they didn't.

736
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:32,432
Somebody's coming!

737
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:41,383
Creighton!

738
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:43,764
Creighton!

"Wise Up"
by Aimee Mann

740
00:43:00,965 --> 00:43:08,894
# It's not what you thought #

741
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:16,000
# When you first began it #

742
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,955
# You got what you want #

743
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:31,469
# You can hardly stand it
thought by now you know #

744
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:38,235
# It's not going to stop #

745
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:46,145
# It's not going to stop #

746
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:58,396
# It's not going to stop 'til you wise up #

747
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:09,559
# You're sure there's a cure #

748
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:16,700
# And you have finally found it #

749
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:24,588
# You think one drink #

750
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:32,006
# Will shrink you til you're
underground and living down #

751
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:39,108
# But it's not going to stop #

752
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:46,606
# It's not going to stop #

753
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:54,519
# It's not going to stop #

754
00:44:54,519 --> 00:45:04,073
# It's not going to stop 'til you wise up #
