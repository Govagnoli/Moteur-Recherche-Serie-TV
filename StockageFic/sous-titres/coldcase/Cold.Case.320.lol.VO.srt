Okay, fellows, you can
use the front door.

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:14,278
And if you need any water or soda,
it's in the kitchen. Help yourselves.

5
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:16,904
Thank you.
Real nice of you, sir.

6
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,371
So these guys are really ex-cons?

7
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,706
Moving company hires them, 
helps them get back on their feet.

8
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,383
Hey, stop that.

9
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:30,541
You're not worried
they'll steal something?

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,207
I think people deserve a second chance.

11
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,944
Like mom?

12
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,507
- That's different.
- Yeah?

13
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:40,382
Let's not do this here, please.

14
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,558
Fine.

15
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:45,486
FYI, that's mine.

16
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,059
Where would you like me to put this?

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,469
Upstairs, first room on the right.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,481
You ready to see your new room, honey?

19
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,792
Come on.

20
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,919
- Beautiful house, sir.
- I think so.

21
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,925
And you?

22
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,483
I want to go home.

23
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:25,720
I'll get the rest of the boxes.

24
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:30,161
I'm doing the best I can here, Kate.

25
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,126
- I miss mom.
- So do I.

26
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,810
Then why'd you put her
in that place again?

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,980
- She's sick again, honey, you know that.
- She's not sick!

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,819
If she doesn't stop drinking this time,
she's gonna kill herself.

29
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,056
I ought to get back down there.

36

AC's dead.

37
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,929
It's not even 9 o'clock
and it feels like it's 90 degrees.

Weatherman says no let up in sight.

00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,417
You feel that?

41

I think it's working.

42
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:58,609
Inmate's been calling all morning for you.

43
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,324
Andre Tibbs.

44
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:02,987
Blast from the past.

45
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,286
Name's familiar.
He on the row?

46
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:09,240
Got lethal injection for
the rape/murder of a kid in '94.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,570
You work that job?

48
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,325
Interrogated him, yeah.

49
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,284
He confess? / No. And if the evidence
hadn't been so airtight,

50
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,871
I would've beat it out of him
for what he did to that girl.

51
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:20,331
Why's he bugging you now?

52
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:24,012
My guess? This.

53
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:27,851
Joey Norman, cop in the 17th.
Thought I knew him, right?

54
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,445
Turns out the guy was dirty.

55
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:31,567
Planting drugs, taking payoffs.

56
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,329
And now the DA's office is worried 
he's screwed up three of their cases.

57
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,474
So the guy blows his brains out last night.

58
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,412
So what's the connect?

59
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,870
Dirty cop, death row inmate...

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,515
Andre Tibbs always claimed he was framed 
by his arresting officer, Joey Norman.

61
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:56,000
Homicide.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,784
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

63
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,787
Andre?

64
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:04,235
- They call me Mr. Tibbs.
- Right.

65
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,057
A regular Sidney Poitier.

66
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,688
Call me to talk about the movies, Andre?

67
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:10,979
I heard about that dirty cop
Norman offing himself.

68
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,271
What'd I tell you?

69
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,194
Got nothing to do with your case.

70
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:18,208
Man arrested me, 
remember? Framed me.

71
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,309
Nabbed that letter from 
from  my back pocket.

72
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:23,311
That letter was never
going to prove you innocent.

73
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:26,155
But it'd prove that cop a liar.

74
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:28,441
Then maybe you'd believe my story.

75
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,672
Tell it to your lawyers.

76
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:33,197
I'm done with them snakes in the grass.

77
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:36,243
- I'm telling it to you.
- Nobody framed you, Andre.

78
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,927
So what if he did?

79
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:41,735
You're not gonna wonder about that?

80
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,266
Why should I?

81
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:46,209
My execution is set.

82
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,726
They're gonna kill me in three days.

Cold Case 
3x20. Death Penalty: Final Appeal

84
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:00,951
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/04/16

85
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,914
Never thought I'd be so happy
to be coming down here.

86
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:11,954
Only cool spot in the whole place.

87
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,212
What do we got?

88
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,128
Kate Lange, 16,
raped and stabbed to death.

89
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,919
Andre Tibbs was the only suspect.

90
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,257
He'd just been released from county.
Did three years for assault.

91
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:24,777
Was working for a moving company
at the girl's house the day of the murder.

92
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:27,857
That night, Kate's father heard
a noise, came downstairs,

93
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:30,334
saw Andre standing over
his daughter's body.

94
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,808
Made a positive I.D.

95
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,940
Officer Norman caught Andre running 
from the scene with blood on his boots.

96
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,852
Blood that matched the victim's.

97
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,981
That's open and closed.

98
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:44,767
What about this letter Andre claims 
this dirty cop took off of him?

99
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:49,205
Some apology to Mr. Lange
for mouthing off during the move.

100
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,982
Internal affairs would have the letter now.

101
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:54,696
They've been through Norman's desk, 
locker, house. / If it exists.

102
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,488
State's killing him in three days.

103
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,935
Don't need anyone wondering
if we got the right guy.

104
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,150
Got to you, huh?

105
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,986
This all a game to you, Andre?
Getting your kicks before you die?

106
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,097
Get them while I can.

107
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,093
And you are?

108
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,352
Detective Miller.

109
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,321
Welcome to the row, baby girl.

110
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:24,817
Don't you baby girl me, Tibbs,
or your black ass goes back to isolation.

111
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:28,491
Got to earn it first, right?

112
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:31,668
You find the letter that cop took?

113
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,738
- If there was a letter.
- There was.

114
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:37,278
Even so, be a long shot
officer Norman held onto it.

115
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,915
Forget the letter.

116
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,375
The blood, the I.D,
that's your problem.

117
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,847
Look, I said a million times

118
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,037
that there was blood on my boots

119
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,861
because I was inside that house.

120
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:50,752
Delivering that apology letter.
Right.

121
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:53,293
I lost my cool earlier that day.

122
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,454
I went back that night,
the door was open.

123
00:06:56,454 --> 00:07:00,192
I go inside,
and that's when I seen her.

124
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,771
And you just up and ran.
Why not help?

125
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:04,938
Look in the mirror, brother.
You would've run, too.

126
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,019
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Neither did I.

127
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,976
Bottom line is,
that girl's father saw you.

128
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:11,668
And I told you again and again
that that man is lying.

129
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:13,192
Why would he do that?

130
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,991
Because I pissed him off that day.

131
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:20,406
Dad, what are we doing for dinner?

132
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,156
I haven't thought about it yet.

133
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,639
Do we have chocolate milk in the fridge?

134
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,912
The fridge isn't plugged in yet, honey.

135
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:30,106
Hey, the vanity and the mirror,
you wanted that in your room, right?

136
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:33,004
Whatever.
It's not even mine.

137
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,552
One of the last things to bring in there.

138
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,152
I'm on it, boss.

139
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,972
16 can be tough, huh?

140
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,597
- You got kids?
- Girl, same age.

141
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,783
Me and my daughter
always been close though.

142
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,976
Sometimes they turn out that way.

143
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,959
Lucky.

144
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,879
Need a break there, Andre?

145
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,117
I'm just, uh,

146
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,656
just getting my grip, boss.

147
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:02,113
He okay?

148
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:06,355
Yeah, he's got his problems.
Drinking.

149
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,538
Hey, let me help.

150
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,395
No, no, I'm good.

151
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:12,901
It's okay. This is valuable.

152
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,921
Belonged to my wife when she was a girl.

153
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,753
Please, let it go.
You're making me look bad now.

154
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:19,266
- Let's just put it down.
- No! Come on!

155
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:23,998
What the hell is wrong with you?

156
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:26,099
I asked you to let it go.
I said I had it.

157
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,950
- Well, you didn't!
- Look, get out of my face.

158
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,557
- You have any idea what you just did?
- I said get out of my face!

159
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:35,629
You're done, Tibbs.

160
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,634
Look, I need this job.

161
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:43,237
Sorry. Clear out.

162
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,765
So you got fired, left...

163
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:58,645
then what?

164
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,590
I started off strong that day,

165
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,436
but by that point,
I needed a drink, bad.

166
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:07,203
So back to my corner stool I went.

167
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,112
Right. Get your courage up, 
start thinking about that little girl. / No.

168
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:14,811
Got my courage up
and wrote up that apology.

169
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,653
Why'd you wait till 1 A.M.
to drop it off?

170
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,873
Because I thought if I could
just make it to last call

171
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:23,237
and not pick up my glass
that I would have a,

172
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:26,532
I'd have a chance at a life.

173
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,931
Time's up, Tibbs. Let's go.

174
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,057
Less than three days left and counting.

175
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,249
Why not go out by telling the truth?

176
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:41,133
Like I said, I already did.

177
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,981
I never believed in the death penalty.

178
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,198
But the minute I walked into
that kitchen and saw my girl?

179
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,857
my thinking changed right there.

180
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:58,699
- And you're sure Andre Tibbs did it?
- Of course I'm sure.

181
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:02,012
'Cause you positively identified him
as the man who killed your daughter.

182
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:03,124
Yes, I did.

183
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:07,424
And you're sure officer Norman
didn't influence that call?

184
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,246
If you're 100% certain he did it,

185
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:15,010
we just need you to tell us that.

186
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:20,860
I was the one who found
Kate's body that night.

187
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,302
Somebody had to pay.

188
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,930
I heard a noise.

189
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:33,933
I came downstairs, I saw my...

190
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,866
Take your time.

191
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,065
Is that him?

192
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,736
From the moving company.
He was here today.

193
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:48,047
And is he the man you saw

194
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,337
in your home tonight?

195
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:52,493
I hired him.
I brought him here.

196
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,705
Mr. Lange.

197
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:59,985
I need you to focus, all right?

198
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:03,202
Is that the man you saw?

199
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,190
I didn't see...

200
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:10,990
I heard something,
footsteps, running.

201
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,974
I found him three blocks from here,

202
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:17,187
running with blood on his boots.

203
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:24,025
He did it.
You know it, I know it.

204
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,119
He's got to pay for that.

205
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:34,330
Let's start over, Mr. Lange.

206
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:38,955
Is that the man you saw tonight?

207
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,115
Yes.

208
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:57,835
My daughter's blood was on his shoes.
It had to be him.

209
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:02,187
But you didn't see Andre
in your house that night?

210
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,847
You never saw him, did you?

211
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,659
No.

212
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,998
I never saw anyone.

213
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,640
What the hell is this all about?

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,570
Don't sit.

215
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,370
Mike Lange changed his story.
I.D. in his daughter's case is no good.

216
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,586
We want access to the evidence
in Norman's case.

217
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,246
I.A. isn't granting it.

218
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:45,312
Tibbs ran through all his appeals.
Case is closed.

219
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,778
If Norman tampered with evidence,
the integrity of the case is...

220
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,848
I prosecuted this.
Busted my ass.

221
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:52,240
You questioning my integrity?

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,945
I.D. is out the window.
That doesn't mean anything to you?

223
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:56,991
This guy stupid or what?

224
00:12:56,991 --> 00:13:02,106
Speculation that another case was tainted 
by officer Norman is just that speculation.

225
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,715
Danner, I know you've already taken hits
on your cases because of Norman.

226
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,469
Search warrant's all we're asking.

227
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,867
Internal affairs will get through 
the inventory on their own time.

228
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,093
That could take 10 years.
Andre Tibbs has got two days.

229
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:15,268
Tough. / So if an innocent man dies 
tomorrow night, you don't care.

230
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:19,308
I've told you our position on this.
Now, please...

231
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:23,099
before I drop-kick
you both out of my office.

232
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,489
You know, I was, I was trying to do 
some good by hiring these ex-cons.

233
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,656
Then this little girl ends up dead.

234
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,904
Worst nightmare, huh?

235
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:40,181
If something like that happened
to my daughter,

236
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,772
I don't know how I'd go on.

237
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,020
She's all I got in this world.

238
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,046
Mr. Nelson, you had trouble with Andre 
that day, over him breaking a mirror?

239
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,107
Yeah, I suppose so.

240
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:51,392
Before he walked off the job,

241
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:56,513
do you remember him threatening
Mike Lange or his daughter? / No.

242
00:13:56,513 --> 00:14:00,451
Notice anything odd, maybe how
Andre was looking at her?

243
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,905
Hey, I'm realistic.

244
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:05,247
You know, some guys'll look
at any girl, young or old,

245
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,940
but my concern was "don't touch."

246
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,359
- And Andre, did he touch?
- No.

247
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,201
You know, I was trying
to keep my business alive.

248
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,601
I didn't think it mattered.

249
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:20,304
Understood. Go on.

250
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:23,669
That day, early on, 
before I fired Andre,

251
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,225
Mr. Lange offered to buy us lunch.

252
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:31,589
So he gave me his car keys, and, uh,

253
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,019
I gave them to Andre.

254
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:36,410
- Here.
- What's this?

255
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,281
That's the keys to Mike's car.

256
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:41,517
He buys, we fly.
Better I stay here.

257
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:42,934
But you're sure he'd want me in his car?

258
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,747
Yeah, go on, hurry up.

259
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:47,084
Make it burgers, okay?

260
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:50,454
Heading out?

261
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,649
- How about getting us some beers?
- Leave him alone, Barbie.

262
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,590
Sorry, girls, can't do that.

263
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,906
- So what's prison like?
- Shut up, you dork. God!

264
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:02,971
I mean 'cause you can totally tell us
if you got shanked and stuff.

265
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,756
Beep, beep, beep.
Paging Mr. Drug dealer.

266
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,302
You're a total freak.

267
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,154
You wanna give me that back
so I can do this food run?

268
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:13,643
- Give it back.
- Not till he answers my question.

269
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,758
So why were you in prison?

270
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:19,220
- Sure you want to know?
- Yeah.

271
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,583
Beat a man almost to death.

272
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,485
- Why?
- Why what?

273
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:28,061
Why do that?

274
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,530
I was drunk, that's why.

275
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,315
Guess that's why no beer run, huh?

276
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,207
Give him his pager, Barbie.

277
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:42,665
You need some help getting food?

278
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:48,591
Andre, you still here?
We're getting hungry! Let's go!

279
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:59,049
Exactly how long were they gone?

280
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:01,134
Well, long enough.

281
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,808
Burger place wasn't that far.

282
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:06,165
So long enough to make 
a set of those keys.

283
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,981
Which could explain why no forced entry.

284
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,776
Andre never got out of the car.

285
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,735
Those keys never left the ignition.

286
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,818
Read this interview
you gave back in '94,

287
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:24,039
and nowhere in here do you mention
driving off for a long lunch with Andre.

288
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,463
I was 16.

289
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:29,255
I wasn't gonna let my parents know
I tried to seduce an ex-con.

290
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,335
So this Andre,
he stop anywhere else?

291
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,314
Like a key place?

292
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,848
Just the burger joint.

293
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:38,561
You two were gone quite awhile.

294
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,620
'Cause I gave him wrong directions.

295
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,574
Wanted to get lost with him.

296
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:46,224
But he didn't go for it.

297
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,835
Got anything else to tell,
now's the time.

298
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:53,575
It was my fault.
What happened to Kate.

299
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:55,759
Why do you say that?

300
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,307
I was always looking for a hookup,
even when there wasn't one.

301
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,852
Need to wrap these boxes a little better.

302
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,036
Oh. Sorry.

303
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,390
This box go up to your room?

304
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,626
Nope. Attic.

305
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,012
You sure about that?

306
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,975
Nice photo.

307
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:31,372
I learned how to use a timer that day.

308
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:35,238
- My mom taught me how.
- Did she?

309
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,122
Are you better?

310
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:41,347
Better?

311
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:43,720
The drinking.

312
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:50,307
Forget it, it's none of my business.
I'm acting like Barbie now.

313
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:54,336
No, everyone's got their own point, 
see, their, their own bottom,

314
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,295
when there's no place lower
you can go but there.

315
00:17:57,295 --> 00:18:01,225
And when you hit that, you die.

316
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:05,263
Or you close your eyes and believe.

317
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,900
Believe what?

318
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,309
There's something bigger out there
than what's eating you alive.

319
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,728
Something better.

320
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:18,249
Is there something better?

321
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,635
It's up to you to find it.

322
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,614
What if you don't?

323
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,737
Andre.

324
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,053
Need your help out here.

325
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,685
You might want to hold onto that.

326
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:37,837
Maybe I will.

327
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:55,319
They had this connection, and I didn't 
want her to just leave it at that.

328
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,368
So what'd you do about it?

329
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,075
I got Andre's number off his pager.

330
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,899
And did you use it?

331
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,711
Not me.

332
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,833
I dared her to page him.

333
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,531
Bugged her all day.

334
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:13,376
- And she finally did.
- Late that night.

335
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:16,586
And he called right back.

336
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:22,153
So Andre called Kate
the night of the murder.

337
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:33,058
You called Kate Lange the night she died.

338
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,955
- What?
- After she paged you.

339
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:39,007
- What are you talking about?
- We got her phone records, Andre.

340
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,602
Shows all the outgoing numbers that night.

341
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:44,480
This one look familiar?
Your pager.

342
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,303
I lost my pager that day 
during the move.

343
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:49,115
- That's the truth.
- Sure you did.

344
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:50,329
I never called that girl.

345
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,387
- I got no reason to believe you.
- It's true.

346
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:55,192
- You had her blood on your boots.
- I found her body.

347
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:58,912
- You raped and killed her.
- I didn't!

348
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:02,836
In the den, earlier that day,
you were alone with Kate. / What?

349
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:06,274
That photo of her mom on the beach?

350
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,759
Finding something bigger,
something better? Want me to go on?

351
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,928
There's some things that ain't 
got nothing to do with this case.

352
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:15,139
If you spent time together,
it's got everything to do with this case.

353
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,894
Look, I say different.

354
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,851
I don't see how talking about
old chitchat's gonna help me.

355
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,114
Maybe it'll lead us to the truth,
lead you to the truth.

356
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:27,798
I'm not gonna tell you I did it
if that's what's going on here.

357
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:30,652
We're way past lies, Andre.

358
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:35,389
Today's the day.
You got seven hours left.

359
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,379
We're not so different, you and me.

360
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,099
You and me are nothing alike.

361
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,838
Two black men from the same neighborhood...

362
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,422
if the ball had bounced
just a little bit different,

363
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:50,517
you could be sitting over here
and me over there.

364
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,154
I never raped and murdered a little girl.

365
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:56,940
Neither did I.

366
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:02,565
You want to spend your last hours 
on earth telling yourself more lies...

367
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,914
be my guest.

368
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,414
Where you going?
Hey, don't walk away from me!

369
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,090
Do not walk away from me!

370
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,271
Mr. Lange.

371
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,714
I was on my way to the prison.

372
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,099
Execution's set for midnight.

373
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,491
- How can we help you?
- Barbie called today.

374
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,180
She's torn up.

375
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,285
She blames herself
for what happened to Kate.

376
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:45,500
But it wasn't her fault.
It wasn't anyone's fault.

377
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,566
- No.
- Except him.

378
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,744
And that's why I'm here. I know 
he's the one who killed my daughter.

379
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,489
Okay.

380
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:57,310
But I want to come clean about everything.

381
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:05,180
He called Kate that night.
On the phone.

382
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,728
- You knew about that?
- It was almost midnight.

383
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,032
I heard the phone ring,
the two of them talking.

384
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,476
Why not tell the police about it?

385
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,032
More evidence against Andre.

386
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,911
I didn't think I needed to.
I figured you had him dead to rights.

387
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:20,555
And because, with no forced entry,
you were worried Kate let him in.

388
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,567
If word had gotten out about that,

389
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,662
people would've said
she brought it on herself.

390
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:27,629
Right.

391
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,006
I have this...

392
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:33,966
dream some nights.

393
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:36,078
I'm back at the old house

394
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:39,837
and Kate and her mom are there,
we all are.

395
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,680
And Kate is smiling.

396
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,562
She's so happy.

397
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,627
And she says to me,

398
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,476
"daddy."

399
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,298
"we're home."

400
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:02,285
Sorry my dad was yelling at you today.

401
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,820
I've got to go.

402
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:12,332
- Who's calling at this hour?
- No one.

403
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:18,152
"Andre"?
The moving man?

404
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,780
What? No. God.

405
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,792
Why are you talking to him, Kate?

406
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:27,503
You wouldn't understand.
Forget it.

407
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:30,125
Try me.

408
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:45,776
I gave her...

409
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:51,653
all the chances I could, your mom.

410
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:58,960
But sometimes, if something breaks
inside a person, it can't be fixed.

411
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:02,309
I know this isn't home, Kate,

412
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,356
but maybe it will be one day.

413
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:10,037
Hey.

414
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,836
The fridge is working now.

415
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:17,179
Got your chocolate milk, too.

416
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,695
I love you, daddy.

417
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,733
Love you, too.

418
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,520
We never had a chance to start over.

419
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,951
- That night wasn't your fault.
- Yeah.

420
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,692
Well, I better get going.

421
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:57,555
- It's getting close to time.
- Yeah.

422
00:24:58,003 --> 00:25:01,012
You sure you want to be there?

423
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:07,933
I've been lost for 12 years.

424
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:13,067
Maybe this will bring some peace.

425
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:33,238
Wasn't sure you'd come back.

426
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:37,806
Been better if you'd asked
for a spiritual advisor or a priest.

427
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:41,301
Priest can't help me now, 
you can.

428
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,865
How am I going to do that?

429
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:44,994
I'd have to believe you're innocent.
I don't.

430
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:46,622
But you did.

431
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,741
Somewhere along the way.

432
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:51,694
So maybe you will again.

433
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:59,460
You know nothing's changed.
Your execution is going ahead as scheduled.

434
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,847
I've been informed.

435
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,559
Heat's about to break.

436
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,288
You can feel it.

437
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:15,288
Every since I ripped up my knee
playing summer league,

438
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:18,946
I could always tell
when the rain's coming.

439
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,097
Basketball.

440
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:25,392
Ninth grade and it was all over.

441
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:27,864
I wasn't going pro or nothing.

442
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:31,636
But one college was looking at me.

443
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:34,088
Pretty sure I could have got that.

444
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:38,208
Tore up my knee playing linebacker.

445
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,878
Yeah?

446
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:45,198
Never got the benefit of predicting
the weather, though. Just the pain.

447
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:52,617
I saw a man die once.

448
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:56,225
In this place, years ago.

449
00:26:56,225 --> 00:27:01,553
He lived a life full of lies.
So many lies, he couldn't see through.

450
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:06,142
But in here, 
in those last moments,

451
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:11,072
you could see in his eyes
he was ready to tell.

452
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,600
Tell what?

453
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,253
The truth.

454
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,549
Let's go, Tibbs. It's time.

455
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:45,971
Got a dead man walking here!

456
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,911
Any last words, Tibbs?

457
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:41,690
I'm sorry for you, sir.

458
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:45,040
She was a nice girl.

459
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,293
Maybe this will help you somehow.

460
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,968
Last moment.
Time for truth, like you said.

461
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:08,644
I'll tell it to you,

462
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:13,200
but all it is is what 
I've been saying all along.

463
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,891
Hello?

464
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:49,171
Are you all right over there?

465
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,067
Hello.

466
00:29:52,395 --> 00:29:54,638
Oh, god.

467
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,662
I got to get help.

468
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,420
- Faith...
- What?

469
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:14,831
- Faith.
- Faith?

470
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:17,786
You found faith?

471
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:21,118
Didn't I tell you you would?

472
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:24,460
See, you're not alone, all right?

473
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,005
I'm gonna go get help.

474
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,507
Don't leave me.

475
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:42,346
There's something out there
bigger than what's eating me alive.

476
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:44,622
Something better.

477
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:47,936
And if that little girl found it,

478
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:50,776
I'll find it, too.

479
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:53,898
I gotta believe that.

480
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:58,174
That I'll find some peace.

481
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:07,335
Look into my eyes.
It has been there all along.

482
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:10,443
Truth.

483
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:48,668
Prove me innocent.

484
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:13,948
Will, what are you doing?

485
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:16,075
You know we don't got
a warrant to be here.

486
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:18,500
Andre's letter.

487
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,880
- Son of a bitch.
- I didn't believe him.

488
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,364
You believed the cop.
You should have been able to.

489
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:28,326
Good thing Norman ate his gun
or I'd be feeding it to him right now.

490
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:30,457
What's it say?

491
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:32,098
"Dear, Mr. Lange."

492
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,732
"I've been sitting
in this bar two hours now,"

493
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:38,431
"trying to make sense of the
world on a piece of paper."

494
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,548
"But maybe there's just
this place in the end,"

495
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:46,071
"this drink I'm staring into,
this last stop on the road."

496
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:56,233
"Today I told your girl there's
something bigger out there,"

497
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,860
"something better,
and she's got to find it."

498
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,007
"Make sure she does."

499
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:13,706
"'Cause it's out there,
it's got to be out there."

500
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:16,001
"Don't lose her like I lost my family,"

501
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:18,190
"like my boss fell out with his daughter."

502
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,730
"just up and ran away,
no idea where she went."

503
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:29,804
"She's got to keep looking. Me, too."

504
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:32,914
"'Cause I know, one day,
we'll both find it."

505
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,938
Signed, Andre Tibbs.

506
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:39,429
So Andre's boss's daughter split on him?

507
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:41,129
Got to be Wayne, right?

508
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:45,759
Wayne, who goes around saying
how close he and his kid are?

509
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:48,028
What the hell is this?

510
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,074
You jerk me around for three days,
when you knew this was here?

511
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:53,817
The Lange case is closed.

512
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:58,256
You lie to my face, let a man die.

513
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:00,252
And you're giving me a tone?

514
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:02,714
There is nothing there. Nothing.

515
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:05,269
You're no better than Norman.

516
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:09,817
Kate's killer was executed last night.

517
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:17,313
- Now, do I need to say it any slower?
- No.

518
00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:20,955
That's just right.

519
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:26,593
You're done.

520
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:28,798
You're gonna be back in blues!

521
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:31,999
You're gonna be riding a mount for this!

522
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:38,250
Wayne Nelson's daughter, 
the one he claims he's so close with?

523
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,349
Turns out she booked out 12 years ago.
No contact since.

524
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:43,948
Not my definition of "close."

525
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,889
And guess what her name is? Faith.

526
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,446
And "Faith" is what Kate was saying,
right when she died.

527
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:52,119
Maybe a coincidence.

528
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,276
- We track her down?
- Nah. Lil's talking to her now.

529
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,865
I know this is hard to talk about, Faith.

530
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:02,946
It was 12 years ago.
I'm okay.

531
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:08,418
Your dad's under investigation
for a young girl's death.

532
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:10,807
Okay.

533
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:15,326
And that doesn't surprise you?

534
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,776
Not really.

535
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:22,087
I know there's not too many reasons
a girl would walk out on her dad

536
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,258
and never look back.

537
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:27,862
No.

538
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,814
When did it start?

539
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:33,315
When I was 13.

540
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:36,097
I thought it was normal.

541
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:39,791
How could you know different?

542
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:44,073
By your learning.
Day after graduation, I was gone.

543
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:51,178
Heard from my friends he was calling 
them 20 times a day, frantic to find me.

544
00:35:51,178 --> 00:35:53,505
- Did he?
- No.

545
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:57,787
And then, one day,
he just stops calling.

546
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:59,726
Never heard from him again.

547
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,413
You remember when that was?

548
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,625
Never forgot.

549
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,930
June '94.

550
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,468
That's the same month 
Kate Lange was killed.

551
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,296
You know what your detective
did to me this morning?

552
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:21,715
It's going around.

553
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,899
I want to know how
he's gonna be disciplined.

554
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:26,940
Danner, he watched a man
die last night.

555
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,669
Heat broke.

556
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,931
Andre was right.

557
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:36,017
Got Wayne Nelson's phone records.

558
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:38,652
There was one outgoing call made
the night of Kate's death.

559
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:40,788
To the Lange house.

560
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:44,057
Nelson's here now.

561
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:50,475
Go do the interview.

562
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:56,521
All I'm seeing here is business as usual.

563
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,473
I said I want that detective punished.

564
00:36:58,473 --> 00:36:59,942
Yeah, I heard you.

565
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:05,188
But this is our house,
and I said he's doing the interview.

566
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:10,744
Don't make me drop-kick you out of here.

567
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,019
So you said something about a follow-up?

568
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:24,846
- New developments.
- Like?

569
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:28,794
Like you talking on the phone with Kate 
Lange, the night she was murdered.

570
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:31,986
- What?
- That's what I said.

571
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,956
Saying you didn't hear
Andre's pager, Wayne?

572
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:37,201
The one he left behind.
You didn't make a call?

573
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,054
No, no, no, no.
You're right.

574
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:42,105
- Uh, but she was looking for Andre.
- Good answer.

575
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:45,049
'Cause we checked
with the phone company.

576
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,189
Yeah, in fact, uh...

577
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:52,469
It was funny because, um,
at first, she thought I was Andre.

578
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:54,128
Recall how that went?

579
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,991
Yeah, I called her back,
and she was off and running,

580
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:58,745
saying she wanted to finish our talk.

581
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:02,619
Of course, uh, I stopped her,
and set her straight that it was me.

582
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,180
Sure you didn't
take advantage of the mix-up?

583
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,927
For a guy like you, had to be
an opportunity of a lifetime.

584
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:13,611
- A guy like me?
- We know about Faith,

585
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:16,811
what you were doing to her
all those years.

586
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:20,647
- I don't like what you're implying.
- I don't like it either, Wayne.

587
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:23,019
In fact, it makes me sick.

588
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,572
I know what you are.

589
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:27,769
A degenerate like you gets a chance
to prey on a teenage girl,

590
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,901
and it's only weeks after Faith
walked out forever.

591
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,619
- Don't talk about Faith!
- I'll talk about her all I want.

592
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:36,951
And, by the way, she hates your guts.

593
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,850
So, now, along comes another young girl,

594
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,048
one who reminds you of Faith.

595
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:44,645
You hear her voice on
the other line, late at night...

596
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:47,443
Don't tell me you're not going
over to get your jollies.

597
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:49,550
You were missing your daughter.

598
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,444
Maybe you only meant to 
go talk with this girl.

599
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,736
She wasn't half as sweet as my Faith.

600
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:03,581
'Cause she wasn't beaten down by you.

601
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,600
Probably told you to keep
your dirty hands off her.

602
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,875
Oh, you got a sharp mouth.

603
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:11,900
She talked back to me...

604
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,085
and fought me.

605
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,029
Not like my good Faith at all.

606
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:03,619
Shouldn't be calling ex-cons.

607
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:07,848
You're lucky you got me and, uh...

608
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:10,001
not Andre.

609
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,667
That was you on the phone?

610
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:15,170
You don't call men

611
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,188
in the middle of the night.

612
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:22,858
'Cause you don't know
where a wrong mind can go.

613
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,577
You understand, Faith?

614
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:29,657
What did you call me?

615
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:33,117
- Come here.
- My dad's coming down.

616
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:34,901
Any minute now.

617
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,047
That's enough, Faith.

618
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:41,302
I'm not Faith.
Get outta my house.

619
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:43,363
Don't fight me.

620
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:48,412
- I'm not Faith. I'm not Faith.
- Don't you talk back to me.

621
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,957
You don't want me to hurt you.

622
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:54,893
You're always my nice girl.

623
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:57,064
Don't hurt me.

624
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:52,674
 ¢Ü John Cale's "Hallelujah" ¢Ü

625
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:56,602
 ¢Ü I heard there was a secret chord ¢Ü

626
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:59,774
 ¢Ü that david played
and it pleased the lord ¢Ü

627
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:05,929
 ¢Ü but you don't really care
for music, do you? ¢Ü

628
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:09,968
 ¢Ü It goes like this
the fourth, the fifth ¢Ü

629
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:13,333
 ¢Ü a minor fall, a major lift ¢Ü

630
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:19,369
 ¢Ü the baffled king composing hallelujah ¢Ü

631
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,735
 ¢Ü hallelujah ¢Ü

632

 ¢Ü hallelujah ¢Ü

635
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:40,190
 ¢Ü your faith was strong

636
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,264
 ¢Ü you saw her bathing on the roof ¢Ü

637
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:50,020
 ¢Ü her beauty and the moonlight
overthrew you ¢Ü

638
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,256
 ¢Ü so she tied you to a kitchen chair ¢Ü

639
00:42:53,256 --> 00:42:56,580
 ¢Ü she broke your throne

640

641

 ¢Ü hallelujah ¢Ü

642
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:09,368

 ¢Ü Maybe there is a God above ¢Ü

 ¢Ü but all I've ever learned from love ¢Ü

647

 ¢Ü was how to shoot somebody

 ¢Ü And it's not a cry
