And now live
from Folsom Prison...

4
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:09,646
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash...

5
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:13,676
January 13, 1968

6
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,053
Down! Down!

7
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:45,382
Northern State Penitentiary.

8
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:47,414
They say it's haunted.

9
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:48,447
Haunted?

10
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,878
Heard that's why they closed it
down in the early '70s.

11
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,306
And you believe that?

12
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,227
So, what are we doing here?

13
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,573
Two kids out here playing around.

14
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:00,011
The ground opens up on 'em.

15
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,230
A sinkhole?

16
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,102
Lands 'em right into what we think
is an old escape tunnel.

17
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,791
And the boys find a bag of bones?

18
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,055
And a prison issue uniform.

19
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,237
Prison break...

20
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,869
that's hot.

21
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,570
Any idea who the digger is?

22
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,762
We got his ID patch.

23
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:16,246
Prison number...

24
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:18,386
50126.

25
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:20,589
Boss was on the phone with the 
Department of Corrections.

26
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:21,675
We got a match.

27
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,330
Wonder how he died?

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,793
Tunnel collapsed..

29
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:27,896
suffocated trying to escape.

30
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:30,097
- What's up, boss?
- Scotty, Lil.

31
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,264
So?

32
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,953
Meet Hank Dempsey.

33
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,845
Inmate at Northern State
starting in June, 1965.

34
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:39,035
- So, he's been here awhile.
- Here's the weird part,

35
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:42,568
Corrections has him down
as a murder victim in 1968.

36
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,897
So, there's a box on this job?

37
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:48,665
But Hank was supposedly 
murdered inside the prison walls,

38
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,276
and his body was cremated.

39
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:54,519
So, this guy died twice?

40
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,004
Told you this place is haunted.

The ME says Hank didn't
suffocate in the tunnel.

52
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,106
Skeleton shows blunt
force to the head.

53
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:46,477
We find a murder weapon?

54
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,976
No. But, CSU's doing a
what's-what on the tunnel.

55
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,142
What's the box look like?

56
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,424
A snow job.

57
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,488
Hank Dempsey, 24,

58
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,079
was recovering from an illness
in the infirmary.

59
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,989
That we know.

60
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,640
Then it gets screwy...
supposedly,

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,599
Hank was found murdered
in a hallway outside the infirmary.

62
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,107
Says Correctional Officer
Mike Jaden discovered the body.

63
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:11,188
But Homicide wasn't notified
until 48 hours after the murder.

64
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:12,524
48 hours...

65
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,388
plenty of time to get
your story straight.

66
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,119
And doctor up death records.

67
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,151
Hank's remains were
sent to county morgue

68
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,162
and mistakenly cremated.

69
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,529
So, a cover-up.

70
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,885
But why?

71
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:26,154
We're hoping Bryce Wilbur
can tell us.

72
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:27,694
He was warden at the time.

73
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:29,415
Did a search-- Wilbur's
now running the show

74
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,216
up at Tipley Correctional.

75
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,931
What about family?
Hank have any?

76
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,134
No. But from the interviews,

77
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,771
we got a cell mate,
James Hill.

78
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,848
He's also up at Tipley.

79
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,681
You two head up there.

80
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,721
I'll put Vera and Jeffries
on this guard, Mike Jaden.

81
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:45,602
Yeah, good.

82
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,633
Northern State housed some
bad boys in its day.

83
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,769
What was Hank's story?

84
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,143
Guy was doing 20 years...

85
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:55,267
for stealing a pair of shoes?

86
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,195
Pull.

87
00:04:58,749 --> 00:04:59,885
Shoot.

88
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,494
Come on, Mike.

89
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,272
Your name's on the report.

90
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:05,347
Says you're the officer
that found the body.

91
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,269
Now you know we found the body.

92
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,982
Look, we thought Hank had escaped.

93
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,306
Okay, but a man escapes...

94
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,339
what happened to the chasing
after him part?

95
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,243
We did look for him. 
Six hours.

96
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,317
Six hours? 
That's it?

97
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:23,015
That's when the warden
called off the search.

98
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,196
Wanted us hush-hush.

99
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,280
Story was to be,
Hank was murdered.

100
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,342
And you went along with that,
no questions asked?

101
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,277
Shoot, boy, I was dancing a jig.

102
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:34,843
It was my fault he got loose.

103
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,059
So how's that go down?

104
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:41,456
This was the evening that
Johnny Cash was on the radio,

105
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,632
playing live at Folsom Prison.

106
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:47,462
So, most of the inmates and COs
had gathered in the mess hall.

107
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,849
And?

108
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,582
I had to haul an unruly inmate
back to his cell.

109
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:56,464
On the return trip, I took
up post in the infirmary.

110
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,771
But Hank was still
on the ward then?

111
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,374
And some other sickies.

112
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,826
Figured I could take 
the night off...

113
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:04,059
'cause all of 'em were flat 
on their back.

114
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,083
So, instead of watching Hank,

115
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,942
what, you took a cat nap?

116
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:12,689
Yeah, something like that.

117
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,822
Claudia...

118
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,631
what you doing there?

119
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:22,270
Quiet. Keep
your voice down.

120
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,074
Our boys all right over there?

121
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,142
Everything is fine.

122
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:34,298
Good. 'Cause I got an ache
over here like you wouldn't believe.

123
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:37,024
You're going to wake
everyone up.

124
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,971
Then you'll just have to find
a way to keep me quiet...

125
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:42,129
won't you.

126
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:47,758
And after a few minutes I come out
of the nurse's station

127
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,322
and that bed was empty.

128
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,068
And you never saw him after that?

129
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:55,325
It was like Hank had disappeared.

130
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,912
All right, now, I helped you...

131
00:06:56,912 --> 00:07:00,813
is this thing going to come back
and bite me in the ass or what?

132
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,856
Can you tell us anything else?

133
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,468
How about this.

134
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,981
Since there was never a body,

135
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:10,585
a body was never sent
to the morgue.

136
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,193
Go on.

137
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:18,577
Well, I was there when the warden
signed papers saying there was.

138
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,132
In 1968, I had two problems:

139
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:28,137
One, I was very young,

140
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:32,643
and, two, the prison
was very old...

141
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:36,605
The governor wasn't sure either 
of us were up for the job.

142
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,733
Hank escaped one more time,
and he was closing the place down.

143
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:40,963
One more time?

144
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,262
He'd done it twice before.

145
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,639
In '65 and again in late 1967.

146
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,902
Hmm. But you recaptured him.

147
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,219
First eight,

148
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,357
then another ten years
were added to his sentence.

149
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:58,614
20 years for taking shoes...
that's pretty stiff.

150
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:02,364
He got two for stealing,
18 for running...

151
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:03,706
in any event,

152
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,383
once he'd disappeared
from the infirmary,

153
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:08,561
I had to look at the bigger picture.

154
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,938
So you initiated
a phony murder investigation

155
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:14,127
to cover up what you thought
was a successful escape.

156
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,878
Correct.

157
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:19,723
The problem is, warden,
that make-believe murder
turned out to be a real one.

158
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:23,738
Are you suggesting I had something
to do with Hank's death?

159
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,047
Did you?

160
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,611
Inmate gets killed during an escape,

161
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:30,433
not something I'd need to cover up.

162
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,025
In fact,

163
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:36,134
the first time Hank ran
we should've killed him.

164
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,273
There, on the south wall.

165
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:55,278
Get! Get! Get! 
Get! Get!

166
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,143
Get! Get! Get!

167
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,446
Let's bring him down.

168
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,548
I've been trying to play
the hand I was dealt, warden.

169
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,993
I truly have.

170
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:17,091
Next shot won't be
a warning, Hank.

171
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,545
How's it feel way up there 
on that wall, huh, Hank boy?

172
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:23,576
Lonely.

173
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,731
Screw your head on, son.

174
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,640
You've only been here
a few months.

175
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,289
It gets easier.

176
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,042
In two years you'll walk out of here.

177
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,528
Why jeopardize that?

178
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,222
Two years.

179
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,372
Might as well be a life sentence.

180
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:45,168
Going to be longer if you don't 
climb down from there.

181
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,104
I just...

182
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,953
I got to get back...

183
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,467
Shoot him.

184
00:09:57,489 --> 00:10:00,381
Jaden, you sorry
son of a bitch...

185
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:03,110
Get the dogs out.

186
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,447
As much as I wanted 
to help that boy,

187
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:15,112
had I been doing
the shooting that night,

188
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,817
I wouldn't have missed.

189
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,635
Hank wanted to get back.

190
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:22,376
To where?

191
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,635
Not my concern.

192
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,524
Hunting him down is
what I cared about...

193
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,205
and he got less than a mile.

194
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,315
Okay.

195
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:37,051
Every blue moon some fella
gets it in his head to tunnel out...

196
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:40,672
but I never made Hank for a digger.

197
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,423
How'd he do it?

198
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:45,544
Still trying to figure that out.

199
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:51,053
You do, be obliged you let me know.

200
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,957
You and Hank sharing
a cell three years,

201
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:58,120
you and him must have been close.

202
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,437
Soul brothers.

203
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:06,571
So, did Hank talk much about
how he was going to escape?

204
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,983
No.

205
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:10,747
Nothing. Ever?

206
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:14,915
A man betters his chances
if he keeps such plans to himself.

207
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:19,130
Okay, but why escape at all
with such a light sentence?

208
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,885
That Hank had a mind of his own.

209
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:28,578
Says here you served six years
at Northern State,

210
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,534
and then transferred
here when it closed.

211
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,987
Uh-huh.

212
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:36,729
So that means for 39 years,

213
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,724
Bryce Wilbur's the only warden
you've ever known.

214
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,326
Okay.

215
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:45,001
What's your opinion of him?

216
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,249
Tough, fair.

217
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,055
Doesn't play around.

218
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:56,927
How about a former guard
at Northern State, Mike Jaden?

219
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,509
Pretty girl?

220
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,066
Pretty girl?

221
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,839
That's what we used to call him,

222
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,374
and not just inmates, guards, too.

223
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,136
Hank, finish up.

224
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:29,814
Beat it.

225
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,319
Did you do it?

226
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,863
I think the boys will appreciate this.

227
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,794
Yeah, just like that.

228
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:48,823
Ok, I'm going to unbuckle now.

229
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:50,155
Aha,

230
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,310
there.

231
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,096
Look at my face.
Now say the magic words.

232
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,320
I don't want to.

233
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,568
Come on, you have to.
Otherwise I'm no good.

234
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:00,636
Say it.

235
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,650
Say I'm pretty.

236
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,787
Come on now, say it, say it.

237
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:05,832
You're pretty.

238
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,865
Oh, yeah, that's mighty good.

239
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,975
Now, do the next bit.

240
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:11,627
I'm pretty like what, huh?

241
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:14,070
Say it, pretty like what?

242
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,200
Like a girl.

243
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:20,901
Pretty girl!

244
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,193
Shh.

245
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,977
Hear that?

246
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,913
What?

247
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,528
What the sam hill's
going on in there?

248
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,755
What are you mutts laughing about?

249
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:37,947
Pretty girl!

250
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:42,442
Hank, you son of a bitch.

251
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,864
You boys are goners!

252
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,987
Damn. That'd be a reason
to go after Hank.

253
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:51,706
Yeah, and after
Hank disappeared for good,

254
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,036
pretty girl would walk
on the cell block

255
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,529
cocky, for all to see.

256
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,203
Boasting he'd done the deed?

257
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,638
Not directly.

258
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:04,992
But guys did start calling him
Officer Jaden again.

259
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:08,815
Your bar, huh, Mike?

260
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,074
Bought and paid for.

261
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,653
It's a nice joint.

262
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,759
It's a living.

263
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,605
I'd offer you a drink,

264
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,036
but I used up all my hospitality
on the other two.

265
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:21,861
Use up all your lies, too?

266
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:23,906
How'd I lie?

267
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,098
You didn't tell us about this itchin'
you had for Hank.

268
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,217
How he made you
jackass number one.

269
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:29,543
Punked by all the inmates.

270
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

271
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,952
Hey, that happened to me,
I'd start drinking for a living, too.

272
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:37,312
Yeah, but say I'm a "pretty girl"
who had a score to settle,

273
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:40,691
I might just man-up and see to that first.

274
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,906
I didn't kill Hank Dempsey.

275
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,288
But I did want to settle a score.

276
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,868
So, what'd you do?

277
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:53,185
Planted two boxes
of "Duffy's Hay" in Hank's cell.

278
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,389
"Duffy's Hay"?

279
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,391
Smokes. / How'd having the smokes
hurt Hank?

280
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:02,127
Triple murderer named 
Johnny Harkin controlled the action.

281
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,368
Guy was a half-tweaked
hate machine.

282
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,153
You plant Johnny's smokes
on Hank,

283
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:08,845
then tell Johnny who's got 'em.

284
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,031
Thinking Johnny would kill Hank.

285
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,381
If not him, one of his crew.

286
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,357
So, you think he pulled it off?

287
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:17,585
Now that you tell me
Hank was murdered...

288
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,504
seems possible.

289
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,511
Any idea on where Johnny is today?

290
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:22,876
Yeah.

291
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:23,857
Dead.

292
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,747
Dead.

293
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,040
Dead.

294
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:32,049
Prison grapevine says he was 
killed in a knife fight in Detroit.

295
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,949
Can't say I'm really sorry
about it either.

296
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:43,896
Only way into that tunnel was through
an old air vent, in the library.

297
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,946
Yeah, but Hank was in the infirmary.

298
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,493
The library and infirmary
share a wall.

299
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,317
He go through the ceiling tiles?

300
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,214
Hm-mm. So, Hank crawls
20 feet through the vent,

301
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,555
hits a dead end.

302
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:56,692
What's he do?

303
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,828
Digs. Through three feet of dirt,

304
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,302
which then drops him into

305
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,618
and this is the beauty part

306
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,635
an existing tunnel
from a 1945 12-man escape.

307
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:06,911
Cool.

308
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,454
And that tunnel goes under
Fairmount Avenue,

309
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:12,798
comes out a manhole cover
over on 22nd street.

310
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,493
Hmm, a block from the prison.

311
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,755
These guys in '45 get away?

312
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:19,668
Entire dirty dozen were captured
within an hour.

313
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:22,962
The question is how did Hank know
where that old tunnel was?

314
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,114
Another question,

315
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:25,818
what's in Bucks County?

316
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,245
The second time Hank ran,

317
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,520
he was recaptured
outside the city.

318
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,294
Vera's over there now
getting their police report.

319
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,581
The guard, Jaden, pointed to this
Johnny Harkin?

320
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:36,635
The problem with him as our doer,

321
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:39,225
he was released two weeks
before Hank was killed.

322
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,342
If Johnny's on the outside,

323
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,954
maybe his long arm still 
got things done.

324
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:45,248
Who was his number one henchman?

325
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,760
His old cell mate, Wendall Foyt.

326
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,912
We know what became of Wendall?

327
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:53,166
Hal's auto, Germantown.

328
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,811
You heard about Detroit, huh?

329
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,263
Knife fight that killed Johnny?

330
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,262
Yeah, tough luck.

331
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,242
Me and Johnny
ran the mail room.

332
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,745
So, running the contraband
made you two

333
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,300
"King of the Hill."

334
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,369
The mail room gave us power.

335
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,579
Droppin' guys made us king.

336
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,449
Here, shake.

337
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,325
Still strong, right?

338
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,288
Yeah.

339
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,949
Working on these the past 30 years
kept me that way.

340
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,575
So, Wendall, when Hank stole 
those smokes from you,

341
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:31,704
you do something with
those strong hands of yours?

342
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:33,189
Won't deny, I told Johnny

343
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,846
we should get Hank alone
and cut him up.

344
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,525
What did Johnny say?

345
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,927
No.

346
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:44,511
We would do it in the mess hall.
For all to see.

347
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,424
I'll trade you my fruit cocktail.

348
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:52,977
Hi, Hank.

349
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,935
- I've been waiting for you fellas.
- You were waiting for us?

350
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,312
Smokes are still in their cartons,

351
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:05,041
'cept for one or two
I gave to my pal, James, here.

352
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,429
I was set up. / Shh... shush.

353
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,736
Now, in 30 seconds,

354
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:17,632
your insides'll be spilling
on the floor.

355
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:21,131
Any last wishes?

356
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:25,356
Tell me about Willie Harkin.

357
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:29,212
Who? / My daddy.

358
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:32,067
Sorry, I got the name wrong.
I meant your grandpops.

359
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,114
Gramps and my dad
were both named Willie.

360
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,658
Now, what in the hell
do you know about them?

361
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,033
They both did time in this prison.

362
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,188
Both did murders.

363
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:48,011
One of them, I think
your grandpa, lived in my cell.

364
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,104
What are ya talking about?

365
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:52,748
His name is etched on the wall.

366
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,893
If you wanna see it,
I'd show you.

367
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,313
Come by your cell later...

368
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,895
grab those smokes.

369
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,824
No problem.

370
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:14,852
Hey, on your mother,
you didn't steal from us, right?

371
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:17,720
What good's a pack
of smokes to me?

372
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,967
My wife made me quit.

373
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,619
Pretty cool customer, that Hank.

374
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,349
My hat was off to him.

375
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,828
What about this "wife"?

376
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:31,101
Our records don't show
Hank had anyone.

377
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:32,927
I don't know about a wife.

378
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:36,923
But he would talk about his 
sweetheart from Bucks County.

379
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:40,786
Bobbi something.

380
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,646
Old Hank got himself
in all this trouble

381
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,648
because Bobbi wanted
a pair of shoes.

382
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,737
They weren't shoes.

383
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,904
They were boots.

384
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:51,267
Knockoffs...

385
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:55,025
like Nancy Sinatra's
"made for walking" boots.

386
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,465
He knew I loved them.

387
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:58,682
So Hank went out
and got 'em for you.

388
00:19:58,682 --> 00:19:59,812
Women and shoes.

389
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,910
Anyway, that was a long time ago.

390
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,939
Our records show when Hank 
escaped that second time...

391
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,692
December '67...

392
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,569
he was caught in Bucks County,
at your aunt's house.

393
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:14,363
I was staying there. He came straight
to me the second he escaped.

394
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,661
Kinda shortsighted, wasn't it?

395
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:19,100
Hank was compulsive.

396
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,696
Just couldn't stay away?

397
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,738
Now this one's over the moon.

398
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:27,859
Anyway, in the end,
I found the right person for me.

399
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,378
Lyle and I have been married
for 25 years.

400
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:34,162
Like this Hank was some sort
of Steve McQueen...

401
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:36,323
Tell 'em about that night
at your aunt's house.

402
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,338
It's okay.

403
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,771
Hank, what are you doing here?

404
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,179
I always told you

405
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,479
when I got out I'd come straight
to my wife.

406
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,885
Baby, there's no time.
You need to run... / Shh...

407
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,487
close your eyes. / Hank...

408
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:56,093
Bobbi, please...

409
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,569
You weren't listening...

410
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:03,126
Bobbi Jean Banks,

411
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:06,348
will you be my wife?

412
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:12,459
Hank, you can't come all this way,
just to let them catch you again.

413
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,122
It was worth it.

414
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:16,219
Hold it right there, Hank.

415
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,297
That's twice now
you've run on me, Hank.

416
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:34,305
Laundry truck had my name on it, 
warden.

417
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,489
Evening.

418
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,904
Oh, casserole.
How nice.

419
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,583
Do you mind?

420
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,572
Mmm. It's only so-so, Hank.

421
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,632
You'd do just as good
back at the house.

422
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:03,108
I'll come back to you.
Promise.

423
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:04,728
No. Hank.

424
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:12,459
You won't.

425
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,713
Save the rest for when you get back
to your cell, okay?

426
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,147
I didn't get your answer.

427
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:21,417
Wave bye-bye, miss.

428
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,517
You're never going to see Hank again.

429
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,398
Yes.

430
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:37,114
Lucky for me that warden
meant what he said.

431
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,829
He always makes it so easy for me.

432
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,867
We'll leave you
to your gardening.

433
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:45,787
Detective Rush...

434
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,712
I knew when I opened
that package

435
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,437
he couldn't have paid
for those boots,

436
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,541
but I wanted them so much.

437
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,640
I always regretted that...

438
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,529
It wouldn't have mattered.

439
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,208
Hank would never have let you
give those boots back.

440
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,414
How do you know?

441
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:04,470
'Cause I knew someone
just like him...

442
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,259
once.

443
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:17,577
We think the warden's got skeletons
in his closet, James.

444
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:19,913
We also think he's a lot more

445
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:23,763
than "tough" and "fair,"
like you told me.

446
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,341
Okay.

447
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:27,200
We checked his personnel file.

448
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,457
27 reports of misconduct.

449
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:31,482
Maybe you said what you said

450
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:34,461
because you've been
under his watch for 40 years.

451
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:37,692
So, what if we got you
transferred outta here?

452
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:41,210
Houtzdale, Chester,
whatever you want, James.

453
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,660
Today?

454
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,974
Today.

455
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,050
I was in the cell

456
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,241
when they brought Hank back
from his lady's place that night.

457
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,811
What kind of shape was he in?

458
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,440
He was holding up.

459
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,592
Showed me the fork
wounds on his hand.

460
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:03,407
Nasty.

461
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,465
Anything else happen that night?

462
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,638
Yeah.

463
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:10,390
The warden happened.

464
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:14,926
Hey.

465
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:22,614
You're making me look bad, Hank,

466
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:28,796
and I got enough trouble with the rats
and water in this place, yes?

467
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,028
You saw her, warden.

468
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:35,141
I can't help it.
I got the fever.

469
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:39,391
Little gal's got you
going the wrong way, Hank.

470
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:41,798
You already had eight years put on
now, it'll be ten more.

471
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:44,343
Does that make sense?

472
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,314
Gimme your hand.

473
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:59,943
Now, I want you to tell every last soul
in this ever lovin' prison

474
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:01,993
that you'll never get off me again.

475
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,384
Otherwise,

476
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:07,906
you and me gonna have a little game
of... little piggy.

477
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,450
Hank. Go on.
Say it.

478
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,801
I'd be lying.

479
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,657
This one went to the market.

480
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:23,363
Come on, Hank.

481
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:27,072
It's gotta hurt more than that.

482
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:30,151
No? Okay.

483
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:36,336
This little piggy stayed home.

484
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,314
Damn it, boy! 
Let 'em hear!

485
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:51,509
After the pliers,
they took him out.

486
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:59,102
Later, I heard talk about him getting
wailed on with a Louisville slugger.

487
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:00,990
Okay, James.

488
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,032
You're coming with us.

489
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:08,698
Let you stay in hotel homicide
till we get that transfer worked out.

490
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:18,996
Lil, I called the state police
about the warden.

491
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,263
Well, James says he's been 
terrorizing inmates for years.

492
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,173
He put a hurtin' on
Hank back in '68?

493
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:26,396
Hank never would cry uncle.

494
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:27,814
Gotta admire that.

495
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:30,386
The guy had heart.

496
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,891
You're supposed to be
on the side of the law, Lil.

497
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,452
I can't be on the
side of this warden.

498
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,814
So how do you
figure him as the doer?

499
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,861
Hank died from blunt-force trauma.

500
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,120
This baseball bat could 
be the murder weapon.

501
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,356
Maybe why he was in the
infirmary, not pneumonia.

502
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:48,263
Mm-hmm. A month later,
say he died from the injuries.

503
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:51,873
The warden dumps the body 
in a tunnel no one knows about.

504
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:53,183
Hmm.

505
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:55,264
What about this nurse
who was treating him?

506
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:58,144
Scotty's paying her
a house call.

507
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:01,149
Ms. Valez,
I don't mean to be too personal.

508
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,989
It's okay.

509
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:07,421
Yeah. I'd pass the time
with Jaden there for a while.

510
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,396
Aka... pretty girl?

511
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,090
Aka the big dud.

512
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,533
But he was harmless.

513
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,534
So the night Hank was brought
into the infirmary,

514
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,120
was there a head wound?

515
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,437
Not that I recall.

516
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,563
Body bruises,
like he took a beating.

517
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:23,189
Plus, the hand was mangled.

518
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:25,237
Real bad.
Two fingers broke.

519
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:27,869
And during the month,
uh, Hank was with you,

520
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,732
the warden ever pay a visit?

521
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,307
I think the warden
did enough, don't you?

522
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,463
Anyone come to see Hank?

523
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,299
Only his friend, Johnny,
and he came to help.

524
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,349
So, Hank and Johnny
became friends?

525
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:44,029
Real good ones.

526
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,895
Claudia. / Johnny.

527
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,260
Hear you're getting out.

528
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,172
Tomorrow morning.

529
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:55,835
Maybe I'll find your house.
We can have a date.

530
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:56,849
Hey, Johnny!

531
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,165
Cool it.

532
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:00,567
Yeah, right.

533
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:04,221
I'm sorry.
That was stupid.

534
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,462
Call that number like I told ya?

535
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:11,571
The Falcon will take care of us.

536
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:15,006
Good. Now, do your part.

537
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:18,006
You got till "the man in black" comes
to pull your strength together.

538
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,676
Johnny. Better get.

539
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:21,913
Hey, Johnny.

540
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:26,809
You're true blue.

541
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:34,715
'Member, that's what sets you apart
from the rest of your family. / Ah...

542
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:41,589
Me and the boss will be waiting
for you on the other side.

543
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:47,828
So Johnny was helping
Hank escape.

544
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,456
And I never reported it,

545
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:52,373
'cause I'd always felt
that Hank got a bum deal.

546
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:55,708
What about, um... "the boss"?

547
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,601
Any idea who that was?

548
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:01,052
No. But if he was as handsome
as Hank and Johnny,

549
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:03,809
I'd like to meet him.

550
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:07,523
Johnny Harkin was paroled
two weeks before

551
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,086
the Johnny Cash broadcast.

552
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,686
And left with the intention
of helping Hank bust loose.

553
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,750
Turns out Johnny's
granddad, Willie Harkin,

554
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,297
was one of the 12 that 
built the tunnel in '45.

555
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:19,030
So, stories about the tunnel
are passed down over the years

556
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,559
and Johnny tells his pal,
Hank where to find it.

557
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,644
So Johnny knows
about the old tunnel.

558
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:25,368
Why doesn't he
ever try an escape?

559
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,514
Well, he was serving
five, out in three.

560
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,705
Why risk doing time
you don't have to?

561
00:29:29,705 --> 00:29:32,762
Right, don't be like Hank.

562
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:33,721
Rush.

563
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,023
Hey, Frannie.

564
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,324
Vay-lens.

565
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:41,706
Get to my bones yet?

566
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:44,319
For all I know, your dead guy 
could've played Rachmaninoff.

567
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,962
No sign of breaks or
fractures on the fingers.

568
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,228
But Hank's fingers
were broken with pliers.

569
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:51,477
Wouldn't you be
able to see that?

570
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:56,157
Yes. And I'm telling you
those fingers were good as new.

571
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:59,322
Valens, you a little stumped?

572
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,337
No, I got it.

573
00:30:02,337 --> 00:30:05,077
Those ain't Hank's hands.

574
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:09,938
So...those aren't Hank's bones at all.

575
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,835
Taking a load off.
You don't mind?

576
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,198
It's your house.

577
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:21,258
You like it?

578
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:25,828
You, uh, do a lot with a little.

579
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:27,182
Now,

580
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:31,581
you say it was someone else wearing
Hank's prison uniform in that tunnel?

581
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:32,979
Well, we're checking dental records,

582
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:34,638
but that's what we're thinking.

583
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:38,049
We know Johnny and someone
called "the boss"

584
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:39,804
were helping Hank escape.

585
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:40,916
Okay.

586
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:44,020
Well, you told us Johnny died,
so he ain't the skeleton.

587
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,780
Right. / Leaving the boss,

588
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,357
but we don't know who that is.

589
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:50,252
Well, as far as "the boss" goes...

590
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:52,942
Johnny wasn't one
to take orders.

591
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,103
So, there's no one he ever
mentioned by that name?

592
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,060
Oh, I didn't say that.

593
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:07,652
So, one day...

594
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:09,757
I'm out on the stoop,

595
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:13,009
and I catch Bobbi coming my way.

596
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,436
She walking real fast,

597
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:17,494
not in a hurry, you know,
but with purpose.

598
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:19,398
What did you say to her?

599
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:22,168
Nothing comes out.

600
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,110
Oh, man.

601
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,264
I know.

602
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,906
She just walks on by,
never looks over.

603
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:31,731
This keeps happening
three days in a row.

604
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:36,525
Finally, on day four,
when I'm 'bout ready to call it quits,

605
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:39,989
Bobbi slows up, looks over,

606
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,908
and sticks her tongue out at me.

607
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:45,857
Oh, Mother Mary.

608
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:48,912
Just real cute like?

609
00:31:48,912 --> 00:31:51,278
Like it didn't even happen.

610
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,845
So, then what?

611
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,688
I said, "I'm Hank,"

612
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:58,216
and Bobbi says, "'bout time
you showed some manners.

613
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:03,759
"So, get off your rear end
and walk me home."

614
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,701
She was bossing ya like that?

615
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,535
Oh, my.
Mmm!

616
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,770
Don't you just love it?

617
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,930
That day on,

618
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:21,125
nothing would keep me from being
with that girl with the long, blonde hair.

619
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,131
What else, Hank?

620
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,784
What's that bossy
lady o' yours like?

621
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:30,168
Bet she can fill
a pair a' blue jeans, huh?

622
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:32,324
Oh, uh...

623
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,850
mmm. Um...

624
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,716
man.

625
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:41,063
Sandman's coming
to get me, Johnny.

626
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:43,982
More in the morning.

627
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,433
Johnny always called
her "the boss" after that.

628
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,203
Johnny gives her that name,
how's it go over with Hank?

629
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,461
Well, Hank was patient with him.

630
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,780
He knew Johnny didn't have much.

631
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,411
Story hour helped him get by.

632
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,691
So, Bobbi's "the boss."

633
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,201
Hill said the same.

634
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:06,269
Bobbi's also the Falcon.

635
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:11,461
DMV shows a Ford Falcon
'62 sport was registered in her name.

636
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:14,500
So, she and Johnny were gonna 
get Hank out of that tunnel together.

637
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,037
Falcon was the getaway car.

638
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,762
Thing is, we know Bobbi's
still alive,

639
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,958
so, those bones aren't
the boss's.

640
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,376
And we know they're not Hank's.

641
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:25,133
Which leaves Johnny,
but he supposedly died in Detroit.

642
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,409
But maybe not.

643
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:30,008
There's no death certificate
for a Johnny Harkin in Detroit.

644
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,753
Maybe that knife fight
rumor was a sham.

645
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,836
Maybe he died in that tunnel instead.

646
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:39,122
So, the bones in the tunnel
are Johnny.

647
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:41,401
Where's Hank?

648
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:46,967
Where's Lyle, Bobbi?

649
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:50,653
He went fishing.
And I'm getting ready to join him.

650
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,826
He seems like a nice guy.

651
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:53,869
Grounded.

652
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:57,486
He's a good man.
He's smart, too.

653
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:01,550
Romance?

654
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:04,920
You make do.

655
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,639
I know about making do.

656
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,925
I lost my number one smile,

657
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,487
way back.

658
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,920
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:18,437
We were gonna move upstate.

660
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:21,664
Live on a farm. / Yeah?

661
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:25,120
Not that I've ever been upstate.

662
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,847
I just liked the sound of it. / Uh-huh.

663
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:30,587
Had this image in my mind,

664
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:36,587
he's out in the field,
I'm in the kitchen with my little girl,

665
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:39,958
telling her about the day
her daddy sold his motorcycle

666
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:43,021
to buy our wedding bands.

667
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:46,770
He sounds special.

668
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:54,067
Been settling for less ever since.

669
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:57,055
- That's a hard way to live.
- No. I'm fine.

670
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:02,891
Just don't look me in the eye
and tell me you're making do.

671
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,237
Pardon?

672
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,949
You're not sitting around
pining for Hank...

673
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,451
because you're with Hank.

674
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,551
Aren't you?

675
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:19,676
You can't arrest me.

676
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:22,399
My husband told me the statute of
limitations are up.

677
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,508
That why you're the one
following behind?

678
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:28,017
Safe for you, but not Hank?

679
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:33,208
You want to sit down?

680
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,411
So, he went fishing, huh?

681
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:38,404
Want to tell me where?

682
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,415
Just a place.
Somewhere nice.

683
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:44,911
Somewhere that doesn't
extradite?

684
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,111
He thinks of everything.

685
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,119
Guess Johnny was just
a loose end, huh?

686
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,005
No.

687
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:55,028
Hank thought of Johnny
as a friend.

688
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,461
True blue.

689
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,079
Then how come Johnny
ends up dead?

690
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,364
You wouldn't understand.

691
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:10,582
Make me.

692
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,821
I love how this man sings.

693
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:23,971
Stands up there like
a wall of granite,

694
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:29,664
but can still speak his heart some.

695
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:31,989
The concert's almost over.

696
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,311
When's he going to get here?

697
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:36,537
You don't like Johnny Cash?

698
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,759
The manhole cover's
halfway across the road.

699
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,649
What if we don't
hear Hank's signal?

700
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,630
He'll be pounding so hard,

701
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,336
have to keep him from 
waking the neighbors.

702
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:53,559
Bobbi, these last two weeks...

703
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,158
Cops.

704
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:58,873
No, it's not.

705
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:00,620
Bobbi,

706
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,710
easy.

707
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:04,075
Easy.

708
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,125
Your...

709
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,085
Your hair.

710
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:18,831
That was stupid.

711
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:22,363
I didn't mean it.

712
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:24,857
No, I swear, Johnny,

713
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:31,175
you've become my second 
favorite man in the whole world.

714
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:44,527
Better go see
what's keeping him.

715
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:47,282
The plan was to wait
until he knocks.

716
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:50,467
No, this is better.

717
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,004
Johnny?

718
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:30,638
It's me.

719
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:32,622
You were gonna wait
above ground.

720
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:34,973
- Where's Bobbi?
- In the Falcon.

721
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:36,044
Let's go.

722
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:37,771
I should...

723
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:40,359
I should tell you about her.

724
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,977
Bobbi okay,
something wrong?

725
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:45,217
Yeah. There is.

726
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:49,749
She's... perfect.

727
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,054
Johnny, you seem off.

728
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:53,923
Baby, look out!

729
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:01,156
- Why are you doing this?
- You got what I want!

730
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:02,631
Johnny...

731
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,108
don't hurt him.

732
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:10,981
No matter what you do,
I'll never be yours.

733
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:22,054
Guess maybe
I already knew that.

734
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:29,367
This ain't a wrestling match.

735
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:36,549
Better pick that up, Hank boy.

736
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:43,343
There...

737
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:47,618
we're even steven.

738
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,913
Johnny, it doesn't
have to be this.

739
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:53,945
I'm a Harkin.

740
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,270
That's my blood.

741
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:09,372
Hank,

742
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:14,093

00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:19,761
