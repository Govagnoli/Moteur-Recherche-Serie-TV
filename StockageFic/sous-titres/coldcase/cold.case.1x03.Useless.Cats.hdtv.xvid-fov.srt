00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:05,118


2
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:21,062
Oh, Gail.

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,087
Hey, Larry.

4
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,849
I was just doing my woodworking,
needed a break.

5
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,664
I'm building a bridhouse for 
the tweeties on my balcony.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,917
- You want a peek?
- I'm in a rush.

7
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,574
Yeah, I'm going 
for a walk anyway.

8
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:35,115
Enjoy it.

9
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,995
Hey, you wanna see one of 
the coolest spots in Philly?

10
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,137
It's three blocks from 
here. I discovered it.

11
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,499
I've got a lot of reading to do.
And Bruce is coming over.

12
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,419
Good night, Larry.

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,111
How's "The Miller's Tale" 
gonna help me in life?

14
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:57,983
Totally unreadable.

15
00:00:57,983 --> 00:01:00,423
So drop the class.

16
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,835
fI'm going to 
med school anyway.

17
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,283
Hey.

18
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:09,699
What?

19
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,981
- I'm done studying.
- I'm not.

20
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:14,197
Yeah, you are.

21
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:15,780
Bruce, I have 
a seminar in the morning.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,486
It's only Summer school.

23
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:19,941
Skip it.

24
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:23,044
What am I gonna have to 
do, kick you out of here?

25
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:26,817
I'm getting sick of that story, too.

26
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,637
Came in this morning 
addressed to Homicide.

27
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:08,826
I think it's one of yours.

28
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,900
"Number one. Kitchen floor.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,664
She had a useless 
cat who did nothing."

30
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:18,961
"Number two. Brunette.
At least two useless cats."

31
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,584
Ellen Curtis had two cats.

32
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:25,197
"Three. This one died on me.
And her useless cat just watched."

33
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,265
Oh... this bastard.

34
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:30,112
"I don't like what I do, 
but I can't go yet.

35
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:32,787
The days are still warm."

36
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,467
That's him.

37
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:37,303
Try to get prints off this?

38
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,246
This guy doesn't leave prints.

39
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,082
Where has he 
been for five years?

40
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,240
And why is he 
sending us this letter?

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,609
He's bragging. He's 
telling us he's back.

42
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,294
And that he's gonna do it again.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS:  2003/10/12

52
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:25,629
Gail Chimayo. Summer '98.

53
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,286
Guy broke in 
through the window,

54
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:30,787
raped her like all the others,
but Gail he killed.

55
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,090
He got through those bars?

56
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,766
Guy was some kind of spider.

57
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,237
He could climb walls, 
get in tiny windows.

58
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:39,029
- So he's skinny.
- He's a contortionist.

59
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,571
Boss...

60
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,629
I don't have the constitution 
to go after him again.

61
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:46,094
Why'd he kill Gail 
and not the others?

62
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,209
She fought back.

63
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,263
Any physical evidence?

64
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:50,851
Just the DNA from his sperm, 
but we never found a match.

65
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,409
I got samples from everybody--

66
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,930
the neighbors, plumbers, 
handymen... nothing.

67
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,344
It was like chasing a ghost.

68
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:57,371
Boss, I can't do this.

69
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,590
I'm not asking you to, Nick.

70
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,162
This case became 
a health issue for me.

71
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:02,622
Didn't you get any 
direction where to look?

72
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,750
He only struck when 
the weather was warm, so

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,040
I check out baseball teams, exchange
students coming in for the Summer...

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,574
Circus. / Yeah?

75
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:12,268
Yeah, yeah, 
I interviewed a damn clown.

76
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,937
Who was the top suspect?

77
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,543
Bruce Elridge.

78
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,599
- Gail's boyfriend.
- How come?

79
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,331
He gave a shady, 
hostile interview.

80
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,693
Refused to give his DNA,

81
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:24,583
had not one good alibi
for any of the rapes.

82
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,034
Unfortunately, Vera's under 
orders not to talk to him.

83
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,649
- That's not official.
- The D.A.'s office was very clear, Nick.

84
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,508
Do not approach him again.

85
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,426
What did you do to him?

86
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:36,031
I was on the case.

87
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,677
He was a serious suspect.

88
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,135
He put him in 
the room four times.

89
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,786
What am I supposed to do, 
start all over again?

90
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:43,692
- I'll start it over.
- Whoa, this is my job.

91
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,935
I'm not gonna get cut out of it.

92
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,032
Well, which one is it, 
Vera? You in or out?

93
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:47,663
I don't know.

94
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,021
All right. Lil will read 
the case again.

95
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,098
You wanna join her, okay.

96
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,503
But I don't want you going 
to Bruce without new direction.

97
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,765
We got the letter.

98
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,938
Connect him to the letter, 
Nick, you can go back.

99
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:59,469
Not before.

100
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,597
You got an angle, 
how to do that?

101
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:10,237
Yeah, I got an angle.

102
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,707
No. Not you again.

103
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:22,499
- Got some questions, Larry.
- Forget it.

104
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,713
You browbeat this guy, too?

105
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,996
He's a material witness. 
I talk to him sometimes.

106
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:37,934
Larry, it's Lily Rush. 
With Homicide.

107
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,557
I need to talk to you about Gail.

108
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,782
I'll talk to you. Not him.

109
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,382
Grow up.

110
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,992
Open the door, Larry.

111
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:55,388
Detective Vera 
will take a little walk.

112
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:06,129
This guy's sick, huh?

113
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,397
Anything about it say 
Bruce Elridge to you?

114
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:12,737
The smugness fits.

115
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:16,860
He was such a snob. 
He'd never even say hello.

116
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,778
So you didn't know him well.

117
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,170
Nah.

118
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,176
You told 911 that you thought

119
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:25,407
Gail and her boyfriend were 
having a fight next door.

120
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:26,489
If I may speak.

121
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,998
I never saw anyone else 
go inside that apartment.

122
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,480
What was your 
relationship with Gail?

123
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:35,081
Good neighbors.

124
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,935
Good friends.

125
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:41,175
Maybe something could have blossomed
if the world was laid out differently.

126
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:44,108
So now you're flirting?
You didn't say that five years ago.

127
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,233
You asked about the 911 call,
not my relationship with Gail.

128
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,219
Did the noise from next 
door wake you, Larry?

129
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,775
I was up, working.

130
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,981
Gail?

131
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,779
What's going on in there?

132
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,001
It sounds like 
more than reading.

133
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,035
911.

134
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,707
I'm at 1832 Sansom.

135
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,988
I'm worried about my neighbor.

136
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:47,987
That was heroic, 
making that call, Larry.

137
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,066
It was instinct.

138
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,487
Anyway, uh...

139
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,261
the cops came,

140
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:57,371
knocked, left.

141
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,137
She was found 
dead the next day.

142
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:02,527
Cops can't break down a door just 
because some guy sense something.

143
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:05,695
I gave a DNA sample right off.
I'll give another one if you like.

144
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,427
That's not necessary.

145
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,780
So back to Bruce.

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,627
You seen him lately?

147
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:12,440
I did run into him a couple of months 
ago, up on the Penn campus.

148
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,112
He does experiments 
at med school.

149
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,384
Yeah, he was full of hot air

150
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:21,154
about some kind of sleep 
study he's doing on cats.

151
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,866
- Thank you. 
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,971
Some maybe we 
should check that out.

153
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:37,207
How'd you find out 
about his research?

154
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,094
I track this guy.

155
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,439
I knew it was animals, but 
I always figured it was lab rats.

156
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,170
That's him.

157
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,151
You can't talk to me.

158
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,089
That letter you 
wrote gave me cause.

159
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,268
Your pal here made my life 
miserable five years ago.

160
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,176
You could have ended it at 
anytime by giving a DNA sample.

161
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,485
Let's not have that 
conversation again.

162
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,889
Bruce,

163
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,903
I'm the one who 
wanted to talk to you.

164
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:03,907
And who are you?

165
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:07,427
Detective Rush. I'm looking 
back into Gail's murder.

166
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:12,491
I was wondering about the 
animal research you do.

167
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:14,286
What about it?

168
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:15,802
We're talking cats, right?

169
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:16,740
Yeah.

170
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,524
And I don't feel guilty about it
if that's your next question.

171
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,110
You kill those cats? / If need be.
If a person's got cancer

172
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,361
I'm not gonna worry about testing
on some useless animal.

173
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,138
Why are they useless?

174
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,225
They're sub-human.

175
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,582
- Small brains. 
- Like women.

176
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:33,586
Women have a use.

177
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,740
Bruce, why not make this easy?

178
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,810
Volunteer your DNA.

179
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,590
Fourth amendment says 
I got a right to privacy.

180
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,139
Don't you wanna be
ruled out as a suspect?

181
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:42,242
On the contrary.

182
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:45,311
I don't want desperate detectives
to act like it's a discovery

183
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:48,152
if they match my DNA to semen
that was on Gail's sheets.

184
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,226
I was her boyfriend.

185
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,293
We were very active,

186
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:52,487
if you get me.

187
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:55,523
I'm sure my DNA's 
all over that place.

188
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:56,765
I see.

189
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,094
I don't need a witch hunt

190
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:01,765
just 'cause you couldn't 
solve this thing.

191
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,062
Vera.

192
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,641
What is it about this job?

193
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,953
You yap on all the time about the 
other cases. Why not this one?

194
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,542
This one did things to me.

195
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,137
Like what?

196
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:19,163
You ever work a job 
makes you feel helpless?

197
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:22,063
Yeah, I can always find 
motive, direction, but...

198
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,580
that piece of crap, he stops.

199
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,272
Leaves me with nothing.

200
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,570
I start second guessing 
everything, you know?

201
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,018
Maybe I'm not the 
bad ass I think I am.

202
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,048
- I want this guy. 
- So do I.

203
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,092
We can get him.

204
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,775
But I need you, Vera.

205
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:40,338
You know him 
better than anyone.

206
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:52,264
If he's following his M.O.,

207
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,846
he's already hunting...

208
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,428
stalking someone right 
now following her home.

209
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:02,343
Let's hope she's got 
her windows locked.

210
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,207
I should have noticed 
that they all had cats.

211
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:15,073
It didn't mean anything 
till we got the letter.

212
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:19,420
It's a list of parolees who were locked up 
the last five years and just got out.

213
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,584
One guy fits the time line, 
but he weights 300 pounds.

214
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,848
Since when?

215
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:27,501
His whole life. It ain't him.

216
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,198
Was worth a try. / Yeah.

217
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,715
Well, how'd you do today?

218
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,964
Found out Bruce Elridge 
tortures cats for a living.

219
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,812
Does he?

220
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:41,112
Talks about useless animals 
and won't give up his DNA.

221
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:42,923
I gotta go sit on him.

222
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:45,745
Make sure he doesn't climb
through anybody's window tonight.

223
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,789
I got new addresses 
on the first two victims.

224
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,520
They've both moved.

225
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,681
Let's go.

226
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,195
Wait till tomorrow.

227
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:57,320
I don't want you going to these girls 
at midnight asking about their rape.

228
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:58,967
Yeah.

229
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,023
Tomorrow.

230
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,652
Good night.

231
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,866
My dad told me why you're here.

232
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,760
Can I come in?

233
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,621
No, I'd rather... I'd rather talk out here.

234
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,976
We think he's back, Ellen.

235
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:38,942
Oh, no.

236
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,179
Can I show you a picture?

237
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,452
A detective showed me 
that five years ago.

238
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:48,504
I know.

239
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:50,497
Just look again.

240
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,352
Could this be the guy 
who attacked you?

241
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,902
I couldn't say.

242
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,893
I never saw him.

243
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,608
Did his voice sound like 
anyone you know?

244
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:02,519
I told the first detective no.

245
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,298
I don't think so.

246
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:09,449
You said at the time you were 
certain it was a stranger.

247
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:10,904
Right.

248
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,971
You got a different feeling 
about that now?

249
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,783
It's okay if you do.

250
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,200
No.

251
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,062
No, I don't know him.

252
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,756
I really can't... I really 
can't tell you anything.

253
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,873
The lead detective on 
this case is female, Ellen.

254
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,892
Would you be more 
comfortable talking to her?

255
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,038
Maybe.

256
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,839
Okay.

257
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,621
I gotta go to work, but, um...

258
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,716
I'm home every day by 6:00.

259
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,107
All right.

260
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,205
Could be him.

261
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,271
Could be Yo Yo Ma.

262
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,716
I didn't see crap.

263
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:37,904
He covered your eyes right away.

264
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,809
I'm in my kitchen...

265
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,503
all of a sudden there's 
a towel over my face.

266
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:48,283
Guy whispers that he's real 
sorry... rapes me right there...

267
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:52,449
and then stays for an hour, 
talking to me.

268
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,762
I'm always nervous on first dates.

269
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,384
But we did okay, didn't we?

270
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:02,210
You were playing such 
a sad song before.

271
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,885
You wanna play it for me?

272
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,930
I don't think so.

273
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,729
That's okay.

274
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:16,659
Those bars on your windows
are no good, honey.

275
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,118
They're too far apart.

276
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,651
You gotta be more careful.

277
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:29,450
You know what he said to 
me right before he left?

278
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:34,934
"Wish that we had met under 
different circumstances."

279
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,195
I'm sorry, Niki.

280
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:41,163
I just hope you finally get the guy.

281
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,926
I don't wanna make you 
uncomportable, but, um...

282
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:51,690
you were obviously in 
close contact with him.

283
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,162
Yeah.

284
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,690
He touched you. You 
must have touched him.

285
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,871
Was there anything that you 
felt that was distinctive?

286
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,349
Scars? Moles?

287
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,930
This is kind of weird...

288
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,702
That's okay.

289
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:12,325
I did touch him. I didn't 
do it to be intimate...

290
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,369
Of course not.

291
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:18,013
I was trying to get him off me.

292
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,809
And you noticed something.

293
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,706
Smooth skin.

294
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:30,568
Legs, arms, everything.

295
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,990
Soft and smooth like a woman's.

296
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,581
Excuse me a second, Niki.

297
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,478
What's that?

298
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,097
Bruce Elridge's coffee cup.

299
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:49,215
You stole his coffee?

300
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:51,096
He abandoned it in a public place.

301
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:53,688
Now we got his precious DNA.

302
00:16:57,928 --> 00:16:59,132
According to Niki Lamas,

303
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:02,427
we're looking at a guy 
with super smooth skin.

304
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,390
That's new.

305
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,479
Maybe he shaves his 
body before he attacks.

306
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,264
No hair ever found at the scenes.

307
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:09,769
Anything from Ellen Curtis?

308
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:13,229
Jeffries got the sense she knew 
something. I'll go back to her today.

309
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:15,719
And how's our boy Vera doing?

310
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:19,530
He's... passionate.

311
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,922
That passion almost compromised 
this case five years ago.

312
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,556
I'm watching, boss.

313
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,158
I hate to rat a guy out,

314
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:31,792
but Vera just walked in with Bruce Elridge.

315
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,473
- I can't have this...
- Let me go.　　　　

316
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,785
You'll want to look at this first.

317
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:41,816
This isn't gonna help.

318
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,131
You can't keep me here.

319
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,978
I can keep you here for six hours.

320
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:53,914
So what's with the animal experiments?

321
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:56,339
What are you, an activist?

322
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,362
Lot of killers start off torturing animals.

323
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:01,953
But smart guy like you...
know something about that.

324
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,448
So what?

325
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,880
Is that you, Bruce, hmm?

326
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,690
Did you go from cats to 
women with your viciousness?

327
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,064
That's a leap.

328
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:15,417
You slip into their apartments with 
that wimp-boy frame of yours.

329
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,476
You terrorize them and you 
pretend you're on a date?

330
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:20,836
I've got a girlfriend.
We're very, very happy.

331
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,276
Maybe you didn't mean to kill Gail.

332
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:23,250
Just rape her like the others.

333
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,090
I didn't do anything to her, so why 
don't you stop acting like a thug.

334
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,763
What'd you just call me, you little rube?

335
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,044
Say it again, come on!

336
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:30,847
Say it again.

337
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,126
Say it again!

338
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:32,858
Vera...

339
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,081
Looks like Bruce here 
thinks I'm wasting his time.

340
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,032
Come out here.

341
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,480
Bruce has better 
things to do... / Vera!

342
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,185
We got the DNA back.

343
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,986
It's a negative match.

344
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,796
You bunch of thugs!

345
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,564
Bruce... what the hell's wrong with you?

346
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:01,622
What's that supposed to mean?

347
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:03,657
You knew we wouldn't 
match your DNA. / So?

348
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:06,419
So why not give a sample five 
years ago like a normal person?

349
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,799
I got a right to privacy.

350
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,378
How's giving a swab of 
spit invading your privacy?

351
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:13,664
A guy's got a right to have 
sex with his own girlfriend.

352
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,415
Okay.

353
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,086
Okay.

354
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:20,649
You weren't having sex with her.

355
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,767
Excuse me?

356
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,115
You didn't want us to not find your DNA.

357
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,683
It wasn't anywhere in that apartment,

358
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:29,742
'cause she was shutting you down.

359
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,358
We went out for seven months.

360
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,555
And by that time a guy's got a right.

361
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,056
You think I wanted all those 
macho cops, all my friends,

362
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:40,530
knowing I was putting up with such a prude?

363
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,698
Hey, Bruce... this ain't high school.

364
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:46,774
This case died five years ago and 
you could have helped us bring it in.

365
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:49,490
And you coming off to your 
pals like some big stud

366
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,862
isn't more important than a girl dying.

367
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:02,971
My partner got the sense you knew
we were on the wrong trail.

368
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,846
How would I know that?

369
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,367
Maybe you saw the guy.

370
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,939
No.

371
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:15,907
Maybe... you knew the guy?

372
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:21,650
- I really try not to think about this.
- That's understandable.　　　　

373
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,748
But he contacted us.

374
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:26,091
Let us know he's gonna do it again.

375
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,249
I can't worry about that.

376
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:29,836
If you could describe 
him...

377
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,919
I can't. / I know that's what you've 
been saying all these years,

378
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,321
but maybe it's because it's too painful.

379
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:42,599
Ellen, I'm just scared 
it's gonna happen again.

380
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,493
I never used to be scared of anything.

381
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:51,786
No?

382
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,379
Now I live with my parents.

383
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:59,830
I'm terrified if I'm not home before dark.

384
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,253
You had a life before.

385
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,951
You just want it back.

386
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,632
I don't think that's in the cards.

387
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,252
I do.

388
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:12,522
But you have to start by telling 
me what you saw that night.

389
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,614
It might not be relevant.

390
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,151
I was at the Free Library, 
outside buying a coffee

391
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:29,405
and this, um... this guy started 
talking to me about books

392
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,583
and I can't even remember what else.

393
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,733
But it was only for, like, a few minutes...

394
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,302
and then I went home.

395
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,802
And that was it.

396
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,835
Did you get his name?

397
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,644
Then the rape happened that night...

398
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:58,603
Olive?

399
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:01,042
Edie?

400
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:04,901
Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.

401
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,357
You scared me.

402
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,959
I'm so sorry.

403
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,201
First dates are hard.

404
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,549
Especially with serious girls like you.

405
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,971
I just wish we could met under 
different circumstances.

406
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,089
It was so quick.

407
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,455
It was like a flashbulb.

408
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:34,716
And I, uh... I could be wrong, but...

409
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,563
the face I keep seeing
is the guy from the library.

410
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:49,370
Um... dark hair...

411
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,757
kind of shaggy.

412
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,380
Smooth skin.

413
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:00,733
This is gonna help us a lot.

414
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:02,549
I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier.

415
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,960
You weren't ready earlier.

416
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:10,018
I should have told that first detective.

417
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:15,809
I was worried he'd think that 
since I'd talked to the guy...

418
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,826
I'd let him on.

419
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,196
You know?

420
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:25,776
Detective Vera only looks 
like a Neanderthal.

421
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,022
Excuse me.

422
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:37,264
What?

423
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:41,290
Sex Crimes got an assault,
9th and Lombard.

424
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,395
Same M.O.?

425
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,446
Crawled through the 
second floor window.

426
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:52,701
Our boy is back.

427
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,412
(*) up the drain pipe,

428
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:17,903
climbed cross the walls,

429
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:20,080
slipped in through the bars.

430
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,776
Now, that's determination.

431
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,223
Are there prints on the bars?

432
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:24,281
Of course not.

433
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,794
Ah, but he did leave a token behind.

434
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,150
Kenfield, filter.

435
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,692
Left it right at the bedside.

436
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,590
This the victim?

437
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,484
Yeah. Sex Crimes took her to the hopital.

438
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:40,021
They know you want talk to her, though.

439
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,107
We doing this together?

440
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,957
Yeah.

441
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,179
Please.

442
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:05,299
Maybe I should have 
fought or something.

443
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,692
There's no "should", Tanya.

444
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:11,627
Does, uh... this look like him?

445
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:14,247
He covered my eyes so quickly.

446
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,256
Did he speak to you?

447
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:16,053
Yeah.

448
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:21,484
Afterwards, he talked a lot.
He talked about art and books.

449
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,695
I'm in grad school for 
art history, but I don't...

450
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,857
I don't know how he knew that.

451
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,913
Did you recognize his voice? / No.

452
00:25:29,913 --> 00:25:32,377
He was a stranger.

453
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:34,512
You study art history?

454
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:36,147
Yeah.

455
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,232
Been to any museums lately?

456
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:44,195
Um... I was at the Rodin a few days ago.

457
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:47,786
Did you notice anything about this skin?

458
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:54,734
It was... smooth. 
You know, like... hairless.

459
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,328
No hair at all?

460
00:25:56,328 --> 00:25:58,638
Didn't seem like it.

461
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:04,316
Do you know what he 
told me before he left?

462
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,917
That he wished that we had met under...

463
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:10,268
Under different circumstances.

464
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,834
And that he was sorry.

465
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,137
Does this guy stalk girls 
on Ben Franklin Parkway?

466
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:24,855
Gail worked at the Museum of Art.

467
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:27,142
Ellen was at the Free Library 
the day she was attacked.

468
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:30,919
And Tanya went to the Rodin last week.

469
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,443
Niki was on Locust.

470
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:34,775
Leaving the Academy of Music.

471
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:38,183
Maybe he targets smart girls.

472
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,195
All the victims were college types.

473
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:43,985
"Serious girls." He said it to Ellen.

474
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,321
Let's post this composite 
all over the Parkway.

475
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,148
I got it.

476
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:52,828
I interviewed a woman that worked 
with Gail at the art museum.

477
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,731
Anna...

478
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:57,794
Anna... Berlin.

479
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:00,895
They had lunch together 
the day of the murder.

480
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:02,765
We have this now.

481
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:06,043
Let's see if she knows our new friends.

482
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:12,267
Is this who killed Gail?

483
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,544
Could be.

484
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,182
Do you recognize him at all?

485
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,211
I don't think so.

486
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,304
Take your time.

487
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,082
I can't be sure, but...

488
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:25,227
But what?

489
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,541
It sort of looks like a guy we'd 
see out here at lunchtime.

490
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,093
You and Gail saw him?

491
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:35,196
He'd hang out here, 
smoking, watching people.

492
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,919
I kind of forgot about him.

493
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,086
He hasn't been around for years,

494
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,830
but he's been back lately.

495
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:44,613
Ever get a name? / No.

496
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,836
We only talked to him once.

497
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,545
How's the pre-med student?

498
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,713
Arrogant. Pushy.

499
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:56,401
In other words, the same.

500
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,822
I know, I have bad taste in men.

501
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,069
You ladies work here?

502
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,396
Yeah.

503
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,797
How's the new exhibit?

504
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:05,707
The Monet? It's beautiful. 
I recommend it.

505
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:08,233
Maybe I'll take a look.

506
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,680
See you in there.

507
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:21,185
I didn't think to mention 
it to you back then.

508
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:24,150
People are always aksing questions.

509
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,491
Do you think he may have
been watching Gail?

510
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:30,838
He wasn't there for the art.

511
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:36,715
Got something.

512
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,491
Girl was with a friend and her 
mom on Ben Franklin Parkway.

513
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:41,561
Saw your composite.

514
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,344
This is Lily. She's a police officer, too.

515
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,711
Tell her what you told me.

516
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:50,207
That's Carl.

517
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,271
My mommy's boyfriend.

518
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,054
What do you got?

519
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,840
Carl Heeley, grew up in a trailer park 
in Trenton, moved up Philly at 18,

520
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,104
worked as a security guard in the 
Franklin Institute from '92 to '98.

521
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:09,844
Across from the Free Library. / Yeah.

522
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:13,442
And the last five years, he was 
at an army base in Portland.

523
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:14,604
Just got back to town.

524
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:15,495
How'd he behave in Oregon?

525
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:17,750
Dishonorably discharged six weeks ago.

526
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,759
Breaking into a female officer's room.

527
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,797
Through the window.

528
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:23,427
She was trained in combat 
though, unlike our girls.

529
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,942
She fought him, ID'd him, 
and they sent him packing.

530
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:27,229
Military will have boold types.

531
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,395
We're getting a subpoena right now.

532
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:31,841
Pick up this soldier.

533
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,051
What's this about?

534
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:42,498
A woman was raped inOld City last night.

535
00:29:42,498 --> 00:29:44,079
I'm sorry to hear that.

536
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,006
Where were you last night, Carl?

537
00:29:46,006 --> 00:29:48,252
At home. Reading.

538
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,938
Can anyone verify that?

539
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,872
My girlfriend and her daughter.

540
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:54,269
You a big reader, Carl?

541
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:55,275
You could say.

542
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:58,861
You lived in the area five years 
ago when three women raped.

543
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:00,789
Do you remember anything about that?

544
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:02,678
Not really.

545
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,627
But you heard about it, right?

546
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:09,257
Yeah, I think I remember something 
about it, but that was a long time ago.

547
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,917
This looks a lot like you, 
don't you think?

548
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,515
Sort of.

549
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,859
Can you arrest a man for 
looking like a drawing?

550
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,372
We're asking guys who look like 
this picture to take a DNA test.

551
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,841
Would you do that?

552
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:28,406
I'm sorry. I prefer not to.

553
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:33,735
Look, I'd love to help you out, but 
I gotta get back new job and all.

554
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:36,444
So, is there anything else?

555
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:38,030
No.

556
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,869
Crap.

557
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:54,741
It was a Kenfield filter.

558
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:04,996
Carl and I used to date, so...

559
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,707
Well, you lived together, that's a 
bit different than dating, isn't it?

560
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:12,414
Cait, honey, take Dolly 
and play in the room, okay?

561
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,438
We lived together five years ago.
We broke up when he moved.

562
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:22,828
If you broke up, how'd 
you get this Army picture?

563
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,584
We kept in touch.

564
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,077
Caitlin says that Carl's 
still your boyfriend.

565
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:30,471
That he's been around 
the apartment a lot.

566
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,379
Yeah, well... maybe 
I never got over him.

567
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,155
Do you remember those 
rapes five years ago?

568
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,079
Yeah.

569
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,499
Do you remember that 
a girl was murdered?

570
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:43,971
What, you trying to say that was Carl?

571
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,563
This is the guy.

572
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,925
You tell me, Bridget.

573
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,680
Carl is a good person.

574
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,649
He is.

575
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:59,260
He is. Just should see him
with Caitlin and animals.

576
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,504
Down at that shelter you work at?

577
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,914
Yeah. He helps out sometimes.

578
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:04,201
You got any pets here?

579
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,548
No, no.

580
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:10,204
Carl always says that dogs are for 
families and cats are for single girls.

581
00:32:10,204 --> 00:32:13,015
- Mm. Carl says that, huh?
- Yeah, we joke about it.

582
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,395
You know, cats and book clubs,

583
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,502
two sure signs that a woman's
all alone in the world.

584
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:22,335
I'm guessing you wouldn't be 
caught dead at a book club.

585
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,759
I noticed your Shakespeare 
collection over there.

586
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,002
Yeah, Carl got that at a garage sale.

587
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:31,147
You guys read the tragedies together?

588
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:35,236
He looks at'em sometimes.
I don't like books.

589
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:38,855
Maybe that's why he 
took off five years ago.

590
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:41,475
What do you mean?

591
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:43,636
Nothing.

592
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:45,673
No, what?

593
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,793
We talked to Carl earlier today
and he just wasn't, uh...

594
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:54,891
very complimentary about 
your... brain power.

595
00:32:58,447 --> 00:32:59,713
That's mean.

596
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:01,685
I thought so.

597
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,956
Was he with you last night?

598
00:33:06,196 --> 00:33:07,959
Yeah, he was here.

599
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,918
He go out after?

600
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,873
He went out for a walk, late.

601
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,919
'Cause there was another 
rape last night.

602
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,318
Another woman who 
lives alone, with a cat.

603
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:20,260
Carl take a lot of walks?

604
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,807
Yeah. He has trouble sleeping.

605
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,225
He always did.

606
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:43,163
Honey... what's wrong?

607
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:45,969
Nothing. Can't sleep is all.

608
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,130
Come back to bed.

609
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:50,482
I'm gonna get some air.

610
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:52,270
Okay.

611
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:54,733
Be careful.

612
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,082
You, too.

613
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:58,783
Keep the windows closed.

614
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:04,301
Yeah, he did that a lot.

615
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:07,932
He'd leave in the middle of the night.

616
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,784
Didn't you think it was pretty odd
that he shaved like that Bridget?

617
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:15,039
He always shaved, 
you know? He said, um...

618
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,737
it had to do, you know, 
with biking, for speed.

619
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,708
Did he always shave at midnight?

620
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,967
I don't know.

621
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,668
You remember the rapes, 
though, don't you?

622
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,063
Yeah.

623
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:26,687
Didn't you ever think...

624
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:28,341
That I was living with a rapist?

625
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:32,019
No, I never thought that. Would you?

626
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:39,001
Does it make sense now?

627
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:45,247
Yeah, I guess.

628
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:47,317
With the walks and all.

629
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:48,688
Now that I think about it,

630
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:54,208
he's only ridden that bike a couple 
times since I've known him.

631
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,087
Bridget?

632
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,928
I'm so sorry Carl.

633
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,034
You really should be more careful.

634
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:09,311
I just wish we should've met 
under different circumstances.

635
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,428
Why are you here?

636
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:18,191
We just wanna chat. Again.

637
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,494
We called the base up in Oregon.

638
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,546
Seems you got the same 
blood type as our rapist.

639
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,111
Type A is pretty common.

640
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,058
We've got your letter, too.

641
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:30,941
I'm not much of a writer.

642
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:32,634
Plus that cigarette you left at Tanya's--

643
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:35,162
tells me you're just about 
ready to stop this.

644
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:38,291
How'd them army boys deal with 
you shaving your chest and your legs?

645
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,660
I cut that out up there.

646
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,074
Didn't wanna be on the wrong 
side of "don't ask, don't tell," huh?

647
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,259
I just didn't get much of a 
chance to bike in Oregon.

648
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:49,706
What kind of people do 
you come from... Carl?

649
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:51,173
Nothing special.

650
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:52,473
Educated?

651
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:53,438
No.

652
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:56,148
Low rent?

653
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:58,651
You could say.

654
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,117
Not a lot of books in 
the trailer, I take it?

655
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,475
My mom couldn't read.

656
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:05,585
What about that sister of yours,

657
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:09,874
the one that's in jail for 
prostitution? She a... big scholar?

658
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:12,068
Yeah, you come from trash, 
you end up trash.

659
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:15,766
With a trash girlfriend. You were
looking for someone better.

660
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:19,342
A classy girl with... education.

661
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:22,914
I like girls with culture who don't 
eat their takeout right out of a box.

662
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:23,906
Hm, like Bridget?

663
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,264
Bridget's never been to 
a museum in her life.

664
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:29,935
So you went looking for a girl 
with a little something upstairs.

665
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:31,414
Trolling through the 
museums and libraries

666
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:33,987
till you found her, then 
you followed her home.

667
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:35,711
Looked to see if there 
was a cat in her window,

668
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:38,393
'cause that meant she 
was all alone in there.

669
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:42,494
And you got that talent 
for getting into tiny places.

670
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:49,468
Talk or don't talk.

671
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,048
It doesn't matter anymore.

672
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,636
Bridget gave us your razor.

673
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:58,150
It's at the DNA lab right now. / Yep.

674
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,354
We're just waiting for the official word.

675
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,631
I used to slide down the laundry 
chute at my best friend's building.

676
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:21,223
You can't believe how narrow it was.

677
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:24,528
I'd get into the neighbor's 
house and steal things.

678
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:31,280
It was like the one thing that 
I was really, really good at,

679
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,566
getting into small places.

680
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,907
I was, like, known for it.

681
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:43,029
That's sensational, Carl.

682
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:51,271
I told you... I was ready soon,
soon as the weather changed.

683
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,747
Yeah. You told us.

684
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:57,092
I just had these demons.

685
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,539
Is that why you joined the military?

686
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:01,095
To maybe get some discipline?

687
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:04,600
I kept them down for a while, 
but they came back.

688
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,974
The... one in Oregon was a fighter,
like the other ont that... / Gail.

689
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,482
The girl you murdered.

690
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,909
I just wanted to...

691
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:19,200
date her, you know, not hurt her.

692
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:52,285
Quiet. I am sorry.

693
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,482
Studying, huh?

694
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:58,619
- College girl?
- Let me... go!

695
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:06,311
You should be more careful.

696
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,495
That window's wide open.

697
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,309
Gail. / Be quite.

698
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:11,091
What's going on there?

699
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:12,698
Be quite. Quite. Quite.

700
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:16,671
Sounds like more than 
reading. /  Quite. Quite.

701
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:24,118
I just wish we could've met 
under different circumstances.

702

00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:17,963
# Nothing will drive them away #

707
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:22,125
# We can be Heroes #

708
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:26,977
# Just for one day #

709
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:30,918
# We can be us #

710
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:36,376
# Just for one day #

711
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:44,877
# I, I can remember #

712
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:53,561
# Standing by the wall #

713
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:56,811
# And the guns #

714
00:41:56,811 --> 00:42:01,737
# Shot above our heads #

715
00:42:01,737 --> 00:42:04,967
# And we kissed #

716
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:10,264
# As though nothing could fall #

717
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:13,586
# And the shame #

718
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:18,894
# Was on the other side #

719
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:22,836
# Oh we can beat them #

720
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:27,233
# For ever and ever #

721
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:31,610
# Then we can be Heroes #

722
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:37,099
# Just for one day #

723
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:46,883
# We can be Heroes #

724
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:55,837
# We can be Heroes #

725
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:05,093
# We can be Heroes #

726
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:14,943
# We can be Heroes just for one day #
