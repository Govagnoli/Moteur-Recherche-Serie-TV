00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:04,450
 ¢Ü Helen Reddy's "I Am Woman" ¢Ü

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,932
 ¢Ü I am woman, hear me roar ¢Ü

3
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:09,894
 ¢Ü in numbers too big ignore ¢Ü

4
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:15,814
 ¢Ü and I know too much 
to go back and pretend ¢Ü

5
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,261
 ¢Ü 'cause I've heard it all before ¢Ü

6
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:21,240
 ¢Ü and I've been down there on the floor ¢Ü

7
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,090
That's it, Andi!
That's a winner!

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,815
Match point.

9
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:32,338
I need a sec.

10
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:35,892
Be right here.

11
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,241
 ¢Ü But look how much I gained ¢Ü

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:40,354
 ¢Ü if I have to ¢Ü

13
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:43,781
 ¢Ü I can do anything ¢Ü

14
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:45,952
 ¢Ü I am strong ¢Ü

15
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,345
That's my sister.

16
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:49,706
I know. Everyone knows.

17
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:53,256
Close it out, Andi. One more, 
and you're on the map with Billie Jean.

18
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,372
And Fritz goes the way of Bobby.

19
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:01,035
 ¢Ü You can bend but never break me ¢Ü

20
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,544
 ¢Ü 'cause it only serves to make me ¢Ü

21
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:09,133
 ¢Ü more determined to achieve 
my final goal ¢Ü

22
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:09,934
 ¢Ü and I come back even stronger ¢Ü

23
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,711
Run around it! 
 ¢Ü and I come back even stronger ¢Ü

24
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,721
 ¢Ü Not a novice any longer ¢Ü

25
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:19,674
 ¢Ü 'cause you've deepened 
the conviction in my soul  ¢Ü

26
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,880
Put it away!

27
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,481
Yes! Attagirl!

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, yes, yes!

29
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,262
 ¢Ü I am invincible ¢Ü

30
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:43,947
Nice match.

31
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:46,057
You've come a long way, baby.

32
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,885
Enjoy your moment, superstar.

33
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:57,043
 ¢Ü I am woman, watch me grow 
see me standing toe-to-toe ¢Ü

34
00:01:57,043 --> 00:02:02,713
 ¢Ü as I spread my lovin' arms  
across the land  ¢Ü

35
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:05,656
 ¢Ü but I'm still an embryo  ¢Ü

36
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:08,576
 ¢Ü with a long, long way to go  ¢Ü

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,525
My sister was a great tennis player.

38
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,371
Born with a racket, as they say.

39
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:56,832
She played for Penn university?

40
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:59,191
Number one varsity, her first year.

41
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,272
Sounds like a star.

42
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,232
My dad said given another year or two,
she would have gone to Wimbledon.

43
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:06,132
But then she was murdered.

44
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,826
Remember Billie Jean King
and Bobby Riggs?

45
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:12,630
Battle of the sexes.
We won.

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,212
Few weeks later, Penn U had its own 
version of that match, for a fund-raiser.

47
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,336
Andi for the ladies?

48
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:19,524
And like Billie Jean, she won.

49
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,252
The next morning, she was found dead.

50
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,867
Strangled, in her room.

51
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,336
Cops look at the guy she beat?

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,681
For quite a while.

53
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,506
Nothing stuck?

54
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,401
Then her case just kind of stalled.

55
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,380
It's been a dark cloud
hanging over us 33 years.

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,000
Sure.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,996
What brings you in now, Emily?

58
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,439
My dad's moving to Florida.

59
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,749
I've been cleaning out his house.

60
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:47,823
I found a bunch of Andi's
old tennis stuff, including this.

61
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:49,414
Is that a towel?

62
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,946
The one she used
the night of the match.

63
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:54,130
It was still in her bag.
I got sick after I handled it.

64
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,893
Poison control found traces
of sodium nitrate.

65
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:59,328
It's, uh, lethal in high doses.

66
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:01,187
Someone really wanted to hurt Andi.

67
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,902
I don't want to be a bother,

68
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:06,145
but I thought maybe
it was related to her murder.

69
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,221
Could have been the doer's first attempt.

70
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,534
So find out who dosed this towel...

71
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:16,639
maybe we find the person
who brought down a rising star.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/03/26

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,752
- What'd you do this time?
- Nothing.

81
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:41,032
Ah, I missed dinner.
Big deal, right?

82
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,415
Because of work, or because
you were at the bar?

83
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,562
Ran into a guy I know.
I buy one, he buys one, we talk.

84
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,880
Next thing I know, it's 2:30.

85
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,520
Julie wait up?

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,782
In that creepy rocking chair I hate.

87
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,530
You gotta do something about this.

88
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,250
It's a circle game.

89
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,183
It'll work out.

90
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,252
So where are we going?

91
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,608
Victim's family.

92
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:10,973
Coed strangled after a battle
of the sexes tennis match.

93
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:14,393
I need an egg sandwich for this.

94
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,440
Andi Simmons, 18.

95
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,206
Found strangled in her dorm room,

96
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,586
day after her big win.

97
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,188
No sign of forced entry.

98
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,538
So she knew her attacker.
Any candidates?

99
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,346
A Fritz Adams, the guy she beat.

100
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:35,328
Men's number one player,
cops' number one suspect.

101
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,898
Senior guy loses to a freshman girl?

102
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,266
It's kinda hard to live down.

103
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,700
Especially when it's splashed
all over the front page.

104
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,226
No alibi, but they still
couldn't build a case against him.

105
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:46,858
Family lawyered him up,
job fizzled.

106
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,465
Other lead was some hang-up
phone calls Andi was getting.

107
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,047
Someone calling and whispering "superstar."

108
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,695
- Could've been Fritz?
- He never copped to it.

109
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,624
Any chance this poisoned towel was a prank?

110
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,980
The dose was practically lethal.

111
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,457
Where do they get the sodium nitrate?

112
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:06,380
Chemistry building at Penn U
is right next to the courts.

113
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,648
Well, the towel narrows it down
to someone close to Andi.

114
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,147
With access to her gear,
the night of the match.

115
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:12,809
Thins out the suspect pool.

116
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:16,234
Vera and Jeffries are with
the family, getting names.

117
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,886
Well, we already know one.
Fritz.

118
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,265
Might as well start with the top guy.

119
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:32,053
- See you're pulling up stakes.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:33,814
Dad's had enough Philly winters.

121
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,659
My sister lives in Palm beach.

122
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,971
Be nice to live near family.

123
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,297
So this towel Emily found could be 
a new direction on Andi's murder.

124
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:44,850
If my girl was poisoned,
I don't see why you missed it.

125
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,349
- Cause of death was strangulation.
- I know that.

126
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,562
And standard autopsy
doesn't test for poison.

127
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,056
The point is,
someone had it out for Andi.

128
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,730
Any ideas why?

129
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,407
Envy.

130
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:57,935
'Cause of her talent?

131
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,902
What she had was rare.

132
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,930
This was no dime a dozen kid.

133
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,324
Know who might have tampered
with her gear that night, planted this towel?

134
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,857
Of course I do.

135
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,980
The guy you've been looking 
at for 33 years.

136
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,708
- Fritz Adams.
- Maybe this towel finally nails the bastard.

137
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,984
'Cause I know for a fact
he loaned her another one.

138
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:18,517
When was that?

139
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:21,579
Week before the big match.

140
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,200
Saw it with my own eyes.

141
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:30,842
 ¢Ü Carole king's "I feel the earth move" ¢Ü

142
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:34,840
 ¢Ü I feel the earth move
under my feet ¢Ü

143
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,870
 ¢Ü I feel the sky tumbling down ¢Ü

144
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,623
 ¢Ü I feel my heart start to trembling ¢Ü

145
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,288
Run around that, Andi.

146
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,135
I would've had it,
but I broke a string.

147
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,410
You sweat a lot for a girl.

148
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,144
Borg sweats a lot.

149
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:06,750
Is that what the headband's about?

150
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,388
Okay, you got your racket.
Get back out there, kiddo.

151
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:14,259
You know, most people, when they go away 
to college, bring their stereo, not their dad.

152
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,044
Your serve.

153
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:33,128
Damn it!

154
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:36,793
Screw this! Screw this match!

155
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:39,287
- Fritz...come down.
- This is rigged, lose-lose.

156
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,324
- What's your problem?
- I'm screwed, that's my problem.

157
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:43,235
I never should've agreed to this thing.

158
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:47,037
It doesn't help me if I win.
I'm supposed to win, you're a girl.

159
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:48,243
Thanks a lot.

160
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:51,329
But if I lose, I'm over.

161
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,267
So win.

162
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:04,354
Fritz made a big show of laughing it off
when Andi won the big match,

163
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,641
but I'd seen his true colors.

164
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,363
All his fears come true?

165
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:10,551
He tanked the season.

166
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,379
Never even tried the pros.

167
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,966
Did you see him with Andi
after the match at all?

168
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,680
Last time we saw her was out
on court one after her win.

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,097
Surrounded by people toasting her.
Right, Em?

170
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:29,523
It's how I always remember her.

171
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,148
Nothing's been right since.

172
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:36,636
Lost the brightest light in my life.

173
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,742
Fritz Adams?

174
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:51,847
Hi, there.
Here for the ladies' clinic?

175
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,184
Do we look like we're here
for the ladies' clinic?

176
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:57,594
- What then?
- Detective Rush, Miller.

177
00:09:57,594 --> 00:09:59,955
It's about Andi Simmons.

178
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,777
I've been down this road
way too many times.

179
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,533
The towel turned up, Fritz.

180
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,340
That supposed to mean 
something to me? / You tell us.

181
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,705
I give up.

182
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:17,505
The towel Andi used at your match,
was laced with sodium nitrate.

183
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:21,021
Sodium what? Ladies, I'm a jock.
I don't do chemicals.

184
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:25,355
Well, maybe fear of getting whipped
by a girl got you to crack a book.

185
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:28,363
I lost a match.
That's no reason to kill someone.

186
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,531
Unless your temper got the best of you.

187
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:34,279
We hear you had a real meltdown
with Andi at a practice match.

188
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,759
You ever see John Mcenroe chuck 
a racket? That's just tennis.

189
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,076
But after she beat you, 
you lost any chance of going pro.

190
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:43,858
I had a one-time problem with Andi.

191
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,846
That was nothing compared with the girls
she was with day to day.

192
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,360
Her teammates?

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,533
Talk about a bunch of hens
with ruffled feathers.

194
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,177
Who was the most ruffled?

195
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,151
Grace Andersen.

196
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,966
- The team captain?
- And my girlfriend at the time.

197
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,270
She have something against skirts?

198
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,478
Let's just say she's
more Billie Jean than Chrissie.

199
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:13,109
She's been in the paper
like three times this week. / Four.

200
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:15,498
Oh! Thanks for joining us.

201
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,975
Am I late? I'm sorry.

202
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,131
- We have a challenge match.
- I know.

203
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:22,233
It was supposed to start 10 minutes ago.

204
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:24,676
I was doing an interview.

205
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:28,679
We all know you're a big superstar, Andi,
but tennis should come first.

206
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,927
You're right.
This guy just kept talking.

207
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:32,553
Tell him you have practice and 
that being late is frowned upon.

208
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,644
I will. Promise.

209
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,805
Look, why don't you take a game
for every minute I'm late?

210
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,945
Oh, right.

211
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,844
No, I mean it.
I deserve it.

212
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:45,169
It's 6-0, 4-0 yours.
Two games away from winning.

213
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,396
And you can serve.

214
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:55,213
Andi still won?

215
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,616
0-6, 6-4, 6-0.

216
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,332
Grace didn't take a game?

217
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:03,368
She was a good captain,
didn't vent in public.

218
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,544
But behind closed doors?

219
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:09,117
She had a lot of bad nights.
Andi was making her crazy.

220
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,382
Think she could have poisoned this towel?

221
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:15,662
Grace was a grind
on the court and off.

222
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:18,535
Doesn't sound like an answer to me.

223
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:19,913
She was a chem major.

224
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:24,273
Spent half her time in the lab,
and the other half on the courts.

225
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:29,269
- Giving her means, motive...
- And opportunity.

226
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:38,433
So Andi's a phenom,

227
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,979
Grace is a grinder.

228
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,203
And they hate each other.

229
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,543
- Like Mozart 
- and that other guy.

230
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,002
Exactly. 
Saw it when I played college ball.

231
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:49,183
No one hates god-given talent
like a second-stringer.

232
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:52,200
Excuse me.
You're Will, right?

233
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:54,487
Yes.

234
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,745
I'm Julie, Nick Vera's wife.

235
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,337
Of course.

236
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:02,586
Uh, this is John Stillman,
Scotty Valens.

237
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,530
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

238
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,505
Nicky says nice things.

239
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:10,058
Um, he's out on the street,
have a seat. I'll call him.

240
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,495
We got some god-awful coffee.

241
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,681
No, that's okay.

242
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:17,604
Could you just give him this?

243
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,245
Uh, sure.

244
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,586
Thanks.

245
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:24,875
- Nice seeing you again.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,897
Bye.

247
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:32,421
Way to go.

248
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:35,465
Crap.
I met her once, four years ago.

249
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,966
That'll help his cause,
trying to get out of the woodshed.

250
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,991
I didn't know things were so bad.

251
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,811
Well, he didn't seem worried yesterday.

252
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,572
But this ain't a good sign.

253
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:54,616
Met your old boyfriend, Grace.

254
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:58,343
Fritz Adams? / Oh, really?
Is he bald and fat?

255
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,070
I take it you're not in touch.

256
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,350
Uh, things didn't end well with us.

257
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,268
He said you had a little
problem with Andi Simmons.

258
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,622
Oh, I wouldn't call it little.

259
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:08,322
A lot of fur flying between you two?

260
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:12,136
I was number one for three years,
and then Andi takes it away.

261
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,991
For a high-strung, type-A bulimic 
like me? Big problem.

262
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:19,218
- You work all that out?
- Yes, thanks.

263
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:23,142
So when Andi and Fritz
played in the battle of the sexes,

264
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:26,130
- who were you rooting for?
- Oh, I was Switzerland, neutral.

265
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,546
I know if I'm choosing between my 
boyfriend and a girl I despise,

266
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,253
I'm going with the guy.

267
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,867
Maybe that's where the towel comes in.

268
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:38,633
Andi's towel was laced
with sodium nitrate.

269
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,020
And I'm Marie Curie?

270
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,429
Crossed our mind.

271
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:44,397
I had a lot of things
to work through back then,

272
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,355
- aforementioned emotional issues.
- But?

273
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:50,605
I was in a study group the night 
she was killed, for one thing,

274
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:53,573
- with three other people.
- We'll need those names.

275
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:57,092
And more importantly, Andi's win 
actually meant something to me.

276
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:00,620
- Women's lib, you know.
- Oh, boy.

277
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,657
Was Andi a big activist?

278
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,808
No. And that was a problem.

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,446
You look great, you know.

280
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:22,620
You don't have to do that.

281
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:29,438
MYOB, okay?

282
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,539
"I don't really have 
an opinion about title IX.

283
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,791
- "I just want to play tennis."
- What?

284
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,741
- Tell me you were misquoted.
- Um, no.

285
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:47,232
Title IX protects women athletes.

286
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,416
- I just think of myself as an athlete.
- Hey...

287
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,517
leave your little backyard, kid.

288
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,970
There's a revolution going on.

289
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:59,311
Ever wonder why we have to use the chem 
building bathroom to change for practice?

290
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:00,643
I guess I never thought about it.

291
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,480
The guys have a locker room.

292
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,395
According to Fritz, it's beautiful.

293
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:10,813
Title IX gets us a locker room, a van, 
decent budget, same as the guys.

294
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:13,660
I care about tennis, not politics.

295
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,599
Hey, bambi, wake up!
This is our moment.

296
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,880
You're our golden girl.

297
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,540
And I'm not gonna let you blow it.

298
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,785
Sounds like the coach was 
a dragon lady.

299
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,338
Breathing fire all over Andi.

300
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,555
Lot of sore points between them?

301
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:36,321
Biggest one was Andi's dad 
wanted Susan fired,

302
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,627
not that it happened.

303
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,053
Because Andi died first.

304
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:42,117
I guess that's true.

305
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:45,177
You think Susan could've harmed her?

306
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:46,975
She was radical.

307
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:50,853
Believed in making change
by any means necessary.

308
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,537
I ain't doing that interview.

309
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:01,765
You remember the battle of
the sexes match in '73?

310
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:06,161
Court one, Andi Simmons
brought Fritz Adams to his knees.

311
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,910
That was a great day.
I enjoyed it.

312
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,186
Good for the cause.

313
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,373
Knocked the bastards down a peg.

314
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:17,209
Fair to say you take a pretty
extreme view on politics? / Have to.

315
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,450
No one gives you an inch without a fight.

316
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,246
And now, you've climbed all
the way up to athletic director.

317
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:28,079
Say what you mean.

318
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,921
If Andi was getting in the way
of your agenda...

319
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:34,517
She was good for my agenda.
She just needed enlightenment.

320
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:37,106
We also heard her dad wanted you fired.

321
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,760
'Cause he didn't want to stop coaching her.

322
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,512
But after Andi died,
you kept your job.

323
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,442
I hear you.

324
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:49,771
So? / Bill was a tennis dad,
overreaching pain in the ass.

325
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,368
We tussled over Andi.

326
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,798
Both wanted your piece of her.

327
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:54,687
'Cause she was so special.

328
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,647
But we came together
when we ran into a real enemy.

329
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,611
Run around, run around. 
Nice!

330
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,105
And put it away!

331
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,629
We just had a three hour practice, Bill.

332
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:17,318
- Don't start.
- She's my player.

333
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:19,238
Who put a racket in her hands
when she was four years old?

334
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,384
Was that you, Susan,
or was that me?

335
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:24,765
So this is the superstar
they're all talking about.

336
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,237
Arnold Brown, athletic director.

337
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:29,209
Oh, hey, hello,
good to meet you.

338
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,710
Bill and Andi Simmons.

339
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,332
- They say you're the next Billie Jean King.
- I'd like to be.

340
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:38,080
And I hear there's a battle 
of the sexes match scheduled?

341
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,504
Fritz Adams and I are playing,
number one against number one.

342
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,546
Sounds like something
you dreamed up, Susan.

343
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:48,318
Just trying to raise money,
since we've got such a crap budget.

344
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:53,252
Let me guess. The trolls at the women's
center put you up to this.

345
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:57,154
No. I want to play.
I want to win.

346
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:01,676
Well, that certainly would 
be interesting, uh...

347
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,404
but problematic, too.

348
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,099
Why?

349
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,320
These are complicated times, Andi.

350
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,018
A lot of demands being made.

351
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:13,935
I'm just going out there to play.
It's not complicated for me.

352
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:17,494
Still, this title IX business
is a slippery slope.

353
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:19,125
We don't want to embarrass the university,

354
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,640
and we have an obligation 
to men's athletics.

355
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,799
Embarrass? This kid is dynamite.
She's gonna make you proud.

356
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,564
It's harmless enough to
have an exhibition game.

357
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:30,599
But an upset could stir the pot.

358
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,982
It'll be bad for everyone.

359
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:37,640
You mean, I should throw the match?

360
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,439
Due respect, I doubt Fritz needs the help.

361
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,605
You haven't seen what this girl can do.

362
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,151
And I always play to win.

363
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:49,833
Maybe I wasn't clear.
An upset is not a possibility.

364
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,283
And I'll be watching.

365
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:02,157
To him, that was the last word.

366
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,804
He was so sure Andi
would just obey him.

367
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,225
And lose on purpose?

368
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:09,159
In his mind, that's what 
they had agreed to.

369
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,909
But then Andi won.

370
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,553
And was dead the next day.

371
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:23,312
The Penn athletic director, Arnold Brown, 
died four years ago.

372
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,401
Dead suspect. Love that.

373
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:28,433
He's all over these articles
on title IX, big opponent.

374
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:33,260
The same guy who wrote those stories
covered Andi and women's tennis, Eric Witt.

375
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,773
I know that name.

376
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:37,430
He writes a sports column
for the Philly post.

377
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,453
Well, maybe he can tell you how the A.D.
took it when Andi disobeyed him.

378
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,430
Heading over there.

379
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,709
You doing okay, Nicky?

380
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:49,737
Going home tonight.

381
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:51,635
By invitation?

382
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,678
Ambush.

383
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:59,525
She'll give me her come-to-Jesus,
I'll beg forgiveness, we'll settle back in.

384
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,108
Familiar drill, huh?

385
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:07,930
One that's getting
less and less interesting.

386
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,883
May be time to change it up.

387
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:19,602
A.D. Brown went ballistic,
when Andi won that match.

388
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:22,935
Yeah, because now she's the
poster child for title IX.

389
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:24,764
And he wanted things 
to stay just like they were.

390
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:26,882
Women athletes, back of the bus.

391
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,015
So maybe he retaliated after Andi won?

392
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:31,611
Actually, I can vouch for
his whereabouts that night.

393
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:35,124
- Yeah?
- He was at the paper with me.

394
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:36,539
Doing what?

395
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,104
Breathing down my neck.
Didn't want me to glorify her in the story.

396
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:42,979
But you kind of did, anyway.

397
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,148
You should have seen my first draft.

398
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:49,613
You get any heat from the other players
for all the press you gave Andi?

399
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:51,653
Grace Andersen didn't like it.

400
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:54,446
Well, Grace has an alibi.

401
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,655
Kind of relieved to hear that.

402
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,806
Why's that?

403
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:04,097
There... 
there was an incident at a reception.

404
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:05,237
Go on.

405
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:10,048
It was the night before the match,
at an athletic alumni event.

406
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:13,009
Drinks were flowing pretty good.

407
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:37,821
Hi, everyone.

408
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:45,246
Where's the attractive headband?

409
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,754
Hey, sport.

410
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:59,108
- What's the problem?
- I don't know what they get out of it.

411
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:02,402
- Out of what?
- Treating me like that.

412
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:07,837
Lets them win for a second.
Off court, since they can't do it on.

413
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,239
Oh, no! It's the superstar!

414
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,073
Don't say that.

415
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:17,183
I've been getting some weird calls.

416
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,708
Well, it's the price of fame.

417
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:23,120
I come in peace, Andi, to apologize.

418
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,013
- Forget it.
- No, I gotta!

419
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:30,715
I gotta apologize for yelling 
the other day, when we played.

420
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,338
You're yelling now, too.

421
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,449
You're funny.

422
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,758
And, uh, foxy, too.

423
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:40,635
Fritz, stop it.

424
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,001
You're, you're drunk, sport.

425
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,021
What did you call me, twit boy?

426
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:53,957
Hey, Eric.

427
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:56,496
- Hi, Grace.
- Get ready.

428
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:58,694
You're gonna have
a big story tomorrow.

429
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:04,049
- What about?
- Believe me, you'll know.

430
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:13,529
You didn't think to mention this
when Andi turned up dead?

431
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:17,565
I just thought Grace was venting.

432
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,805
I plead love-sick college kid.

433
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,543
I never thought my Grace
could hurt someone.

434
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:27,126
"Your" Grace?

435
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:30,420
I'd been covering her for three years.

436
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,702
Had a crush.

437
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:34,688
Occupational hazard.

438
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:37,456
You seeing it with a clear head now?

439
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,521
Gotta admit.

440
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,583
Always wondered what she meant by that.

441
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:54,749
You said you and Fritz broke up, Grace,
but never mentioned why.

442
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:56,382
He was a bad boyfriend.

443
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:59,452
Night before the match,
we hear he was all over Andi.

444
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,306
Pawing her right in front of you.

445
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:04,206
He did that kind of thing.
Charming, huh?

446
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:11,113
Well, this night, it ticked you off enough
to promise Eric Witt a big story, right?

447
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:14,292
- Premeditation is murder one, Grace.
- I have an alibi.

448
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:16,111
So maybe someone else
did your dirty work.

449
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:18,406
I wasn't talking about Andi,
that wasn't the story.

450
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:20,290
What then?

451
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,625
The towel.

452
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:28,535
I soaked it in sodium nitrate
at the chem lab.

453
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:32,789
Okay. / But the dose wasn't lethal.
I made sure of that.

454
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,163
You wanted to poison Andi
so she'd lose the match?

455
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,760
No, the towel was meant for Fritz.

456
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,522
Your bad boyfriend.

457
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:42,148
Have you ever been dragged 
through the mud

458
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:45,311
so many times by a guy that you...

459
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,488
lash out in an inappropriate way?

460
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:52,714
You consider poisoning someone
"inappropriate"?

461
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:54,858
He humiliated me.

462
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,787
So you wanted to humiliate him.

463
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:58,573
Make sure he lost.

464
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:01,530
But he didn't end up with the towel.

465
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,220
Late in the match,
Andi grabbed his towel by mistake.

466
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,555
Afterwards, I tried to get it back.

467
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,095
Andi?

468
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,250
I feel dizzy.

469
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,542
- The champagne, maybe.
- Maybe.

470
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:28,389
- You don't have to help me.
- I want to.

471
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:35,064
You were great out there.

472
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:38,146
Think maybe now we'll get the stuff
Susan wants for the team?

473
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,794
I hope so.

474
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:44,451
Me, too.
'Cause this bathroom is really bad.

475
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,284
Grace, I know I screwed it up somehow.

476
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:57,865
But I'd like to be friends with you guys.

477
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,298
It wasn't you.
It was us.

478
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:06,993
I think I have to get better
at being with people.

479
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:09,660
I've spent so much time
playing tennis, but...

480
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,553
the only real friend I have is my dad.

481
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:21,334
We're all going out tomorrow night.
Trying this new "tex-mex" thing.

482
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:25,192
- You want to come?
- Yeah.

483
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:28,472
- Andi?
- That's my dad.

484
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:31,934
Come on, kiddo, we gotta
go over these numbers.

485
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:38,499
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.

486
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,620
Andi's dad took her home?

487
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,151
Yeah.

488
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:53,667
He didn't tell you that?

489
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,225
Do you really have to bring this to work?
Embarrass me there?

490
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,700
I don't know where else to find you.

491
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,430
Okay.

492
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:35,660
Sitting target.
Throw your daggers.

493
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:40,478
- Something's different this time.
- Really?

494
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:43,035
'Cause to me, it's exactly the same.

495
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,106
I go AWOL for a couple hours,

496
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,667
I don't call you on the dot when I say 
I will, and you go off the rails.

497
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,570
- Right.
- And a small thing like

498
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,466
a guy coming home late turns 
into a three-hour referendum

499
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,737
on all the cheap things
Nick Vera's ever done.

500
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:59,444
Not this time.

501
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:02,609
I get a pass tonight, why?

502
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,099
Usually I wait up and worry.

503
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,893
Where is he?
Who's he with? Is she pretty?

504
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,641
I been walking the line.

505
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,009
When your girlfriend from high school
showed up last year?

506
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,855
Nothing happened with her.

507
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:15,703
I came to your work.

508
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:18,443
I watched you from the car.

509
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:22,602
- To check on me.
- No.

510
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:25,710
To see what you liked.

511
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:31,029
She was wearing this beautiful white coat.

512
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:34,420
So, the next day, I went out 
and bought one just like it.

513
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,621
- Jules...
- Wore it for months.

514
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:44,355
- But...
- you didn't notice.

515
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:47,736
And it didn't keep you home.

516
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,049
Asking a lot of a coat.

517
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,233
Anyway...

518
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:02,763
the other night, I waited.

519
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:05,609
But I didn't worry.

520
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:11,343
And when I heard you come in, 
I wasn't glad.

521
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,167
I wished you were still gone.

522
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,591
Well, that is different.

523
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,295
I think it's time, Nicky.

524
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:38,538
- What about this baby thing?
- What?

525
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,645
Maybe we gotta do it now.

526
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,725
You have to be able to offer
a good home for that.

527
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:44,796
It could save us, Jules.
Bring us together.

528
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:47,567
This isn't a good home.

529
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,588
I'm done.

530
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:57,468
So you saying this, 12 years in?

531
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:02,781
Talk me out of it.

532
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:29,966
You told us the last time 
you saw Andie was out on court one.

533
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:33,338
- That's right.
- But that was a lie.

534
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:40,133
What? / Someone saw you leave 
with her later. Headed back to the dorm.

535
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:49,749
I have a... 
a lot of regrets in my life.

536
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,590
The worst one was that night.

537
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,718
Did you hurt your daughter?

538
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,135
Of course not.

539
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:57,564
Then what?

540
00:31:57,564 --> 00:32:00,465
I've tried to forget it.

541
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:04,247
Our last conversation.

542
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:07,404
You had a whole life together, Bill.

543
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:10,937
The last time you spoke
doesn't define all that.

544
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:13,488
I was more than her dad.

545
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:16,792
I was her coach, her mentor.

546
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,294
And she was my best friend.

547
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:21,754
I couldn't give that up.

548
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:25,490
But Andi wanted something else?

549
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:28,932
Friends of her own.

550
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:32,674
A life outside of tennis.

551
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:36,929
The last time I saw my girl...

552
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:41,430
I was trying to keep her
from any of that.

553
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:45,471
Nice work out there, kiddo.

554
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,932
Nine unforced errors, though.

555
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,705
- Two double faults.
- Still, I played well.

556
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,419
But you're still using
that overhead backhand.

557
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:56,887
- It just feels right.
- But it's not disciplined.

558
00:32:56,887 --> 00:33:00,099
After all the buckets we did,
I don't see why you fall back on junk.

559
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,880
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

560
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,040
Were you drinking tonight?

561
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,958
- I had some champagne.
- Andi...

562
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:14,499
I'm afraid we're losing our focus.

563
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,199
Who's that at this hour?

564
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,863
Someone keeps calling and hanging up.

565
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:24,093
- Is it a boyfriend?
- No.

566
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:26,664
'Cause that would explain
why your tennis is suffering.

567
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:28,638
I don't have a boyfriend,

568
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:33,577
but I am starting to make friends,
I think.

569
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,822
You know what? I made a mistake.

570
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:42,384
- College isn't right for you.
- But I'm just starting to like it.

571
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:44,126
It's too distracting.
We should be on the tour.

572
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:47,577
We'll train for a few months,
hit the tri-state tournaments...

573
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,001
Hello!

574
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:54,557
Who is this?

575
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,231
Dad... / You sleep off that alcohol.
We'll pack up in the morning.

576
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,476
But I want to stay here.

577
00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:03,811
We're going on tour, Andi,
and that's the end of it.

578
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,222
Dad, that's not what I want!

579
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:07,230
I know what you want better than you do.

580
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,614
We've got something special here,
and we're not throwing it away.

581
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,401
- We?
- That's right, we!

582
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:14,440
Who put a racket in your hand
when you were four years old? / You did.

583
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,966
Who took you to every tournament, 
every lesson? / You.

584
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:19,901
I spent 14 years
making you what you are.

585
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:22,512
You act like you're not even grateful.

586
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:37,736
I didn't want her to get over me.

587
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,821
Didn't matter in the end.

588
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,925
I lost my girl.

589
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:47,681
You have another girl.

590
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,596
You ever find out who that caller was?

591
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:55,466
Wrong number, he said.

592
00:34:56,014 --> 00:35:00,104
Then he called me something.

593
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:02,659
"Sport."

594
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:06,209
It stuck with me,
because it was odd.

595
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,365
Occupational hazard.

596
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:15,299
Falling for the athletes you covered.
Isn't that what you said? / Yeah.

597
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:18,983
- That's why you were sweet on Grace.
- Is that a crime?

598
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:23,002
No, but in '73, you were done
writing about Grace.

599
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,824
Now you were writing about Andi.

600
00:35:26,785 --> 00:35:30,704
I might have nursed a light crush on her.

601
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,891
Well, you put her photo
in the paper over and over.

602
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:35,471
Nothing lightweight about that.

603
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:37,769
Something might've been growing.

604
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,001
Between you and Andi?

605
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:45,717
We might even have ended up together,
if she wasn't killed.

606
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,225
No.

607
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,548
How would you know?

608
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:56,909
Well, I know guys like you.

609
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:00,373
Always setting your sights too high
on girls that are,

610
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:03,668
- well, out of your league.
- That's not true.

611
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:06,612
And when they give you the brush-off,
you get frustrated.

612
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:08,383
Bitter.

613
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,810
"Bitch thinks she's better than me?"

614
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,236
I don't know what you're saying.

615
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,810
Andi didn't have feelings for you.

616
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,276
She never would've.

617
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,506
She was a big tennis star 
on the verge of going pro,

618
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:21,146
and you were just this little...

619
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,580
- fan.
- I wasn't just some fan.

620
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,704
I put Andi Simmons on the map!

621
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:36,198
- I know you called her that night.
- Wrong.

622
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:40,388
- And that you came to her room.
- No, I didn't.

623
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:51,453
Well, that's the paper
that ran after she won.

624
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:53,654
Didn't hit campus till the next day.

625
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:56,323
How else did it get
in her room that night,

626
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:59,307
underneath her dead body?

627
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:02,856
Sport.

628
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:09,785
I just came to show her...

629
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:12,337
what I did for her.

630
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:14,407
And she wasn't even grateful.

631
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:18,157
No, she wasn't.

632
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,293
Eric.

633
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,552
- Is someone here?
- No. Why?

634
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:35,117
- Well, I just didn't want to interrupt.
- It's pretty late.

635
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:39,982
Yeah. This can't wait.
Here, go ahead, read it.

636
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:44,150
You're the story. The superstar.

637
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,214
You know, Eric, that word
is really starting to creep me out.

638
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:51,556
I'm the one who named you that.

639
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:54,111
It caught on, and everyone
calls you that now,

640
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:57,185
but I was the first one.

641
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:03,912
- Anyway...
- I was the first one to see it.

642
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,023
- And I see something else.
- What's that?

643
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:13,172
I see how great we could be together.

644
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:15,382
We?

645
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:19,742
Eric!

646
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:22,080
This is what you want.

647
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,942
How do you know?
You don't even know me!

648
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:27,378
I don't know you?
I write about you every day. / So?

649
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:29,236
Andi, geez, I'm the reason
you're in the paper!

650
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:34,976
No, you're not! It's me, not we.
It's my life.

651
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:38,837
I don't need people 
telling me what I want.

652
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,846
Boy, this has gone to your head.

653
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:43,417
You should leave.

654
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,839
You've gotten really stuck up.

655
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,184
I'm the one who made you here,
you might show some gratitude.

656
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:54,100
You're not even grateful.

657
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:58,386
Take your paper and go.

658
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,484
And stop calling me and hanging up.

659
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:04,429
I know it's you.

660
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:10,659
It's really pathetic.

661
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,438
- I'm the one who made you!
- Eric!

662
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:28,080
You hear me, Andy!

663
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,178
I made you!

664
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:51,025
 ¢Ü Elton John's "Your song" ¢Ü

665
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:56,006
 ¢Ü It's a little bit funny ¢Ü

666
00:39:56,006 --> 00:40:00,125
 ¢Ü this feeling inside ¢Ü

667
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:07,417
 ¢Ü I'm not one of those 
who can easily hide ¢Ü

668
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:14,620
 ¢Ü don't have much money 
but boy, if I did ¢Ü

669
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,412
 ¢Ü I'd buy a big house where ¢Ü

670
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:22,994
 ¢Ü we both could live ¢Ü

671
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,952
 ¢Ü if I was a sculptor ¢Ü

672
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:30,751
 ¢Ü but then again, no ¢Ü

673
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,835
 ¢Ü or a man who makes potions ¢Ü

674
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:39,330
 ¢Ü in a traveling show ¢Ü

675
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:46,416
 ¢Ü I know it's not much 
but it's the best I can do ¢Ü

676
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:54,290
 ¢Ü my gift is my song 
and this one's for you ¢Ü

677
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:59,988
 ¢Ü and you can tell everybody ¢Ü

678
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:03,373
 ¢Ü this is your song ¢Ü

679
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:10,787
 ¢Ü it may be quite simple 
but now that it's done ¢Ü

680
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:14,375
 ¢Ü I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind ¢Ü

681
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:19,305
 ¢Ü that I put down in words ¢Ü

682
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:23,670
 ¢Ü how wonderful life is ¢Ü

683
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,939
 ¢Ü while you're in the world ¢Ü

684
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:41,347
 ¢Ü so excuse me forgetting ¢Ü

685
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:45,220
 ¢Ü but these things I do ¢Ü

686
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:52,306
