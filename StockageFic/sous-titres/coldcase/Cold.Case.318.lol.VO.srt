00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:05,656
I can't do this.

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,099
This is insane.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,167
What am I thinking?

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,723
I can do this.

6
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:24,506
I'm as good as the next guy.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,233
Next.

8
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,616
What are you singing?

9
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:44,525
- "Willkommen"?
- Of course.

10
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,846
Give me your name, tell me
something about yourself.

11
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,002
Dennis Hofferman.

12
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:50,819
Um...

13
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,143
I'm just a cabdriver.

14
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:55,867
A singing cabdriver.
That's terrific.

15
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:58,690
I've never really sang
in public before. I've...

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,359
never done anything like this before.

17
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,407
That's fine.

21
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:22,338
You know what? Um...

22
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:23,487
maybe I'll just come back.

23
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,641
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

24
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:29,639
Why don't you just turn around,
face the back of the stage?

25
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:36,981
No prying eyes.
Just you, alone in your cab.

33
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:21,481
What's taking Dennis so long?

34
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:25,300
Clinton, go find him. Tell him 
we're minutes away, for Pete sake.

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,809
Dennis?

36
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:29,828
Showtime. Dennis?

37
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,607
And now!

38
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:05,077
Final time you're telling me guns 
and mess, you all, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,835
- Good morning, boss.
- Morning.

40
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:18,749
Detectives Rush and Vera,
this is Della Gardener, theater owner.

41
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:19,830
Morning.

42
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,087
Excuse me if I'm still trembling like a leaf.
It's been a very upsetting morning.

43
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:26,679
Stagehands were moving set furniture
out of storage and they dropped a piece.

44
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,372
Take it that's not a prop.

45
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:30,638
No, it's a real live .38.

46
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:33,760
Mrs. Gardener had bought 
the furniture used, a few years ago.

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,326
Got a very good deal on it.

48
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,044
I bet.
Who was the original owner?

49
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,848
Francisville community theater.

50
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,508
There was an unsolved murder 
there in 2002, place shut down.

51
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:48,611
This was the dresser from the set
of Fraulein Schneider's boardinghouse.

52
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,173
They were doing Cabaret.

53
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:59,163
Actor went out for a smoke before the show,
was shot and killed with a .38.

54
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:02,096
Wallet was missing and there'd 
been a series of holdups in the area.

55
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:05,008
But someone off the street wouldn't 
have been able to slip unnoticed

56
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,632
onto the stage, hide the gun.

57
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:10,732
So if this gun's the murder weapon,
shooter was from inside the theater.

58
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:14,564
We need to go back and look at 
actors, crew, whoever else was inside.

59

61
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,415
I hate musicals.

62
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,481
Well, you wouldn't if you'd seen 
me as Danny Zuko

63
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:30,422
in my eighth grade production of Grease.

64
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,417

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/04/02

78
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:09,079
Victim is Denise Hofferman.
35, cabdriver.

79
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,463
One of the most dangerous jobs there is,
and the guy gets shot doing a musical.

80
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,095
Was killed opening night,
before the curtain even went up.

81
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,160
Robbery theory seemed solid at the time.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,632
That part of Francisville
had a string of holdups, same M.O.

83
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:23,352
One shot to the chest,
close range, wallet gone.

84
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:25,723
Somebody sure wanted it
to look like a robbery.

85
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,214
Ballistics confirms the .38
is the murder weapon.

86
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:31,780
There was a fiance, Gloria Hill.

87
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,510
Let's talk to her first, see if Dennis 
was having trouble with anyone there.

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,096
Then we gotta talk to a bunch of actors.

89
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:39,948
Try and guess who's telling the truth.

90
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,453
Dennis was the sweetest guy I ever knew.

91
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:49,135
Honest to the bone.
And that's not so easy to find, you know?

92
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,991
Yeah. I do.

93
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,134
We were real happy.

94
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,867
About to set a wedding date, too.

95
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,363
You two meet here?

96
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,179
My family owns the place.

97
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,348
Dennis was right out of community college,

98
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:03,349
took it as a temporary job 
after his mom died.

99
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:04,727
But he stuck around.

100
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:09,053
Got comfortable, I guess.
But he had so much talent.

101
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,305
Was my leading man
right here in the garage.

102
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,597
What made him decide
to audition for Cabaret?

103
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:18,824
- Did he know someone at that theater?
- No.

104
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:21,186
He saw the sign driving by.

105
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,953
Said it was like a siren
went off in his head.

106
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:26,078
Week later, he auditioned.

107
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,853
How'd he get along with the group there?

108
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,133
There was some trouble
right from the beginning.

109
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,373
What kind of trouble?

110
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:36,132
Neither of us had any idea what 
a cutthroat world the theater was.

111
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,776
No nerves.
They're lucky to have you.

112
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,308
Thanks.

113
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:58,339
This show is about the danger...

114
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,082
of not facing the truth.

115
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:06,113
The truth about others,
and, most important,

116
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:08,779
the truth about yourself.

117
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,188
So I have a question.

118
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:19,328
Can you shut off your memory
and live in the now?

119
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:24,439
A community will form here
if and only if...

120
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,796
you...

121
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:30,168
trust...

122
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,918
me.
Trust me.

123
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,527
And why should you trust me?

124
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:42,717
Because I've acted with Uta Hagen on stage
and with Bobby Deniro in movies? No.

125
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:45,832
You should trust me...

126
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,310
because I'm the director.

127
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,352
Rehearsal!

128
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:55,427
Let me have my Sally over here,
my Cliff over here,

129
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:59,240
my emcee over there.

130
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:07,039
Shut off my memory. Live in the now. 
Wow. That's intense stuff.

131
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,979
- So you're playing Sally?
- Yep. Name's Nora.

132
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:13,206
I saw you at the audition.
You were really good.

133
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,323
God, I was so nervous.
I just, I wanted it so bad.

134
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,691
I can't believe I got a lead role.

135
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,058
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah, watch it.

136
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,236
- I was just... 
- So you think Cliff is the lead roll?

137
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,912
It's one of them, isn't it?

138
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:29,988
No, the emcee is the star of this show.
I'm in every damn scene.

139
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:33,218
Cliff is just some sucker who walks 
around and watches everybody.

140
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:35,081
I mean, you don't even have
your own song, man.

141
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,024
Listen, I'm sorry if I offended you.
Of course, the emcee is a lead role.

142
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:41,059
I don't think you're hearing me.
You get in my way,

143
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:46,550
you step in my space, and you ain't 
gonna make it to opening night.

144
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,491
Denny was so excited
about that first rehearsal,

145
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:59,562
he didn't even sleep the night before.

146
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,531
Then that Clinton had to ruin it for him.

147
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,119
What did Dennis think about Clinton?

148
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:07,172
He didn't mention it again, 
and I thought things got better.

149
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,271
Guess I was wrong.

150
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,241
- What can I get you guys?
- We're not here for the cosmos.

151
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,673
Oh, too bad, I make a mean one.

152
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,457
We've got some questions
about Dennis Hofferman.

153
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,662
I'm buried here.

154
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,899
Show's gonna start soon,
and I got to serve people.

155
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,087
Hey, you wouldn't want to lose your job.

156
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:40,174
Criminal record of yours
could make it hard to find work.

157
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,540
That's a cheap shot, man.

158
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,613
That theft charge is from way back.

159
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,856
Theft, possession,
trafficking stolen goods,

160
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,016
you were a real live gangbanger,
weren't you, Clinton?

161
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,738
I was messed up, yeah.

162
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:57,581
But that was before I got with the theater,
got off the street.

163
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,001
We heard you brought trouble
right in with you,

164
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,356
got tough on other actors,
threatened Dennis.

165
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,810
I learned real early how to play
tough to cover up being scared.

166
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,699
That's all it was, but I got over it.
And me and Denny got tight.

167
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,327
- You can ask anybody in the cast.
- We will.

168
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,460
Look, I had no reason 
to hurt anybody there.

169
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,938
That place turned my life around,
put me on a solid path.

170
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:19,548
I'm a family man now.

171
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:22,879
Problem is, we know someone
from inside killed Dennis.

172
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,759
And you're the only one with a rap sheet.

173
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,264
Let's just say that I wasn't the only one
with anger management issues.

174
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,641
You got something to say,
I suggest you let it fly.

175
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,224
Our big daddy director...

176
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,489
had a serious dark side.

177
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:42,537
Mama...

178
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:45,924
doesn't even have an inkling...

179
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,990
that I'm working in a nightclub

180
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,818
in a pair of lacy pants.

181
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,791
So, please, sir.

182
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,145
 ¢Ü if you run into my mama ¢Ü

183
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,921
 ¢Ü don't reveal my indiscretion ¢Ü

184
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:11,889
 ¢Ü Give a working girl a chance... ¢Ü

185
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:18,647
 ¢Ü Hush up, don't tell mama shush up ¢Ü

186
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:24,094
 ¢Ü don't tell mama 
don't tell mama, whatever you do... ¢Ü

187
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:28,177
 ¢Ü if you... 
if you... ¢Ü

188
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:32,307
Oh, my bad.
I forgot where I'm supposed to be.

189
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:33,872
I think my cross messed you guys up.

190
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:37,271
No, you guys were perfect.
I'm the idiot.

191
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:40,507
Found a whole new thing I'm awful at.
Dancing in heels.

192
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:41,896
Line, please!

193
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,977
If you had a secret,
you bet I would keep it.

194
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:47,049
 ¢Ü I would never tell on you ¢Ü

195
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,322
You think it's cute, that you
don't know what you're doing?

196
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:53,729
- Of course not, I...
- Nora, I actually believed in you.

197
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,186
Sally Bowles is supposed to be
a second-rate singer,

198
00:11:57,186 --> 00:12:02,294
but you are hovering below third-rate!
Try harder!

199
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:08,199
And the emcee is supposed to be
from the streets.

200
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,302
I want you to give me some 
of that dirt, that edge,

201
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:16,302
not this lazy punk attitude.
Try harder!

202
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:21,695
Lyle is just the music director,
and yet, he knows every word,

203
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:25,965
and you can't remember your own?
Pathetic!

204
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:30,011
I think they're both really talented.

205
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,849
I know you're a big shot in the business,

206
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,811
but that doesn't mean
you can treat people like that.

207
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:42,252
You think you know better 
than I do, cabbie?

208
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,924
I'm just saying you don't
have to be mean, that's all.

209
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:49,109
I will be and do whatever it takes
to get this show to the next level.

210
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,606
- Do you understand?
- I guess not.

211
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,134
Then let me explain.

212
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:58,002
My reputation is on the line here,
and I will crush anyone

213
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:04,006
before I let them embarrass me or
ruin what I have worked 30 years...

214
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,257
to build!

215
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:10,319
Take five!

216
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,603
- Good looking out.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,619
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,807
Dennis stood up for us.

219
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,774
I don't think Rafe
ever forgave him for that.

220
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:27,588
You saying that's motive for murder?

221
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,572
The thing is,

222
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:32,988
Rafe came asking me about guns
a few weeks before Dennis was killed.

223
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,120
What?

224
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,078
I know I should have said something,
but I'm the one with the record,

225
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,577
and I knew I'd be the one to get in trouble.

226
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:42,082
- For talking to him about guns?
- He wanted me to get him one.

227
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,412
You know, since I knew my way
around the streets.

228
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:48,554
So I did a .38.

229
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,853
Rafe Webb?

230
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,911
That's right.

231
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,566
Detectives Rush, Miller.

232
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,700
Lady cops, terrific.

233
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,926
Here to ask you about Dennis Hofferman.

234
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,276
What a tragedy that was.

235
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,516
Two years ago, I did Ibsen.

236
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,791
I played the father of a dead child,

237
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,981
and I tapped into my feelings for Dennis.

238
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:29,435
- Got the best reviews of my life.
- Congratulations.

239
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,065
Rafe, we hear you got yourself a gun
a few weeks before Dennis died.

240
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:34,579
Well, how is that relevant?

241
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,270
Dennis was shot in a stick-up.

242
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,358
New information says otherwise.

243
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,474
Well, I, uh...

244
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:43,294
- I'm afraid I did get a gun.
- And why'd you do that?

245
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:47,088
I heard the cop movie "Blue blood"
was shooting in Philly.

246
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,856
I was going to audition.

247
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,659
I'm method.

248
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,471
I needed to tap into the emotions of 
holding a gun if I was going to play a cop.

249
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,378
So you bought a real one?

250
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,325
Yeah, I went to target practice, too,

251
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:03,774
and then the studio decided
to cast Blue blood out of Hollywood.

252
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,371
Where's the gun now, Rafe?

253
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:10,254
It was stolen out of my office
just a little time before the show.

254
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:13,628
- And you never mentioned this before?
- You see...

255
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:17,624
I bought it illegally,
so I couldn't exactly report it stolen.

256
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,065
That's kind of shaky, Rafe.

257
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,973
Especially since people
saw you and Dennis fighting.

258
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:23,722
Said you weren't too happy with him.

259
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,489
Our relationship was tumultuous, yes.

260
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:31,438
You see, my style is to tear actors down,
and then build them back up.

261
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:32,857
I don't shoot them.

262
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,337
We could bring him in right now
for buying the gun.

263
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,631
Might help him tap into
the emotions of jail time.

264
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,823
Look, I didn't kill Dennis,

265
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,368
and I don't know who did.

266
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:50,865
But there was a little situation
that Dennis had gotten himself into.

267
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:57,695
 ¢Ü I met this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü

268
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,065
 ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü

269
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:07,224
 ¢Ü and she skillfully managed
to talk her way into my room ¢Ü

270
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,603
Very nice, you two.

271
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,838
What are you smiling about?

272
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,324
I don't know.

273
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:18,284
I've just been kind of flying
on air since rehearsals started.

274
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:23,283
Me, too.
This place is kind of magical, isn't it?

275
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,056
All right.

276
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:31,750
Now, do you all remember when I said
that trust is the key to performance?

277
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,278
Well, I want to try something.

278
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,253
Put down your scripts,
come up here and form a circle.

279
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,154
Here's what I want.

280
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:44,272
I want you to fall back into the arms
of the person behind you.

281
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,394
Before you fall,

282
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:49,951
I want you to tell a secret
about yourself,

283
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,411
something that you have 
never shared before.

284
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,440
It's all about creating
a safe environment, people.

285
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,893
Start with you, Robin.

286
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,203
I felt relief when my father died.

287
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:15,717
Clinton, to me.

288
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,098
I don't trust any of you.

289
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,698
I respect that.

290
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,025
Dennis?

291
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:43,777
I started driving a cab because I didn't
want to be lonely all the time.

292
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,514
That's deep. That's deep.

293
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:50,839
Nora, to Dennis.

294
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:59,405
I think I'm falling in love
with my leading man.

295
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,718
Me?

296
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:24,575
Plenty of blowups at this place, huh?

297
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:25,903
Welcome to the theater.

298
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,472
So what was Lyle's problem?

299
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,752
He had a thing for Nora,
I'm afraid.

300
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,039
How did Dennis take Nora's confession?

301
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,204
He made it perfectly clear to Nora
that he had a fiancee,

302
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,305
but she didn't like that.

303
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:39,353
Did either of them
have access to your office,

304
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,420
where you kept the gun?

305
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,641
Everyone did.
I never locked it.

306
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,039
Nora and Lyle are on their way in now.

307
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,122
- So we're looking at the love triangle?
- Yep.

308
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:03,181
Nora angry at the rejection,
Lyle the jealous outsider.

309
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,295
We believe this director?

310
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,963
Plenty of big dramas with these people.

311
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:11,900
Hard to sort through what's real
and what's made up.

312
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,809
That Clinton kid seemed on the level.

313
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,399
You kidding?

314
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,706
You actually bought his act?

315
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:18,802
I'll put money down
on Clinton being clean.

316
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:22,490
Five bucks. /  Five bucks?
What kind of stakes are those?

317
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,455
20 bucks on the director as doer.
Biggest liar, biggest ego.

318
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:30,180
I'm going with Lyle the piano man.
Sneaky guy with a bad crush.

319
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,355
I say Nora.
Lady could handle a .38 easy,

320
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:37,015
and the female species ain't exactly
on my good side right now.

321
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,868
- What's this?
- It's an IOU.

322
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:44,010
I'm going Clinton, the emcee.

323
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,589
A street kid who couldn't
break his bad habits.

324
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:52,832
 ¢Ü Life is a Cabaret, my friends ¢Ü

325
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:56,555
Hey, here's my gal now.

326
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,331
Hi.

327
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,213
Is one of you detective Valens?

328
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,488
I perform on cruise ships these days.

329
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,887
You'd be surprised how high-end
the productions are.

330
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,985
Oh, I've heard they're top-notch.

331
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:14,732
Nora, how did you feel about Dennis?

332
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:17,561
Honestly? I was in love with him.

333
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,497
Must have been hard, falling for a guy
who was engaged to someone else.

334
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,006
And humiliating.

335
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,505
once everyone else knew 
about your feelings.

336
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:25,981
Is that why you shot him?

337
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,685
I would never hurt Dennis.

338
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:37,667
He was this beautiful, open person
who saw the best in everyone.

339
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,055
After two months, it was like
we'd always known each other.

340
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:43,771
But there was that little
problem of his fiancee.

341
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,446
Dennis didn't want to hurt her.

342
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:48,386
But, after the show's run,
he was going to leave her.

343
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,774
- For me.
- Really?

344
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,807
'Cause that's the first 
we've heard about it.

345
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,937
We found ourselves during Cabaret.

346
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:01,937
And we found each other.

347
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:07,571
We hear you got pretty upset when Nora 
announced her feelings for Dennis.

348
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,901
Me and every other straight guy there.

349
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,260
But you were the only one
who stormed out of the theater.

350
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,656
I didn't storm out of the theater
because of my little crush on Nora.

351
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:17,658
Why, then?

352
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:22,415
These little dramas within the drama
always end up hurting the show.

353
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,772
These actors are given a chance
to perform onstage,

354
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:32,251
realize a dream, and they risk it all 
for these fleeting emotions.

355
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,321
But sounds like you were suffering
some fleeting emotions yourself.

356
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,441
Nothing I'd let interfere
with the performance.

357
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:41,182
So you're pretty dedicated.

358
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,536
The theater's my life.
I love it.

359
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:51,168
But I know exactly what can happen
when emotions start to boil over.

360
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,546
 ¢Ü Lady peaceful ¢Ü

361
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,661
 ¢Ü lady happy ¢Ü

362
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:02,680
 ¢Ü that's what I long to be... ¢Ü

363
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,928
 ¢Ü all the odds are ¢Ü

364
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:09,367
 ¢Ü they're in my favor ¢Ü

365
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:16,176
 ¢Ü Something's bound to begin ¢Ü

366
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:20,277
 ¢Ü It's gotta happen ¢Ü

367
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:24,604
 ¢Ü happen sometime ¢Ü

368
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:28,413
 ¢Ü maybe this time ¢Ü

369
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:36,347
 ¢Ü I'll win ¢Ü

370
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,042
Good.

371
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:44,080
All right!

372
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,746
Great sound check.

373
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:52,717
Now, before we take our break,
I have an important announcement.

374
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:57,597
Many of you have heard of Barry Turk,
my agent in New York.

375
00:22:57,597 --> 00:23:00,418
- Doesn't he represent Deniro?
- That's right.

376
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:03,471
And, drumroll, please.

377
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:08,773
He's going to come and see
the show next week on opening night!

378
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:12,842
And he's told me
that if he sees good talent,

379
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:15,750
he might sign someone up.

380
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,912
It'll be you the agent signs, Nora.

381
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,165
You've got that star quality.

382
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,715
No, it'll be you.

383
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:28,608
You're the talented one,
you're just so real up there.

384
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:30,642
Maybe it'll be both of us.

385
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,049
- Oh, hi, Gloria.
- Hey, Lyle.

386
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,690
Made some brownies for the gang.
You've all been working so hard.

387
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,612
That's nice of you, thanks.

388
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:48,530
Dennis, I can't imagine
life after the play.

389
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,026
Without you.

390
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:54,493
We're an amazing team, you know that?

391
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:56,890
Yeah, I do.

392
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:02,558
Being here with you is the only time
I'm really happy these days.

393
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:14,296
I should've turned off the speakers
as soon as she walked into that booth.

394
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:18,120
But part of me hoped it would explode.

395
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,578
And I'd be the one end up with Nora.

396
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,273
Gloria made it sound like
everything with Dennis was solid.

397
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:25,490
No way.

398
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,985
That woman was furious.
I thought she'd kill him then and there.

399
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,993
- Did you see her again?
- Yeah.

400
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:35,498
Uh, backstage, opening night.

401
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:41,278
She was upset and looking for Dennis.

402
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:52,130
 ¢Ü Isn't that long a stay ¢Ü

403
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,856
 ¢Ü life is a Cabaret ¢Ü

404
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:01,550
What is your problem with musicals?

405
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:09,741
When was your wedding going to be, Gloria?

406
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,357
- We hadn't decided.
- Huh.

407
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:15,645
Most of my girlfriends pick a place
soon as they know they're getting hitched.

408
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:20,152
Unless there's trouble, like
their fiance's in love with someone else.

409
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,137
Gloria, we know you were upset

410
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:25,447
and that you went backstage before the show.

411
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,259
I never even found him.

412
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,929
Saw that Nora first and left.

413
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,248
Ask any of my family.
They were all there for the big show.

414
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:36,632
We can't help if you don't tell us 
the truth about your relationship.

415
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:38,878
I loved Dennis.

416
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:41,479
But once those rehearsals started,

417
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,861
I faded into the background to him.

418
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,844
Well, why didn't you tell us, Gloria?

419
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,102
I didn't tell anybody.

420
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:52,579
We were engaged for five years
while everyone here called me a fool

421
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,325
and I kept waiting for him to commit.

422
00:25:56,325 --> 00:26:01,153
How could I admit to anyone that
it never would have happened?

423
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:07,240
 ¢Ü How the world can change ¢Ü

424
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,648
 ¢Ü it can change like that ¢Ü

425
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:14,330
 ¢Ü due to one little word ¢Ü

426
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,889
All I could think about the whole shift
was the opening tonight.

427
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:23,983
Almost ran a couple of curbs.

428
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:28,729
I have a meeting with the director today
so I should leave soon.

429
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,789
Is your girlfriend gonna be there?

430
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,278
What?

431
00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:35,484
I heard you the other night
with that actress.

432
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:37,149
I know something's going on.

433
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:39,172
Nothing happened between
me and Nora, I swear!

434
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:42,196
But you want it to, don't you?

435
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:49,505
I love you, Gloria, I really do.

436
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:51,266
But I'm just a little confused right now.

437
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,853
Obviously.

438
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:55,442
I don't want to hurt you,

439
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:59,411
but I need some time to think
about all this stuff.

440
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:03,700
Remember when I first got this job?

441
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,447
I was gonna save money and 
travel, maybe. Go to Australia.

442
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,829
Of course I remember.

443
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,195
But I never did.
I never did anything except drive a cab.

444
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,473
We can travel, 
if that's what you want.

445
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:17,332
No, I'm just saying...

446
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:22,021
I haven't made much of myself,

447
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:26,035
and this meeting with the director,
I know it's supposed to be a secret,

448
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:30,032
but I really think that it could 
make my future a whole lot brighter.

449
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,874
Brighter.

450
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:36,228
I don't understand, Denny.
I thought we had a really good life together.

451
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:38,705
Were things really so dark before?

452
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,555
I just...

453
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:44,845
I know I've been a disappointment.

454
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:47,703
I just don't want to be that anymore.

455
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:51,245
You were never a disappointment to me.

456
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,999
I guess you never really
know anyone all the way.

457
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,383
What was the secret meeting
with the director, day of the show?

458
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:16,184
All Dennis said was that it was 
with Rafe's bigwig agent and Nora.

459
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:18,759
So I got angry again.

460
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,254
That was the last time we spoke.

461
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,685
So what was this meeting
with Dennis before the show?

462
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,985
Since you left that out before,
maybe you can fill us in now.

463
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,152
I didn't think it was important.

464
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:39,146
It was simply so Dennis
could meet my agent, Barry Turk.

465
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:42,593
Our problem is, we called Barry Turk.

466
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,919
Got his client list.

467
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,576
You're not on it.

468
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:52,993
I was once.

469
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:57,793
But Barry hadn't returned
my phone call in six years.

470
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:59,997
So you lied to Dennis and Nora.

471
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,727
Not exactly.

472
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:06,016
I mean, I'd left another damn
message for his assistant.

473
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:09,646
- I was really hoping he'd show.
- Well, he didn't.

474
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:13,182
I couldn't tell my actors that
I'd slipped to the "B" list.

475
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:15,636
I needed to build myself up
in their eyes.

476
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:19,948
- For your own ego?
- Absolutely not!

477
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:24,028
Maybe you're right.

478
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:27,255
Maybe it was for my own ego.

479
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:33,411
Whatever it was,
I'm afraid it may have cost Dennis dearly.

480
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,951
Barry Turk got stuck in New York.

481
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:41,594
Missed the train.
But he'll jump a later one.

482
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:45,274
So he'll make the show tonight,
be able to see me and Dennis perform.

483
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:47,633
- Of course.
- Are you sure?

484
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:52,641
Look, what's important 
for you two to keep in mind

485
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:58,265
is that tonight's performance 
could decide someone's future.

486
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,822
- God, I'm nervous.
- You should be.

487
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:05,023
The truth is, I have a lot of say
over who Barry chooses to represent.

488
00:30:05,023 --> 00:30:07,696
He must really respect your opinion.

489
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:09,258
He does.

490
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,254
And he likes to keep a short client list.

491
00:30:12,254 --> 00:30:15,281
Only one new client a year.

492
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:21,246
- One client?
- That's right.

493
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,261
Well, it should definitely be you, Nora.

494
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:27,085
You're truly gifted.

495
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,502
You're right, Dennis.

496
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:33,358
Rafe, Dennis is 35.
I'm just 25.

497
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,955
I'm the one with a real chance
to make it in the business.

498
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:39,262
I'm the real talent here.
You know I would work the hardest for it.

499
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:43,880
I am committed to going all the way
no matter what it takes.

500
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,200
What was I thinking? I...

501
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,484
I almost ruined
my life because of you!

502
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:04,846
I thought a little healthy competition
would be good for them.

503
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:09,126
I didn't think Nora would be
so consumed by it all.

504
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,543
Consumed enough you think
she'd kill him?

505
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:12,944
Make sure she got the agent?

506
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:18,019
She made it quite clear
she was going to be a star.

507
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:20,420
No matter what it took.

508
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,523
So Nora wanted the spotlight.

509
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,779
The question is, was she
desperate enough to kill for it?

510
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,965
We've been going through
the play mementos Rafe gave us.

511
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:35,988
He told us Dennis Rushed to
a copy place before the show,

512
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,747
- and we found out why.
- Cabaret program.

513
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:41,012
A manager there told us 
they were about to run it off

514
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:45,203
and Dennis stopped them.
Wanted to change his notes. / Notes?

515
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,400
Each actor has a place  where they can write
personal stuff to their family and friends.

516
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,905
"Gloria, I'm sorry 
if I lost my way in the dark."

517
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:55,686
"You are the only star that can
make my future brighter."

518
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:58,802
- "Let's set a date."
- Since the show never went on,

519
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,055
Gloria never saw the program

520
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:04,902
- or knew Dennis had come around.
- Clinton.

521
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:11,330
I, uh, I got something
I think you people need to hear.

522
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,566
Go ahead.

523
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,946
I didn't say anything before
because I...

524
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,672
I knew you'd believe her over me.

525
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:20,253
But now I got proof.

526
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:22,723
Clint, this is Nora.

527
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:25,462
I know the police
have been talking to you,

528
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:27,530
and if you tell them
what I did that night,

529
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,290
you will be very, very sorry.

530
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:37,799
See? Always bet on the dame.

531
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:49,477
Your friend Clinton's in the next room.

532
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:53,354
- He played us your message.
- Oh, god.

533
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:57,735
Yeah. You need to tell me 
what happened, Nora.

534
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:01,085
I'm such an idiot.
Why am I such an idiot?

535
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:04,398
Don't know.
But you better start explaining.

536
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:08,243
I didn't want Clinton to say anything

537
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:11,880
because my career is really
about to take off.

538
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,130
And getting convicted of murder
might get in the way?

539
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,399
I did not kill Dennis.
I'm innocent!

540
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,692
Hey, this ain't a performance, Nora.

541
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:22,942
This is real life,
and you're in real trouble.

542
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:27,938
Okay.

543
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,451
Okay.

544
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:33,746
I was young and insecure,

545
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:38,430
and I let my emotions
get the best of me.

546
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:57,645
 ¢Ü I met this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü

547
00:33:57,645 --> 00:34:01,020
 ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü

548
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,428
 ¢Ü and she skillfully managed to talk 
her way into my room ¢Ü / Oh, Cliff!

549
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:11,350
 ¢Ü I've got a terrible feeling
I've said a dumb thing ¢Ü

550
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,711
 ¢Ü besides I've only got one narrow bed ¢Ü

551
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:19,864
 ¢Ü We'll think of something ¢Ü

552
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:22,695
You can't be mad at me forever, Dennis.

553
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:25,909
I'm just committed, totally.

554
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,963
That's why I'll bet 
you'll be a star.

555
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:32,686
I'll be driving my cab.

556
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:35,565
This was fun.

557
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:37,837
But I don't think I like
shutting off my memory,

558
00:34:37,837 --> 00:34:39,926
living in the now.

559
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,892
You forget too much.

560
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:45,275
Hey, they're looking 
for you guys in costumes.

561
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,568
I'm gonna get ready.

562
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,601
Man, I'm kind of nervous.

563
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,315
I don't blame you.

564
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:06,511
Rafe told me Barry Turk wants to walk out
of here with some new clients. / Cool.

565
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:10,492
- I think you are so talented.
- Thank you.

566
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:15,378
But I'm afraid Dennis has a better shot.
He's just...

567
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:20,628
more commercial, you know?

568
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,029
Well, we'll see, I guess.

569
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,054
But why take that chance?

570
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,689
If we mess Dennis up,

571
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,867
the agent can focus on
you and me instead.

572
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,726
What do you mean, mess him up?

573
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:35,086
Look, I know about your background, okay?

574
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:38,255
The jail time, the gangs.
It's all cool with me.

575
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,207
If you put on a ski mask,

576
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,342
which they have in the costume room, 
by the way,

577
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,903
and wait outside until Dennis goes 
for his cigarette break... / A ski mask?

578
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,694
Just listen, okay?

579
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:49,508
You could pretend to be a robber,

580
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,742
take his wallet,
scare the hell out of him.

581
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,792
You could use the director's gun!

582
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,583
I saw that he keeps it
in his office drawer.

583
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,261
You want me to shoot Dennis?

584
00:35:57,261 --> 00:35:58,970
Of course not.

585
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,322
I just want you to rattle him up
so he's a wreck onstage.

586
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:05,526
Then you and I can shine,

587
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:08,070
blow that Barry Turk away.

588
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,426
You are out of your mind.

589
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:12,199
Nobody gets hurt, and
we'll go to the next level.

590
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,826
What's crazy about that?

591
00:36:14,826 --> 00:36:17,231
You know...

592
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:19,442
a couple of months ago,

593
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:23,052
I would have done it.
You know that?

594
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:26,827
Because I would have believed
that that was all I was good for.

595
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:29,704
But not anymore.

596
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:33,034
And if I ever get an agent,

597
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:37,290
it's gonna be because
I put on one hell of show.

598
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:46,465
After what Clinton said,
I realized I was acting like a lunatic.

599
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,964
Your plan is exactly how it went down.

600
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:51,845
- It's a heck of a coincidence.
- I know.

601
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:54,761
Why do you think I didn't
want Clinton to talk?

602
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,823
I knew how guilty it made me look.

603
00:36:56,823 --> 00:37:00,415
But I swear on my life,

604
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:02,758
I did not hurt Dennis.

605
00:37:02,758 --> 00:37:07,037
One of them must have done it.
It's too detailed a plan.

606
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:10,220
Unless someone overheard it.

607
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:17,512
I'm glad to help, but I'm pretty sure 
I told you guys everything I know already.

608
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:19,584
I don't think so, Lyle.

609
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,903
No?

610
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,710
No.

611
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:26,964
We know you were 
in that booth for sound check,

612
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:28,633
that you could hear everything onstage.

613
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,848
You heard Nora's plan
the night of the show,

614
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,308
and you went through with it, didn't you?

615
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:35,542
Her plan? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

616
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:40,612
The actors are given a chance
to "get onstage, realize a dream."

617
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:43,893
Your words. / That your dream, Lyle?
To be onstage?

618
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:46,285
Come on. I love playing music.

619
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:50,115
But the music isn't what people clap for
at the end of the show, is it?

620
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:52,642
That's because they're morons.

621
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,822
Now, I think you're a lot like Dennis,

622
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:58,619
watching life pass you by,
dreaming of a spotlight.

623
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,259
But Dennis was brave.

624
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:03,039
He got up his nerve,
went out there and auditioned.

625
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,238
- You were too scared.
- That why you killed him?

626
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:07,609
Or did you kill him just because
you knew he was better than you?

627
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,811
Better than me?
I don't think so.

628
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:12,613
Oh, pretty easy to sit  on the sidelines, 
judging. But you know what?

629
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:15,016
I don't think you could've hacked it
under those bright lights.

630
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:17,030
You're wrong!

631
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:21,023
If I'd gotten onstage that night 
with Barry Turk in the front row,

632
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:22,632
everyone would've been blown away!

633
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,759
- But you were never gonna get onstage.
- Wrong again!

634
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:28,642
With Dennis gone, I was the only one
who could go on in his place.

635
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:31,376
I knew every word of that show!

636
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,801
You killed him and thought
the curtain would still go up?

637
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,629
I was just gonna hit him in the leg, 
send him to the hospital.

638
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:40,412
It isn't fair they canceled the show!

639
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:44,372
Whatever happened
to "the show must go on"?

640
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,377
I knew every word.

641
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:51,464
Every word.

642
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:54,766
You don't believe me?

643
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,251
There was a Cabaret

644
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:11,494
and there was a master-of-ceremonies

645
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:14,587
and there was a city called Berlin

646
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:18,247
in a country called Germany.

647
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:21,934
It was the end of the world.

648
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:28,323
And I was dancing with Sally Bowles

649
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:33,049
and we were both fast asleep.

650
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:40,270
 ¢Ü The sun on the meadow
is summery warm ¢Ü

651
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:46,774
 ¢Ü the stag in the forest runs free ¢Ü

652
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:54,336
 ¢Ü but gather together to greet the storm ¢Ü

653
00:39:54,336 --> 00:40:01,118
 ¢Ü tomorrow belongs to me ¢Ü

654
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,983
Give me all your money.

655
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:14,196
Lyle, that's the worst
fake voice I ever heard.

656
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:16,196
What are you up to?

657
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:21,318
You think I'm a joke, huh?

658
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:25,372
You think you're better than me, huh?

659
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,349
Let's go inside, okay?
It's almost time.

660
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:31,355
No, my time! Not yours.

661
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:33,013
You've had enough.

662
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:37,212
Look, all I want to do is put on a good
show and go home to my fiancee.

663
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:39,239
This is my home!

664
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,431
It's all I have!

665
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,782
And this!

666
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:46,797
is going to be my show.

667
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:52,810
For once, I'm gonna be the one
that gets to shine!

668
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,877
Lyle!

669
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:28,896
 ¢Ü Cabaret (soundtrack) 
"Maybe This Time" ¢Ü

670
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:33,726
 ¢Ü Maybe this time ¢Ü

671
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:36,731
 ¢Ü I'll be lucky ¢Ü

672
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:42,778
 ¢Ü maybe this time, he'll stay ¢Ü

673
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:45,470
 ¢Ü maybe this time ¢Ü

674
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,402
 ¢Ü for the first time ¢Ü

675
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:54,272
 ¢Ü love won't hurry away ¢Ü

676
00:41:54,272 --> 00:42:00,360
