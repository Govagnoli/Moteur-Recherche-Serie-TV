00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,030
September 22, 1989
I understand that,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,579
but I'm getting paid on...

6
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,933
I am listening.
You're not listening.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,273
- I'm getting paid...
- Hi, baby.　　　　

8
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:22,297
If you'd just give me 
a brief moment to...

9
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:24,175
I'm not giving attitude.

10
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:26,420
Hello?

11
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,049
Hello?

12
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,136
Midnight, 
they're gonna shut my gas.

13
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,337
What you bring?
Chicken?

14
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,661
For the concert.

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,723
I gotta do these bills.
You should go.

16
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,485
Honey, I can see Nirvana anytime.

17
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:47,634
You know, you could ask Krystal
for the money. She'll help you.

18
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,713
I know. I don't wanna ask.

19
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,974
I'm gonna heave 
that thing out the window.

20
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,688
Here, Grandma.
Here's your tea.

21
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,038
Don't touch that.

22
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:16,210
This is worse than pro wrestling.

23
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,513
Shush. You don't know 
anything about it.

24
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,844
These guys'll bleed every last cent.

25
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:22,963
Can't take it with you.

26
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,313
So, it's a freezing February night.

27
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm up, get this call 
about midnight.

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,780
Oh, is this the Jamaican job?
That's a good one.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,624
Yeah. You know how 
Jamaican jobs are, right?

30
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,467
I mean, aliases, no papers.

31
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,596
- Give me a bag of bones any day.
- Yeah, well, I'm in a slump,

32
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:04,022
and I need a cake job 
like you wouldn't believe.

33
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:06,205
So he gets this call 
out of, uh, North Central.

34
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,337
- You telling this or me?
- No, go ahead. It's your story.

35
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,921
So, anyway, we're riding out,
and I'm thinking, I hope 
this is not a Jamaican.

36
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:13,791
Please don't 
let this be a Jamaican.

37
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,099
Don't-don't finish it. 
Vera, Homicide.

38
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,639
So anyway, I get out there.

39
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,646
This guy's on the front seat,
frozen through.

40
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:24,443
- And he's a Jamaican.
- No. He's a Burmese Buddhist Monk.

41
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:28,253
I take one look, I say to Vera,
"why couldn't he be Jamaican?"

42
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:29,564
Hold on just a second.

43
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:31,203
You couldn't wait?

44
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,785
It's for you.
Another cold one.

45
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,135
Why do you got to be like that?
Some of those stories of yours I like.

46
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,047
Uh, Detective Rush.

47
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:45,982
I wanna tell you about a murder.

48
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:48,043
And this happened a while ago?

49
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,708
In 1989.

50
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,442
What's your name?

51
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,820
I don't wanna tell you my name.

52
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,856
Okay, what do you 
want to tell me?

53
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,971
She was elderly.

54
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:02,156
Who was elderly, the victim?

55
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:05,602
Her name was Krystal Hogan.

56
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,578
At her age, there was 
no defending herself.

57
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,414
How old was she?

58
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,928
Almost 81.

59
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:17,933
How is it you know 
she was murdered?

60
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,493
I did it.

Guy confess to murder,
and he won't tell you his name?

71
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,741
Maybe it's a hoax.

72
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,429
I can't find a box on the lady.

73
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:05,397
Well, it's not Krystal Hogan,

74
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,682
but I-I seem to remember 
a K. Dugan when I was on the line.

75
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:12,015
Maybe on '87 job.

76
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,616
Kendall Dugan.
Drug shooting.

77
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,770
Oh, right.

78
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,122
So, did you run her name
through the computer?

79
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:23,615
Waiting for something to kick out.

80
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,348
Well, there's not much else 
you can do, though.

81
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,069
Lil?

82
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,887
That fellow's back on the line.

83
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,763
- You hung up on me.
- I was having second thoughts.

84
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:42,879
Now I'm not.

85
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,219
Well, I don't have a box 
on Krystal Hogan. Sorry.

86
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:50,392
- What does that mean?
- No box, no body, no crime.

87
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:55,175
Maybe you're just a guy 
who likes to talking to police.

88
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,960
You don't believe me?

89
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,384
I'll tell you where the body is.

90
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:01,717
Okay.

91
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,898

92
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:09,092
Germantown.

93
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,166
In the basement.

94
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:16,409
Wanna tell me your name now?

95
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:22,250
Guy's real up front, 
or messing with me good.

96
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,460
- Gave you an address?
- I'll run it.

97
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,770
- Don't have enough for a warrant.
- So, finesse the neighborhood.

98
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,750
Right. Worth a door knock.

99
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,517
- Are you Brad Meyer?
- Yeah. Who are you?

100
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:48,264
Philadelphia Police.
Detective Rush.

101
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,242
Oh, low blow.
Someone called the cops on me?

102
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,715
No. Uh, can I talk to you a minute?

103
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:55,973
What's going on?

104
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,668
This is my wife, Dana.
She's police.

105
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,799
I'm just looking into something
that might have happened around 
here several years back.

106
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:06,569
- Thought it was about us getting rowdy.
- We only moved in eight months ago.

107
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:10,072
Maybe you should try that lady,
Joan, across the street.

108
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,583
She brought us moving-in casserole

109
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,233
and knows the neightborhood 
business pretty good.

110
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,488
Thank you.

111
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:20,542
Krystal Hogan.
She was an old pistol.

112
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,927
- So, you knew her?
- Lived right over there.

113
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,232
- When was that?
- 10, 15 years ago.

114
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:28,175
She moved in
with her son's family.

115
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:33,994
Then... this was awful...
the son and his wife died
in a crash on the turnpike.

116
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,528
That left Krystal alone over there
with her grandson.

117
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,358
Hmm. Do you remember 
the grandson's name?

118
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,835
James. Just a teenager.
Acted like one, too.

119
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,118
Always riding around in his car.

120
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:12,403
James, was that you honking 
that horn? / Yeah.

121
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,904
- Honk, honk, honk.
- Sorry.

122
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:17,968
- Show some courtesy.
- I told you to be waiting outside.

123
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,883
You don't tell your grandmother
to wait outside. / I have a date.

124
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:23,738
- And if we don't do this now...
- Oh, hold your horses.

125
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:27,627
- I forgot my keys.
- I got keys. Let's keep moving.

126
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,345
James, will you stop rushing me?

127
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:34,499
You know what?
I'm screwed now anyway.

128
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:40,922
Taking care of his grandma 
put a real strain on James.

129
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,956
Anyway, poor old Krystal 
eventually went missing.

130
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:48,582
- When was this?
- '89, 90.

131
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,148
Wandered off.

132
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,696
The kid went to the police.

133
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:55,258
Put flyers all around, 
including one on my door.

134
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,404
Used some kind of tape 
that took off the paint.

135
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:03,714
- A body in our basement?
- It's a possiblity.

136
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:07,414
Outrageous.
I told you that was weird.

137
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,015
What was weird?

138
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,833
This cat from the moving company.

139
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,879
What company?

140
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:15,682
The other day they were moving 
a family in down the block.

141
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,442
One of the workers stops over,
says he grew up in this house.

142
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:19,772
And he wants to have a look around?

143
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,938
You'd think he'd want to see 
his old bedroom or something,

144
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:25,374
but this dude... he only wants
to see the basement.

145
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,002
I basically live down here.

146
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:34,004
Got my bar, my video games, stereo,

147
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:37,000
various whatnots.

148
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:41,745
That's odd.

149
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:44,779
- What are these bricks about?
- That's the old coal chute.

150
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,080
You do this?

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,793
No.

152
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:14,838
Coroner says from the pelvis,
it's a female.

153
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:18,204
And she has her teeth, 
so we'll get an ID.

154
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,471
- What about her age?
- Sutures on the skull are closed up.

155
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,679
She was elderly.

156
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,151
So your guy was for real.

157
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,881
I just hope he calls back.

158
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,054
That the file from missing persons?

159
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,367
Krystal Hogan. October '89.

160
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,327
Yeah, the grandson, 
James filed the report.

161
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,046
Did the investigators 
do the job right?

162
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:48,386
They put out an APB,

163
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,494
checked the morgues, hospitals,
jail system.

164
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:54,124
Took statement, from this James,
some others... don't tell you much.

165
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:55,888
Says there were no other relatives.

166
00:09:55,888 --> 00:10:00,259
They got dementia written down, question
mark, case was filed pending more info.

167
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,228
Mm-hmm, but then, in '94,

168
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,476
James petitioned the court 
to declare grandma dead.

169
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,988
They allowed him to collect
on a $50,000 life insurance policy.

170
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:10,825
Well, it won't buy you the 76ers,
but it does give you motive.

171
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:11,525
Mm-hmm.

172
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,844
What about the moving company?
Does James work for one?

173
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:16,916
- Haven't made that connect yet.
- But we're thinking he's the caller?

174
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,035
Rush.

175
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,457
Line two. It's him.

176
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,120
Anyway we trace this, boss?

177
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,345
We wish.

178
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,530
Detective Rush.

179
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,957
I don't like that you said that.

180
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,797
- Said what?
- That I just like talking to police.

181
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:35,997
I wouldn't be doing this 
if I didn't have to.

182
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:38,487
So, why are you doing this?

183
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,278
Listen, James, I'm just 
trying to do my job here.

184
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,128
Still there?

185
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:56,993
I'm here.

186
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,950
Are you surprisedI know your name?

187
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,541
I guess not.

188
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:06,615
Look, did you find the body?

189
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,813
James, the best thing for you
is to come into Police Headquarters.

190
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,576
Just tell me, yes or no.

191
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,340
DMV photo.

192
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,036
I know you found her.

193
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:17,073
I mean, you had to.

194
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,955
Hello?

195
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,843
Uh, uh, I'm here.
Um, uh, I was thinking.

196
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,291
Thinking what?

197
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,250
I understand what you're doing.
I do that.

198
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,286
I'll, uh, I'll be in a dark mood

199
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:37,002
and I'll turn to people 
who I don't really know.

200
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:38,563
Seems safer.

201
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,971
I don't wanna talk.

202
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,575
Well, hey, it doesn't have to be me.

203
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,212
Are you religious?
I-I can get you anybody you want.

204
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:46,129
James?

205
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,428
I'm here.

206
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,816
Why'd you kill her?
She wasn't a good grandma?

207
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:50,931
No, she was.

208
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,840
You wanna tell me how you did it?

209
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,230
You're making my head hurt.

210
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,664
James, how about we hang up?

211
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:06,797
You wanna hang up?

212
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,743
Yeah, I'll give you 
my cell phone number.

213
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:13,389
That was you can take a bunch of 
breaths, collect your thoughts,
and then we'll figure this out.

214
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,423
James?

215
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:19,634
Yeah.

216
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,139
5-5-5...

217
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:23,625
0-1-9-8.

218
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,680
Risky play.

219
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,320
I was losing him.

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,743
Give him my number, 
maybe build a trust.

221
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,922
What's out take on this guy?

222
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,245
We know he was orphaned.

223
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,749
Lost both parents on the same night.

224
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,530
And at 19, he was solely responsible
for an 81-year-old woman.

225
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,601
No other family?

226
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,632
All alone in the world.

227
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:47,686
Auto-track just spit out 
his current address. We got him.

228
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:56,936
Philadelphia Police.

229
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:00,223
Police! Anyone here?

230
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,779
Clear.

231
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,408
Guy didn't finish his chicken potpie.

232
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,880
- Must've been in a hurry.
- He knew we were on to him.

233
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,064
You find something?

234
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:26,810
Something.

235
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:30,920
"Listen, darling. 
I don't mean to make you tense.

236
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,255
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,225
I just want us to 
move up in the world.

238
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:36,402
Love you, Sherry."

239
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,044
Sherry, who?

240
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:40,943
Fox.

241
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,721
Postmark: February, 1989.

242
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,823
You still reading your 
love letters from 14 years ago?

243
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,543
This guy's reliving a better time,

244
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:53,216
'cause Brotherly Luv Movers is 
paying a slave wage.

245
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:55,852
Guy's living alone, got a bad job,
getting older.

246
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:58,273
Self-seteem's shot, 
so he's breaking out the old love letters.

247
00:13:58,273 --> 00:13:59,876
Guilt over grandma's gaining on him.

248
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:04,293
But still, why does 
he crack after 14 years?
Why not 12 or 19.

249
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:08,738
Hmm. I'm gonna call Jeffries,
get him on the hunt for this foxy lady.

250
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,804
In the meantime, let's see 
if Brotherly Luv has any for James.

251
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:18,290
Yeah, I got a job over 
in Germantown

252
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,463
three days ago.

253
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,954
- James Hogan was on that crew?
- Yeah.

254
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,815
Listen, that guy's a hell of a worker.

255
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:27,456
Shows up on time,
doesn't clown around, dependable.

256
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:29,873
- So he's full-time?
- Yeah, and then some.

257
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,988
Been with us close to three years now.

258
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,590
Why isn't he here today?

259
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,946
This ain't union,

260
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,127
but a guy puts out,
I give him the days he wants.

261
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,141
It was the first time James asked.
So I told him to take the week.

262
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:44,453
- He ever talk about a girl named Sherry?
- Beats me.

263
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:46,762
- Any girls at all?
- Look, I don't know.

264
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,042
Some of the humps around here
give him a hard time about that,

265
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,067
but let's face it, 
he's not George Clooney.

266
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,039
Excuse me.

267
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,748
Lilly Rush.

268
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:09,323
I saw you at the apartment.

269
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,586
So, you stuck around, huh?

270
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,096
You were watching?

271
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,880
Now there's a cop out front.
I can't get back in.

272
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,409
It's not just your house, James.
There's an APB out on you.

273
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,358
What'll happen to her body?

274
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,860
What do you want to happen?

275
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,364
I thought maybe

276
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:28,269
a service of some kind and then
bury her at the County Cemetery.

277
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:29,893
Don't think so.

278
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,997
- Why not?
- I'm not trying to upset you,

279
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:35,848
but, uh, if next of kin
doesn't claim the body,

280
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,671
the coroner has procedures.

281
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,489
Like what?

282
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:43,468
Oh, he'll cremate her, then, uh, 
put her remains in a plastic bag.

283
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:46,925
Probably stamp on a ticket number
or some ID, then box it up

284
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,701
and stuff it away 
in a warehouse somewhere.

285
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:53,843
You wanna come in, James?

286
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,380
Talk face-to-face?

287
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,533
We can see about a real funeral
for grandma that way.

288
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:07,670
Do you really get dark moods
or were you just conning me?

289
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,635
Wish I was conning you.

290
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,737
Look, you can talk to me.

291
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:14,318
Don't you feel that?

292
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,008
Yes.

293
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,330
So, come in. We'll talk.

294
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,697
About what?

295
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:24,525
How about... Sherry?

296
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,115
Sore subject?

297
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,000
Off-limits.

298
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,626
Maybe because she's no longer a Fox.

299
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,353
She goes by Mrs. Stephens now.
Lives on the Main Line.

300
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,344
Nice digs.

301
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,109
Marry on OB-GYN, 
and you can have this, too.

302
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:04,682
This is a mistake.

303
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:07,545
There was no homicide.
James's grandma went missing.

304
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,360
Well, this ain't a mistake.

305
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,268
Have you seen James recently?

306
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:13,676
Talked to him?

307
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:16,222
Not in three years.

308
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,623
Still, this doesn't make sense.

309
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,547
But you two were involved, right?

310
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:24,801
Well, he was my boyfriend.
We lived together forever.

311
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,396
You break up with him?

312
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,734
We met a bowling alley.

313
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:33,402
At the time, that kind of 
life was really fun to me.

314
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,199
Ten years later, it wasn't.

315
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:38,677
How long till you got married?

316
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:41,359
- A year.
- That's pretty quick.

317
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,872
Doesn't seem so quick 
when you're over 30.

318
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,671
Sherry, going back, were you around
when Krystal supposedly went missing?

319
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,518
Mm, not the exact day.

320
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,012
- But I was staying over a lot.
- What was that like?

321
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,598
- How do you mean?
- Before Krystal was gone.

322
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,242
Sleeping over with grandma 
in the house?

323
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:03,063
Mostly okay.

324
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,671
But sometimes not.

325
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:13,279
- Let's go upstairs.
- No, it'll be better here.

326
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,378
What if Krystal comes in?

327
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:16,228
Let her.

328
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,357
No, come on.

329
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:25,814
What?

330
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,382
Times change, grandma.

331
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:31,612
You gotta accept that things 
ain't like when you were a kid.

332
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,468
I just came to give you 
a check for groceries.

333
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,834
You don't like it here, grandma,

334
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,853
I can make other 
arrangements for you.

335
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:48,487
But James threatened to put her 
in a home, not murder her.

336
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,340
Now, Krystal was chipping 
in on the bills, right?

337
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,943
She didn't mind helping
when James got in a pinch.

338
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,293
Well, please tell me 
he's not in trouble.

339
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:00,477
Wish I could.

340
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:02,044
Thanks for your time.

341
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:04,624
So, she outgrew the guy.

342
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:07,289
He's still pining for her
all these years later.

343
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,197
Most people get over this stuff.

344
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,009
She left him three years ago,
grandma died 14 years ago,

345
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,140
but I still don't get why he's
reaching out today.

346
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,274
- Where you headed?
- Due in court.

347
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,948
Drop by social security for me?

348
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,732
Uh, not my favorite joint.
What do you need?

349
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,047
Well, it took five years
before the court declared
Krystal Hogan dead,

350
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,014
and six years before James 
collected the life insurance.

351
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:36,423
So, in the meantime,
you think he was picking up
her benefit checks?

352
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,230
Easy scam to pull off.

353
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,802
Sherry said grandma had 
some cash floating around.

354
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,452
So, what about Krystal's 
bank records?

355
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:44,942
- Already put out a subpoena.
- All right.

356
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,002
Rush.

357
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:47,605
Yeah?

358
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,608
Remember when I ran 
James through NCIC, PCIC?

359
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:51,831
Yeah, he was clean.

360
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:55,660
Yeah, well, I got his social, 
I ran him again. Got an assault charge.

361
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,198
Why didn't it show up earlier?

362
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,903
He wasn't charged under 
the name James Hogan.

363
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,877
He was charged under 
the name James Gable.

364
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:04,627
Gable? / Half-brother
to the victim, Lonnie Gable.

365
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:06,343
So he has some family after all.

366
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,551
I don't know if Lonnie's 
gonna see it that way.

367
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,227
What did James do to him?

368
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,659
Beat on him... with a brick.

369
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,192
James was using your last name?

370
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,202
'Cause I bought him his first car.

371
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:28,804
- I told him not to do that.
- Sounds like you looked out for him.

372
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,632
He was my little brother.

373
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:32,898
So, how did he end up 
alone with Krystal?

374
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,747
I was in Baltimore,
working for a mortgage company.

375
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:38,860
When Mom died in that wreck, 
I came back.

376
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,796
I didn't wanna move in.

377
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:44,581
I've got a life. But I told him
to get live-in help for her.

378
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,119
- He didn't wanna do that?
- I couldn't force him.

379
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,174
She was his grandma, not mine.

380
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:51,895
Actually, he and the old girl
got along pretty good.

381
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,661
He always said how much he liked 
his talks with her.

382
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,355
I lived nearby, I figured I could
look over his shoulder.

383
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,592
But then you two had that falling out.

384
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,434
He was begging for me to meet Sherry.

385
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,787
You weren't too high on her?

386
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,922
I had them over for a barbecue.
She's nice, whatever.

387
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:11,811
Then suddenly she says that she
wants this certain wine cooler,

388
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,501
so James goes on a run.

389
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:17,045
For the next 20 minutes, 
this girl goes on parade.

390
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:19,569
Flirting, prancing, bending over...

391
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,754
real intentional...
showing me the world.

392
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,527
I just look away, whatever.

393
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:28,684
And then she says
will I take her away to New York?

394
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,611
It was such a sideways 
thing to say, I just laugh,

395
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:33,673
and she follows it up with,

396
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:37,417
whatever you want,
wherever you want,

397
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,436
for the rest of your life.

398
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,445
So, then what happened?

399
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:43,245
I got her the hell out of my yard.

400
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:46,689
James comes back, I figure I better
tell him before she starts lying,

401
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:49,239
so we sit on this back stoop
then I'm fixing up.

402
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,770
You can guess the rest.

403
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,311
He opened you up pretty good.

404
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,346
So, why did you pull back on 
pressing charges?

405
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,010
What, am I going to send him to jail?

406
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,420
I figure it's best just to 
walk away and not look back.

407
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,978
The shocking thing was

408
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:05,044
he was really fond of Krystal.

409
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,942
Krystal's benefit checks were 
$812 a month.

410
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,590
Good bank for a 19-year-old.

411
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,127
And they flowed in long 
after her death.

412
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:19,166
These here are dated before the murder.
That's Krystal's signature.

413
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,838
The rest are dated after she died.

414
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,190
I know that writing.

415
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:31,858
- See the little tails on both S's?
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,758
Did Sherry endorse these checks?

417
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,893
Well, let me send it over to
Questioned Documents. / Thanks.

418
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,004
- What if Sherry orchestrated this?
- The fraud or the murder?

419
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,435
Or both.

420
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:45,521
So, you're saying

421
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,142
Lonnie's story is starting 
to ring true?

422
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,834
Well, these checks showed 
she was no angel.

423
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,578
and if James got on so well with 
grandma the way Lonnie says...

424
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:54,177
Plus your crush on him.

425
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,585
James just got sloppy.

426
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,600
- See if you can ID this.
- 2-4-2-7.

427
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,085
2-4-2-7

428
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:07,665
Hello. / What did Sherry say to you?

429
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:10,014
You gonna follow me, James,
you might as well just come in.

430
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:10,818
Tell me.

431
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,729
Cops get information,
they don't give it.

432
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:14,044
I wasn't following you.

433
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,320
You asked about Sherry, 
so I knew you'd go see her.

434
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,530
But you were there.

435
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,057
- I was around. 
- You around Sherry's house a lot?

436
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:25,063
Do not accuse me of that.
I know what you're accusing me of.

437
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,176
Then help me understand, James.

438
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:28,556
I'm not a stalker.

439
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:30,379
That was the first time 
I've ever gone by.

440
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,030
Only once in three years?

441
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,688
I've been doing what you're
supposed to do. I'm working.

442
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,117
I haven't been in trouble.
You can check.

443
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,209
I did.

444
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,053
- It's true.
- Okay, then.

445
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,588
So, why are you flipping 
out today, James?

446
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,732
What happen to make it today?

447
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,282
I don't wanna tell you that.

448
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,537
Everything she used to give me,

449
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,348
I don't have anymore.

450
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,690
But that's not new.

451
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,582
That's a three-year-old problem.

452
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:02,615
Tell me what she said.
Please.

453
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:07,805
- She was trying to protect you.
- She was?

454
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,744
She said she didn't think you did it.

455
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:10,835
Really?

456
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,660
I'm wondering if she was 
trying to fake me out.

457
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:18,794
If maybe she was... part of it?

458
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,296
No. No.

459
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,030
I've been finding out a lot of things.

460
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,440
What things?

461
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,622
I know she signed Krystal's checks.

462
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:28,867
- That's forgery.
- No, that was me.

463
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,368
Looked like her handwriting.
And according to your brother,

464
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:34,210
Sherry isn't as reputable 
as she plays up to be.

465
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,155
Son of a bitch.
He's a liar.

466
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,437
You saying she never knew?

467
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:43,655
Never talked about how great
it would be to collect grandma's money?

468
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,491
Just got cash from you,
never asked where it came from?

469
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,485
She'd say things.

470
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:53,735
Okay.

471
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:56,132
But Sherry says things she doesn't mean.

472
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:04,701
Don't move.

473
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,942
Why? / The way the light's hitting.

474
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:10,568
- You're my handsome man.
- Don't say that.

475
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,893
No one's better on the inside, 
hear me?

476
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,411
I see the way you take 
care of your grandma.

477
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,442
Sometimes I'm not sure 
I'm living up, you know?

478
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,649
You see how she watches 
the preachers all day?

479
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,767
All she wants is peace.

480
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,908
I do sort of feel that.

481
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,903
It's no accident she waits
for you to open her mail,

482
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,621
always letting you know 
that money's come.

483
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,689
The same joke every time.

484
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:37,801
What good's money to a worn-out 
bag of bones?

485
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,420
She's not gonna come 
right out and say it.

486
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,253
You gotta read between 
the lines, dariln'?

487
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,101
I don't think I could ever do that.

488
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,248
Of course you couldn't.

489
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,150
See, with her it was just talk.

490
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,094
She manipulated you, James.

491
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,286
You need to see that.

492
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,656
He's at the bus station.

493
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:30,509
Hello?

494
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:32,067
You've been conning me.

495
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:35,127
- What?
- Yeah.

496
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:38,600
No. / I can tell.
I can see it on your face.

497
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:52,809
Police! Don't move!

498
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:54,234
Rush!

499
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,241
It's not him.

500
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,682
James kills grandma for Sherry,

501
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:08,403
so he can afford to take her 
nicer places than bowling.

502
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:11,744
- And make her the new lady of the house.
- Or Sherry put him up to it.

503
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,756
Or does the deed herself.

504
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,813
Those are the scenarios.

505
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,485
Do we know how grandma died?

506
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:20,660
Autopsy made a positive ID.
No cause of death determined.

507
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,204
Heard from James lately?

508
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:25,698
No. He's pissed at me 
'cause I bad-mouthed Sherry.

509
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,018
Hope I didn't take it too far.

510
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:29,291
It's been hours.

511
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,799
You're gonna love this.

512
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:34,083
Sherry had four sets of parents,
all before she was 11 years old.

513
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,753
- Foster homes.
- Yeah, then runaway.

514
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:39,217
On the streets and who knows what,
till she meets James.

515
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,650
- Any record?
- Shoplifting.

516
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,437
Well, she's a survivor.

517
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:45,918
She finds James,
a 19-year-old with a house.

518
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:48,403
Moves up to a doctor
on the Main Line.

519
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:49,991
Aw, sooki-sooki.

520
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:52,518
Where you going?

521
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,654
Pharmacy run.

522
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:59,007
Thought your sister was 
taking care of your mother.

523
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,162
AWOL since last week.

524
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:03,849
Detective.

525
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:05,638
Lonnie.

526
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:06,473
What happened?

527
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:08,766
I was going to my car, 
and James jumps me.

528
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:11,436
Keeps going on and on
about Sherry and her pure heart,

529
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,601
what a lout I am... 
all the old stuff.

530
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,448
I'm sorry.
You can press charges.

531
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:16,862
No, that's not what I want.

532
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,253
But I didn't lay down.

533
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,089
Me and him, we had it out.

534
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,771
- And we talked, too.
- You talked?

535
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:24,833
About him coming in.
I'm not gonna walk away again.

536
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,479
But I want him brought in safe.

537
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,412
I'm working hard to do that.

538
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,078
No, I mean I've set it up.

539
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,498
He's agreed to meet.

540
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,386
But only with you.

541
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,497
Lonnie okay?

542
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,821
Fair.

543
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,843
I'm such a jerk.

544
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:09,618
I shouldn't have hurt him.

545
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,474
You gotta control yourself, James.

546
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:14,728
I don't know why he keeps telling 
that lie about Sherry.

547
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,363
What's the plan now, James?

548
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:24,504
I wanna turn myself in.

549
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,893
- Good.
- One condition.

550
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:31,145
I'm listening.

551
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,173
You guarantee me
you'll leave Sherry alone.

552
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:37,553
- She's not part of this.
- If that's true,

553
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:38,475
you have your guarantee.

554
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:42,392
No! Certain things 
will look bad for her.

555
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:43,928
You're already thinking that way.

556
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:46,212
James, every cop in Philly
has an eye out.

557
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:49,028
Some are inexperienced.
Don't let this end badly.

558
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:52,765
- Right now, we go in safe.
- This was a bad idea.

559
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,179
You ever ask her to marry you?

560
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:01,990
What?

561
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,039
You were together a long time.

562
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,620
You ask her to wear your ring?

563
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,327
Yes.

564
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:11,351
- She said no, huh?
- She had her reasons.

565
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,854
Whatever they were,
she quit you.

566
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:15,433
So, why protect her now?

567
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:18,155
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to tear her down.

568
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:20,979
I just don't think Lonnie 
was lying about her, James.

569
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,418
She was my girl.

570
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,518
She believed in me.

571
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:28,670
And that may not be big to you,
but it is to me.

572
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,377
And not just when we were together.

573
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:33,343
More so since we've been apart.

574
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:34,612
How's that work?

575
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:37,573
She told me that for 
the rest of her life,

576
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:41,467
she would never find someone
who took care of her like I did.

577
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:43,884
That that's the man I am.

578
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,614
Even now, I know she believes in me.

579
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,694
So why do you believe in her?

580
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:50,250
She's gone.

581
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,838
What do you know about it?

582
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:55,255
I know Lonnie wasn't lying that 
day you hit him with the brick.

583
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,691
And so do you.

584
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,020
She didn't love you, James.

585
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,265
And I'm your girl now.

586
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:23,702
So, Sherry's coming in?

587
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:25,320
She's one powerful girl.

588
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,716
James is still hanging on
to what she said at the kiss-off.

589
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:30,828
While she's kicking back on
the Main Line with Dr. Stephens.

590
00:31:30,828 --> 00:31:35,634
Oh, I have some new interesting
information about Sherry and doctors.

591
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:42,041
- Care for a coke, coffee?
- I'm good, thanks.

592
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:44,029
Husband bring you in?

593
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,611
Yeah, he doesn't like
me driving in the city.

594
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,033
How'd you meet your husband?

595
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,712
He was my doctor.

596
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,191
Out in Merion?

597
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:55,177
Yeah.

598
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:58,089
45 minutes away from 
where you and James lived.

599
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,301
So?

600
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,968
I noticed your dentist, 
dermatologist...

601
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,723
all your health care takes 
place out in the suburbs.

602
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,563
- I live in the suburbs.
- Well, now you do.

603
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:12,784
But you started with all these doctors
while you were still in Germantown.

604
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:14,838
All your doctors are male, 
aren't they?

605
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:18,475
- I don't get your meaning.
- Nothing. No meaning.

606
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:20,864
Here's what bugs me.

607
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:23,583
You and Jimmy together...
I ain't seeing it.

608
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,498
I mean, you're a head turner.

609
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:30,194
Him... he's a shlub.
And that's not a shot.

610
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:32,007
I mean, you're out of 
my league, too, but...

611
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:34,978
How a man looks has 
never mattered to me?

612
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:36,937
Lonnie's pretty good-looking.

613
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:38,938
Not with that scar, he isn't.

614
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:41,771
No remorse for having 
caused that scar?

615
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:44,098
- Caused?
- Oh, we've been talking to Lonnie.

616
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,885
He gave us the whole 
shooting match, babe.

617
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:48,042
Well, the next time you see Lonnie,

618
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,432
tell him to have another drink.

619
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,899
Recognize this?

620
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:57,863
I guess it looks like 
a letter I wrote.

621
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:01,346
You talk about being tense.
Over what?

622
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,841
Who knows?
That was 14 years ago.

623
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:07,559
Let's move up in the world.
Anything on that?

624
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,496
I have goals.
Let's try and... do well.

625
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:15,983
- A driven person, aren't you, Sherry?
- Sure, no question.

626
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,156
Comming up hard the way you did,
you'd have to be, right?

627
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,125
- What would you know about it?
- Nothing.

628
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,510
I came up in a real sound situation.

629
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,645
Not like you.

630
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,403
You had it hard scrabble.

631
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:32,813
You had to fight your way to 
the Main Line.

632
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:36,734
Did you ask James to get rid of 
his grandma in this letter?

633
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,019
No.

634
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,120
What did you mean by asking him 
to read between the lines?

635
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,367
That all grandma wanted was peace?

636
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,670
N-Nothing. I-I don't even
remember saying that.

637
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,230
You must have loved sharing 
a bathroom with an 81-year-old woman.

638
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,093
- I liked Krystal.
- But she was old.

639
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,517
Already lived a full life.

640
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:56,295
She'd had her time.
Now it was your time, right?

641
00:33:57,008 --> 00:34:00,663
Before I was a cop, Sherry,
I worked in Questioned Documents.

642
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,679
Handwriting Specialist.

643
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:04,329
Board certified.

644
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:08,758
So? / So this isn't Krystal's signature.

645
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:12,428
This is you signing Krystal's name.

646
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,888
You're wrong.

647
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,004
Board certified, Sherry.

648
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:27,397
Did you get her to go?

649
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:30,284
- For the fraud.
- Won't go for the murder.

650
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,524
Rush.

651
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:36,568
I'm calling to say good-bye.

652
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:43,631
It was messed up.
I open the door,

653
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:45,813
and it's that James dude 
from the other day.

654
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:48,321
- And he was armed?
- Had the double-barrel all busted out.

655
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,391
- Told us to leave.
- Guy took the place. That was it.

656
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,413
- I gotta get inside.
- Well, SWAT wants to wait, Lil.

657
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:00,951
We can't wait.

658
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:05,446
You gotta go to bat for me.

659
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:15,764
James.

660
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:19,031
Can you hear me?

661
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,205
I hear you.

662
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:23,747
Hey...

663
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:27,957
I wanna come around this corner...

664
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:30,475
but I know you have a gun.

665
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,627
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- I believe you...

666
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,345
but you need to put the gun down.

667
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,355
I'm gonna show you my gun, okay?

668
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:41,245
Then you show yours.

669
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:43,715
James?

670
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:46,458
Just don't ask me to give it to you.

671
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:47,634
Deal.

672
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:08,740
Say it again, will you?

673
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,253
Say what again?

674
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,401
My name.
You always say my name.

675
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:17,241
James.

676
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:21,976
Sherry would never call me that.

677
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:24,246
No?

678
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:26,768
What, then?

679
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:30,934
Hon... or baby...

680
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:35,687
or darlin', mostly. Darlin'.

681
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:37,063
That's nice.

682
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:40,374
No, but, sometimes you wanna 
hear your name,

683
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,358
you know, and she would never say it.

684
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,897
I'd ask, but she said 
it make her feel awkward.

685
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:53,228
Who I am made her feel awkward...

686
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,991
Should've known back then, right?

687
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:59,700
No, she's...

688
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,271
...good, James.

689
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:08,556
Clever.

690
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:12,385
- I feel like I can really talk to you.
- Keep that gun down.

691
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:23,860
Do you like talking to me?

692
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,011
Yeah.

693
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:31,427
I do.

694
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,563
I did a bad thing.

695
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,349
Do you want more?

696
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:49,343
There's no shame in scrubbing floors.
If only my knees knew it.

697
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:51,453
- Let me help.
- Oh, thank you.

698
00:37:53,748 --> 00:37:57,214
You know, I used to run like the wind.
Did you know that?

699
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,733
Look at me now.

700
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:05,046
Are you sad, Grandma?

701
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,049
Of course I'm sad,

702
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:12,014
but this is the way 
it's supposed to be.

703
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:15,672
We're meant to wear 
ourselves out, James.

704
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:18,297
That's what the Lord expects.

705
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,827
Here, lift your head.

706
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,029
Lay back.

707
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:31,513
Close your eyes.

708
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:42,491
Finish.

709
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:44,233
Huh?

710
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,082
You have to finish telling.

711
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:48,475
You have to face it.

712
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:57,363
Here, lift your head.

713
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,585
It's for the best.

714
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,637
You didn't kill her.

715
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:35,698
Sherry did.

716
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:38,520
No, it's still the same.

717
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:42,915
I put her in the basement.

718
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,039
I dumped her here...

719
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:49,111
like potatoes.

720
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,054
It's the same.

721
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:54,831
Worse...

722
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,938
... for you.

723
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,434
In your mind, it's worse...

724
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,196
... because you let it happen.

725
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:09,806
That's what's eaten you,
what you didn't do.

726
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:12,882
My God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

727
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:14,216
- Oh, God.
- Don't.

728
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:17,343
- Suicide's not the way, James.
- I'm executing myself.

729
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:20,168
- I deserve to die for what I did.
- Look at me.

730
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,445
James.

731
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,495
Why'd you start this?

732
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:31,006
Sherry left you, and for three years,
no trouble, so why'd you call?

733
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:35,702
I wasn't getting over things 
the way you're supposed to.

734
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,452
You couldn't move on.

735
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:45,656
And it was just... 
the final straw last week.

736
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,060
What was?

737
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,767
James... give me an answer.

738
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,883
Give me an answer!

739
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:08,121
I was working down the road...

740
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:09,579
With the movers.

741
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:12,247
and I-I was, like, three doors down,

742
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:15,333
so I figured, 'Let me 
come pay my respects',

743
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:20,414
and the kid you know... he lets me 
come down here and-and-and look.

744
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,161
Look?

745
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:23,912
Look at this place. 
It's a party place...

746
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,935
and, the kid was telling me 
all the things they do down here,

747
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,258
and my grandma's underneath 
them the whole time

748
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,449
under this cheesy bar...

749
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,128
and I put her there!

750
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:40,277
And I looked in this beer mirror...

751
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,856
and I thought, I am a disgrace.

752
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,816
I'm a disgrace.

753
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:02,882
James...

754
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,162
You're not a disgrace.

755
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:10,297
You have regret.

756
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,052
You're facing that night.

757
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,355
Who says that counts for anything?

758
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,016
That's up to you...

759
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:24,527
... but it counts for me.

760

# Don Henley의 "The End of the Innocence" #

761
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:54,757
# Remember when the days were long #

762
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:59,755
# And rolled beneath a deep blue sky #

763
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:03,168
# Didn't have a care in the world #

764
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:07,228
# With mommy and daddy standing by #

765
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:10,975
# When "happily ever after" fails #

766
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,577
# And we've been poisoned 
by these fairy tales #

767
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:19,509
# The lawyers dwell on small details #

768
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:23,378
# Since daddy had to fly #

769
00:43:23,378 --> 00:43:28,077
# But I know a place where we can go #

770
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:32,468
# That's still untouched by man #

771
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:36,072
# We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by #

772
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:40,124
# And the tall grass wave in the wind #

773
00:43:40,124 --> 00:43:44,478
# You can lay your head back on the ground #

774
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:48,684
# And let your hair fall all around me #

775
00:43:48,684 --> 00:43:52,766
# Offer up your best defense #

776
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,548

779
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:21,878
# But now those skies are threatening #

780
00:44:21,878 --> 00:44:25,256
# They're beating plowshares into swords #

781
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:30,072
# For this tired old man that
we elected king #

782
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:33,483

783
00:44:33,483 --> 00:44:37,953
