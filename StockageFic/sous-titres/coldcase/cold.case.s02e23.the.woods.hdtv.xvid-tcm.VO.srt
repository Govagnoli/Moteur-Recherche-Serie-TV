00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:09,289
November 3, 1972

4
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:24,257
Turn that music down
for god's sakes.

5
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,561
I'm hungry.

6
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:32,585
I need you to go to the store.

7
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:34,907
Now.

8
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,873
You mind me.

9
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,227
I did a bad thing, mother.

10
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,371
What did you do?

11
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,839
I took out their eyes.

12
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:15,245
Hey.

13
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,889
Oh, morning.

14
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,509
Scene's out back.

15
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:20,848
Lil.

16
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,592
I've been meaning to talk to you.

17
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,478
About Chris.

18
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,512
Yeah?
What about?

19
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:31,645
You were right.

20
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:34,727
I fell for an act.

21
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,972
You're not the first.

22
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,958
But, uh,

23
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,964
I should've listened to you.

24
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:46,885
Anyway, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,117
I'm sorry that

26
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,958
it became between us.

27
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,452
Detectives.

28
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,324
What are you working with, Lenny?

29
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:02,329
Third week in homicide, 
I get this mess.

30
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,111
What's with the block party???

31
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:07,142
Some moron gets it in his 
head to buy this piece of crap,

32
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:10,340
sends an inspector to check it out, 
digs up a bunch of skulls.

33
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,366
- How many?
- 9.

34
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,619
CSU says some are recent,
others have been there for years.

35
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:17,700
Found them positioned like this.

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,528
Bind up, facing upwards.

37
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,238
Attic of the house,

38
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:25,539
owner was killed up there in 1972, 
single gunshot to the chest.

39
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,971
They find the doer?

40
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,960
Robbery rape's all they got.

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,843
Scottie, look at this.

42
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,900
Black marbles in all their eyes.

43
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,997
You wanna cool me in?(?)

44
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:46,048
Serial killer we interviewed 
few months back.

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,674
The black marbles like 
these were at his place.

46
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,312
It's the freak who walked, right?

47
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,235
Hunting down his victims.

48
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,334
And made them run 
till they couldn't anymore.

49
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,693
He decapitated 9 women.

50
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,116
Never gave up 
where he put the heads.

51
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,344
Looks like we might've found them.

52
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,078
And who was the previous owner?

53
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:16,004
Simone Marks, 32.

54
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:17,534
Lived here with 
a 12-year-old son.

55
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,107
Named George.

56
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,291
Yeah, that's right.

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,908
Looks like our serial killer's 
come back home.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2005/05/22

70
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,172
Now we know what 
George did with their heads.

71
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,205
Buried them in 
his childhood backyard,

72
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,417
all facing the attic where 
his mom was murdered.

73
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:31,091
And the deer eyes, 
he put them in their eye sockets.

74
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,521
You know, maybe he wanted 
those dead women to see something.

75
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,286
- Like...
- Like..

76
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,203
his first kill.

77
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,967
His own mother.

78
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,418
Rape was never his M.O., Lil.

79
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:45,464
Gotta be a reason he's 
lining up the heads like that.

80
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,100
Scottie, we hear anything from 
Fugitives(?) yet on George's wherabouts?

81
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,016
Sherman had a beat on him.

82
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:54,761
Till three weeks ago. And George 
drops off the face of the earth.

83
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,828
All right. What do we know 
about George's mother's murder?

84
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,964
Robbery rape gone south.
Signs of forced entry.

85
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,935
Mom was found stripped, 
semen recovered at the scene.

86
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:04,806
Any leads back in '72 on the doer?

87
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:09,981
The weapon that killed Simone was 
a Colt .22 automatic, Woodsman series.

88
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,662
- Never recovered.
- What else?

89
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,159
There's a set of prints off 
a jimmied window. No hits.

90
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,800
Those doers had 33 years 
to make it into the system.

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,476
Run them again.

92
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,072
We think working this job 
will flush your boy out?

93
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,458
Could, yeah.

94
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,806
You know, George couldn't 
have killed his own mother.

95
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,993
- Why not?
- He wasn't in the house that night.

96
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:35,109
DHS removed him hours earlier, put him
in a group home at mom's request.

97
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,441
His mother put him away?

98
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:42,268
Told the authority she was 
afraid of her own son.

99
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
Yeah, they took him out of here.

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,594
Kid was a real wack job.

101
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:55,912
Sat in front of the window there.

102
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:58,630
Tiddling(?) with his flashlight.

103
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,199
His mother said 
she was afraid of him. Why?

104
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,219
Kid was a punk.
Mom couldn't control him any more.

105
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,787
So you ?? him up to the group home?

106
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:12,494
Yeah. Let him loose 
with the other animals.

107
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,552
This was his bedroom.

108
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,824
Mom kept him locked up in here.

109
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,882
What do you mean locked up?

110
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,267
Dead bolts on the door.

111
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,395
I don't think she let him out much.

112
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,721
What else you're gonna 
do with a kid like that?

113
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,584
He was a weirdo all right.

114
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,677
But if you ask me,

115
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:31,930
so was mom.

116
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:35,305
I keep him in here

117
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,996
so he won't run out at nights.

118
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:47,047
Time to go, George.

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,996
Upsy daisy.

120
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,345
You heard your mom.

121
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,352
You need me to go
to the store, mother?

122
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,381
Mind me.

123
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,189
Are you sending me away 
because of what I did to their eyes?

124
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,400
Stop talking, George.

125
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:29,131
You did this.

126
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,479
You're a bad, bad boy.

127
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,449
But I did it to help you.

128
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,345
You are the darkness.

129
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,757
You always will be.

130
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,048
Apple didn't fall far from the tree,
if you know what I mean.

131
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,629
What was with the light 
coming from that house?

132
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:52,776
Got me.

133
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,077
Looked like some kind of a signal.

134
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,567
Hey, Nick, check this out.

135
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,122
Where you at?

136
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,029
Same kind of knife marks.
Top and bottom of the stairs.

137
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,354
What are they?

138
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,245
- I got 13 down here.
- How many have you got?

139
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,105
13. So what?

140
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,562
13 steps.

141
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:22,207
You were George's 
neighbor back in '72?

142
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:25,925
My bedroom was right there.
Across from his.

143
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,575
A haunted house.
It's what we called it.

144
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,148
Why? / Night after night, 
music would be blaring out of the attic.

145
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,045
Real sappy songs, 
over and over.

146
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:36,820
But you and 
George were friends?

147
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,288
Wouldn't call it that.

148
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:41,085
We just fooled around 
with our flashlights at night.

149
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,906
Morse code.

150
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,781
What kind of morse?

151
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:48,149
Hi, Bye, SOS, 
dumb stuff like that.

152
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,617
My folks would've 
killed me if they found out.

153
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:53,682
No one wanted 
their playing with George.

154
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:57,225
And you were doing this morse code thing
the night George's mother was killed?

155
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,353
George never coded me back.

156
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:02,118
So I went over to see why.

157
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,620
Shut-ins like her always have 
banks stashed under their mattresses.

158
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,436
- Sure she's alone, man?
- Yeah, sure.

159
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,570
It was like she was 
looking right through me.

160
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,562
Then what?

161
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:02,465
Then the guys started in 
on her window with a crowbar.

162
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:04,416
I ran back home.

163
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,675
Thanks for coming out here, Elvin(?).

164
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,834
You know, Jeffries said Simone had these
knife marks on all her stairways, right?

165
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,791
13 marks and 13 steps.

166
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,177
Yeah.

167
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,421
And George said he made 
those marks to help her.

168
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,546
Okay, so what?

169
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:27,756
Simone looked past Elvin 
because she couldn't see him.

170
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:32,388
George's mother was blind.

171
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,860
That's why George's fixation 
with the victim's eyes.(?)

172
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,756
His mother was blind.

173
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,520
Knife marks in the wall were 
kind of crude(?) rail for her.

174
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,500
And no one else knew 
about her blindness.

175
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,772
She was a shut-in.

176
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,353
Barely came in contact 
with the outside world.

177
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,752
- Got a hit on those window prints.
- Yeah?

178
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,285
Jacob Leonardo.

179
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:54,876
He's locked up in Allenwood Federal Pen.
We're taking you ??.

180
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:56,411
Road trip, great.

181
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,726
This Leonardo doing 
time for burglary?

182
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,020
Rape.

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,851
Has a rap sheet 
as long as my arm.

184
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,605
Kids, grandmas, 
all 51 flavors in between.

185
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:07,671
Uses his belt to gag his victims.

186
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,416
Real Romeo, this guy.

187
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,175
Better be getting back 
some of that love in lockup.

188
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,505
Wonder what kind of prison justice you'll get
when they hear you raped and killed a blind lady.

189
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:24,811
- What are talking about?
- 1972 job.

190
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,888
- I know nothing about it.
- No?

191
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:30,057
Cuz we lifted your prints
from her window.

192
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,256
Prints. So what?

193
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:33,672
Maybe I worked at the house.

194
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,505
Plus we got the rapist's semen.

195
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,189
And we're taking hair and blood 
samples from you today.

196
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,971
- Says who?
- My warrant.

197
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,615
And with a murder conviction,

198
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,178
you're stuck
in this crap hole for life.

199
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,656
I didn't kill the girl, he did.

200
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,546
- Who?
- Guy who set it up.

201
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,448
- What guy?
- Some low life that I met at the track.

202
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,939
We was on a losing 
streak and he says

203
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:01,279
he knows a way to make off 
with some bitch's life savings.

204
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,210
And you just followed along.

205
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,853
Look, man.

206
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,033
My thing is rape.

207
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:12,139
Figured I cop a feel, 
some change.(???)

208
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,875
I didn't do murder.

209
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:21,119
- There's nothing here, man.
- Be quiet or she'll hear you.

210
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,626
- Damn.
- Who's there?

211
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,588
You idiot.
What are you doing?

212
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,320
She's blind like Stevie Wonder.

213
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,963
This wasn't the plan.

214
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:05,663
- Forget the plan.
- No way.

215
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:08,144
- I'm not gonna be a part of this.
- Then leave.

216
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:11,300
It's just me and you, Helen Keller.

217
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,131
I know your voice.

218
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,943
I know who you are.
You're the one who took George away.

219
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,090
You gotta kill her now.
Might as well rape her first.

220
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,794
I mean it. Get out.

221
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:34,777
The belt, it was him, her.

222
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,813
The gun, that was the last I saw.

223
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:42,071
Jerk from DHS, gets the lay 
of the land earlier that night.

224
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:46,667
Lee. / Point is it wasn't 
me who killed the girl.

225
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,042
What kind of weapon 
did Lee have?

226
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,752
Sweet piece.

227
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,500
Colt automatic .22.

228
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,680
Woodsman series.

229
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,962
You owned the same kind of gun 
that killed Simone Marks, Lee.

230
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:08,424
You buying that con's story?

231
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,270
You're the worse kind of scum.

232
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,228
Come into people's homes as 
the do good and social worker.(?)

233
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:17,847
But on the side, 
you're casing the joint.

234
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:21,781
Did something go wrong 
with your robbery that night?

235
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:23,338
Later at Simone's.

236
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,649
Like what?

237
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,203
Like she knew you, your voice.

238
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:29,747
So you had to kill her.

239
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:34,761
I didn't. Swear it.

240
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,717
No?

241
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:39,399
Then what did you 
do in that house?

242
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,905
We know it was 
just you and her.

243
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,597
That's the thing.

244
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,470
It wasn't just me and her.

245
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,160
I ain't gonna hurt you.

246
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,760
Understand, lady?

247
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,134
What do you want with me?

248
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:56,114
- No one's gotta know about this.
- What are you gonna do?

249
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:57,657
Dirty acts?

250
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,729
- Isn't that why you're here?
- Hey, I'm leaving, okay?

251
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,515
To do dirty, filthy acts.

252
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,951
Put your disgusting 
thing inside me.

253
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,053
Keep your voice down.

254
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,790
Making another monster, 
another one like him?

255
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,653
It's darkness.

256
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,287
It always comes back.

257
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,613
Left my gun there. 
I tailed out.

258
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:48,210
Are you sure you heard 
that music coming from the attic?

259
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,357
You kidding?

260
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,719
Scared the hell out of me.

261
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,126
The darkness always comes back.

262
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,290
She was talking about George.

263
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,548
He was in the house.

264
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,597
?? security was next to nill.

265
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,346
The kids run away all the time.

266
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,805
So George could have to.

267
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:12,754
So it's just him and mom in the house
and the gun that killed her.

268
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:15,529
All right. So he scares 
Lee away and then what?

269
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,156
He shoots his own mother?

270
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,890
Mom sent him away.

271
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,259
Maybe he was looking 
to settle the score.

272
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:24,166
Looked into the buyer of the house 
who ordered the inspection.

273
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,629
Guy doesn't exist.

274
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,383
Well, someone signed
the escrow papers.

275
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,715
Someone using an alias.

276
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,804
Who wanted us 
to find those skulls.

277
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,430
George.

278
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,230
He set this whole thing in motion.

279
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,108
Rush, phone for you.
?? Smith.

280
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,600
That's the name. 
Of the buyer.

281
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:50,968
Nick.

282
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,549
Hi, George.

283
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,567
My congratulations to Will.

284
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,993
So invigorated when 
he left that escrow office.

285
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,378
So you're in Philadelphia.

286
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:20,196
I've been following your work 
these last few days.

287
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:23,108
And I see you've followed mine.

288
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,159
Well, we found your deer eyes.

289
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,227
- Yeah.
- Vicious little brute, that Bamby.

290
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:34,880
Do you know what Scottish researchers 
have discovered about our friend, the deer?

291
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:40,280
- Why don't you tell me?
- On the mineral deficient island of Rum(?),

292
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,667
deer attack young birds,

293
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:49,236
??, decapitate
?? their chicks, eat their heads.

294
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:52,098
Imagine that.

295
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,678
So you're the deer?

296
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:57,346
I thought you were the hunter.

297
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:00,280
I am both.

298
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,066
Enough with the games, George.
You wanna talk, talk.

299
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,141
If not, I'm hanging up.

300
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,718
Ask your question.

301
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,496
Why did you go back to 
your mother's house that night?

302
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:17,142
To kill her.

303
00:19:17,802 --> 00:19:22,589
But perhaps another beat me to it.

304
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,169
What do you mean?

305
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:29,495
I wasn't the only one 
who went back to that house.

306
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,944
George.

307
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,588
George.

308
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,458
Why did you send me 
away, mother?

309
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,364
You know why.

310
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:07,738
I didn't make you blind, 
how could I?

311
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:12,396
You are darkness.

312
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:16,403
You did this to me. 
You know it.

313
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:31,832
Get out of my house.

314
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,724
No, no.

315
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,550
No, no.

316
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,061
- No.
- Yeah.

317
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,208
We'll have some fun now.

318
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,648
Not in the woods.

319
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,039
Not in the woods.

320
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,692
Jacob came back, 
raped your mother.

321
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,810
We see things even 
when it seems we don't.

322
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,847
Like you.

323
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:26,579
Hiding in the closet, watching.

324
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,193
Better than porn. That.

325
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,130
Why are you telling me this?

326
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,713
To show me 
what a monster you are?

327
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,681
Apt word choice.

328
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,855
Monster.

329
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:43,251
Now you tell me something.

330
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:44,543
What?

331
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:49,431
Do you keep a photo of my mother at 
your bedside like you do all your victims?

332
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:53,275
How do you know that?

333
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,644
I know you, Lilly.

334
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:58,268
Everything about you.

335
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:05,629
- You been in my house, George?
- Not necessary to know that.

336
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:11,316
Who else would be in your bedroom 
except dead people.

337
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,257
George.

338
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:25,293
Heard you went 
back that night, scumbag.

339
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,730
- Got freaky with the blind girl.
- I didn't go back.

340
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,821
Yeah.

341
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:32,372
Labs got your DNA, it's only a matter 
of time till they match to that semen.

342
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:34,749
Labs mess up.

343
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:37,314
Got a witness too.

344
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:41,022
Her 12-year-old saw it all go down.

345
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,716
Okay.

346
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:46,683
Okay, what?

347
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:50,153
I did a rape like I do.

348
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,407
And I just wanted out.

349
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,974
Whoa, kid.

350
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:25,303
Take it easy.

351
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:28,699
Hey, put down the gun.

352
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:31,726
Not in the woods.

353
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:34,376
What?

354
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,513
How could you know that?

355
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,985
About the woods.

356
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,177
If you can't see, mother.

357
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:44,919
Stop talking, George.

358
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:52,656
No.

359
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:54,485
Forgive me.

360
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,736
George shot his mother?

361
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:12,052
Point blank.

362
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,564
Why? / Don't ask me, man.
The kid was looney tunes.

363
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:25,020
And you're saying 
she wasn't blind.

364
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:29,283
Looking down the barrel 
of that gun, she wasn't.

365
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,191
George's mother could see.

366
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,191
We see things even 
when it seems we don't.

367
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,549
That's what George meant.

368
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:38,573
So we're saying she was 
faking blindness all along?

369
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:41,297
She was crazy, maybe 
in her mind, it was true.

370
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:45,396
So we know she was blind until that moment 
in the attic right before the rape.

371
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,338
Not in the woods, she said.

372
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,564
What woods was she talking about?

373
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:53,495
We traced George's call. 
It was made from a pay phone.

374
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:54,684
Where?

375
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,195
Tinicum Wildlife Reserve.

376
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,109
Where he dumped the bodies.

377
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:00,711
Where it all started, in the woods.

378
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:01,996
So what's his game?

379
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:03,545
It smells like a set up. 
We're heading out.

380
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,171
You stay here, Lil.

381
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,843
What?

382
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:10,059
You heard me.
It's you he wants.

383
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:11,390
Let's go.

384
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,767
What do you want them to see?

385
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,514
That's it.

386
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:10,270
John.

387
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:17,389
What is it?

388
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,592
Head's missing.

389
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:11,921
Multiple gunshots.

390
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,833
He usually takes them out with one.

391
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,720
Knife wounds too. That's new.

392
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:19,887
His patterns are changing.

393
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:22,918
He's bored.

394
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:25,984
Or he's out of control.

395
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:28,454
That's why the woods.(?)

396
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,274
This is the woods.

397
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,934
I told you long ago.

398
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:44,291
We would go hunting 
together in the woods.

399
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:47,453
You and I.

400
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,725
What a shame.

401
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,014
To hide the blood?

402
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,828
But the past never quite 
goes away, does it, Lilly.

403
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:05,271
No, it doesn't.

404
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,923
Phone.

405
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:25,465
Weapon, I meant.

406
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:33,820
Now, the phone.

407
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,288
And no Lilly tricks, hmm?

408
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:52,072
Welcome to my past.

409
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:57,611
An empty room with nothing but 
your mind splashed on the walls.

410
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,956
Your mother faked her blindness.

411
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,562
Is that why you killed her?

412
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:07,916
Hysterical blindness is the term.
One needs only to believe to become.

413
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,968
But you didn't understand that then.

414
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,967
You were just 
a lonely 12 year-old.

415
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,485
In a lonely world.

416
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:18,518
Loneliness is for the weak.

417
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:21,308
And for those who desire love.

418
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,097
Neither apply.

419
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,228
Then why did you 
bring me here, George?

420
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,458
To kill you.

421
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:47,037
Why now?

422
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:52,721
Oh, hunting has become a tedious game, 
since I met you, Lilly.

423
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:02,219
Even Atlanta(?) lost her charm.

424
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,349
The one who survived.

425
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:12,333
What did you do to her?

426
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,370
Didie Cooper.

427
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,890
Oh, god, we met this girl. 
Interviewed her in these woods.

428
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,551
Atlanta, the one that got away.

429
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,234
- The first time?
- You got Lil yet?

430
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,596
She and her PPD.

431
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,517
- I told her to stay there.
- Well, she ain't there.

432
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,278
And her cell keeps 
bumping me to voice mail.

433
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:27,023
- Let's go to the house.
- Why?

434
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:28,743
Cuz that's where 
he takes the heads.

435
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:34,304
Poor Didie. 
How she begged.

436
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:36,736
In the woods.

437
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,212
Like you will.

438
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:43,033
Because in woods, 
you're a god, right?

439
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:45,207
God's a sociopath.

440
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:49,475
Free from all pretense 
of love and loyalty.

441
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,177
- Like you.
- And you.

442
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,708
Disposing of those you ??
to care for like your dirty little sis.

443
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:01,417
Sticky fingers on Lilly's hubby to be, 
real bitch in heat, that one.

444
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:03,891
Don't even think that about her.

445
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,863
You have.

446
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,983
Your mother was stripped.

447
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,770
Shot in the chest.

448
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,165
But in the end, you would've 
found another reason to leave him.

449
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:19,128
Just like Tina, Janet. All of them.

450
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:22,918
You replicate her 
murder over and over.

451
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:25,273
But why the running?

452
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:29,084
Your mother didn't run.

453
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,836
Your junior college degree

454
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:38,540
equips you for pop psychology and a low 
level five figure income, not much else.

455
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,050
Why do you make them run?

456
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:44,581
Why?

457
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:53,737
You were running, right?

458
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:55,595
Why?

459
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:57,991
Trying to find help?

460
00:32:57,991 --> 00:33:00,051
Stop him from hurting your mother?

461
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:04,519
The granny panties, 
all in a bunch.(?)

462
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,759
Who could resist that?

463
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:10,247
Your turn now

464
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,540
to tell me.

465
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:16,603
- Tell you what?
- Of little Lilly lamb.

466
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,644
Long ago.

467
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:26,719
Still ain't answering.

468
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,168
It's her car.

469
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:31,790
Detective Valens, 
how nice of you to come?

470
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,579
What do you want with Lilly?

471
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,897
I never sent my condolences, 
did I, about your pretty fiancee.

472
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:42,211
Oh, the river can do terrible 
things to a girl's complexion.

473
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:47,520
You hurt her, George,

474
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,412
I'll murder you.

475
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:52,581
A gentle reminder 
to mind your manners.

476
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:55,452
Now, put your boss on the phone.

477
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,975
George.

478
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:03,593
Let's work this out.

479
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:08,755
One courtesy call is purpose to disabuse 
you of storming the Alamo guns blazing.

480
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,237
If you call again, if I see a cop 
within 100 yards of this house,

481
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,624
I put a bullet in her head.

482
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:19,873
No one's gotta die here, George.

483
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,782
Too bad you couldn't save her.

484
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:27,559
Save who?

485
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,942
Your daughter.

486
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,439
From the big bad wolf, 
his sharp wet teeth.

487
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,633
Let me talk to Lilly, George.

488
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:40,922
A real father would've eviscerated
the thug who soiled his little girl.

489
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:44,842
But you, you just talked.

490
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:46,210
Now you listen to me.

491
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,334
You won't get out of this 
alive without my help, George.

492
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:57,028
I know all about your help,
it comes 18 years too late.

493
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:02,085
And true to form, 
you're too late for Lilly too.

494
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:09,760
So...

495
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:14,056
Where were we?

496
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,186
Game's over.

497
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:21,603
- It's only  a matter of time now.
- You were telling me how you ran.

498
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,047
- You're gonna die in here too.
- Tell me how you ran.

499
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,372
No.

500
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:33,885
You've never told anyone 
what happened little Lilly long ago.

501
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:36,162
But you want to tell.

502
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:40,071
- Not you.
- Well, I'm the only one left.

503
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,435
So tell me.

504
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:50,875
I was 10 on my way to the store.

505
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:54,325
It was dark out, late.

506
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,109
And that's when 
the bad man came for you.

507
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:02,729
I ran.

508
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,689
But he caught me.

509
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,055
Did he touch you?

510
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:10,291
In your secret place.

511
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:14,921
He wanted my money.

512
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:17,181
That's why he followed me.

513
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,670
I gave him what I had.

514
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,964
Then he went his merry way.

515
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:25,498
You know he didn't.

516
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:29,719
Tell me what he did.

517
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,644
He hit me.

518
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,926
- I don't remember much after that.
- Cracked(?) your jaw. Five broken teeth.

519
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,081
Pretty little face not so pretty 
when he got through with you.

520
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,967
I fought, but he wouldn't stop.

521
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:45,567
He just kept hitting and 
hitting me and laughing.

522
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:53,789
I didn't wanna die. 
So I fought.

523
00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:04,078
We're alike, you and I.

524
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:06,198
How so?

525
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,129
You fought too.

526
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,371
That's why you were bleeding.

527
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,807
Jacob found you in the closet,

528
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,378
- cornered you.
- No.

529
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:20,160
And you fought. Like me.

530
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:27,623
No.

531
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,645
Let go of me.

532
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:31,856
No.

533
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:41,273
And you ran.

534
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:44,924
But the doors were locked. 
The windows nailed shut.

535
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:47,885
He hunted you down in 
that house like an animal.

536
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:51,645
- I'm not an animal.
- That's why you pick fighters.

537
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:55,055
How did he know you were 
in that closet, George?

538
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,645
Do you want to know 
what I'm wondering?

539
00:37:56,645 --> 00:38:00,095
I'm wondering who would send a 10-year-old 
girl to the store late at night all alone.

540
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,101
That's what I'm wondering.

541
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:07,225
SWAT will have sharp shooters 
in position ten minutes tops.

542
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:09,075
She doesn't have 
10 minutes, Scottie.

543
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:11,841
I'm going in. / But he was real 
clear about violating the perimeter.

544
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,223
He's blind on the south side 
of the house. I can enter there.

545
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:15,864
Yeah, then he puts 
a bullet in her head.

546
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:17,888
Look, you do this, 
you'll kill her.

547
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,431
He's gonna kill her anyway.

548
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:23,353
Boss.

549
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:25,358
I'm not losing her too, Scottie.

550
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:33,558
Who sent you to the store, Lilly?

551
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:36,154
I go there all the time.

552
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:40,183
- The owner knew me.
- Answer the question, Lilly.

553
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:44,521
My mother.

554
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:46,778
Why?

555
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,538
She needed a drink.

556
00:38:55,984 --> 00:39:02,126
Sold out by the person 
who loved you most.

557
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,994
No wonder little Lilly likes 
to play with the dead.

558
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:12,896
Who sold you out, George?

559
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,576
Because what I'm wondering is how did 
Jacob know you were hiding in that closet.

560
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,095
You stop talking.

561
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:22,087
Forgive me, your mother said.

562
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:23,504
- For what?
- Shut up.

563
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:25,721
She told Jacob where 
to find you, didn't she?

564
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,508
You shut up.

565
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,712
Your mother wasn't 
raped in this attic.

566
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:32,447
You shut up.
You shut up.

567
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:34,747
You shut up.
You shut up.

568
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,512
You were.

569
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,896
Not in the woods.

570
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:44,715
Not in the woods.

571
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,962
Not in the woods.

572
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:49,656
In the closet.

573
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:50,999
In the closet.

574
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:54,087
The boy, do it to him.

575
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:57,114
Not me, do it to him.

576
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:07,606
He brought you up here 
and raped you.

577
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,385
And she just watched.

578
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:13,546
I am god in these woods.

579
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:15,557
No, George.

580
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:18,887
You're a little boy.

581
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:21,949
Whose mother didn't love him.

582
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:25,304
Who sold him out.

583
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:28,821
Like you.

584
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:35,056
It's time you learned.

585
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,119
Down on the ground, George.

586
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,326
About freedom.

587
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,014
On the ground.

588
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:59,757
When you kill me,

589
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,673
the only thing that separates 
you and I is who pulls the trigger.

590
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,113
Don't make me do that.

591
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:10,912
- I don't wanna kill you.
- Yes, you do. That's why you came.

592
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:14,068
We are alike, you and I.

593
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,961
I'm nothing like you.

594
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:18,658
You sleep with the dead.

595
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:21,435
You're already half way there.

596
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,942
And when you kill me,

597
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:28,770
even those photos you 
cling to will fade away

598
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,599
like everyone fades away for you.

599
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,133
And you will be alone.

600
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,756
Like me.

601
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:42,607
You're wrong.
I'll never be like you.

602
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:44,150
