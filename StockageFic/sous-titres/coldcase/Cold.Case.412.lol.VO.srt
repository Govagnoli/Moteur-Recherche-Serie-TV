Cold Case
Season 4 Episode 12

90
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,220
All right.

91
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,660
Young adult male,body too decomposed to ake a proper ID.

92
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,530
Anything else in there to identify him?

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,460
A damaged cell phone,backpack at the bottom of the drum.

94
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,470
- What are they doing down there?
- The sister is the one...

95
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,860
who put us on to the location.

96
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,790
The family can't see this.

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,840
Looks like multiple fractures base of the skull.

98
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,090
Kid was beaten to death.

99
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,340
Like in the video.

100
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,590
We'll take the drum, bag the hands,

101
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,840
check the fingernails for DNA, could have fought his assailant.

102
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,490
We have the cell number?

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,360
Well,Main Line PD already dumped his number after he went missing.

104
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,200
No calls after James left home.

105
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,730
Video assault was originally posted from
inside Hanford Prep Academy.

106
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,510
The same high school the victim attended.

107
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,550
Looks like you're taking a trip out to the Main Line.

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Want me to handle this one,boss?

109
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,170
No,I got it.

110
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,060
I got some bad news.No...stay still...

111
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,930
This a high school or a country club?

112
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,030
The place gives me the willies.

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,670
'Cause these kids drive better cars than we do?

114
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,370
No,'cause it's high school and you're the only female in sight.

115
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,190
Excuse me,officers.

116
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,200
Detectives.

117
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,640
Valens and Rush, Philly Homicide.

118
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,320
Gene Emmerick, Headmaster.

119
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,750
I wish you'd called ahead to tell me you were coming.

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,630
Computer labs this way?

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,080
Excuse me,did you say homicide?

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,050
Yeah,James Hoffman, he was a student here.

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,970
Oh,my God. I knew Jes.Top-notch student.

124
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,360
- That's terrible news.
- We're gonna need to see...

125
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,890
any online records in the computer lab.

126
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,480
Whatever you need. We're an open book.

127
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,730
We'll need to talk to whoever monitors computer usage.

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,360
We use students to monitor the computer room.

129
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,910
Great,if you could get us a list of names.

130
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,140
Like,any who knew James Hoffman.

131
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
Not a problem.

132
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,380
I just need to get the written permission

133
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,580
of their parents before you talk to them.

134
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,070
Oh,that won't be necessary.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,790
If you could just show me those logs,Mr. Emmerick.

136
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,730
Hey.

137
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
Hold up,sport.Name?

138
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Lucas.

139
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,670
What's your hurry,Lucas?

140
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,010
I'm just late for my next class.

141
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,260
What,gym?

142
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,320
You don't look like a kid who hurries to P.E.

143
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,810
Calculus,a short cut.

144
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,070
Go ahead,I'll walk with you.

145
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,930
No,it's cool.

146
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,050
No,no,it's not.

147
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,160
You knew James Hoffman?

148
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,480
Sort of used to be friends,kind of.

149
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,490
Sort of,kind of want to tell me here or down at the station,Lucas?

150
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,780
We used to eat lunch in the computer lab together.

151
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,080
Compare ** scores.

152
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,800
He'd always ace me out.

153
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,580
Then he started tanking.

154
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,520
Tanking what?

155
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,920
His grades.His life.

156
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,740
He got all weird and angry.

157
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,270
We stopped talking.

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,950
When was that?

159
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,180
A couple months before he went missing.

160
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,430
All the Ivy's are getting rid of early decision.

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,490
There's no angle left unless you're a hook.

162
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,950
A hook?

163
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,370
Yeah,like a legacy,athlete,minority, special circumstance.

164
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,140
I think I got an uncle who's part Native American.

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,060
I'd look into it.

166
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,570
Pacific Islander's good,too.

167
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,460
Dude,my parents are all over me about the essay right now.

168
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah,you're supposed to write about your passion.

169
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,870
Whatever that means.

170
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,710
I'm passionate about Giselle Bundchen.

171
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,110
Tell me about it,man.

172
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,210
I stayed up all night last night and I only inked out a page.

173
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,080
Let me see.

174
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,190
No way.

175
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,660
Come on,Jay, you know I don't pirate.

176
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,670
All right,man.

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,920
Promise not to laugh.

178
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,690
Hey.***

179
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,850
Come on,man, give that back.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey,Tanner,what are you doing?

181
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,590
What are you doing?!

182
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,360
What did you do that for?

183
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,560
What the...?

184
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,670
Do something.

185
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,250
Do something,come on,hit me.

186
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,360
Come on,come on,hit me.

187
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,040
Come on, pretend I'm your dad.

188
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,530
What? You're an idiot.

189
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,780
Take your fist and take a swing,come on.

190
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,080
Tanner,leave him alone. He didn't do anything to you.

191
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,690
That's what I thought.

192
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,880
The tattoo on his left wrist?

193
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,370
You're sure about that?

194
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,710
Yeah.Like one of those little anarchy symbols.

195
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
Why?

196
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,880
Who was this clown?

197
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,980
Tanner Lennox.

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,230
But you didn't hear it from me.

199
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,320
He's untouchable.

200
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,370
Yeah,why's that?

201
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,740
His dad just donated the new science building, that's why.

202
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,780
Go on.You're going to be late for calculus.

203
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,980
You had a beef with James,Tanner?

204
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,270
It's nothing personal.

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,430
This interview is over.

206
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,530
I'm taking my son home.

207
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,660
We just need to ask Tanner a few questions,Mr. Lennox.

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,440
Not without my lawyer you're not.

209
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,730
Why,you got something to hide?

210
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,170
Come on,Tanner.

211
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,720
We have your son on videotape assaulting another student.

212
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,500
James Hoffman, whose body

213
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,730
turned up this morning, stuffed in drum down at The Bottom.

214
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,090
So either we talk to your son today,Mr. Lennox,

215
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,480
right here, real civil like...

216
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,020
Or we get a warrant for his arrest,and stick him in a holding cell all weekend...

217
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,540
Until his daddy's attorney gets him arraigned Monday morning.

218
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,030
You're on video?What the hell?

219
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,190
Tanner?

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,110
Yeah.Yeah,you're right, that was me...

221
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,650
pounding on James, but...it's not what you think.

222
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,080
Over! Over! Over! Over! Over!

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,750
How do you feel?

224
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Alive.

225
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,480
Welcome to the world, young buck.

226
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,170
What'd I tell you? Yeah.

227
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,860
Next time, thumbs on the outside,
unless you want to break them.

228
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,410
Thanks,Aries.

229
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,190
You,you,fight.

230
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,590
Bunch of rich kids throwing down in the hood?

231
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,590
It's a fight club.

232
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,510
Some people like to drink,do drugs.We like to fight.

233
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,490
What,you saying James was a part of this?

234
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,440
He took to battle like a caged amal.

235
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,650
Hey,neighbor.

236
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,870
I usually move the car before the street sweeper.

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,810
I just overslept.

238
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,900
Oh,give it to me, I'll take care of it.

239
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,850
Oh,no,that's okay.I'll just pay it.

240
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,760
Why? Just give it to me.

241
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,920
Well,I don't want to put you out.

242
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,340
It's no big deal, realreally.

243
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,160
Hey.Hey

244
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,690
Scotty,you remember my neighbor,Toni?

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,370
Yeah,how could I forget?

246
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,430
You,uh,follow up  my case?

247
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,680
The case of the missing basketball?

248
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,600
We got Encyclopedia Brown on it.

249
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,640
We,sorry,I got to go.I'm already late.

250
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,420
- Thanks.
- Forget it.

251
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,710
Look at you,dawg.

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,660
What?

253
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,290
Trying to tap that.

254
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,370
Come on,she's a broke, single mom.

255
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah,you're just helping her out,
big-shotting that ticket.

256
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,740
Justeing neighborly.

257
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,830
You know you can't fix it.

258
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,080
That's the biggest cop lie invented.

259
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,140
Think I'm working a favor?

260
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,440
I find that offensive.

261
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,220
Yeah,you're not interested, just let me know.I'll ask her out.

262
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,690
Back off,slick.

263
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,760
Anyway,they got a name on that kid was the ringleader of ts fight club.

264
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,200
He's Cole Palmer,senior, a.k.a. "Aries."

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,820
Aries was the Greek God of War.

266
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,530
Rawfodog spelled backwards?"God of War."

267
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,540
So the same kid posted the video.

268
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,370
Not bad,huh?

269
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,510
Yeah,dude.You really need a girlfriend.

270
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,260
Cole.Or should we call you Aries?

271
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,840
You could have just e-mailed me.

272
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,130
Why'd you post that video assault of James Hoffman?

273
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,200
Assault?That sounds criminal.

274
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,070
We know all about the little fight club you were running.

275
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,940
Yeah,you left James to rot in the drum down in The Bottom.

276
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,420
You're making it sound like I knew he was dead.

277
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,820
You were down there with him.

278
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,590
We moved on from that location a long time ago.

279
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,000
I got no idea who killed James.

280
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,250
We lock you up for inciting a riot,

281
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,640
maybe that'll jog your memory.

282
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,840
A riot?

283
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,970
What,like two kids lacing up the gloves in the backyard?

284
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,280
Your average hockey fight?

285
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,620
I used to box,kid.What you're doing ain't the same thing.

286
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,970
Oh,that's right.

287
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,690
Only cops get to beat the crap out of people.

288
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,510
This kid's really starting to bother me.

289
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,060
I wonder who'd win,

290
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,830
you two threw down,
I bet you big boy here packs a whopper.

291
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,370
You think this is some kind of game,jackass?

292
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,730
Define assault for me again.

293
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,990
What happened to James?

294
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,150
James is just another domesticated dog on a leash headed down a path to misery.

295
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,890
What are you talking about?

296
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,330
Inside of every dog there is a wolf.

297
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,830
I just let 'em out.

298
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Hey,is that my phone?

299
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,860
Yeah,that was your dad.

300
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,500
I told him you wet your pants.

301
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,420
Your old man calls you eight times a day?

302
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,620
Talk about an electronic umbilical cord.

303
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,010
What's he do anyway?

304
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,910
What does that have to do with anything?

305
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,240
Your father, does he got a life or is he too busy scheduling yours?

306
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,440
He's a computer programmer
and he's plenty busy.

307
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,410
Hey,dyou want to make money? Yeah,sure,someday.

308
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,760
Well,my pop made a fortune on Wall Street

309
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,060
but that didn't stop his trophy wife from
banging her personal trainer.

310
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,790
Can you just give me back my phone?

311
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,940
What are you taking all these AP exams for?

312
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,380
For college credit.What are you doing?

313
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,820
You're off to grad school.

314
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,500
Eventually. Med school,law school.

315
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,820
Which is it, lawyer,doctor,what?

316
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,030
I don't know yet,ay?

317
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,610
Did you ever read Jack London?

318
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,300
<i>The Call of The Wild, yeah. So what?</i>

319
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,180
So you lack inspiration,Buck.
And you can't wait for it.

320
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,330
You have to go after it with a club.

321
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,770
What are you talking about?

322
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,500
You should know that man has only two primal passions:

323
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,560
to get and beget. Do you feel me,Buck?

324
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
My name's not Buck.

325
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,010
Do you ever wonder why

326
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,400
marginal students get into great colleges every year?

327
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,020
No,because they don't.

328
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,650
Yes,they do.

329
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,140
You want to change an F into a B,

330
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,640
you just put a three on top.

331
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,840
The system's rigged.

332
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,270
I know how the system works.

333
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,430
All you know is not to touch
a hot stove or run with scissors.

334
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,870
When was the last time you did anything that you wanted to do?

335
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,040
Hey,at least I got a plan in life.

336
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,050
Well,guess what,Buck.

337
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,450
Everybody's got a plan until they get hit in the mouth.

338
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,550
Hey,pick it up! Yes.

339
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,750
Pick it up and give me back my damn phone!

340
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,690
Yes,that's what I want to see,Buck.

341
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,130
Stop calling me Buck! And this clenched fist,

342
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,860
<i>that's The Call of the Wild.</i>

343
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,160
And when you're ready to answer it,

344
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,290
you just give me a call.

345
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,000
Buck answered the call-- total transformation.

346
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,930
What did you mean,"The system's rigged"?

347
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,240
The headmaster helped kids like Tanner Lennox get over on the game.

348
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,450
He helped them cheat,fudged their scores.

349
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,770
Hanford Prep isn't totally merit-based.

350
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,680
What's that got to do with James?

351
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,030
James found out.

352
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,040
Blew a gasket, called the headmaster out.

353
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,340
So Emmerick killed James? Come on.

354
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,360
Or let some punk kid torpedo his career,maybe end up in jail?

355
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,170
You're right,that's insane.

356
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,460
You remember when Tanner Lennox took
his AP Board test for college?

357
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,530
I think he may have taken them over. I'd have to check.

358
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,310
Oh,we already did, with the ETS Testing Service.

359
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,750
He took them twice.

360
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,270
Failed the first time.

361
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,820
But then you were the proctor in the room the second time around.

362
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,920
Near-perfect score.

363
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,820
Tell us.

364
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,650
Is it common practice

365
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,200
to allow students to have their cell phones on during the test?

366
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,970
You're accing me of helping students cheat on a college board exam?

367
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,700
The rich ones,yeah.

368
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,240
Is there a point to all this false conjecture?

369
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,780
James Hoffman called you out the same day he died.

370
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,030
James was a brilliant student,

371
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,570
but I've seen it before with kids under stress.

372
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,010
He became paranoid,volatile.

373
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,260
Volatile?

374
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,720
It's unfortate, but you can never predict

375
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,820
how a student will handle the admissions process.

376
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,640
Remember,you need to have three recommendations lined up:

377
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,560
two from teachers and preferably one

378
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,690
from an alumni of your first-choice school.

379
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,700
Excuse me.

380
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,480
Please,hold all questions till the end. Thank you.

381
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,870
No,I just,I just want to know
which test date u'll be proctoring.

382
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,630
Why,Mr. Hoffman?

383
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,980
Because...I'll want to make sure to bring my cell phone,too.

384
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,800
Or does my dad need to donate a wing to the school for me

385
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,340
to g that sort of special attention?

386
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,300
Sit down,Mr. Hoffman.

387
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,750
No,no,I want to know.

388
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,730
Which of you here is claiming you're

389
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,500
one-eighth Native American on their applications?

390
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,890
I'm Eskimo,does that count?

391
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,950
Tell me.

392
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,580
How many hours flying over

393
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,990
Guatemala qualifies as community service?

394
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,230
James... No,seriously.

395
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
Is this process merit-based,
or can we just make it all up?

396
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,720
That's enough,James.Sit down.

397
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,870
Look at you.You're like gerbils in a cage.

398
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,080
When was the last time any of you did anything

399
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,330
because you wanted to do it?

400
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,200
Not for your parents, not to get into college.

401
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,360
When was the last time you felt alive?

402
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,670
Son,you're bleeding.

403
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,870
How about that?

404
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,460
Looks like I found my passion.

405
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,860
This incident slip your mind when James went missing?

406
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,180
I had no reason to believe it was related.

407
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,340
Or you didn't want the world to know you had a price tag.

408
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,780
For the record,I did inform someone about what happened,

409
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,350
James's father.And he hit the roof.

410
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,310
One,two,nine,four,four, three,three,nine.

411
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,730
Yeah. Yeah.Expires 10-09. got to call you back.

412
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,790
Take care of that ticket yet?

413
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,730
Yeah,I just got to call in a favor.

414
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,470
What,you don't think I got the juice?

415
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,110
Juice?

416
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,980
No,I think you got a credit card.

417
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,750
You should have just skipped the favor BS and asked her out.

418
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,560
Save 40 bucks.

419
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,380
Yeah,single mom,neighbor, pain-in-the-ass kid,
the whole package.

420
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,730
That sounds like me.

421
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,840
Except for the neighbor part.

422
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,990
No offense. None taken.

423
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,200
What makes you think I want an overweight, underpaid white man?

424
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,450
No offense.

425
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,460
See what you started?

426
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,640
Go squeeze some more juice out of that plastic.

427
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,890
Yeah.Got it.Thank you.

428
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,280
That was Franny.

429
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,200
Found skin under James' fingernails.

430
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,140
We got a match?

431
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,300
Yep.DNA was Jame's father.

432
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,160
Back this way, Mr. Hoffman.

433
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,660
Dad?

434
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,820
Why don't you wait here with me?

435
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,060
It's okay,Alexa. Go ahead.

436
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,410
Like a soda?

437
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,660
Anything? No,thanks.

438
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,300
Sohere's news about my brother's case?

439
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,120
Alexa,did you notice any changes with your brother,

440
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,230
justefore he went missing?

441
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,600
He was a little stressed out.

442
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,560
The college thing is a lot to handle.

443
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,770
Yeah,I guess.

444
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,600
You remember how he got that black eye?

445
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,470
No,not really.

446
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,430
Your dad had pretty high expectations for your brother.

447
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,210
My dad would never hurt my brother.

448
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,790
No?

449
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,950
He went through a lot.

450
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,530
Especially after my mom left.

451
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,070
What about you?

452
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,950
I just... I just want him to be proud of me,too.

453
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,880
like he was of James?

454
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,040
I admit James and I got into an argument.

455
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,000
You're skin was under his fingernails,Darryl.

456
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,250
Come on.

457
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,350
Well,something happened. I-I didn't understand.

458
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,800
That night?

459
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,860
The past few months, he'd been checking out,

460
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,340
coming home late at night,

461
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,880
out of pocket for hours at a time

462
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,780
like he... like he was on drugs or something.

463
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,990
You confronted him?

464
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,480
Well,after I got the phone call from the headmaster about Jam that day.

465
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,980
The incident at school th Emmerick?

466
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,080
I... I couldn't believe it.

467
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,670
All the tuition and the hard work,he...

468
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,110
He was just throwing it away.

469
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,120
What the hell is going on?

470
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,290
Trying to hit the chimney.

471
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,780
What is wrong with you,James?

472
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,030
Were you trying to get expelled?

473
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,180
Remember when me and Lex were kids and you used to

474
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,860
play with us in the snow for hours?

475
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,650
James,what are you talking about?

476
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,370
Then after Mom left,you just...

477
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,890
you just sort of stopped doing that.

478
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,230
Damn it,James, I am talking to you.

479
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,770
Is that what you call it?

480
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,430
I must have called youen times,lt you messages.

481
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,970
You don't even call back.

482
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,890
Oh,yeah,must have turned it off.

483
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,780
Well,why'd you turn off your phone?

484
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,880
More importantly,why do you have to call me...ten times a day?

485
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,510
I should have cut that cord a long time ago.

486
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,050
Are you on drugs? Nope.

487
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,410
Never been more clear-headed in my life.

488
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,710
So you are going to flush everything
that we have worked for

489
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,080
down the drain, is that it?

490
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,520
Is that the plan,James?

491
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,450
We? The plan?

492
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,250
You know,all this time I've been busting my hump,

493
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,020
doing what you wanted me to do.

494
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,430
Then it occurred to me,why do I want to be like you?

495
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,040
What?You've been a miserable

496
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,870
suffocating jerk for so long,no wonder Mom left.

497
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,440
Your mother left because she couldn't handle raising two kids.

498
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:16,930
You're saying it's my fault?

499
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,500
No,damn it.That's not what I meant.

500
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,620
I don't wantto talk about...Hey,come back here.

501
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,700
Hey.

502
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,220
What has gotten into you?

503
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,370
You're the one who changed, dad.

504
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,090
Why can't it be more like before?

505
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,950
Before?

506
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,390
Yeah, before.

507
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,020
Before you cared so much about my scores, my grades.

508
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,400
I-I don't understand, james.

509
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,480
No, why can't you just be happy with me?

510
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,410
Get your own life, dad.

511
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,430
that was the last time I saw him.

512
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,360
It had to be tough, the past eight years, raising kids on your own.

513
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,850
I just wanted him to have every advantage,

514
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,190
be prepared for when life let you down.

515
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
Darryl, you're saying james destroyed his cell phone that night?

516
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Yeah.

517
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,070
So whose phone was that in the oil drum?

518
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,360
Off to work?

519
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,040
Oh, late jump?

520
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,470
Late night.

521
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,460
Oh, by the way, I took care of that thing for you.

522
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,650
What thing?

523
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,570
Parking ticket.

524
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh, oh, thanks.

525
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,150
Appreciate it.

526
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,770
It's nothing, really.

527
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,680
Something else you want to tell me?

528
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,210
Uh, no, uh...

529
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,530
I just realized how nice it is to talk to you without that damn ball bouncing.

530
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,700
Hmm.For a second there, I thought you were going to ask me out.

531
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,180
Me?

532
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,610
Were you?

533
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,050
Absolutely.

534
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,390
Let me think about it.

535
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,540
Think about it?

536
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,880
Sunday night, I'll buy.

537
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,480
Since you paid for the ticket.

538
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,800
Sunday night it is.

539
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,280
Hey, what you cramming for...
lucas?

540
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,190
Ap chem.

541
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,820
Am I in trouble?

542
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,130
I tried to call you, but I guess we had an old cell number.

543
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,430
You switch phones in the last year?

544
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,800
Get a new number?

545
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,590
No.Maybe you lent it to somebody.

546
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Not that I remember.

547
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,010
No?'Cause the cell phone we found with james's body,

548
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,920
we pulled the serial number.

549
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,530
Yeah, checked it with the service provider--  the phone was registered to you.

550
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,200
Stand up, lucas, let's go.

551
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,880
I lent my cell phone to james.

552
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,460
Why?

553
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,360
He called.
Said he needed me to come pick him up.

554
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,030
From where?Uh, overbrook station.

555
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,810
When was this?

556
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,290
The night he disappeared.

557
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,920
He was in trouble.Big time.

558
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,600
you scared the hell out of me.

559
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,290
Let's get out of here.

560
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,580
What's up?

561
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,710
Just drive, man, just go!

562
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,710
Go where?What's going on, james?

563
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,100
Dude...dude, is that blood?

564
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,960
You're getting it all over my dad's leather seats.

565
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,820
I screwed everything up.

566
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,760
Let me just sit here, okay?

567
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,530
Let me...let me just sit here.

568
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,200
Okay.

569
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,260
I got so lost, you know?

570
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,660
Yeah...sure...

571
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,090
I thought he was right 'cause I was mad at my dad...

572
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,650
but then I just kind of lost sight again.

573
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,660
Of what?

574
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,660
Of me.

575
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,630
I got to make it right.

576
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,300
Give me your phone.

577
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,820
What?

578
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,650
I'll give it back later.Please.

579
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,140
Hey, what happened, james?

580
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,270
This guy, I think we killed him.

581
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,320
They killed someone?

582
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,760
I don't know, I guess.

583
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,050
Their fight club?

584
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,350
I'm not going to get in trouble, am I?

585
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,160
I mean, I'm waitting to hear from colleges.

586
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,360
I checked on this kid's story, boss.

587
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,180
There was an assault of an adult male, white,

588
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,780
that evening, a few blocks from mantua train station.

589
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,880
Martin jacobsen, 42.

590
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,080
Discovered unconscious with a critical head injury-- subdural hematoma.

591
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,900
Blood on the brain.

592
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,000
He died two days later, ruled a homicide.

593
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,390
The r-5 stops in mantua.

594
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,300
It's the same train james took to the bottom.

595
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,100
He was telling the truth about killing someone.

596
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,200
So, who'd he mean by "we"?

597
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,620
Got the dump back on lucas's cell phone that night.

598
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,930
Only one call made, to cole palmer.

599
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,180
The fight club leader.

600
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,860
If they killed a man, could be james went to meet cole later on.

601
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,580
To get their stories straight.

602
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,010
And cole cleaned up the loose end.

603
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,570
50 years homicide Here, cole.

604
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,910
No strangers to violence as a lure to young men.

605
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,850
Girls cut themselves, guys fight.

606
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,860
Show of strength, confused with power.

607
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,280
But it's always a dead end.

608
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,060
Because violence just begets more violence.

609
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,970
And someone...ends up dead.

610
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,620
That guy's dead?

611
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,400
You remember him?

612
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,980
His name was martin jacobsen.

613
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,090
He left a wife and a four-year-old boy.

614
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,000
Beaten to death.

615
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,240
Look at him.

616
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,770
Look at him.

617
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,980
You think you know everything, but you don'T.

618
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,130
Don't know what...buck?

619
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,230
Black eyes, bruises...

620
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,360
I show up like this every day at school, and all the adults are asleep at the wheel.

621
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,220
Nobody asks why.

622
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,760
So you do it for the attention?

623
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,520
No, to feel alive.

624
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,960
To feel like I matter.

625
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,160
Killing james make you feel alive, too, cole?

626
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,120
I didn't kill him.

627
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,130
What happened that night?

628
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,090
We had just gotten off the train, and everything went to hell.

629
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,380
You scratched him?

630
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,060
You should have wailed on your old man, if you ask me, man.

631
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,080
That's not the point, you know?

632
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,210
He's always meant well.

633
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,220
No, the point is, you dad thinks your accomplishments

634
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,990
are a reflection of him, as long as you look good on paper.

635
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,930
No, forget it.

636
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,670
Is that guy lost?

637
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,350
The car won't start and I'm in a kind of
a sketchy neighborhood.

638
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,400
What a tool.

639
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,410
Yeah, if you can get here as soon as possible, I'd appreciate it.

640
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,420
Just like my dad.

641
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,900
What's he doing?

642
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,830
I don't know!

643
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,530
Hey!

644
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,870
Hey, cut that out.Give that back.

645
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,120
Buy, sell, buy, sell, everything must go!

646
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,890
Kid, what are you doing?

647
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,700
Hey, tanner!

648
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,300
Yo, tanner!

649
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,640
Hey, get off him, huh?

650
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,510
What the hell's wrong with you?

651
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,490
He'll be all right.

652
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,550
Oh, my god!Hey.

653
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,320
Tanner, you idiot.

654
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,800
Hey, come on, he's fine, man.

655
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,000
Does he look fine to you?

656
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,440
We gotta get this guy some help.

657
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,670
No, we gotta get the hell outta here, man.

658
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,590
Come on, cole.We gotta get outta here.

659
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,010
Screw it, I'm gone.

660
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,630
Hey!Hey!

661
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,210
James, we've got to go.

662
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,550
No!We can't just leave this guy here.

663
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,270
That's not my problem.

664
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,130
Everybody's got a plan, right, cole?

665
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,330
What's your plan now?

666
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,190
Cole!

667
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,250
I just took off.

668
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,540
You got scared.

669
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,320
I never wanted anybody to die.

670
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,040
Why did james call you?

671
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,150
He wanted to go to the police.

672
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,870
But that never happened.

673
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,080
I called tanner and told him to go meet james at the bottom and settle it.

674
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,340
Settle it?

675
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,680
But you never went.

676
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,760
It was tanner's mess, not mine.

677
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,710
You want to talk deal with my son, it'll be through my lawyer after he makes bail.

678
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,430
There won't be any deal then, mr.Lennox.

679
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,300
Tanner killed martin jacobsen, the same night james disappeared.

680
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,260
We got testimony from an eyewitness.

681
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,220
Dad...just keep your mouth shut, tanner.

682
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,320
You were only 17 at the time.

683
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,230
I can't go to jail.

684
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,840
Worst case, they prosecute you as a juvenile.

685
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,040
Prosecute?Dad.

686
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,570
Over 16, any violent act is automatically tried as an adult.

687
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,990
You became a man e minute you started beating that guy, tanner.

688
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,470
I didn'T...mean to kill anybody.

689
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,790
Tanner, shut up.

690
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,370
Just let me handle this mess.

691
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,960
Don't tell me to shut up!

692
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,060
I'm sick of you always telling me what to do.

693
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,310
You met james down at the bottom.

694
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,600
Didn't you?

695
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,000
Man up, tanner.James had to go.

696
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,910
Tanner...you're a lennox.Do not go down a loser.

697
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,090
I'm not a loser.

698
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,100
Shut up, damn it.

699
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,970
He was just a kid, dad.

700
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,190
You do this, you're going down.

701
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,420
Then you're coming with me.

702
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,140
Stay in the car.I'll handle this.

703
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,180
Get out here, son!

704
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,860
Mr.Lennox?

705
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,320
Shut up.Over here.

706
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,710
Tanner told me everything you dumb ass kids did tonight.

707
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,910
We got to go to the police.

708
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,210
Don't be stupid.

709
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,270
The only thing that's gonna save your ass is if everybody keeps their mouth shut.

710
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,380
'Cause all it takes is one screw-up like this to derail your whole life.

711
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:35,340
Screw-up?We killed a guy.

712
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,640
Son, after tonight, there'll be no mention of this ever again.

713
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,350
Understand?

714
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,550
You're a bright kid, james, with a hell of a future,

715
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,650
but I know your father's financial situation.

716
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,930
Do the right thing, and I can pull some strings.

717
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,940
Tuition will not be an issue.

718
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,330
The right thing?

719
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,090
You wouldn't know the right thing
if it bit you in the ass.

720
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,560
My dad never made a lot of money, mr.Lennox,

721
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,340
but he knows right from wrong.

722
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,160
That's very touching.

723
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,930
Your point?

724
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,080
You screw up, you man up.

725
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,530
Sorry, mr.Lennox.

726
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:10,990
You can take your offer and shove it.
