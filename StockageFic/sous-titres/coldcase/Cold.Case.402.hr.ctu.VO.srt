2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,990
I told you guys,no gifts.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,410
Who ever believes that?

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,920
Come on.

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,530

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,260
How can you tell it's a girl,mommy?

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,410

Oh,and I'm supposedto be dieting.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,470
One of the few good perks of being this huge is you can eat like a horse.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,260

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,480

Oh,my god.

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm being deployed?

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,110
But you havea kid.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,790

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,600

Probably get stationed in oneof saddam's old palace sgrilling filetsfor the generals.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,690
Right.

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,860
Well,here.
I'll slice the tart.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,440

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,360
You're goingaway,mommy?

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,630
I'll be backbefore you know it.

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,540
In no time at all.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,410
That veronicain the car?

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,760
We're on our wayto school.

37
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,160
She's pouting becauseI won't let her come with.

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,380
Eight-year-old wantsto see a crime scene?

39
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,960
She's a weird kid.

40
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,680
- Hey,boss.
- Morning.

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,050
We got a floater?

42
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,010
Not exactly.

43
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,440
Marine unit was doing a trawl of the delaware,turned this up.

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,080
Is that an arm?

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Ran the serial number.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,830
Matches the prostheticof a missing iraq war veteran.

47
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,510
Guy couldn't catch a break,huh?

48
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,420
Gal.
Dana taylor.

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,080
Went missing three months afterreturning from the middle east.

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,610
How long could someonewith a missing arm stay lost?

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,870
You ever see the fugitive?

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,750
These things don't come cheap.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,410
It's a custom fit,titanium.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Not somethingyou'd just toss.

55
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,090
Not on purpose.

56
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,540
So where'd the rest of her go?

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,790
Well,if the armwas in the river,odds are the body is,too.

58
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,440
Divers are coming out.

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,270
Not really a "bringyour daughter to work day."

Yup.

65
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,650
Asgot to wonder.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,700
wonder what?

67
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,220
Remember the girl in iraq,had that guy on a leash?

68
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,550
what's your point?

70
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,780
I just don't get these chicks that want to tote guns and take prisoners fora living,no offense.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,670

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,420
Joined the guard to payfor cooking school.

74
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,200
Seven and a half years into an eight-year bid.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,630
Yeah.Probably never thoughtshe'd get called up.

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,630
Lost her right armin a grenade attackon her truck outside fallujah.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,130
Ribbon of valor for heroism-- pulled anothersoldier out of the wreckage.

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,480
When'd she get back?

79
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,730
June 2004.

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,820
Disappeared octoberthe same year.

81
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,780
Last to see wasthe husband,geoff.

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,610
Says she went for a walkthat night,never came back.

83
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,960
Lame story.

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,970
Yeah,so lame it could be true.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,090
Though he and dana were goingthrough a rough patch.

86
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,240
So maybe she took a headerinto the river on her own?

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,730
Or maybe the husband pulled a scott peterson.

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
Valens upstairs?

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,550
Taking lost time.

90
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,920
Didn't say why.

I can't visit my own brotherwithout being abused,hmm

98
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,160

We had to throw it away.

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,700
A lewd act with a minor.

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,430
Da's really gunning for him,and he's got a long listof...

111
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,430
witnesses.

112
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,340
Are you serious?

113
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,910
you're on the list,mikey.
你在名单上

114
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,300
That-that don't make sense.

115
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,370
- No?
- No.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,540
But to put this guy away,they're gonna need all the ammo they can get.

117
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,690
Hey,god bless 'em,but I can't help.

118
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay.

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,920
- I just told 'emI'd check with you.
- Told who?

120
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,500
The peoplewho got it wrong,I guess.

121
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,650
Dana never tookoff that arm.

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,900
She wanted to be as normalas possible.

123
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,700
Like before.

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,730
Before iraq.

125
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,760
She come homedifferent?

126
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,340
If you had your arm blown off,wouldn't you?

127
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,140
Just asking a question.

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
Yes.She was different.

129
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,190
When I got back from vietnam,my wife and I had some troubles.Adjusting.

130
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,140
We were working it out.

131
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,550
Till she walked out the doorthat nightand I became a widower.

132
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,490
She happen to mentionshe was headedtoward the river that night?

133
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,740
She used to go onlong walks alone.

134
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,390
Never said where she went.

135
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,700
Any problemswith friends,neighbors?

136
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,920
No way.

137
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,290
Fishtown'sa military neighborhood.

138
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,210
Dana went over,did her duty.

139
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,540
People respected that.

140
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,250
I hate to ask,butsuicide?

141
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,470
I thoughtwe were finding our way back.

142
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,420
Maybe dana couldn't make it.

143
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,110
Like you said,she came back different.

144
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,870
And it...

145
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,240
threw me.

146
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,720
*I know you think thatI shouldn't still love you*

147
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,780
You know whatI miss the most?

148
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,010
Your leg?

149
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,580
the chow?

150
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,800
The danger.

151
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,210
*Well,I'd still have felt it  where's the sense in that?*

152
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,390
- Hey,linds!
- Mommy!

153
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:54,590
*I promise I'm not tryingto make your life harder*
they couldn'tput your arm back on?

154
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,660
Or return to where we were
no,baby,they couldn'T.

155
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
It's okay.
Give your moma hug.

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,590
*Well,I will go downwith this ship*

157
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,770
We're all goingto get used to it.

158
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,350
Yeah,sure.

159
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,920
I don't like it.
It's weird.

160
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,540
Lindsey!

161
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,800

162
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,520

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,890
I couldn't look at her.

181
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,090
And she knew it.

182
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,690
So,maybe that hurt enough,she put herself in the river.

183
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,140
The person who'd knowbetter than me?

184
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,610
Tommy.

185
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,470
Tommy from the hospital?

186
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,690
Yeah,he wasjust a guywe knew from the neighborhood,

187
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,330
but after whatthey went through,he was her new best friend.

188
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,280
Was he in the rpg attack,too?

189
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,700
He was the one she saved.

190
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,100
If dana had any secrets,it's tommy who'd know 'em.

191
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,140
Yasasme and dana fought in iraq,93 days and nights.

192
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,900
Brings you together,huh?

193
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,080
In a wayyou can't understand.

194
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,250
Her cell phone records showa lot of calls to you,tommy,after you both got back.

195
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,490
Includes the nightshe disappeared.

196
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Uh,it's 'causewe talked every night.

197
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,090
It's not whatyou think.

198
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,420
We talked about the war,rehab.

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,760
Frank.

200
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,610
Who's frank?

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,510
Our friend.

202
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,620
Died in the attack.

203
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,510
That you anddana survived?

204
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,110
What'd youtalk aboutthe nightshe disappeared?

205
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,950
Well,the usual.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,490
Night terrors.
Seeing frank in our dreams.

207
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,270
How the thanksyou get for fightingis people back here lookingat you like you're a freak.

208
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,020
Sounds hardto live with.

209
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,150
No one else gets it,so we'd tell each other.

210
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,190
This is the straw,final straw in the...

211
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,100
I wrote the guard.

212
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,280
Yeah?

213
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,590
Asked them to send meback over.

214
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,690
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

215
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,090
I'm walkinggood as new.

216
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,510
Why not?

217
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,290
- you okay?
- Yeah.

218
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,080
It was just...

219
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,870
oh,dana,they're precious.

220
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,670
It's the best I can doat the moment.

221
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,850
They're sweet.

222
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,110
- Brenda?
- No.

223
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,740
Look at that face.

224
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,500
I see frankevery time I look at her.

225
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,400
Missed you at his memorial.

226
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,140
I heard it was beautiful.

227
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,910
Out on the bridge...

228
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,710
I guess you had somethingbetter to do?

229
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,890
I didn't thinkyou wanted me there.

230
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,870
Oh,you got that right.

231
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,440
So what should ihave done?

232
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,010
Just don't actlike we're friends.

233
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,890
We're not.

234
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,500
And we never will be again.

235
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,550
Brenda,you've had a few...

236
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,550
you blew it off,too,tommy,so you just save it!

237
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,360
It's hard on us,too.

238
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,140
You didn't lose anyone.

239
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,280
We lost frank.

240
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,480
You don't have a babywith no father.

241
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:04,230
I can't standto see you alivewhen he is nothingbut ashesat the bottom of that river.

242
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:13,860
*A simple mistakestarts the hardest time I promiseI'll do anything...*

243
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,780
why was brendalaying this on dana?

244
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,090
Dana was driving the truckwhen...

245
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,630
so she blames herfor her husband dying?

246
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,700
But brenda wasn'tin her right mind.

247
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,290
She was drinking all the time,and half crazyover losing frank.

248
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,870
Crazy enough to kill someone?

249
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,780
what,are you tryingto smoke us out?
A nudge wouldhave worked.

250
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,520
I was tryingto make breakfast.

251
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,320
Oh,maybe I'll takea rain check.

252
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,250
in my family,"cooked" pretty much meantwhatever was spinningunder the heat lampat 7-11,so...

253
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,140
so I guess this is it then.

254
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,890
go ahead,pack your bags and leave.

255
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,200
It's been nice knowing you.

256
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,340
Get the dooron your way out,huh?

257
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,110
Yeah,sure thing.
Adios.

258
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,940
Cut and run.

259
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,680
You wouldn't be the first.

260
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,270
Who left you,lil?

261
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,700
What?

262
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,690
My dad.

263
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,810
I was six.

264
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,840
Yeah.

265
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,750
I always thought he'd come back.

266
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,740
My high school graduation,I'm sitting there,looking for min the bleachers.

267
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,820
Did he show?

268
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,130
What do you think?

269
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,330
Yeah.

271
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,730
Like I said,you wouldn't be the first.

272
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,900
Yeah,well,you know,maybe I'll stay,see if I can't be the last.

273
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,340
We appreciate youtaking the time.

274
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,960
You said it was about dana.

275
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,890
Did you find her?

276
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,620
Her arm.

277
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,220
We're thinking the restof her might be dead.

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,400
you missed the sensitivitytraining,did ya?

279
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,890
Fourth of july,2004,things got ugly between you two.

280
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,150
I was reelingover frank's death.

281
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,570
Not for nothing,I wasa few glasses into the chablis.

282
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,010
That can fuel the fire.

283
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,820
I was grieving,not homicidal.

284
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,130
And I was homewith my six-month-oldthe night she went missing.

285
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,820
Well,a six-month-oldcan't alibi you,bren.

286
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,680
How would killing dana help me?

287
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,520
Wouldn't bring frank back.

288
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,440
Murder ain't logical like that.

289
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,290
Look,I apologized to her.

290
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,510
After the hangover.

291
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,630
Yeah.

292
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,800
Things got back to normalfor us again.

293
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,230
Of course,going"back to normal" not so easy.

294
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,350
No.

295
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,180
Like a lot of guys coming back,it seemed like part of danawas stuck in iraq.

296
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,250
said mr. Dalai lama  another sister'sshooting heroin tomorrow...

297
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,440
how come daddy'snot driving me to gymnastics?

298
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,350
'Cause mommy's home now.

299
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,970
And this was alwaysour thing,right?

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,140
Daddy always lets me situp front.

301
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,720
Why don't youbraid lucy's hair,huh?

302
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,560
So I stopped drinking.

303
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
Yeah?

304
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,330
After the wayI talked to you...

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,680
oh,come on.

306
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,070
It was understandable.

307
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm goingto grief counseling,to talk about frank...

308
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,840
- missing him.
- Sure.

309
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,890
You thought about it?

310
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,590
Counseling?

311
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,850
Me?
For what?

312
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,890
Geoff says you nevereven talkedabout the attack.

313
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,460
No.

314
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,140
I'd like to knowwhat happened.

315
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,590
We were driving.

316
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,090
Like we are now.

317
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,140
Orders are you keep moving;you never stop.

318
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,010
What was frank doing?

319
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,700
He was looking out.

320
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,280
You always have to look out'cause the one thingout of placecan be the thing that...

321
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,820
"the thing that" what?

322
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,100
********* what are you doing *********

323
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,190
Mommy,don't!

324
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,490
********* kill me? *********

325
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,470

326
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,130
********* ******freak.

327
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,420
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,810
I keep *************

329
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,330
it's okay,sweetie.

330
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,120
She's always doing that,making people mad.

331
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,470
From happy homemakerto road rage case.

332
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,570
That's quite a flip.

333
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,270
Combat vet,classic ptsd.

334
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,760
I realized that day thatthe dana I knew was gone.

335
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,150
T1I wonder who elseshe went off on.

336
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,100
Sounds like this daughtercould tell some tales.

337
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,000
Do you know where my mom went?

338
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,940
We're tryingto find T.

339
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,840
That's why we're here.

340
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,450
Do you rememberwhen she came backfrom the war,lindsey?

341
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,290
Yeah,she didn'thave an arm.

342
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,870
We heard she'd getupset sometimes,make people mad.

343
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,630
Yeah.

344
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,880
Do you rememberany of those people?

345
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,940
No.

346
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,210
You won't get in troubleif you tell us.

347
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,500
Maybe one man.

348
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,830
Okay.

349
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,160
At my school assembly.

350
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,390
He sat behind my mom.

351
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,090
In this time of unrest,we honor our own war heroes,

352
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,230
who put themselves in harm's wayto keep you safe.

353
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,990
There are currently...

354
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,870
what's with you?

355
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,580
My petition to go backwas rejected.

356
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,790
I got medically discharged.

357
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,110
It was a long shot.

358
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,260
It was also my last shot.

359
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,290
- At what?
- I just...

360
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,990
got nothing,no one.

361
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,620
Here.

362
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,420
Hold this for me.

363
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,100
And her daughter is inmiss connor's third grade class.

364
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,010
Please welcomelindsey taylor's momcorporal dana taylor.

365
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,290
I was in iraq for three months.

366
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,700
I drove a supply truck.

367
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,980
I was scared going over,but was ready to do my duty.

368
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,320
Then,this happened to me.

369
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,000
Now I...

370
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,850
I have confused feelingsabout the war.

371
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,200
So instead of giving youa speech,maybe I'll justtake some questions.

372
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,650
Did you ever waste anyone?

373
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,630
No.

374
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,390
But I watched my good friendget wasted.

375
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,610
His name was frank.

376
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,290
One second,he was telling a joke,and in the next,his...

377
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,660
his blood and his insideswere all over the truck...

378
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,630
all over me.

379
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,440
It's not like a video gameor a movie.

380
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,790
It breaks your heartright in half.

381
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,500
Our next guest has beenin the navy his entire career.

382
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,230
What kind of soldier are you?

383
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,070
The kind that tells the truth.

384
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,170
I'm going backfor my second tour in a week.

385
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,650
How do you thinkmy kid feels now?

386
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000
Maybe we shouldgo,linds...

387
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,790
You should have stayedin the damn kitchen.

388
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,920
You know that?

389
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,100
You got no businesstrying to do a man's job.

390
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm a soldier,same as you...

391
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,140
His son charlie is inmr. Levin's fifth grade class.

392
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,890
Someone oughtto teach you a lesson.

393
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,800
So please welcomelieutenant jamal ross.

394
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,950
who was this man?

395
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,690
Penny kozlowski's dad.

396
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,570
That helps alot,lindsey.

397
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,100
Maybe my mom went away'cause of me.

398
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
Why would she do that?

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,700
'Cause maybe she found outI thought her arm was scary.

400
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,460
You know what,lindsey?

401
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,810
If you were my girl,I'd be so proud.

402
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,070
You would?

403
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,350
Yeah,becauseyou're brave.

404
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,560
I know your mom could see thatjust like I can.

405
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,200
Thanks a lot,sir.

406
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,160
Sounds like this kozlowskididn't like girlsfighting his war.

407
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,820
What say we find outhow much?

408
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,500
Josh kozlowski?

409
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,030
Who's asking?

410
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,730
Philly homicide.

411
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,020
It's about dana taylor.

412
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,450
Homicide,huh?

413
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,810
Not surprised,the mouth on her.

414
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,400
We heard you werea real fanof her speechat your daughter's assembly.

415
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,680
Gi janes.

416
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,590
Some jobs women just can't do.

417
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,700
Not disagreeing,but why go after dana?

418
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,110
'Cause that bitch traumatizedevery kid in the place.

419
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,850
So maybe you retaliated.

420
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,680
Agg assault does seemto be your specialty.

421
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,860
That taylor broadneeded to be shut up.

422
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,050
And if I was the one who did it,I'd tell you.

423
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,870
All the same,we got to verifyyour whereaboutswhen she disappeared.

424
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,200
I keep great calendars.

425
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,400
You tell me the date,I'll tell you where I was.

426
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,620
Deal.

427
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,920
They sayyou're onlysupposed to cutto the first five-leaf.

428
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,110
Is that right?

429
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,000
My grandma wasa green thumb.

430
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,610
Always said that's how you getdouble the bloom in return.

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,020
That's a good tip.

432
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,350
Got any tips for me?

433
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,220
You know yourhusband's temperall too well,I bet.

434
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,640
Got anything to add?

435
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,520
- I knew that woman. - Dana.

436
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,890
Well,I knew of her.

437
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,760
- Meaning? - I knew her husband.

438
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,700
paula,who's your friend?

439
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,770
This is geoff.

440
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,670
His wife dana's a soldier.

441
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,500
- Hi,jeff.Hi,jeff. - Hi.

442
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,510
Welcome to oursupport group.

443
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,890
Tell 'em about her.

444
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,190
Dana-- well,she's been my girlsince we were 15.

445
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,770
We got a kid.

446
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,400
Thank god 'cause that's allI have to hang onto right now.

447
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,550
I mean,I'm not even allowedto know where dana is.

448
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,280
Just that she'S...

449
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,840
over theresomeplace.

450
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,600
I worry all the time and...

451
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,880
I...I guess,just feel kind of lost.

452
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,030
Why don't we takea coffee break?

453
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,550
*Time and time again I'm half stalled*

454
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,120
helps to talk,right?

455
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,860
- Feel like a fool. - Why?

456
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,720
'Cause I'm a man,paula.

457
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,630
Sitting aroundexpressing feelings...

458
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,200
I know you're a man.

459
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:48,960
*Just give a second thought what if we don't get caught.*

460
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,900
So geoff had a side dish.

461
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,330
A lot of people have jodys.

462
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,240
Jodys?

463
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,500
Someone to keep company withtill your soldier comes home.

464
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,000
Meaning it wasn'tserious between them?

465
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,660
Except paula's husbandkept re-upping,so she was alone a lot.

466
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,720
My opinion,she wanted something realwith geoff.

467
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,190
So his wife coming homewas a problem.

468
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,390
And when paula wants something,she's pretty determined.

469
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,250
Your husband'soverseas,paula?

470
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,600
Ass-deep in the sunni triangle.

471
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,650
Not exactly a garden spot.

472
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Desert air mustappeal to him. He keeps re-enlisting.

473
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,720
lonely nights?

474
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,770
I keep busy.

475
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,490
Like with geoff taylor?

476
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,850
Me and geoffmight've had a thing.

477
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,010
A thing.

478
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,240
Like an affair?

479
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,610
No,we'd get togetherand do crosswords.

480
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,720
And dana,being your friend,didn't count for much.

481
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,110
Wartime. Rules change.

482
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,210
So you and geoff are hitting it,then dana comes home,and he startsflying right.

483
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,620
You're out in the cold.

484
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,130
You know the old sayingabout the woman scorned.

485
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,110
Except I wasn'T.

486
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,170
The affair kept going?

487
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,160
Geoff was patient.

488
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,350
But a month aftershe came home,dana still wouldn'tlet him touch her.

489
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,560
So pretty soon,he's back in your arms.

490
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,540
And then it all blew up.

491
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,850
Button up already. Got to get out of here.

492
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
My house tomorrow?

493
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,920
what are wedoing,paula?

494
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,410
Living.

495
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,800
Yeah.

496
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,260
We could make it permanent.

497
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,420
Sometimes I think...

498
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,930
what,baby?

499
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,380
I get dark thoughts.

500
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,560
About changing my life.

501
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,790
no.

502
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,560
I-I thoughtyou were at rehab.

503
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,630
Lindsey's school called. She has a fever.

504
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,240
Look,dane...

505
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,460
so I've been busting my asstrying to learnhow to brush my teeth again,

506
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,000
and this is what you're doing?

507
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,690
- I'm sorry. - Yeah,me,too.

508
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,560
But,hey,let me make it right.

509
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,180
I'll pack up and get lost. Leave you to it.

510
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,790
- That's not gonna happen.
- And I'll take lindsey with me,

511
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,370
'cause there's no way I'm letting this bitchset an examplefor my little girl.

512
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,230
Dana...

513
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,970
I can't believeyou threw it all away.

514
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,530
You probably thinkI'm some bimbo home-wrecker.

515
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,990
Pretty much.

516
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,700
He was lonely. So was I.

517
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,500
And then danacleared the way for you.

518
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,620
Once she busted us,it was over.

519
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,630
Over for her,too.

520
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,480
She disappeared that night,leaving geofkind of single.

521
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,990
Like I said,that wasthe end of him and me.

522
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,080
But no worries,I've got a new jody now.

523
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,540
Congratulations.

524
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,130
You can go,paula.

525
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,140
Didn't geoff say his little girlwas all he had to hang onto?

526
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,340
Yeah.If dana was gonna leaveand take the kid...

527
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,470
maybe those dark thoughtsgot the best of him.

528
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,370
didn't tell us about your girlfriend,jeff.

529
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,940
excuse me?

530
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,720
***** Paula.

531
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Sounds likeyou found out anyway.

532
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,520
Didn't want to sharethat piece of the puzzle?

533
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,140
Would you?

534
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,040
If a murder copwas asking,yeah,I'd come clean.

535
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,820
Ashamed enough of something,you do a lot to hide it.

536
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,220
Not to mention it gives youmotive for offing your wife.

537
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,390
I didn't kill dana.

538
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,510
I loved her.

539
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,740
You lovedyour daughter,too,and dana wantedto take her away.

540
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,380
Look...

541
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,310
whatever punishment I had comingmy way,I was gonna take it.

542
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,540
But something good actuallycame out of all that crap.

543
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,380
Oh,yeah? What?

544
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,620
We finally talked about it.

545
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,590
About...?

546
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,380
What happened over there.

547
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,550
How's she doing?

548
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,940
Fever's down.

549
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,330
Helps her sleep.

550
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,240
She always loved this.

551
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,970
Still does.

552
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,310
You're going,huh?

553
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,290
What happened,dane?

554
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,570
I don't know.

555
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,780
It's like I lost you over there.

556
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,050
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,560
Look,I'll goif that'swhat you want.

558
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,910
But first...

559
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,920
tell me...

560
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,060
what happenedover there,when you got hurt.

561
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,690
- You don't want to know.
- Yeah,I do.

562
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,510
You'll hate me.

563
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,290
I could never hate you.

564
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,170
that ribbon of valor--I don't deserve it.

565
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,390
Why not?

566
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,450
What happened to frankwas my fault.

567
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,710
how's that possible?

568
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,440
We'd just madea delivery.

569
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,710
We weredriving back...

570
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,780
frank was tellinga stupid joke,and then suddenly,there was something in the road.

571
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,590
- Someone. - Who?

572
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,830
a little girl.

573
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,520
And they tell you,you see anyone in the road,you...

574
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,890
you just run 'em down.

575
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,710
Even a kid?

576
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,520
They use kidsto get the convoys to stop.

577
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,380
but I didn't see a trap;I saw a little girl,who could'vebeen lindsey.

578
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,530
So I slowed down,and that's when we got hit.

579
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,610
Dane. Dane.

580
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,380
Typical girl soldier,right?

581
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,980
That wasn't a girl thing.

582
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,200
It-it was a human thing.

583
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,660
I would've done the same.

584
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,030
Baby,an rpgkilled frank,not you.

585
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,300
I don't want that ribbon.

586
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,870
It's keeping me in a placeI don't wanna be.

587
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,940
- So get rid of it. - And frank.

588
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,830
We gotta say good-bye to him.

589
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,820
Okay.

590
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,070
Can you stay with lindsfor a couple hours?

591
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,730
Sure. Of course.

592
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,580
I'll be right here.

593
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,690
Yeah. Good.

594
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,200
Dane?

595
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,260
You're my girl.

596
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,450
I was praying she'd come homeand want to start over.

597
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,830
But she nevermade it back.

598
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,260
You didn't go with her?

599
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,180
No.

600
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,870
So what did she mean by "we"?

601
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,200
I don't know.

602
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,510
I always assumedshe went on her walks alone.

603
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,260
tommy.

604
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,050
He didn't go tofrank's memorial either.

605
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,830
And he hadthe ribbon of valor.

606
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,530
So where would they goto say good-bye?

607
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,150
Ashes were in the river,right?

608
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,480
We know why dana wentout that night,tommy.

609
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,580
Oh,yeah?

610
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,360
To ditch that ribbon of valor.

611
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,690
Put the war behind her.

612
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,130
Any thoughts how shemight've done that?

613
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,310
Not really.

614
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,190
Want my guess?

615
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,620
She threw itin the river.

616
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,590
Where danaended up,too. Probably.

617
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,060
Why are you telling me?

618
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,700
'Cause she called youthat night.

619
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,950
Asked you to meet her.

620
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,800
Bring the ribbon.

621
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,150
She knew you both neededto lay frank to rest.

622
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,920
So what if that's true?

623
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,130
Seems like somethingyou'd mention,unless something wentreal wrong that night.

624
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,100
What I don't get?

625
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,600
Dana saved you.

626
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,640
Pulled you from that truck.

627
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,600
Why would youwant to hurt her?

628
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,530
I wouldn'T.

629
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,240
That is the last thing I'd want.

630
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,120
Well,I believe you,tommy,'cause I think you wanted moreof her than you could have.

631
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,990
What do you mean?

632
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,990
Iraq. Rehab.

633
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,570
All those late-night callswhen you got home.

634
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,600
Brings you together in a wayother people can't understand.

635
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,420
Hard not to get attachedto someone after all that.

636
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,190
But she was married.

637
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,040
Geoff was messing around on her.

638
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,110
She told me that night.

639
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,440
And you saw your opening.

640
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,270
seemed likeshe felt the same.

641
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,280
When we'd talk,you know?

642
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,670
I got her...

643
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,920
and she got me.

644
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,330
And no one else did.

645
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,230
I thought it was gonna bethe start of a new life.

646
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,630
Instead it was the end.

647
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,610
what are you doing?****** of danger again?

648
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,770
river looks beautiful from up here.

649
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah.

650
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,260
did you bring it?

651
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,930
what are you going to do with it?

652
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,170
Move on.

653
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,440
This is about what was.

654
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,280
Memories,right?

655
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,710
I guess.

656
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
It's time to leave 'em behind.

657
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,880
Rest in peace,frankie.

658
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,110
New chapter,huh?

659
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,680
Right.

660
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,190
So how about you and me?

661
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,020
You and me?

662
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,420
There's a reasonwe talk every night,dane.

663
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,900
Why we never wanna hang up.

664
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,920
Tommy...

665
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,830
we went through a lot.

666
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,730
And now it's part of our lives.

667
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,690
- I have a family. I can'T...
- he cheated on you.

668
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,030
I know.

669
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,590
And maybe we'll neverrecover from that,but we're gonna try.

670
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,680
When I'm standing right here?

671
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,440
Tommy,we almostdied together.

672
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,390
Of course thatbrought us close.

673
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,730
I got nothin' else,dane.

674
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,010
You got me.

675
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,870
- As your friend. - No.That's not enough.

676
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,130
We're vets. That's special.

677
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,130
Oh,bull. That's nothing.

678
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,890
I can'T... hold on to that.

679
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,920
We're findingour way back,tommy.

680
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,310
And we're gonna make it.

681
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
You will.

682
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,570
Not me.

683
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,940
Not me!

684
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,860
No...!

685
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,130
Dana! No!

686
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,780
Dana,no!

687
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,560
Dana!
