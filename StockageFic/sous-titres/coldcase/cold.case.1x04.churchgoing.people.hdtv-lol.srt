00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:09,871
February 3, 1990

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,372
Bless, us, oh, Load, for these thy 
gifts which we are about receive

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:17,252
through thy bounty, through 
Chirst our Load, Amen.

6
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:18,948
Amen.

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,381
Did you buy film, Mitchell?

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,381
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:30,344
We'll want lots of pictures of 
Ryan tonight. / Okay, Mom.

10
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,295
Did you see your brother in his suit?

11
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,663
Yeah, he looks so 
handsome. / Shut up.

12
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,661
Are you taking me to Cindy's?

13
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:41,291
I assume you're taking Ryan?

14
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:46,830
And no one misses 
Church in the morning.

15
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:52,651
# Well I guess it would be nice #

16
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,122
# If I could touch your body #

17
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,474
# I know not everybody #

18
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,148
# Has got a body like you #

19
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,563
# But I've got to think twice #

20
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,115
# Before I give my heart away #

21
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,473
# And I know all the games you play #

22
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:09,798
# Because I play them too #

23
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:15,980
# Oh but I need some time 
off from that emotion #

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,082
# Time to pick my heart up off the floor #

25
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:23,571
# And when that love comes down #

26
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:25,899
# Without devotion #

27
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,093
# Well it takes a strong man baby  #

28
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,854
Mitchell.

29
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,595
Mitchell.

30
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,043
Mitchell? Mitchell?

31
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:54,686
Mitchell?

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,553
Mitchell? Mitchell?

33
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:07,925
Mitchell?

34
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,038
She ask for Homicide?

35
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,777
She can't ask for nothing.
She's loony tunes.

36
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:16,689
Carrying around an orbit of 
a guy that died in 1990.

37
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,280
Covering my ass....
I called you.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,461
Why's she locked up?

39
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,838
She kept wandering away.

40
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,873
Come on, Silvan, 
get her out of there.

41
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,522
Son's on the way.

42
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:31,202
She had his number in her pocket.

43
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,426
Hi, Ma'am.

44
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:41,135
So many cuts.

45
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,471
So many cuts.

46
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:47,574
So....so many cuts.

47
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,207
You want to come out?

48
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:52,627
Poor... Poor Mitch....

49
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:56,467
- Poor Mitch.... Mitch...
- Who's Mitch?

50
00:02:57,127 --> 00:03:01,307
Couldn't have a church funeral...
not with all those cuts.

51
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,897
- Nuttier than a fruitcake.
- Mitch was a good man.

52
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:05,786
Was Mitch your husband?

53
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,900
"Mitchell Bayes served as 
organist and musical director

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,088
of St. Anthony's Episcopal 
church in Roxborough..."

55
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,562
Here's the son.

56
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,485
Mom, you can't do this.
You can't leave the house.

57
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:20,247
I don't think anyone's 
pressing charges,

58
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,786
but she disturbed the peace
over at Holy Field Cemetery.

59
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,412
I'm sorry, I'll keep a better eye out.

60
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:26,938
Come on.

61
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,460
That where your dad was buried?

62
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,063
Yeah.

63
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:33,174
It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,564
She was talking about him.

65
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,130
He was murdered?

66
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,114
13 years ago.

67
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,401
She's been going back there a lot lately.

68
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:51,469
Doctor says it's something about 
older memories becoming more present.

69
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,818
It's Alzheimer's?

70
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,992
Might wanna get her 
one of those bracelets.

71
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,469
I ordered one.

72
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,683
She was carrying these.

73
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:03,442
We ever get the guy?

74
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,463
No.

75
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,920
Come on, Mom.

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,425
Come on. Let's go.

77
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:15,850
It's okay. It's okay.

87
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:54,064
What's an '82 job doing next to a '96?

88
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:57,006
Civillian workers going the extra mile.

89
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,363
So how'd this guy die?

90
00:04:58,363 --> 00:05:00,547
Stabbed by a hooker was the theory.

91
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,149
Here it is. Bayes, '90.

92
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,226
Why are we looking at this?

93
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,346
The lady was so distressed.

94
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,852
I just wondered why 
we didn't bring the job in.

95
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,708
Mitch Bayes, 49.

96
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,179
Stabbed 14 times.

97
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,040
Wallet was gone.

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,084
Presumed robbery-homicide.

99
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,161
Never found a weapon?

100
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,926
No, they never even 
named a good suspect.

101
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,698
Bump in the night.

102
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:30,264
Let's take this upstairs.

103
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,542
So is this a regular thing 
now? Working cold jobs?

104
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,435
I am. You can stay 
on the line if you want.

105
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:40,808
I guess cold cases aren't less 
important than new ones.

106
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,096
They're more important.

107
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,101
They're been waiting longer.

108
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,825
Any limits on how far back we can look?

109
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,562
No limits.

110
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,826
There's some problems 
with this job, boss.

111
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:54,062
Unsolved is always a problem, Lil.

112
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,891
The ME reports and the 
body chart don't match.

113
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:59,588
Plus the inventory of 
the clothes in the van.

114
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:03,201
Pants, underwear, shirt, 
shoes... but no socks.

115
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:03,710
Uh-huh.

116
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,423
That was February.

117
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,973
You don't go anywhere 
in February without socks.

118
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:08,872
Maybe they were inventoried wrong?

119
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:10,620
Whatever happened, 
this case was a rush job.

120
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,146
The assigned chalked it up 
to a solicitation gone bad.

121
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,802
Pretty much left it at that.

122
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,672
This is a nice lady, boss.

123
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:20,836
And her memory's going fast. If 
we're ever going to look at this again...

124
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,344
We should do it now.

125
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,942
- Who's the assigned?
- Gil Sherman.

126
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,657
This was a typical job 
during the crack era.

127
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,229
Guy comes 'round looking 
for some company,

128
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,259
ends up robbed and killed by the girl.

129
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,927
Why'd you think it was a hooker?

130
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,699
Ever been to Kensington 
Avenue, darling?

131
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,088
That's hookerland.

132
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,987
Yeah, I grew up in Kensington.

133
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:42,683
So what was he doing there, 
seeing the sights?

134
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,468
You don't have this back wound 
marked on your bodychart.

135
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,435
So I missed it.

136
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:52,973
You ever miss a wound?

137
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,309
No.

138
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:56,425
What did forensics show you?

139
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,296
Forensics were screwed. Rained 
like a son of a bitch that night.

140
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:00,984
Whole scene got soaked.

141
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:01,703
He was in the back of a van.

142
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:03,802
They should have had some 
evidence to work with.

143
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:06,373
Partial prints on vials.
Inconclusive.

144
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,163
So there were no suspects at all?

145
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:09,499
Plenty of suspects.

146
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,279
Whores, dealers, homeless.

147
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,799
Nothing stuck.

148
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,493
So that was it. End of case?

149
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:20,388
Look, Rush... these murders 
were a dime a dozen that year.

150
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:23,662
crackheads thought nothing
of icing a guy for 12 bucks.

151
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:26,746
Next night the same job all over again.

152
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,302
You remember.

153
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,336
Yeah.

154
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,527
I felt for this family though.

155
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,604
They were decent people.

156
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,555
I had to tell 'em on a Sunday morning....

157
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,151
We found him in his vehicle

158
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,783
just off of Kensington Avenue.

159
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:54,788
I don't understand why he'd be there.

160
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,196
There's a lot of activity in that area.

161
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,503
What kind of activity?

162
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:04,961
Drugs, prostitution.
Like that.

163
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,563
Mitch wouldn't be 
there. / I'm sorry.

164
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:10,167
No, Mitch didn't use 
drugs, or prostitues.

165
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,152
We are churchgoing people.

166
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,316
I understand.

167
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:21,630
He didn't use.... prostitutes.

168
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:25,070
Bayes was a hypocrite church type.

169
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,837
Whoring Saturday night,
asking forgiveness on Sunday.

170
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,550
Son's meeting us here?

171
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:40,165
Maybe he's already here.

172
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:44,614
Yeah, I'm not sure 
where they went exactly.

173
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,822
No, I...

174
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,779
I'm not sure.

175
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,184
I..Yes.

176
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,445
Okay.

177
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,724
I'll... I'll tell them.

178
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,954
When they.

179
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,738
Okay, I'll make sure 
I tell them. / Hello.

180
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,105
They're home now...

181
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,663
Hi, Charlotte.

182
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:16,682
T-Tina.

183
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,729
No, no, Lily.

184
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:22,475
Remeber we talked about Mitch?

185
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:28,141
"Mitchell Bayes served as 
organist and musical director

186
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,898
at St. Anthony's Episcopal 
church in Roxborough..."

187
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,674
Oh. You're here.

188
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,159
Did Mom let you in?

189
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,365
The door was open, Ryan.

190
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:37,850
Was she trying to leave?

191
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,424
No, she was just talking to herself.

192
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,217
She has good days and bad days.

193
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:45,582
Can't have a church funeral 
for Mitch... / Okay.

194
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:47,968
Just can't.

195
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,572
Why is she talking about Dad?

196
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:51,954
I brought him up.

197
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:54,370
We're looking at his case again, Ryan.

198
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,141
I'll do what I can to help.

199
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:59,404
I was only 16, you know.

200
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:01,100
Do you know if your dad 
had any enemies?

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,368
Maybe someone 
from work, or church?

202
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,893
No, he worked at Drexel Insurance.

203
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:07,028
I think it was pretty mundane.

204
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,283
At church all he had was friends.

205
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:13,321
Were you surprised to hear he 
was found on Kensington Avenue?

206
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,182
We were all shocked by that.

207
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,145
Including your Mom?

208
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,176
I think it was the humiliation of her life.

209
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:23,611
Could we try to talk to 
her about that night?

210
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:24,868
Yeah.

211
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,034
It'll be tricky. She kind 
of goes in and out.

212
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,226
Mom. Mom.

213
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,912
We're gonna talk about dad, okay?

214
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:36,157
About the night he died.

215
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,378
Okay...Mitch...

216
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,620
He died, Mitch died...

217
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,671
Remember we had dinner as a family?

218
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,825
And I was going to a school formal,

219
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:49,541
and I was worried 
because I couldn't dance.

220
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,696
I'll teach you.

221
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,339
You remember that?

222
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,633
Anyone can dance...

223
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:01,968
Cheers.

224
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,785
Okay, now let me show 
you how it's dance.

225
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:08,504
Come on. Come on.

226
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,443
Aw, loosen up, sweetie..

227
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,959
I can't. I don't move right.

228
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,583
Sure, you do.
Come on.

229
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,100
Come on. Here.

230
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,894
My best gal.

231
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:30,477
Thanks.

232
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,173
Go easy on him, Charlotte.
He's got a real date tonight.

233
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,732
Started out as a nice night.

234
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:54,323
Who was the phone call from?

235
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,750
I don't remember a phone call.

236
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:58,884
Your mom does.

237
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,111
Huh?

238
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,823
Maybe she's adding 
that detail in her mind.

239
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,689
Embellishing, you know?

240
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:09,599
To be honest, I'm still learning
about what's happening to her.

241
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,951
Ryan, could we get 
your sister's address?

242
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,020
Yeah.

243
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,691
Diabetes don't scare you enough,

244
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,411
you got to add somking 
to your health problem?

245
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,343
Thanks, Lil.

246
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:23,291
You know what? I don't 
hear that enough at home.

247
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:33,924
I got that.

248
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,056
You're Tina, right?

249
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,143
Who are you?

250
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,989
Detective Rush and Lassing, Homicide.

251
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,449
We wanna talk about your dad.

252
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:42,537
No, thanks.

253
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:45,023
We know he dropped you
at a friend's house that night.

254
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:47,712
I'm not talking to any 
cops. / How come?

255
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,253
You guys dicided a long 
time ago how my dad died.

256
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:53,711
Why you got to bring it up again?

257
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,617
We just want to hear 
about that night.

258
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:57,421
What your dad said to you?

259
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,399
You mean, like, did he say,

260
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,880
"Bye, darling, I'm going 
to see my hooker"?

261
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,376
You think that's where he went?

262
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,011
I never thought that.

263
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,475
Tina, we're looking for answers here.
You can't give us five minutes?

264
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:07,706
Your mom and brother helped us.

265
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,317
They'd like you to do the same.

266
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,020
I haven't talked to my mom 
or brother in eight years.

267
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,613
So I could really care 
less what they'd like.

268
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:24,491
He was parked here.

269
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:27,357
Found at 5:00 A.M. by a homeless 
guy looking for someplace to sleep.

270
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,340
So you're calling this a crime scene?

271
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,273
This is where it happened.

272
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,623
Rush, that was 13 years ago.

273
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,572
We ain't got much to work 
with, Lil. / It's what we got.

274
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,326
You're standing next to the 
best scene man I know,

275
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,550
but I don't think there's 
blood in that stone.

276
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,653
Take a picture.

277
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:46,724
Gotta go find the girls that Sherman 
talked about Mitch Bayes.

278
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,863
Hey, girls.

279
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,620
You know this guy?

280
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:03,718
Naw.

281
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:05,836
Uh-uh.

282
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,144
Sure, you don't.

283
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,860
probably playing hopscotch in 1990.

284
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,297
Any girls out here with some age on 'em?

285
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,069
Delores, Rhona, Rhono, Mary?

286
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,042
Delores....

287
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,162
She's, like, 33.

288
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:20,154
That is old.

289
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,936
You know where we can find her?

290
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,260
Works the alley.

291
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,359
She only do oral now. 
'Cause of HIV.

292
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,846
Thanks.

293
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:30,827
She's got HIV or she 
doesn't want to get it?

294
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,824
I don't need to know.

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,938
Delores?

296
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:35,505
Delores?

297
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah,Yeah. That's me.

298
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,863
Remember this guy, Delores?

299
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:41,367
Mitch Bayes?

300
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,905
Yeah. Yeah, that guy died down 
there behind the Dumpster.

301
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,537
Is he a trick of yours?

302
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,408
No, I've never seen him 
before. Nobody had.

303
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,329
Know where I can find 
a Rhona or Mary?

304
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:56,738
Rhona moved back to Delaware,
to her Mom's where her kids are at.

305
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,309
Mary got the AIDS.

306
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,903
She died, like, a year ago.

307
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,103
Yeah.

308
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,577
That looks kind of funny, you know?

309
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:05,912
Funny how?

310
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:09,740
I never seen a guy take all 
his clothes off for a girl

311
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,471
and leave 'em in the 
corner all tidy like that?

312
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,366
Right.

313
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,764
Thanks, Delores. 
Take care of yourself.

314
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,087
She's right.

315
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,168
The scene's off.

316
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:24,563
There are a lot of props:
the crack vials, the magazines.

317
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,091
It's all wrong.

318
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,284
Mitch Bayes didn't hang out here.

319
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,179
We gotta redeem this guy.

320
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,672
Henry Walsh, his name's on 
one of these porn rags

321
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:35,015
that was found in the van.

322
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,716
He's not in your file.
Do you know who he is?

323
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,478
Great, Sherman. Got to run.

324
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,433
A simple yes or no 
don't work for Sherman.

325
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,306
I take it he didn't auto-track Walsh.

326
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,571
Probably too busy will 
all the crack going on.

327
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:53,014
- You guys again?
- You were right, Tina.

328
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:53,848
About what?

329
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:56,462
Your dad didn't go with 
a hooker that night.

330
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,298
How do you know?

331
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,515
We think someone drove him 
to that ally after they killed him.

332
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:05,209
- That cop told us...
- That cop was wrong.

333
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,531
I knew it.

334
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,973
I knew my dad was too good for that.

335
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,971
You were close, huh?

336
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:12,881
Yeah.

337
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,748
We're looking for the truth here, Tina.

338
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:17,274
Can you help us and talk to us?

339
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:19,702
About what?

340
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:20,969
Start with the night he died.

341
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:22,716
Was there a phone call?

342
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:25,737
Nice families don't talk 
about these things.

343
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,220
Tina, what things?

344
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,636
What was the phone call?

345
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:31,581
It was for him.

346
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,105
Do you know who it was?

347
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,096
I had an idea.

348
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,229
I know where you're going now.

349
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,988
I'm going home.

350
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,752
No, you're not.

351
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:43,580
What are you talking about?

352
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,091
Don't go.
Call her and say no.

353
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,567
T-Tina!

354
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:54,014
Go on in the house. I can 
see Cindy's waiting for you.

355
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,714
You're always talking about 
what's a sin and all that.

356
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,698
This is a sin, dad,

357
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:03,057
what you're doing with Judy.

358
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,372
You get out of this car.

359
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,479
That was our last conversation.

360
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:25,923
Who was Judy?

361
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,376
I don't know.

362
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:30,171
I just heard him talking 
on the phone to her.

363
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,591
After he died, I thought

364
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:36,193
maybe it was a prostitute that....

365
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,409
Do you think your mom 
knew about Judy?

366
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,265
I wouldn't know that.

367
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:45,017
Maybe you should go 
with us to see your mom.

368
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:46,597
Ask her about this woman?

369
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,563
Why don't you ask her?

370
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:52,496
Your probably would have a better chance
of getting through with her condition.

371
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,735
What condition?

372
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,653
Your brother says it's Alzheimer's.

373
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:13,529
You're probably going to have 
to help the conversation along.

374
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,032
Don't worry.

375
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,144
The door's open again.

376
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,685
Mom?

377
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:41,420
Oh, God...Mom.

378
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,661
It's Tina.

379
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,786
Ba-ba.

380
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,262
Mom?

381
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,819
We'll give you a minute, Tina.

382
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:23,756
All these locks...

383
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,712
what's that about?

384
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:48,714
I wish you would comb your hair.

385
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,000
She knows me now.

386
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,024
Can we talk to her?

387
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,476
Mom, we want to talk about Judy.

388
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:02,831
Judy...

389
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,420
Yeah.

390
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,959
Judy and Dad.

391
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,654
Judy...

392
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,744
I never,

393
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,207
never cared for Judy.

394
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,265
I never cared for Judy.

395
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,108
Judy.

396
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:24,947
Who was she, Charlotte?

397
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:26,789
How did you know her?

398
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,306
Judy Enright.

399
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,941
I never cared for Judy Enright.

400
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:03,386
Charlotte, it's okay.

401
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:04,225
It's okay.

402
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,438
What's going on here?

403
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,006
Never cared for Judy...

404
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,835
What are you doing here?

405
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,742
I just... I thought I'd come...

406
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:15,905
What?

407
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:18,911
I don't know.

408
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,886
We asked her to come.

409
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:22,544
Well, I'm asking you to leave.

410
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:24,889
They believed me about dad, Ryan.

411
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,789
Good for you.

412
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,623
Congratulations.

413
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:31,797
I really do want to help you,
but I'm not coming back here.

414
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:34,762
She always, always has the solos.

415
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,108
She always...

416
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,828
She always has the solos.

417
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,045
You shouldn't have come here.

418
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,532
- Strangers upset her.
- We thought with Tina....

419
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:45,264
- You thought wrong.
- The most talented singer...

420
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,296
She was talking to us about Judy.

421
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:49,647
That name mean anything to you?

422
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,882
No. Look, you should know my 
sister has emotional problems.

423
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,504
She's been hospitalized a few times

424
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:58,427
and sometimes she says things
that aren't necessarily true.

425
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:02,764
You should know your front 
door was open again, Ryan.

426
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,192
Tina says your dad was 
close to this woman.

427
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,371
And I told you that she 
has mental problems.

428
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,810
Excuse me.

429
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,607
Come in.

430
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,035
Something going on 
with this family, boss.

431
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,225
The brother and sister
hate each other.

432
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:30,073
She says they've been oil and 
water ever since dad died..

433
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,771
He says it's because she's crazy.

434
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:33,933
Plus that door upstairs.

435
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:37,553
Do you, uh, trust this Tina?

436
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,614
She seems more sad than crazy.

437
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:41,363
She was hospitalized 
twice for depression,

438
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,383
but that doesn't make her a liar.

439
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,454
So, follow her leads, 
see where it takes you.

440
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,192
Where do you find Judy Enlight?

441
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:50,793
She works at St. Anthony's 
Church in Roxborough.

442
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,679
You better wash up.

443
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,281
Poor Mitch.

444
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,549
It was such a disgrace....

445
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,316
how he ended up.

446
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,831
The flesh is weak.

447
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,994
Yes, it is.

448
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:08,201
How well did you know Mitch?

449
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,440
Well, the congregation 
here is very tightknit.

450
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,854
Plus, him on the organ 
and you singing solos...

451
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,476
Did you see Mitch the night he died?

452
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:20,594
Unless we had a rehearsal, 
I don't see how...

453
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:22,277
Judy, I have phone records 
that show me two calls

454
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,782
were made from your home
to the Bayes' home that night.

455
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:30,555
Well, I suppose you already know, then.

456
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,538
I was weak, too.

457
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,617
So did you meet Mitch 
the night he died?

458
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,940
Just for a few minutes.

459
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:56,097
Hi, why don't you park?

460
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,038
I can't do it anymore.

461
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,044
What?

462
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,725
Tina knows.

463
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:11,150
I can't my daughter 
being ashamed of me.

464
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,581
Mitch, come on, honey.

465
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:16,891
We'll talk about it.

466
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:19,593
I gotta stop.

467
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:24,012
She's my daughter.

468
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:31,353
And that's the last
I saw of Mitch Bayes.

469
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:34,352
Are you sure you didn't 
follow him, Judy,

470
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:36,610
in your anger at him,
for breaking it off like that?

471
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,618
No.

472
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:40,064
But you called Mitch again later.

473
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:43,085
There were two calls from 
your house that night, Judy.

474
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,630
I didn't call again.

475
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,671
Could your husband have called him?

476
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,049
He'd have no rason, too.

477
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:50,717
Unless he suspected you two.

478
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:56,643
So did Lassing embarrass you in church?

479
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,328
No, he behaved. And we 
met Mitch's girlfriend.

480
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,519
Oh, yeah?
She's a suspect?

481
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,128
Her alibi's good, but there 
was a jealous husband.

482
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,638
Vera and Jeffries are 
checking him out.

483
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:07,364
Mitch's clothes from 
the van... no socks.

484
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:08,973
Is this criminalist screwing up,

485
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,909
or were they never 
there in the first place?

486
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,275
You might want to ask 
your pal Sherman over there.

487
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:19,092
People steal stuff off the 
dead bodies all the time.

488
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,890
People steal Timberlands, 
leather jackets.

489
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,503
They don't steal a guy's 
socks and nothing else.

490
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:25,329
Fine. You know best, apparently.

491
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,917
Sherman, it's a simple question.
Were the socks at the scene or not?

492
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,330
No.

493
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:33,442
Are you sure?

494
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,450
I'm pretty sure.

495
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,740
You're known as a 
good detective, Sherman.

496
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:46,481
They say you're the best in Fugitives.

497
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,547
Is that what they say?

498
00:25:49,524 --> 00:25:54,425
So what was going on in 1999 that 
you were doing work like a bum?

499
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:03,223
Nothing that ain't fixed now.

500
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:14,546
1988 to mid '94....

501
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,813
I was a drunk.

502
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:20,522
I mean bombed full-time.

503
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:26,142
So probably I did some damage,

504
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,415
being sloppy.

505
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:32,072
Just.... wasn't in my head.

506
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:33,830
Uh-huh.

507
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:39,544
You know that, uh, name you 
wanted followed up, Henry Walsh?

508
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,695
The guy whose porn rags 
were found in the van?

509
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:42,735
Did you auto-track him yet?

510
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:43,974
Uh, not yet.

511
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:46,115
Good. 'Cause I did.

512
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,230
Figured I'd save you some time.

513
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,061
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:53,151
Let's see, he had a carpet 
business in Germantown.

515
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:56,004
He died three years ago,

516
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:59,727
but I got an address 
on the son, Tom Walsh,

517
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:01,348
if that'll help.

518
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:03,315
It would.

519
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,601
I don't know who my dad knew or didn't.

520
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,115
Pretty strange how his porn rags

521
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:19,208
ended up in a van with a dead man.

522
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,188
What am I supposed to do about that?

523
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:24,180
How about giving it more 
than 30 seconds of thought?

524
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:28,683
Bayes... I knew a Ryan 
Bayes in high school.

525
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:31,088
There you go, Tom.
Were you good friends?

526
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:31,806
I guess.

527
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:34,202
We played a lot of Dungeons 
and Dragons together.

528
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,655
Just nerds, you know.

529
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,316
Nerds who looked 
at dad's porn together?

530
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,923
I probably took some 
magazines there sometimes.

531
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:50,987
You guys ever take 
it to another level,

532
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:54,611
like, uh, going to hookers?

533
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,095
Do we really got to go into this?

534
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,824
I've heard so much worse, Tom.

535
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,026
I guess we cruised for 
prostitute once in a while,

536
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:10,418
just look at them. We'd be terrified 
if they actually talked to us.

537
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:13,301
Where'd you do that cruising?

538
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,481
Kensington Avenue.

539
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:20,461
You see, Tom, 
that's helpful to me.

540
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:24,594
Embarrasing to you, 
but helpful to me.

541
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,297
Ring, ring.

542
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:33,334
I'll get it, Mom. / Ringing.

543
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,320
- Now is not a good time.
- We had to talk, Ryan.

544
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,704
Not now. / It's very important.

545
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:40,989
Mom, go back to the living room.

546
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:41,956
Someone's here.

547
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:43,054
- Someone's here.
- Did you hear me?

548
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,439
- Go back to the living room.
- Tea, tea, tea.

549
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,828
Ryan, hey, let's you 
and me sit down.

550
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:50,870
Come on. You need a minute of 
peace. Las will sit with your mom.

551
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,861
Come on, take a break.

552
00:28:57,927 --> 00:29:00,419
Isn't there someone 
that can help you out?

553
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,098
A girlfriend?

554
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,983
I don't have time for that.

555
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,487
We guess your mom's kind 
of your girlfriend, huh?

556
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,642
She takes a lot of my time, 
if that's what you mean.

557
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,037
Yeah.

558
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,919
I take care of my mom, too.

559
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:27,279
She sick in a different 
kind of way, but, uh,

560
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,128
it makes me half crazy sometimes.

561
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,120
Yeah.

562
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:34,497
Doesn't feel natural.

563
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,275
It's role reversal.

564
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,727
Yeah, I mean, Mom's 
supposed to take care of you.

565
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,549
That's what you're 
used to. / Yeah.

566
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:46,417
Did she take good care of you?

567
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,933
Yeah, sure.

568
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:50,370
She let you meet girls?

569
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,669
Or did she keep you in

570
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:56,586
so you had to look elsewhere 
for those interests?

571
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,722
I'm not sure I know 
what you're talking about.

572
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:07,438
I guess I mean these.

573
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,155
Those aren't mine.

574
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,682
Technically they belong 
to your friend Tom Walsh.

575
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,234
Do you remember him?

576
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:13,925
Uh-uh.

577
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:17,359
No? He's the guy you used to 
cruise Kensington Avenue with.

578
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,960
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

579
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,494
Thing is, I need explanations 
for all these lies.

580
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:23,025
Because it looks bad that you lied

581
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:25,255
about the phone call from 
Judy Enright that night.

582
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:27,161
And that you lied to me just now

583
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,387
about these periodicals here, 
Ryan. / I want you to leave.

584
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:31,077
And it really looks bad that you were

585
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:33,793
so familiar with the strip 
where your dad was dumped.

586
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,922
I got questions that need 
answers here, Ryan.

587
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,997
And without good answers,
you're my number-one suspect.

588
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:41,923
My mom and I are not 
talking to you anymore.

589
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,126
You speak for your mom?

590
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,928
Yeah, I do. 
And you know what?

591
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,584
We want you to drop my dad's case.

592
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:52,568
When I'm so close to 
the truth? Not a chance.

593
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,648
Well, that was one hot trail 
you set us down, Rush.

594
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,051
You met Enright?

595
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:59,809
You call that guy a suspect?
He's a 90-pound invalid.

596
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,618
He's been in a wheelchair 
since the Great Flood.

597
00:31:02,618 --> 00:31:05,409
No chance he stabbed 
anybody in the last century.

598
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,233
Okay, but was he our 
second called that night?

599
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,941
Called Mitch to give him 
a piece of his mind

600
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:12,449
Talked to the boy instead. / Ryan.

601
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:15,793
Yeah, I mean, he probably 
traumatized that kid.

602
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,077
Must have told him 40 times

603
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,372
what a cheating sinner 
his old man was.

604
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,907
Gives Mama's boy his motive.

605
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,015
Tina...

606
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,776
thanks for coming.

607
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,555
Did you find out anything?

608
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,859
Yeah.

609
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:38,201
Listen, Tina....

610
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:41,394
We think we can put Ryan
at the murder scene.

611
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:45,992
Ryan?

612
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,370
Yeah.

613
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:56,938
This is how you help me...

614
00:31:56,938 --> 00:32:01,472
"Your dad wasn't scumbag after all,
but your brother's a murderer?"

615
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,569
I'm sorry.

616
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,839
We used to be really close,

617
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,731
me and my brother.

618
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:16,964
Do you think you could 
help us one more time?

619
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,408
Can you do it for your dad?

620
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,306
A...a dance.

621
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:30,130
We really have to go 
to church tomorrow.

622
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,631
There was a...sleep...
sleep... sleepover....

623
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:37,540
and a dance,

624
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,285
and that.... that's where 
the kid's were going...

625
00:32:40,285 --> 00:32:41,315
Kids were going...

626
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,306
sleepover...

627
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:44,939
That-that was a big... dance...

628
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:48,716
I know that part, Charolette.
I'm talking about later.

629
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:54,567
I-I-I... I danced, 
I danced with Ryan.

630
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,256
After the dancing, much later.

631
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:58,789
Did Ryan fight with Mitch?

632
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,347
Poor Mitch.

633
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,121
Poor, poor, poor, poor Mitch.

634
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:09,327
After the dancing, did Ryan 
do something to him?

635
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:10,311
Mitch...Mitch..

636
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:12,870
- Charolette.
- Mitch, Mitch base...

637
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,301
Mitch took-took you...

638
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:15,169
Mitch took you..

639
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:16,162
Mitch took you..to..

640
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:19,148
you s... your sleepover... Mitch...

641
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:21,452
He took me to the sleepover?

642
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:25,025
Mitch took you, 
Mitch took you...

643
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:35,227
Tin-Tina?

644
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,435
Tina... / It's okay to tell me, Mom.

645
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,823
What did Ryan do?

646
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:50,368
Mom.. What happened?

647
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:51,438
Clothes...

648
00:33:51,438 --> 00:33:53,335
Clothes? Dad's clothes?

649
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:56,024
Ge-Get thos.... get those...

650
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:57,836
get tho... get those...

651
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:58,934
Get that!

652
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,207
Put it in! put it in!

653
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,880
Yes, put the clothes... I'll

654
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,463
I'll fo...

655
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,480
I'll follow..

656
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:09,909
I'll follow.

657
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:38,567
Wait!

658
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:41,046
Get that! Get that!

659
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,698
Get that!

660
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,230
Get that over there.

661
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,016
over there!

662
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,670
Get that over there!

663
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,819
Get those vials!

664
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:52,942
Yes!

665
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,615
Yes, hurry!

666
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:10,220
Put the...put them in?

667
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,404
Yes.

668
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,513
Yes! Hurry!

669
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:16,931
Hurry!

670
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:36,521
Okay, Charlotte.

671
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:39,284
Okay.

672
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,183
You've totally disrupetd my family.

673
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,006
No, that was you, Ryan.

674
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:47,246
You and your mom, 13 years ago.

675
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,606
We heard all about you staging the scene.

676
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:53,733
When you weren't there to charperone,
your mom gave us details.

677
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:56,695
You took advantage of 
a sick, old woman?

678
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,895
But you forgot the socks.

679
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:02,363
Nice touch with the crack vials,
though... real respectful to dad.

680
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:03,610
I respected my dad.

681
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,245
Really? / I respected 
my mom, too.

682
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:07,478
What was I supposed to do?

683
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:09,690
You trying to blame Mom?

684
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,004
Mom who treated you 
like you walked on water?

685
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,112
I never asked fot that.
I didn't want to be her pet.

686
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:17,004
She chose me.
I couldn't shake her.

687
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:19,527
Like you can't shake her now.

688
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,866
You dreamed of being an adult, right?

689
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:26,367
- Finally escaping her?
- But then Mom got sick.

690
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,978
And now you're trapped again.

691
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:37,897
You have no idea 
how much she needs.

692
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:39,409
I know, Ryan.

693
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:41,736
That's why you leave 
the front door open.

694
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,912
Maybe she'll wander away for good,

695
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,719
and then you'll be free.

696
00:36:48,357 --> 00:36:49,680
I love my mom.

697
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,498
But you're angry at her 
for what she made you do:

698
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:57,600
commiting murder in her name.

699
00:36:58,557 --> 00:36:59,731
I didn't do that.

700
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:03,587
Come on, Ryan, you're 
a classic mama's boy.

701
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:05,265
What better way to protect your mom

702
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,243
than to kill the guy 
who's done her wrong?

703
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:12,524
My mom didn't need 
protecting from anyone.

704
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,482
What's that supposed to mean?

705
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:20,889
You only know her 
as this feeble woman

706
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,566
who gets confused and scared,

707
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:25,549
and you probably feel bad for her.

708
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,558
But you didn't see her in her prime...

709
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,548
when she terrorized us.

710
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,233
We weren't supposed to talk about it.

711
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:42,580
Nice family keeping up appearances.

712
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:45,897
She would bitch me 
and Tina out all the time.

713
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,101
When it got really bad...

714
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:50,296
when she was good 
and drunk and crazy...

715
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,166
she would attack my dad.

716
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,140
Hit him?

717
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,739
He never hit her back.

718
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,012
He would just take it.

719
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:03,307
and get away as soon as possible.

720
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:08,254
Is that why he had all those 
locks on his bedroom door?

721
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:16,615
He couldn't sleep if he 
didn't lock himself in at night.

722
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,462
That's how scared he was of her.

723
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,526
And still he stood up 
for me that night.

724
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,786
Knowing what she could do to him.

725
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,605
Why are you home, Ryan?

726
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,382
Why aren't you at the dance?

727
00:39:00,597 --> 00:39:04,030
Mom didn't want me to go.

728
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,628
We had an interesting call tonight.

729
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:14,736
He had a date, Charlotte.

730
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:20,493
Well, apparently, 
you both had dates.

731
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,108
All right, get your jacket. I'll 
take you to the dance myself.

732
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,541
No, he's staying with me.

733
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,204
Look, he's 16 years old, Charlotte.

734
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:31,418
He doesn't want to sit home on 
a Saturday night with his mother.

735
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,316
Yes, he does!

736
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:35,762
Yes, he does.

737
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:42,232
Unlike you, who would rather 
be sneaking around with Judy.

738
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:44,382
Don't do this in front of Ryan.

739
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,676
Ryan? Ryan took the call!

740
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,195
This between you and me,

741
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:50,707
and I'm going to take 
him over to the dance

742
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:53,479
and when I come back, 
we can talk about it.

743
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:57,599
He's staying with me!

744
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,113
He loves me.

745
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:02,279
He loves me.

746
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:04,025
Don't you, Ryan?

747
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,062
I do.

748
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:08,558
But I want to go to the dance.

749
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:09,689
What?

750
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,153
The both of you teaming up against me?

751
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:15,185
- Ryan, get your jacket now.
- Wha... Ryan....

752
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:17,316
I'm not going to talk to you
when you're like this, Charlott.

753
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:18,611
Do you understand that?

754
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:21,727
Now I'm going to go upstairs and 
I'm going to get some dry clothes.

755
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,672
Mitchell... Mitchell!

756
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,187
Ryan!

757
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:28,031
Mi...

758
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:29,867
Ryan...

759
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,347
- Mitchell! 
- Mom,

760
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:35,970
- Mitchell! No!
- mom....

761
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,710
No!

762
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:41,708
Judy Enright is cheap Christmas trash!

763
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:48,044
She's a disgrace and you're a 
disgrace to good churchgoing people!

764
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:51,882
Do not shut me out!

765
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,460
Don't ....you...

766
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:59,220
Don't you shut me out! / Mom!

767
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,545
Do not shut me out!

768
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:06,458
You will not disgrace me!

769
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:09,011
Don't you shut me out!

770
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:14,966
You will not disgrace me!

771
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:17,034
No!

772
00:41:35,222 --> 00:41:36,759
Ryan...

773
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:40,056
Get the van.

774
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:05,726
# Madonna의 "Live To Tell" #

775
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:24,736
# I have a tale to tell #

776
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:33,587
# Sometimes it gets 
so hard to hide it well #

777
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:42,181
# I was not ready for the fall #

778
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:51,218
# Too blind to see 
the writing on the wall #

779
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:55,331
# A man can tell a thousand lies #

780
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:58,648
# I've learned my lesson well #

781
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:00,748
# Hope I live to tell #

782
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:06,207
# The secret I have 
learned, 'till then #

783
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:15,830
# It will burn inside of me #

784
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:36,975
# The truth is never far behind #

785
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:40,041
# You kept it hidden well #

786
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,233
# If I live to tell #

787
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,470
# The secret I knew then #

788
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:54,610
# Will I ever have the chance again #
