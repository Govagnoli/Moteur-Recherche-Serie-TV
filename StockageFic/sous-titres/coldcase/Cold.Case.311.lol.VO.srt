1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:03,352
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,688
- Are we going to that party tonight?
- Yeah

3
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:33,175
Man, forget about that party,
just keep driving right out of Philly

4
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,526
What's wrong with Philly?

5
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:36,656
May's got her big plans

6
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,027
Singing, huh?

7
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:43,439
She's gonna cut some place of her own
in New York City

8
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,125
Why do you wanna go to New York?
You don't know anyone there

9
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,319
I know everyone here

10
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,448
I bet she makes it

11
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:53,029
We won't hear from her ever again
except for on the radio

12
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:56,054
My Daddy says if you plan big
you'll just disappoint yourself

13
00:00:56,054 --> 00:01:01,346
- Yeah, well I got plans that involve you
- You do?

14
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:06,030
Oh, crap, get a room

15
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:39,001
8 Years Later

16
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:50,459
So this chick went AWAL
after a highway shooting in '88?

17
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,953
Yeah, the guy she was with was killed

18
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:56,925
She got winged, skipped out of the hospital
before the cops could interview her

19
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,246
Now someone dropped a dime?

20
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:02,498
Old classmate saw her
on the boardwalk last week

21
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:06,550
Man, what is that?

22
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:11,139
- Rice cake
- All right

23
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,309
- May Pierson
- Yeah

24
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,814
Philadelphia Homicide

25
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,978
I don't have anything to do with anything

26
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:24,106
That's a pretty broad claim

27
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,516
I've been up all night,
I can't be doing this

28
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,394
Doing what, May?
You don't even know what it's about

29
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:30,479
- Or do you?
- Clem Garris

30
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,643
Shot on the expressway in '88,
you were there

31
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,813
'Till you fled

32
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:39,752
No
That was another girl

33
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,196
So you're not May Pierson?

34
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:47,280
That works at this fine establishment
and drives this vehicle?

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,679
I'm sayin' that was a lifetime ago

36
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,060
Yeah, we gotta talk about it

37
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,540
- Forget it, I'm goin' home
- This ain't a debate, May,

38
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,504
we got a warrant
We do this here or do it in Philly

39
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,433
You can't take me there, on what basis?

40
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:02,147
Obstructing a police investigation '88,
New York bench warrant '94

41
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:08,579
And irritating two homicide guys, 2006
Get in the car

42
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,317
Philadelphia Police Department
Central Division

43
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,268
Were you in court this morning?

44
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,944
Cat emergency,

45
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,339
Olivia got chomped by a neighbor dog

46
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,444
You get the ???

47
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:09,163
That's not funny

48
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,737
Rita

49
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:18,960
Hi, John

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,559
I almost came by,
I didn't wanna bother you

51
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,987
Lilly Rush, Rita Hart

52
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:28,983
Formerly Stillman

53
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:34,349
Oh, hi Um I'll see you later, boss

54
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:37,846
So, what brings you here?

55
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,788
- House got robbed last night
- No kiddin'?

56
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,673
Yeah, I just reported it

57
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,954
Was Joel with you?

58
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,851
Joel moved out

59
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:49,893
Few months ago

60
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:53,182
- The drinking?
- Yeah

61
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,664
- Sorry
- It's better

62
00:05:56,664 --> 00:06:02,525
I'll talk to major crimes,
have them fast track it / OK

63
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:06,705
- Give you a call
- Thanks

64
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:20,595
Clem Garris shot and killed January '88,
found on the shoulder of I-76

65
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:21,703
But not alone

66
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:25,670
No, that's the scandelous part,
he was found with a woman not his wife

67
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,642
May Pierson
Was shot in the arm,

68
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:31,092
slipped out of the ER
before the cops could get a play by play

69
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:32,931
But Vera and Valens
picked her up this morning

70
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,040
Got her upstairs

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,348
Leaves the scene
and doesn't turn up for 18 years?

72
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,720
- That's a person of interest
- At least

73
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,334
Clem told his wife Sally, he'd be
at a local bar that night with the guys

74
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,922
So why is he out on the highway
with this gal?

75
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,840
Rough way to find out
what your husband's up to

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,742
Unless Sally already knew
Decided she'd had enough

77
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:55,699
Making her a person of
interest number two

78
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,092
Between New York and Jersey,
there's a lot of ink on you May

79
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,109
That's from way back

80
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:03,670
A DUI, arrest for loitering, solicitation?

81
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,320
I know what I did

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,114
Now you know why I ditched
the cops that night

83
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:08,312
You didn't wanna get jammed up

84
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,547
Never mind helping find
who killed your boyfriend Clem

85
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,981
He wasn't my boyfriend

86
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,162
Sayin' you weren't screwin' around?

87
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:14,827
I hadn't seen him in years

88
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:19,334
Well then how the heck do you end up
on that highway with him, May?

89
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:23,643
I ran into Clem at Atlantic City that night

90
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,328
Told his wife he was at a Philly bar

91
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,798
I can't account for that

92
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:30,248
So, you run into him

93
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,781
We're talking about old times,

94
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,435
we're both headin' back to Philly,
he offers me a ride

95
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:39,229
- And?
- And we're almost there

96
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,055
Get bumped from behind

97
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:45,834
He pulls over
Gets out

98
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,895
Gets shot
Just like that

99
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:54,015
Clem talk about bein' in trouble?
Anything like that?

100
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,758
I don't know what his life was like

101
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:59,963
We'd said our goodbyes years earlier
when we were just kids

102
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,467
1981

103
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,990
May Pierson shows up

104
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,128
What's one last shift

105
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,151
You're really goin', huh?

106
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,282
Leavin' for New York, 8 am

107
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:33,378
Not gonna wait for Petie
to come get you?

108
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,661
Petie's a big college football star

109
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,826
He's never comin' back

110
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,831
You gonna marry Sally?

111
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:51,289
That's the plan

112
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,028
What if you came with me instead?

113
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,066
Come with you?

114
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:12,340
Remember that day we drove around
playing 'Born To Run' until the tape broke?

115
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,158
Yeah, we ran out of gas

116
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:20,848
We could spend every day like that

117
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm not like you, May

118
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,911
I'm not a big dream kind of person

119
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:28,637
But you are

120
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:34,552
I gotta stay

121
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,173
Well She sure is pretty

122
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:57,036
Bye, Mayflower

123
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:13,884
Just Married

124
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:20,430
That's how I like to remember Clem

125
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,971
'Cause when I saw him that night
at Atlantic City,

126
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:28,854
he'd turned into just another
disappointed working guy

127
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:31,939
It happens

128
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,067
That's what I know

129
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,240
Now can I get back to Jersey?

130
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,741
So May Pierson gave us new details
about your husband's murder

131
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:53,878
Like? / He was in Atlantic City that night
Not in Philly, like he told you

132
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,231
Look, I know everyone thought

133
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:59,419
Clem must have been seein' her
behind my back, but he wasn't

134
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,595
How do you know?

135
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,728
Clem wasn't perfect,
but he was more good than bad

136
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:08,307
And when he was in something,
he was in

137
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,267
When I was 19,

138
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,637
I took off with a guy
2 weeks into knowin' him

139
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,434
The heart wants what it wants

140
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:21,037
Yeah He was a biker, drinker
But I thought this is it

141
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:24,587
Roll out the carpet,
we're goin' down the aisle

142
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:27,294
You didn't go through with it?

143
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:31,458
We came close
We were road trippin'

144
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:38,212
Went to a courthouse in Knoxville
and we just sat out there on his bike

145
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:42,139
Neither one of us could get off

146
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:46,273
Well Clem and I never had
any doubts / No?

147
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:51,455
Getting married was
the happiest day of our lives

148
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:55,433
Anyone unhappy that day?

149
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,502
One person

150
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:03,494
1982

151
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,535
- Are you sorry?
- No, come on

152
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:27,800
I didn't want it to be this way

153
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,664
We were gonna have babies anyway

154
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:39,990
We're doin' the right thing, Sal

155
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,413
I'm gonna make you happy every day

156
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,080
What a frickin' joke

157
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,036
Petie, we didn't think you were coming

158
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:53,416
You two aren't foolin' anyone

159
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,878
Are you drinkin' this early?

160
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,993
You're just marrying here because she's
knocked up OK, and everyone knows it

161
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,592
- Keep it down
- Pete you're acting really embarassing

162
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,297
Whoa, I'm embarassing?

163
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:05,341
I know who you really wanna be with

164
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:10,102
It's my girl May

165
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:13,356
What the hell happened to you?

166
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,239
What would happen?

167
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:23,861
I got my ass kicked out
and I'm washed up

168
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,537
and my girl's gone so you get everything
and I get nothing

169
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:31,971
Hey start up my car

170
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:36,416
Me and my bride are pullin' outta here

171
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:53,894
Just Married

172
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,191
Petie had some kind of wall?

173
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,696
Somethin' went real wrong
at Penn State

174
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:11,827
He dropped out,
came home damaged good

175
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,765
Brought some strong feelings home

176
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:18,912
If it's true, that Clem was
in Atlantic City that night? / Yeah?

177
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:21,562
Petie spent a lot of time there

178
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,886
So he could've run into Clem and May,
and reacted badly?

179
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:29,917
I can't put it past him
He's in jail now

180
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,857
I hear you made a spectacle of yourself
at that wedding, Petie

181
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,242
Yeah, what a jerk

182
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:45,795
Pretty bitter about things
going so good for Clem?

183
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:48,278
I was in a real bad way then

184
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,396
I just lost my free ride to Penn State

185
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:54,114
- I played ball, too
- Yeah?

186
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:55,985
What went wrong?

187
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,311
First game, I choked

188
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:03,220
Froze up on the field, did it all year
Got cut

189
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,289
Couldn't've been easy
comin' home after that / It wasn't

190
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:09,335
- People look at you like you're crap
- Including Clem?

191
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,826
No He was cool

192
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,528
I apologized for the wedding thing

193
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,829
We moved on
Started hangin' out again

194
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:23,249
Were you surprised to hear that he was
with May the night he died? / Yeah

195
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,737
- Everyone was
- Bother you at all?

196
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:30,107
- How do you mean?
- She was your girl, right?

197
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:32,113
I went with her in high school

198
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,594
So maybe you wanted to
get back to that time

199
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:39,418
When you were a football star,
and had your girl May

200
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:45,627
Not denying those were better times
but 8 years later I wasn't thinkin' about May

201
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:50,113
- No?
- I was thinkin' about someone else

202
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,775
1985

203
00:15:56,432 --> 00:16:04,142
*  Glory Days
by Bruce Springsteen *

204
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,620
9 seconds left and crazy Rick
tosses me that screen pass

205
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,254
Yeah, I remember,

206
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:18,726
me and Sal were on the field
gettin' ready to do the homecoming thing

207
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,112
Caught that baby,
turned on the jets

208
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:26,723
- That was something
- Crazy times, crazy times

209
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,919
Never been a prettier
homecoming queen, Sal

210
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,300
You in that white dress

211
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,861
You remember that, huh?

212
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:37,052
Are you kidding me?
Everybody noticed

213
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:41,304
Someone got the best catch in school

214
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:45,012
I sure did

215
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,209
Who's that?

216
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,534
A guy I do favors for,
make some cash

217
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:58,886
- I'd better get back to the baby
- I'll be home soon

218
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,830
Why is she so down?

219
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:12,708
Things have been kind of yippy at home

220
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,571
You know truthfully, man,

221
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:21,810
I don't know if me and Sal were
ready for all this

222
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,479
So young

223
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,064
- It's probably just tough times, right?
- Yeah

224
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,899
No, man

225
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:35,423
- It's more than that
- You think she's sorry?

226
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:40,157
I think she wishes
she didn't cry every night

227
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:47,893
So Clem and Sally were on the outs

228
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:51,168
Win or lose

229
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,362
I'll lay it out for you

230
00:17:55,708 --> 00:18:03,700
Things between me and Sally kind of grew

231
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,918
So Sally and Petie started up

232
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,147
??? Clem their marriage was so great

233
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:13,696
That gives her motive
if she wanted out for good

234
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,379
What about these favors
that Petie was doing for money?

235
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,494
Breakin' legs, stealing cars
Thug stuff

236
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:19,931
Clem ever get in on it?

237
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,981
Petie says he offered
but Clem wouldn't go for it

238
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:24,830
The guy walked the line

239
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,522
Uh, anyway guys, good night

240
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:33,476
What's he nervous about?

241
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,124
Her

242
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:40,169
So they found who did the robberies?

243
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,354
Bobby Greene

244
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,575
Lived up the street
He used to throw mudballs at our windows

245
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:48,222
- That little kid?
- He's grown up

246
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:51,195
- Criminal now
- Oh, God

247
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:55,944
He hit two other houses on the block
but he got picked up this morning

248
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:58,948
That's sad

249
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:06,113
So, why didn't you come to me
about this in the first place?

250
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:09,008
I knew you'd be busy

251
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:11,222
A long time to be less busy

252
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:14,900
You are who you are

253
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:22,297
I would like to think I've
learned some things

254
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:25,944
- Anyway I
- Would you

255
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:28,730
you wanna have dinner?

256
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,984
- Go to Irena's?
- Really?

257
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:37,982
- Yeah I'm free Friday
- Me, too

258
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:42,663
- 7?
- OK

259
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,533
OK

260
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,032
- All right, I'll see you
- OK

261
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:54,889
- 7
- Yeah

262
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,370
Clem made you happy every day

263
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,231
- Right Sally?
- Right

264
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:12,475
- Don't wanna revise that statement?
- Why would I?

265
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:16,083
How about because you were bangin' Petie

266
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,000
- That was wrong
- But it happened

267
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,106
And you not tellin' that,
get's the wheels turnin'

268
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,173
Maybe you felt trapped

269
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:27,554
Things between you and Clem
died out but he wouldn't give up

270
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:32,281
'Cause when he was in somethin'
he was in / Look

271
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,771
I never had that kind of love again

272
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:37,272
So maybe I wanna remember things
a certain way

273
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,159
But we don't live in that land, Sal

274
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,045
We got a real life murder to solve

275
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,912
That's true
Things faded

276
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:51,822
And? / And it's true Clem
wasn't one to give up

277
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:56,014
But he did
Finally

278
00:20:57,366 --> 00:21:00,213
1986

279
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:35,180
- Oh, man it's
- Valentine's Day

280
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,941
Baby, I'm sorry

281
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:44,469
- I was gonna get flowers and candy
- It doesn't matter

282
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,744
Let's go to bed, huh?

283
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,809
No

284
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:15,268
We ain't makin' it, are we Sal?

285
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:23,776
- Why can't we fix it?
- I don't know

286
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,410
It's just gone

287
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,210
But it was right

288
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,553
It was fun and easy and right

289
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,957
Yeah, it was

290
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,693
I don't wanna be a divorced person

291
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:49,497
Yeah, but do you wanna be
this married person?

292
00:23:12,985 --> 00:23:16,339
That's when Petie came into the picture?

293
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:20,538
It wasn't love

294
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,431
But he wanted to be with me

295
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,895
And Clem wanted to be somewhere else

296
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:29,884
By the time May came back to town,

297
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:32,909
he knew he could go see her

298
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:36,014
May came back?

299
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:45,496
When her mother died
Clem went to the funeral

300
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:50,510
I told you I hadn't seen Clem
since high school

301
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,577
Oh, I know what you told me

302
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:57,179
His wife said he was at the funeral

303
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,013
Look, I didn't kill him

304
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:02,892
Then why lie to my face?

305
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:06,391
What are you hiding?

306
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:13,236
Me and Clem did a stupid desperate thing

307
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:19,174
Tried to get back something
we'd never have again

308
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:23,729
I need to hear about that

309
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:27,874
I saw him at the funeral

310
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:30,290
And?

311
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:35,790
Everything rushed back

312
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,892
1987

313
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:53,535
Clem Garris shows up

314
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,188
Hey, Mayflower

315
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:19,243
I should get to the reception

316
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,849
Let me drive you

317
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:08,176
How'd New York go?

318
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,768
Not too good

319
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:12,603
How is that possible?

320
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:15,573
You're the best singer I've ever heard

321
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:19,658
Turns out a lot of people can sing

322
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:33,472
You going to that reception?

323
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:38,798
No
Just keep drivin'

324
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,313
You got a guy there? New York?

325
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:52,114
No Mostly just got debts

326
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:53,668
How you been gettin' by?

327
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:56,236
I don't wanna talk about it

328
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:58,753
OK

329
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:02,921
I just haven't been livin' right

330
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:23,893
What if we started over?

331
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,437
You and me

332
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:33,484
How? / Get out of here
Just drive away

333
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:39,360
Like we should've done years ago

334
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,624
I loved you so much

335
00:28:41,624 --> 00:28:44,967
Maybe it's still in you someplace

336
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:48,843
I know it's in me

337
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,244
I owe this guy

338
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:53,546
There's a job I can do

339
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:58,588
In Atlantic City, get you money

340
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:08,062
- And then clear out of here?
- Yeah, you and me Finally

341
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:41,967
We thought we could pick up
where we left things all those years ago

342
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,687
But you can't go back

343
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:47,509
Learned that the hard way

344
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:50,050
So then you met in Atlantic City

345
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,059
He did this job and we went

346
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,079
Then the shooting happened

347
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:02,081
- What kind of job?
- Just said it was a favor for a guy

348
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,782
Looked into the dude Petie
was doing favors for,

349
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:06,938
he's a lowlife named Henry Mack

350
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,679
Probably who Clem got mixed up with

351
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,271
What's this Mack's line of work?

352
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:13,128
Had a ring of guys stealing cars,
at airports, casinos,

353
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:15,673
bringin' then back to
his chop shop in Philly

354
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:18,269
So maybe Clem's doin'
some runs for him that night

355
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:21,796
Maybe Petie knows more about
that night than he's lettin' on

356
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:25,130
- You find this Mack?
- 6 feet under in Trenton

357
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,565
- Tough interview
- But there's a story to that

358
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:30,159
Guy was murdered,
shot on a casino parkin' lot

359
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,740
That connected to Clem somehow?

360
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,609
I'm guessin' because Mack was killed
the very same night Clem was

361
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,465
I know Clem usually walked the line

362
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:46,984
Didn't get mixed up in
the kind of favors you did

363
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:48,503
He kept his nose clean

364
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:52,955
Is that maybe just one time
when he really needed the money?

365
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,370
- For May?
- Maybe

366
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,743
But that one time you two worked for Mack

367
00:30:57,743 --> 00:31:01,076
Clem gets shot
So does Mack / Uh-huh

368
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:04,062
It's kind of hard to miss
what those murders have in common

369
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,584
- You
- I was a theif not a killer

370
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:10,463
You and Clem were stealin' those cars,
maybe get ambitious?

371
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:12,202
- Decide to double cross Mack?
- No

372
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:13,502
But Clem was desperate

373
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:16,067
Maybe havin' a runnin' buddy
made you bold and Henry Mack

374
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,442
- probably deserved the pop in the head
- I don't know how Mack died

375
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,747
And after you two waste him, you panic

376
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:25,234
Word Clem's gonna fold 'cause he don't
got a criminal nature, he walks the line

377
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:29,189
Clem was the one guy who was nice to me
when I came home a mess!

378
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:32,374
Everyone else kept away

379
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,678
He stayed my friend

380
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,145
So be a friend to him, Petie

381
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:47,767
Say what happened that night

382
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,075
He didn't wanna be dirty

383
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:57,399
But it was his only ticket out

384
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,055
1988

385
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:11,953
* Stolen Car
by Bruce Springsteen *

386
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:17,759
* I found me a little girl
and I settled down *

387
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,213
* in a pretty little house
in a pretty little town *

388
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:27,473
* We got married,
and promised never to part *

389
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:32,901
* then little by little
we drifted from each other's heart *

390
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,294
* Now I'm driving a stolen car *

391
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:38,682
* down on a pitch black night *

392
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:43,385
* And I'm doing my best to make it through *

393
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:48,650
* Well I'm just sittin' down here
at a Stanton light *

394
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,540
* I wanna get caught but I never do *

395
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,766
* At first I thought
it was just restlessness *

396
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:01,811
* that would fade as time went by *

397
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:04,443
* and our love grew deep *

398
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:08,751
* But in the end it was
something more I guess *

399
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:13,852
* that tore us apart and made us weep *

400
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:16,322
* And I'm driving a stolen car *

401
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:19,214
* waitin' on that little red light *

402
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:24,217
* I keep tellin' myself
everything's gonna be alright *

403
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:28,957
* But I ride by night and I travel in fear *

404
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:34,448
* That in this darkness
I might just disappear *

405
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:38,837
* She asked if I remembered
the letters I wrote *

406
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:44,179
* When our love was young
and we were bold *

407
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,614
* She said last night
she read those letters *

408
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:55,018
* And they made her feel
one hundred years old *

409
00:33:57,145 --> 00:34:02,181
* As the river runs by the little town *

410
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:06,596
* down into the sea *

411
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:12,102
* it was there in the shade
I let my body down*

412
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:13,584
I'm out, Petie

413
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,469
No if you wanna get paid,
we gotta go to Philly

414
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,896
I'm takin' the car

415
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,890
- What?
- Forget the money

416
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,560
No, it's no good, Clem
Mack won't go fot that

417
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,755
Mack's not gonna find me

418
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,116
Be good to her

419
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:49,742
He went off to get May

420
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:52,542
That's it

421
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:56,515
The '69 Chevy, huh?

422
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,839
It was a beauty

423
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,201
Yeah I've seen it

424
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:09,259
You're still driving the same car
you and Clem took out of Atlantic City

425
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:13,202
And the only person who knew
where Clem was going that night?

426
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:15,702
- Petie
- It wasn't Petie

427
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:20,429
- Who then?
- A guy Clem called him Mack

428
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:24,955
There had to be two people, May
Someone drove that second car away

429
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,468
And somehow the Chevy
ended up back with you

430
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,094
You would'nt've given us Mack right off

431
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,646
Unless it was someone
you wanted to protect

432
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:37,003
Maybe you and Petie need to talk

433
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:49,337
Hey, Mayflower!

434
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:52,713
Hi, Petie boy

435
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:03,305
May IDed Henry Mack
from a photo spread as the shooter

436
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:06,117
So we know he was one of our guys
at the scene

437
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,720
But we still got the matter
of who was with him

438
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,274
And who killed him later that night

439
00:36:12,274 --> 00:36:15,529
You ever make it with singin'?

440
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:20,104
I'm just a cocktail waitress

441
00:36:20,104 --> 00:36:23,063
So May says you two made a promise

442
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:27,224
Back when Clem died

443
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:30,034
Yeah

444
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:34,712
I'll keep it Petie
I'm not scared

445
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:42,047
It's over for me
But you can still have a good life

446
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:50,930
What happens?
After Clem takes off in that Chevy?

447
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:57,563
He finds trouble
All because of me

448
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:04,782
We both had our part in it

449
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:08,344
- You think you can steal from me?
- Mack

450
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:20,488
Take their car
Meet me back there

451
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,871
You gave him up?

452
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,425
He was gonna kill me

453
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:30,108
- Get in the car and drive!
- OK, OK

454
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:14,329
* One Step Up
Bruce Springsteen *

455
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:21,626
* Woke up this morning my house was cold *

456
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:24,823
* checked the furnace, she wasn't burning *

457
00:41:24,823 --> 00:41:28,246
* Went out and hopped in my old Ford *

458
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:31,380
* hit the engine but she ain't turning *

459
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,068
* Giving each other some
hard lessons lately *

460
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:37,226
* but we ain't learning *

461
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:42,623
* The same sad story, that's a fact *

462
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,567
* one step up and two steps back *

463
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:03,830
* Bird on a wire outside my motel room *

464
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,464
* but he ain't singing *

465
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:09,832
* Girl in white outside a church in June *

466
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:13,012
* but the church bells, they ain't ringing *

467
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:19,628
* I'm sitting here in this bar tonight
but all I'm thinking is *

468
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:24,939
* I'm the same old story, same old act *

469
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:32,493
* one step up and two steps back *

470
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,998
* It's the same thing night on night *

471
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,059
* who's wrong, baby, who's right? *

472
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:51,557
* Another fight and I slam the door on *

473
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:54,527
* another battle in our dirty little war *

474
00:42:54,527 --> 00:43:01,146
* When I look at myself I don't see
the man I wanted to be *

475
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:06,244
* Somewhere along the line
I slipped off track *

476
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:13,228
* One step up and two steps back *

477
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:26,640
* There's a girl across the bar *

478
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,898
* I get the message she's sending *

479
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:33,151
* Mmm, she ain't looking too married *

480
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:36,078
* me,well, honey, I'm pretending *

481
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:39,294
* Last night I dreamed
I held you in my arms *

482
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:41,925
* the music was never-ending *

483
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:47,746
* We danced as the evening
sky faded to black *

484
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:53,944
* One step up and two steps back *

485
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:59,914
* One step up and two steps back *

486
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:07,238
* One step up and two steps back *
