3
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:23,786
It's fun, right?

4
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,832
It's better than watching frat guys
playing beer pong.

5
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:28,927
You get credit for working 
on the campaign?

6
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:31,519
Oh yeah, but I'd do it anyway.

7
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:35,418
Does it bother you that 
he's such a womanizer?

8
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,756
He's not gonna do 
that in the White House.

9
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,885
Who's the face?

10
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,686
He's David Lake.
He runs our campaign office.

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,596
That his girlfriend?

12
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,090
Sister.

13
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,605
Vanessa, that drunk they threw out,

14
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,217
is he with you?

15
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,956
- I'm not with him any..
- Cuz that was embarrassing.

16
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:10,719
I know, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,461
It wasn't her fault, Abbey.

18
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,323
David, we never got to talk.

19
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:19,459
Uh, later. I promise.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,851
Well, him, I'd vote for.

21
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,337
They're saying 
he's the future of the party.

22
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:31,759
It's loud in here.
You wanna walk outside?

23
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:22,128
Hey.

24
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,723
What took you so long?

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,511
Had to doll up.

26
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,087
Vera got lucky.

27
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,592
I'm on the up desk all night,

28
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:33,289
eight minutes to go on the shift 
and this guy's gotta buy it.

29
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,185
Darren Clemen, two in the head.

30
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,201
- Up close.
- Any witnesses?

31
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,859
They heard it, 
but they didn't see it.

32
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,395
Working cold jobs, you almost 
forget how much blood there is.

33
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:50,704
It does seem extra gory.

34
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,658
I'm assuming there's a good reason
we got dragged down here?

35
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,143
Inside.

36
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,832
The guy didn't believe in house work.

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,713
Looks like some kind of shrine.

38
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,077
Or a trophy case.

39
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:13,497
About the death of Vanessa Prosser.

40
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,936
Who's that?

41
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,921
Murder victim, 1992.

42
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:21,750
Never found her killer.

43
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,741
Never say never.

00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,879
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/04/04

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,656
Vanessa Prosser was 
a college senior working

55
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,327
on the local Clinton campaign.

56
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,829
Went to election party 
on November, 3rd, 1992.

57
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,833
Washed up on the bank of 
the Delaware the next morning
with a broken neck.

58
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,882
Republicans thought
they had a bad night

59
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:13,804
Best guess is she was tossed
from the Ben Franklin bridge.

60
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:14,775
It could've been a fall.

61
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,173
Bruising under her arms.

62
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,601
Dragged and dumped.

63
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,286
A letter was found in her pocket.

64
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,976
Signature and most of 
the prints were washed away,

65
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,376
but few words are readable.

66
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,059
Been afraid..

67
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,729
Wanting to..

68
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,947
Feelings for you...

69
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,162
An admirer.

70
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:31,349
With good penmanship.

71
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,935
Lead suspect was Aaron Dutra, 
Vanessa's ex,

72
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:37,610
an ROTC Penn-grad just 
gotten back from the Gulf War.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,756
He got thrown 
out of the party that night.

74
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:42,379
Case against him didn't stick, though.

75
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,287
Hmm, among other things,

76
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,560
bad penmanship.

77
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,040
We think the letter came from 
Clemen, this new victim.

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,929
He had a kind of 
an obssession with her.

79
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,167
What else do we know 
about this guy?

80
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,932
No record, no warrants.
Name's clean.

81
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,581
Can't say the same for his house.

82
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:58,440
Neighbor said the wife died 
three years ago.

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,093
He turned into a hermit, 
let the place go.

84
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,094
And the relationship between him
and the Prosser girl?

85
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,613
No connections, yet, but he did 
have some of her personal items.

86
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,774
Receipts, school papers, 
journal entries.

87
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,207
Maybe he was stalking her.

88
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,693
But how'd he get her stuff?

89
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,834
Walter Spar was assigned to this
case. Will, do you know where he is?

90
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,988
Maybe the shore, I'll find him.

91
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:19,999
Let's see if Vanessa's parents 
know who Clemen was to her.

92
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,465
No.
I don't know him.

93
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,228
Who is he?

94
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:28,446
His name is Darren Clemen.
He was killed last night.

95
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:29,890
Killed?

96
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:32,620
What's this got to do with Vanessa?

97
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,637
We were hoping you could tell us.

98
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:36,536
She was living at home, right?

99
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,842
Yes, she was trying to save money.

100
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:41,601
She wanted to spend 
the summer in Washington.

101
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,802
This man had some of 
Vanessa's things at his house.

102
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,906
Well, I don't understand 
how that could be.

103
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:50,419
One theory is Vanessa was 
involved with this guy.

104
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,324
But, he looks like he's twice her age.

105
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,970
Though that might explain something.

106
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,673
Few weeks before Vanessa died,

107
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:02,332
we were making dinner.

108
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:04,182
George Bush is a war hero.

109
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,977
He doesn't know 
what a grocery scanner is.

110
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:10,249
Well, I, for one,
like that Hillary Clinton.

111
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:13,960
I liked her headbands, and I don't
know why she had to change it.

112
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,991
Dad, you have to vote for Clinton.
I need a job next year.

113
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,851
And never mind 
the Jennifer Flowers tapes.

114
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,626
Jennifer Flowers is a skank.

115
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,923
That's one thing we can agree on.

116
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:27,468
Ahem. For Vanessa.

117
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:31,907
Aaron? Still thinks 
he's in the game, huh?

118
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,419
- No, not from Aaron.
- Oh? Who from?

119
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,065
It's just a thank-you 
from the campaign.

120
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,919
Oh, oh, apply pressure. Here.

121
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,729
Direct pressure, come on. Hold it.
Grab it, honey.

122
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,031
Hurry up, hurry up. Here we go.
Keep pressing.

123
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,031
And then we got distracted 
when she cut herself.

124
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,629
Her blood didn't clot properly.

125
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,297
So you never found out 
who sent the flowers?

126
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:57,370
No.

127
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,069
This says you didn't realize that 
Vanessa was missing till the next day.

128
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,390
We figured she'd gone back to her
friend's place on campus, Beth Reardon.

129
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,292
She drove that night.

130
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:12,435
You build all these?

131
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,878
I just design them.

132
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:20,411
I'm an architect, not the contractor.

133
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,847
I've never seen him before.

134
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:24,908
Who is he?

135
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:26,975
Maybe someone Vanessa 
was involved with.

136
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,979
I doubt that.

137
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,853
You have better candidate?

138
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,727
I thought she had something going on,

139
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,994
but she was being secretive.

140
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:36,914
Anyone else who might know 
who Vanessa was seeing?

141
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,269
Ask Aaron Dutra.

142
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,109
He was all but stalking 
her at the time.

143
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,204
Her old boyfriend?

144
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:44,568
She broke up with him, but he 
wasn't taking no for an answer.

145
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:46,416
You see him at the party that night?

146
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,452
He was hard to miss.

147
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:52,128
I couldn't vote for Clinton,
I was too jealous of the Gore girls.

148
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,955
Gore is crazy. 
He kept dropping out of the race.

149
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:58,281
- I liked Stockdale in the debate.
- Vanessa.

150
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,805
Why are you here?

151
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:06,058
You were supposed to wait, V.

152
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,623
You're drunk.

153
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:08,976
Shut up.

154
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,418
Aaron, it's over.
I told you this.

155
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,742
I saw you with him today.

156
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,705
You're following me?

157
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,682
I saw him touch you, like you're his..

158
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,659
Stop.

159
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,737
Where is he? / Aaron.

160
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,090
Where is he? 
I know he's here.

161
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,210
Aaron. Sleep it off.

162
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,329
Cops had asked me 
about him the first time around.

163
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,036
He was an idiot, but

164
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,708
not a killer.

165
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,162
You and Aaron ever compare notes

166
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,734
on who this other guy 
might have been?

167
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,688
Aaron and I never compared anything.

168
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,342
He got sick after that.

169
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:46,567
Sick?

170
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:50,240
I heard it was Gulf War Syndrome.

171
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:52,256
Sounds like Vanessa's ex saw her

172
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,137
with the new admirer 
the day she died.

173
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:55,022
You've gone to him?

174
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,913
He was too sick to see us today.
We'll go back tomorrow.

175
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,846
That was Walter's partner.

176
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:01,126
He remembers the Prosser case?

177
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,714
Remembers Darren Clemen, too.

178
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,705
Said he started coming around 
few years back,

179
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:06,860
had a bunch of theories 
on how the girl died.

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,524
What, he came with here with theories?

181
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:11,213
Thought it was some kind of 
political conspiracy.

182
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,029
So, he was trying to solve her murder.

183
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,636
Why was he interested in Vanessa?

184
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,203
We still don't have a connection.

185
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,475
Maybe we do.

186
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,160
Remember all the blood 
at the Clemen scene?

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,823
The autopsy explained it, 
he was a hemophilliac.

188
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:23,861
Like Vanessa.

189
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,264
Wait, it's hereditary?

190
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,639
Coroner says yes. 
Females are just carriers,

191
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,468
but some show symptoms.

192
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,904
Blood relation.

193
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,044
Vanessa was 
Darren Clemen's daughter?

194
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:43,750
Yes, he was Vanessa's father.

195
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:49,876
It wasn't even an affair.
It was just one night.

196
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,765
You were already married?

197
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,436
Darren was 
my high school sweetheart.

198
00:09:55,436 --> 00:10:00,966
We had our ten year reunion.
His pals had a suite upstairs.

199
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,726
Old time's sake?

200
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,677
Stupid,

201
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,438
very stupid.

202
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:10,835
My husband doesn't know 
and neither did Vanessa.

203
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,438
Did Darren keep in touch?

204
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,061
No.

205
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:15,997
No, we agreed on that.

206
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:19,565
We had separate lives 
till three years ago.

207
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,694
When he started looking into 
Vanessa's death?

208
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:25,610
His wife had died. 
Said he was trying to fill the void.

209
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,464
Any idea who he suspected?

210
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:28,379
No.

211
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:30,909
I let him look through Vanessa's things

212
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:33,537
and then I asked him not to come back.

213
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,512
I had just lost my daughter.

214
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:39,484
I couldn't risk losing 
my husband, too.

215
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:46,213
If Clemen was looking into Vanessa's
murder and got too close to the truth,

216
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,913
that could explain his death, too.

217
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,406
So we're thinking one doer 
for both murders.

218
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:52,791
We gotta find out what Clemen knew.

219
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,430
Who he was after.

220
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,597
Where you been, Scotty?

221
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:58,833
Charming the pants off for 
a 90-year-old historian 
who works for the DNC.

222
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,092
You get the photo?

223
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,064
Everyone on the regional 
campaign in '92,

224
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:03,861
taken at the day of the election.

225
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,257
Vanessa's ex came to the party
looking for her new guy.

226
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,273
Maybe the new guy's here.

227
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,342
Who's Kite with?

228
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,389
I don't know.

229
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,396
- I heard you and him were..
- Yeah, I don't know.

230
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,970
Let's go see 
if Aaron's feeling better.

231
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:31,077
Whatever it is, 
I was here watching TV.

232
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,314
It's about Vanessa Prosser.

233
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:37,103
Of course, it is.

234
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,650
The night of her murder, you showed
up at the election party pretty upset.

235
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,626
Look at your records.

236
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,130
I've had this conversation 
a hundred times already.

237
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,999
Let's make it hundred and one.

238
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:52,180
It was the turkey talking, burbon.

239
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,008
I've been drinking all day.

240
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,500
Can you turn off the cooking show?

241
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:05,110
Before I went to the Gulf, 
Vanessa and I got engaged.

242
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,183
When I got back, she was 
supposed to be waiting for me.

243
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:11,151
And instead she found 
someone new?

244
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,897
Could you ID her 
new boyfriend from a picture?

245
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,366
Him. 
Glasses, front.

246
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,297
You're sure?

247
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:24,975
100 %.

248
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:32,466
Thanks.

249
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,992
Hi.

250
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:39,009
Thank you very much.

251
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,035
I voted, did you? / Yeah.

252
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:45,199
You know, I consider myself 
a reasonably smart guy,

253
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,186
- but those ballots are confusing.
- I know.

254
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:50,257
What happens if you don't 
knock out little square all the way?

255
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:52,345
Who knows?

256
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,509
David Lake.

257
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:13,592
I know that name.

258
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,741
Abbey Lake.

259
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,886
Congressman's chief of staff.

260
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,706
Detectives Rush and Valens.

261
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:28,348
Sister, not wife.
Everyone makes that mistake.

262
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,903
We're here to talk to David.

263
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,793
Oh, sorry, he's in Washington.

264
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:33,244
Maybe I can help?

265
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,442
We're looking into an old homicide.

266
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,328
Vanessa Prosser?

267
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,594
That was awful.

268
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,905
She was a really nice girl.

269
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,131
We heard she and your brother
might have been involved.

270
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,632
Her and David?

271
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,107
No.

272
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,584
You sure?

273
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,588
A lot of girls in the campaign 
were charmed by David.

274
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,156
It's the story of his life.

275
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,605
Occupational hazard.

276
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,676
Vanessa was a lot 
like the other girls.

277
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:59,107
That's all.

278
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,971
Ready?

279
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,139
Are we in a hurry?

280
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,882
We have a conference call
in an hour.

281
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:07,792
That's right.

282
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:08,867
We'll see you at the party?

283
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,963
- David, I have something I want to ...
- The polls close in four hours.

284
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,554
We need you on the phones.

285
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,170
Final push.

286
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,318
You'll see him tonight, Vanessa.

287
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,224
She was sweet,

288
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:24,554
but young, naive.

289
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,350
Starstruck?

290
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:30,104
David's only human. 
He gets flattered.

291
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,575
Part of my job was 
and is keeping him focused.

292
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:36,559
Still, we'd like to talk to your brother.

293
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,814
Soon as he's back in town.

294
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,286
I'm here at the local 
Democratic election party

295
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:44,781
where hundreds of volunteers 
have helped Bill Clinton...

296
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:47,239
11:15, election night.

297
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,628
Abbey Lake, David's sister.

298
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,113
And the future congressman himself.

299
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:54,691
No Vanessa, though.

300
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,648
Could be out of frame.

301
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,087
Could be dead.

302
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,124
We think Lake had a relationship
with Vanessa?

303
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,358
His sister says no.

304
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,532
Well, we'll see if his handwriting 
matches that letter found on her body.

305
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:05,705
Be delicate, Scotty.

306
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,318
He runs to his friends 
in the mayor's office,

307
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,197
I'm the one who gets the call.

308
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,753
What else do we know about him?

309
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:14,051
Been in Washington since 1992, 
elected to Congress two years ago.

310
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:15,878
Went to Princeton, 
Columbia Law.

311
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:17,640
Raised up north in Redding.

312
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,823
Redding?

313
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,028
Yeah.

314
00:15:20,726 --> 00:15:24,413
My victim made a couple calls to 
Redding the day he got shot.

315
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:25,637
Clemen did?

316
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,399
Yeah. To a guy named Marvin Dobie.

317
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,703
Marvin Dobie?

318
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,746
Philadelphia Homicide.

319
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:39,918
Yeah, so?

320
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,976
Hey, nice. Custom job.

321
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,587
Bamboo rod, tail water reel.

322
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:45,714
Expensive hobby.

323
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,786
Convictions for fraud,
forgery, bad checks.

324
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,855
Which of those hobbies 
got you that rod?

325
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,721
What do you want from me?

326
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,478
You know a guy named 
Darren Clemen?

327
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:56,710
Nah.

328
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,579
Really?

329
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:58,901
He called you last week.

330
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,176
Well, maybe 
he got a wrong number.

331
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,147
Talk to wrong numbers
for six minutes?

332
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:03,381
Maybe I got lonely.

333
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:05,219
Clemen got killed later that day.

334
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,633
You know anything about that?

335
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,200
Dead, whoa.

336
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,050
Know him now?

337
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,564
How about her?
Name's Vanessa Prosser.

338
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,034
Sorry, anyone else?

339
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:18,439
How about Congressman 
David Lake?

340
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,466
Yeah, I'll have him,
he's  from the neighborhood.

341
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,698
You friendly?

342
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,385
I wouldn't say that.

343
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,657
Look, I gotta get to the scrap yard.

344
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,370
This your writing?

345
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,758
No, man.
That's the architect.

346
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,233
They all write like that.

347
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:37,757
Old set of blueprints from Dobie.
Check on the print.

348
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:40,787
Here's the letter from Vanessa's
pocket. Compare this two.

349
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,061
Dobie's architect wrote 
Vanessa a love letter?

350
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:44,964
- They almost match.
- Almost.

351
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,139
This is called lettering.

352
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,553
You look at any set of plans, 
it basically looks like this.

353
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,450
All architects print this way for clarity.

354
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,770
So, it's hard to tell one from the next.

355
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,024
And we only got one architect 
in this investigation.

356
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,387
Beth Reardon.

357
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,246
Where did you find this?

358
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:09,283
It was in Vanessa's pocket.

359
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:11,625
It's your writing, isn't it?

360
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:18,462
I guess I was kind of in love with her.

361
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,961
It's my fault she died.

362
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,679
Why do you say that?

363
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,909
We went outside.

364
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,040
I knew something was bothering her.

365
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,053
Don't worry about Aaron.

366
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,249
He'll regret it all in the morning.

367
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm not.

368
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,872
Then what are you worried about?

369
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:51,898
You're not telling me something.

370
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:57,558
You ever wish you could just go backwards

371
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,806
and unlearn something?

372
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,021
Like?

373
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,971
I just want things to be simple.

374
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,370
But they're a mess.

375
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,252
Tell me what you mean.

376
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,477
I can't.

377
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,700
Beth. / I'm sorry.

378
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:41,047
I don't know what to say.

379
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Don't say anything.

380
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,016
Just read.

381
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,040
I was awry that night.

382
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,161
If I hadn't left, maybe 
she'd still be alive.

383
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,320
You told the first detectives you were 
at home the rest of the night.

384
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,031
Passed out on my bathroom floor.

385
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:11,299
So no alibi, then?

386
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,893
That's my alibi.

387
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:14,346
That's where I was.

388
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,599
How about this past Thursday night?

389
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,320
I was in the ER. 
My son had an asthma attack.

390
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,575
Did Vanessa ever mention 
the name Marvin Dobie?

391
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,292
Ex-con from Redding.

392
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,555
No bells?

393
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,966
Redding.

394
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,935
Um, she took a bus to Redding, 
a few days before the election.

395
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:36,051
She say why?

396
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,628
I heard her on the phone 
checking schedules.

397
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,070
When I asked her about about it,

398
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,241
she changed the subject.

399
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,201
Darren Clemen calls Dobie 
in Redding, ends up dead.

400
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,060
Vanessa goes to Redding..

401
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,010
Probably to contact Dobie.

402
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,915
Same ending.

403
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,381
All roads lead to Redding.

404
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,496
Congressman's hometown.

405
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,726
Believe me, I understand 
the need for low income housing.

406
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:01,368
I come from humble beginnings, 
and if it were up to me,

407
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,308
we'd break ground tomorrow.

408
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:07,905
But we just simply 
don't have the resources.

409
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,427
Me siento mucho.

410
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,813
He just told them he sets down a lot.

411
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,893
Gracias, gracias.
Thank you for coming.

412
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,734
How are you?

413
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,967
Vanessa and I worked 
on the campaign together.

414
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,897
That all you did together?

415
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,210
We hear you may have been 
more than co-workers.

416
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,133
Excuse me, just had lasik.

417
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,809
Put it off as long as I could.

418
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,377
2400 in both eyes.

419
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:38,041
Contacts never seem to fit right.

420
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,808
This a fillibuster, Congressman?

421
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:43,259
Okay.

422
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,426
Vanessa and I were involved.

423
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,917
But you kept it quiet.

424
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,210
Well, I didn't want more than 
one people in the campaign to know.

425
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,129
And after Vanessa died?

426
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:52,937
My coming forward 
wouldn't have helped.

427
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:54,750
Wouldn't helped you.

428
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,623
I had no information.

429
00:20:56,623 --> 00:21:00,228
And I was concerned about being
associated with an event like that.

430
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,450
Even though it was 
your girlfriend that got killed?

431
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,313
She wasn't though.

432
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,338
We broke things off that night.

433
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,239
You been avoiding me?

434
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,887
No, I think you have that reversed.

435
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:20,145
Where's your friend?

436
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:22,474
She went home.

437
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,980
And the ex-boyfriend?

438
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,089
Don't know.

439
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,008
Don't care.

440
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:32,349
V, I've been offered a position

441
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:35,050
in Washington.

442
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:38,319
That's great. / Yeah.

443
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,303
That's what you wanted.

444
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,484
Thing is,

445
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:55,454
it wouldn't make sense for us 
to make this long distance.

446
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,984
I thought the idea was that we were

447
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,941
gonna go to Washington together,
not break up.

448
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:08,344
Things have a way of turning 
on a dime in this business.

449
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:13,021
Is it because of Abbey?

450
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,919
What did Abbey have to do with it?

451
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,710
She was always worried about 
loose ends with the girls I dated.

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,560
You ever get back to your humble
beginnings in Redding?

453
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,280
Not really, no time.

454
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,080
Cuz Vanessa did.

455
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:34,484
Yeah, went to see a guy 
named Marvin Dobie.

456
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:36,710
I don't know the name.

457
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,789
Says he lived in your neighborhood.

458
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,768
I pride myself on my ability to 
remember people.

459
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,026
Thanks for being frank with us.

460
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:49,381
If there's one thing I learned 
from Bill Clinton,

461
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,803
never lie about that sort of thing.

462
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:57,132
Maybe he didn't lie about Vanessa.

463
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,187
He lied about Dobie.

464
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,065
You found a connection?

465
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:01,996
Yeah, pulled the forms to see 
who posted bail

466
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:04,499
on Dobie's arrest. Fraud, '77.

467
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,854
5000 dollar bond posted 
by Linda Savis.

468
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:08,043
Who's that?

469
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,986
Got her own record for prostitution,
but only once under that name.

470
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,455
In her married year, 
she was known as..

471
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:13,444
Linda Lake.

472
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,051
Mother of David and Abbey.

473
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:16,715
What did she had to do with Dobie?

474
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:18,661
Shared an address for an year.

475
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,043
Probably a boyfriend.

476
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:23,130
So Dobie didn't live in the same 
neighborhood with David Lake.

477
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,513
He lived in the same house.

478
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:26,571
And Lake can't place the name.

479
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,597
Which is doubly curious considering
the checks he's been writing.

480
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:30,995
Marvin Dobie

481
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,260
has been getting payments
from a trust since the late eighties,

482
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,089
a trust set up by David Lake.

483
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,827
Had the congressman giving 
Dobie a financial support?

484
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:42,159
But what is Dobie giving him?

485
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,617
You said you didn't know
Darren Clemen.

486
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:46,850
Or Vanessa Prosser.

487
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,996
We think you did though and 
now they're both dead.

488
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:49,990
Not cuz of me.

489
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,638
Cuz of something you know then?

490
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,875
You also lied 
about Congressman Lake.

491
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,758
Not only did you know him,

492
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,350
you lived in his house 
when he was a teenager.

493
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,927
I ain't talking about Lake.

494
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:01,407
Don't want them checks
to stop coming.

495
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,517
Someone's going away 
for this girl's murder.

496
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,836
Comes down to you or Lake,

497
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,530
who do you think gets
the benefit of the doubt?

498
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,599
The congressman or 
the ex-con?

499
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:15,147
Lake has resources, 
lawyers, status.

500
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,161
What have you got?

501
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,646
Self respect.

502
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:20,167
That's more than he can say.

503
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:28,561
You tell me I don't get rung up 
on some extortion rap.

504
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:32,166
And I tell you what you wanna know.

505
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,275
I think we can sell that to the D.A.

506
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,105
Clemen called me up.

507
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,327
Said he found my name 
in this girl's stuff.

508
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:42,907
How that happened, I don't know.

509
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,072
Okay.

510
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,682
Asked what I knew 
about her getting killed.

511
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,762
What'd you tell him?

512
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,052
Nothing to tell.

513
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,803
I didn't know she was dead.

514
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:57,238
I met her that one time.
That's all I knew of her.

515
00:24:57,238 --> 00:25:01,243
So Vanessa did visit you in '92.

516
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,260
I don't know how she found me.

517
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,394
She just showed up at my door, 
out of the blue.

518
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,243
Why does David Lake 
send you money?

519
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:11,988
David who, darling?

520
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,368
Look, I'm not looking for trouble. 
I just..

521
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:16,995
I just wanna know why.

522
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:25,427
I don't know 
what you're talking about.

523
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:29,986
He writes you checks. 
I've seen them.

524
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:33,148
Are you some kind of a reporter?

525
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,209
No.

526
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:36,559
I'm a friend.

527
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:43,461
You go home, little girl.

528
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:46,976
Buy yourself some shoes, 
take your mind off of things.

529
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,065
I don't know what you're doing,

530
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,712
but I know enough to call the police.

531
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:03,180
Why don't you just ask David?

532
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,615
I did.

533
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,826
He won't tell me anything.

534
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:16,084
You aren't just a friend of his, 
aren't you?

535
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:21,265
God, I almost feel bad for you.

536
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,958
Why did you feel bad for her?

537
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,257
She was in over her head.

538
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,520
See,

539
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,552
David and his sister Abbey,

540
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:42,030
they were more than friends, too.

541
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:49,850
Brother and sister.

542
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,574
Yeah.

543
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:54,313
Yeah.

544
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,282
Dobie caught them a few times 
while he was living with them.

545
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,254
He have proof?

546
00:26:58,254 --> 00:26:59,365
What, like pictures?

547
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,706
Yeah. / No, no pictures.

548
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:05,187
But David and Abbey were worried 
enough to be paying him off 
for past 20 years.

549
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:07,782
Man, I voted for this guy.

550
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,422
Dobie told Vanessa Prosser about it.

551
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:12,236
We think she went and 
confronted the happy couple.

552
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,574
And got killed for it.

553
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,493
And last week, Dobie called 
the congressman

554
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,705
to report that Darren Clemen 
was sniffing around.

555
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,183
Few hours later, Clemen ends up
with two in the head.

556
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:21,755
But Lake was in D.C. that day.

557
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:24,514
Dobie says Abbey took the call.

558
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,983
So you think Abbey did both jobs.

559
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,881
When it comes to her brother,

560
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,472
Abbey takes care of everything.

561
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,697
Dobie's got a sheet like a war 
and peace, Kite.

562
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:35,714
Maybe he can be compelled to testify.

563
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:38,647
Hearsay from a repeat felon 
won't buy you much.

564
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:39,907
You wanna get our murder?

565
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:41,834
You gotta get her to talk.

566
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:45,697
I didn't kill anyone.

567
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,214
What would give you 
an idea like that?

568
00:27:48,214 --> 00:27:49,587
Not what,

569
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:50,847
who.

570
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,330
Acquaintance of yours.
Kind of an in-law actually.

571
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,139
Marvin Dobie.

572
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,399
What rock did he crawl out
from under?

573
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,987
You should know.

574
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,149
You paid for it.

575
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,986
Hush money couldn't keep 
him quiet though.

576
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,757
Your own brother, Abbey?

577
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,318
My own brother what?

578
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:11,972
When it gets out David Lake took 
advantage of his sister

579
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:13,782
when they were teenagers.

580
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:14,510
That'll finish him.

581
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,649
Do you have any idea 
how that sounds?

582
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:18,324
I know how it's gonna read.

583
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:21,759
- National Enquirer, Star.
- The jit papers, too.

584
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,450
Now, they'll stop
the presses for this one.

585
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,784
That would be slander, 
we'd sue you.

586
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:30,122
By that time, everyone will know.

587
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,465
Canon, ring a bell?

588
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:35,798
That charming brother of 
yours won't have a career left.

589
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,144
Maybe that's what Abbey wants.

590
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:41,767
To have her favorite guy all to herself.

591
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,857
That's why you killed Vanessa, 
isn't it?

592
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,895
What do you say, Abbey?

593
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:51,753
We call up the gossip rags or 
you start spilling.

594
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:53,929
Okay.

595
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,695
I need assurances.

596
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,226
What kind?

597
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:10,650
You keep certain things
out of the press.

598
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,085
They'll come out at trial.

599
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,722
Not if I plead guilty.

600
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:22,477
David didn't take advantage of me,
I was older.

601
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,542
It was me.

602
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,736
And Vanessa found this out?

603
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,778
She should've minded her 
own business.

604
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,880
Adams Morgan.

605
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,799
How about Georgetown?

606
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:40,341
It'd be so great if we could work 
at the White House.

607
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:42,963
Assuming Clinton wins.

608
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,929
We could get an apartment together.

609
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:46,865
Dog?

610
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:48,313
Cat.

611
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:50,426
Both.

612
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:54,345
I wanna go to every museum 
on the mall.

613
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:56,837
It's easy train trip back to Philly.

614
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,833
It would be great, V.

615
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:17,772
Abbey. / Hi.

616
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:21,208
Sorry, it's late, I know.

617
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:23,592
How long have 
you been standing there?

618
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:25,119
What do you mean?

619
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,912
I just got here.

620
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,292
I need you to sign some checks.

621
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:33,568
6000, now?

622
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,687
That's his new number.

623
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:40,323
Forget it, we can't let him 
keep raising the amount.

624
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,366
You want a future in the public eye,

625
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:46,292
you pay him.

626
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,517
Then we get a girl curious.

627
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:08,608
If I'd been more successful 
at deflecting her,

628
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:12,365
I wouldn't have had to do 
what I did.

629
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,054
Which was?

630
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,599
I sent her down the stairs 
to the hotel parking garage,

631
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,811
then dumped her from the bridge.

632
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,654
All for David's brilliant career?

633
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:23,979
I owed him

634
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:27,078
for what I did 
when we were young.

635
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:31,613
And David agreed to sweep 
the sound of the rug?

636
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:32,842
He doesn't know anything.

637
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,292
What about Clemen?

638
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,987
Doesn't know about him either.

639
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:37,543
You admit to shooting him?

640
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:38,982
Two shots.

641
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,321
He was as close as 
you are right now.

642
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,744
That was your .38?

643
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,497
IT was a .25.

644
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,071
You can find it in my apartment.

645
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,529
Hey, we got a gun.

646
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:55,364
Ballistics will test fire and compare
but she looks good for it.

647
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:58,145
Well, that'll make the bosses happy.
Better her than the congressman.

648
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,048
You were getting 
nervous upstairs, huh?

649
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,058
Can I show you something?

650
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,158
He ain't wearing his glasses.

651
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,134
So? / So,

652
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,156
where'd they go?

653
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,131
I lose mine three times a day, 
Scotty.

654
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:24,377
You're not blind without them.
Lake said he had 2400 vision.

655
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,964
What's your theory?

656
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:28,535
Maybe lost them in a struggle.

657
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,997
Abbey's taking the fall.

658
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:34,207
In her twisted devotion to David, 
she figures better to let him go on

659
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:37,409
doing all his good, 
she'll sit in jail.

660
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,613
- That's a little thin.
- It makes sense.

661
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,020
Scotty, we got nothing on him.

662
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,912
- I know he did it.
- But we can't make the case.

663
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:48,199
Sooner or later, Scotty, 
one's gonna get by you.

664
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,664
Happens to us all.

665
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,730
I wanna go see Lake 
one more time.

666
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,570
I don't know who Darren Clemen is.

667
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,109
He's Vanessa's real father.

668
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,757
He was looking into her death.

669
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:09,020
Which means he was looking into you.

670
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,302
You think I killed Vanessa?

671
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:13,397
Leaning there.

672
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:16,070
Except, your sister says she did it.

673
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,415
She said that?

674
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:18,967
Made a deal.

675
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,830
Copped to both murders
in exchange,

676
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,538
we don't leak your dirty little secret.

677
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,887
I have to call Abbey.

678
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:30,318
Without your help, 
she's looking at life.

679
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:32,253
How can I help?

680
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:34,615
Tell us what happened to Vanessa.

681
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:36,116
I don't know.

682
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:39,358
You know.

683
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:52,995
Excuse me.

684
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:02,596
I don't have anything more to say.

685
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:09,527
He almost sweat in there.

686
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,881
You know that call Stillman 
didn't want to get from the brass?

687
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,167
He got it.

688
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,297
We have to leave Lake alone.

689
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:18,123
Commissioner's orders.

690
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:27,426
Hey.

691
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,888
Heard you went back 
at the congressman.

692
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:32,409
Yeah. Till the bosses shut us down.

693
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,859
Got a pretty good case against the sister.

694
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,540
Yeah, it must be nice having 
a different set of rules.

695
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:42,934
Saw you with that new A.D.A.

696
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:44,606
Julie? / Yeah.

697
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,823
Julie.

698
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,742
Actually, I'm on my way to meet her now.

699
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:52,278
Have fun.

700
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:53,321
Rush,

701
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:55,202
Rush.

702
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:59,499
I'll cut her loose right now 
if it's just you and me,

703
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:02,299
but I haven't heard that from you.

704
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:07,055
- So until you've decided that...
- Okay, okay.

705
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,018
Okay what?

706
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:12,225
Just you and me.

707
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:31,884
Then, I'll go meet her right now.

708
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:36,476
Be polite for now and tell her 
that I'm otherwise engaged.

709
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:37,599
Okay.

710
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,541
Okay.

711
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:01,982
Congressman.

712
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:04,117
You're not allowed to be here.

713
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:05,556
Off duty.

714
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,465
Just two guys talking.

715
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,130
I don't think so.

716
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,728
Your life's pretty important, huh?

717
00:36:14,494 --> 00:36:16,624
Everyone's life is important.

718
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:18,504
Not Vanessa's apparently.

719
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,409
Or Abbey's.

720
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:23,270
What kind of man 
lets his sister take his bullet?

721
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,964
You don't know about Abbey and me.

722
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:27,247
I know more than I want to know.

723
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:30,284
We had a hard upbringing.

724
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:31,630
Yeah, humble beginnings.

725
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,245
It was a lot worse than humble.

726
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:38,261
It made us very close.

727
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,975
I can't make you understand.

728
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,829
I don't need to understand that.

729
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,827
I just want the truth about Vanessa,
how she died.

730
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,966
You got a law degree, right.
You know about Miranda.

731
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:56,003
Yeah. / Well, I haven't Mirandized you,
so anything you tell me right now,

732
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:59,030
I can't use it in court.
You're protected.

733
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:02,387
And we can have a conversation.

734
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,660
About what? / The truth.

735
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,600
Why would you wanna 
know something

736
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,816
you could do nothing about?

737
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:13,701
That's for me to know.

738
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:20,895
What you need to know is 
I ain't leaving till you tell me.

739
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:34,192
I thought that she had left the party.

740
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:37,305
I never expected to see her again.

741
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:40,742
Vanessa,

742
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:44,633
what are you doing here?

743
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:47,455
I went to Redding this weekend.

744
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:50,091
I met Marvin Dobie.

745
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:54,094
Why would you do that?

746
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:58,750
I just wanted to know 
what was coming between us.

747
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,298
What did he say?

748
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:03,239
It doesn't matter.

749
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,526
What did he say?

750
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,321
He told me.

751
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:12,716
About you and Abbey.

752
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,094
It's all right.

753
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:22,382
Vanessa, we can't.

754
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,092
I can't.

755
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:25,105
We can.

756
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:27,164
We can be together.

757
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:31,067
You just have to look forward 
and not back.

758
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,703
I love you.

759
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:40,722
I can't.

760
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,876
V.

761
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,964
Oh god, Vanessa.

762
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:09,369
Abbey.

763
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:13,900
Abbey, I screwed up.

764
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:30,097
# Came in from a rainy Thursday 
on the avenue #

765
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:35,860
# Thought I heard you talking softly. #

766
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:43,644
# I turned on the lights, 
the tv and the radio #

767
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:49,675
# Still I can’t escape the ghost of you #

768
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:54,788
# What has happened to it all? #

769
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:57,501
# Crazy, some’d say, #

770
00:40:58,228 --> 00:41:04,064
# Where is the life that I recognize? #

771
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:05,974
# Gone away... #

772
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:09,384
# But I won’t cry for yesterday, #

773
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,974
# there’s an ordinary world, #

774
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:17,364
# Somehow I have to find. #

775
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:26,676
# And as I try to make my way, 
to the ordinary world... #

776
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,638
# I will learn to survive. #

777
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:45,686
# Passion or coincidence once 
prompted you to say #

778
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:50,763
# Pride will tear us both apart #

779
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:59,642
# Well now pride’s gone out the window 
cross the rooftops, run away, #

780
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:05,473
# Left me in the vacuum of my heart. #

781
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,092
# What is happening to me? #

782
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,185
# Crazy, some’d say, #

783
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:19,597
# Where is my friend when I need you most? #

784
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,317
# Gone away... #

785
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:28,303
# But I won’t cry for yesterday, 
there’s an ordinary world, #

786
00:42:28,414 --> 00:42:32,841
# Somehow I have to find. #
