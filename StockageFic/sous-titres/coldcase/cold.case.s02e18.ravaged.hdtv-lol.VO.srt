 February 2, 1995

4
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:18,579
- What are you gonna eat, mommy?
- Mommy already had lunch.

5
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:20,675
No cheese, right?

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,372
- Can we go ice skating after?
- No.

7
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:27,024
- Hot.
- Let it cool, baby.

8
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:30,887
- Can we?
- No, Hailey.

9
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:37,217
- What's wrong?
- They make these so hard to open.

10
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,061
Why can't we go ice skating?

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,286
You don't wanna be like those
awful girls, Nancy and Tonya, do you?

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,577
No, I wanna be like you.

13
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,852
- No.
- It's ketchup, Ryan.

14
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:51,882
He doesn't like ketchup.
He likes mayonnaise.

15
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:59,272
- He took his lid off.
- Share your drink with him, Hailey.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,044
- Mom..
- I don't wanna hear it.

17
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,355
Daddy says you're a good
ice skater.

18
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,773
Why don't you ever want
to ski with us?

19
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,955
Finish your food.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

20
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:16,049
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:24,738
Did you take my tasty cakes?

22
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,957
No.

23
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:30,283
Man, I'd never do.

24
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,647
I've seen you.

25
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:37,464
There's strudel.
Eat that.

26
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:02,609
- Can I help you?
- This is where the detectives are?

27
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,067
- From Homicide.
- I'm looking for Nick Vera.

28
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,105
He should be here.

29
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,467
I knew him in high school.

30
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,337
He might be in court.
You wanna leave a note?

31
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,949
- Maybe I could talk to you.
- Is it about a murder?

32
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,056
My sister.

33
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,200
10 years ago.

34
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,764
- What was her name?
- Sloane Easton.

35
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,487
She was found in the parking lot
of the bar where she worked.

36
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,258
How'd she die?

37
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:32,897
Cops said she passed out,
died of exposure.

38
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:35,241
Was she drunk at the time?

39
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,091
She was always drunk.

40
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,934
- Okay.
- We figured ...

41
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:46,953
she just slipped and fell,
the whole thing was an accident.

42
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,123
But you think differently now?

43
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,727
I met this guy Evan last night.

44
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,823
Said he knew Sloane.

45
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,971
- From where?
- The bar.

46
00:03:55,971 --> 00:04:01,897
He was a student at the time.
He was there, the night she died.

47
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,630
Is he something significant?

48
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,736
Sloane was drinking 
with some college guys and

49
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,844
things may have
gotten out of hand.

50
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:14,053
- He know these guys?
- They were his fraternity brothers.

51
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,229
I should talk to Evan.

52
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:19,039
He staying the Delaware.

53
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,043
Gave me his number.

54
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,429
Who's this girl?

55
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,400
Megan Easton.

56
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,900
Yeah?

57
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:38,027
We went to immaculatta together.

58
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:42,725
- She wearing a wedding ring?
- I don't have my binoculars.

59
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,471
Yeah.

60
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,200
What'd you do to her?
You gotta hide from her like a kid.

61
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,798
I was in love with her.

74
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,284
Sloane Easton, 32.

75
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:33,013
Homeless guy found her in 
the parking lot of Sansom's Tavern.

76
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:38,574
Her autopsy shows an injury to 
the head. Alcohol content was .24.

77
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:39,836
That's pretty toasted.

78
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:44,247
So, they figure she's stumbling drunk,
falls on her face, and stays there.

79
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:47,841
Temperature was 
16 degrees at night.

80
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:51,569
- Cold was the ultimate doer.
- Maybe the frat guys gave the assist.

81
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,992
This girl was the goods i high school.

82
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:56,296
Homecoming queen, all that.

83
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:58,298
You can tell she was pretty.

84
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:01,130
We found blood on her coat,
never ran it.

85
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,213
Let's run it now.

86
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,426
Anything on family.

87
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:09,278
Separated from her husband Seth,
he was in New Jersey that night.

88
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,323
- Two little kids.
- I'll start with Evan.

89
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,378
See if he knows how Sloane
got knocked in her head.

90
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:16,276
You know the sister, eh, Nicky?

91
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,213
Megan.
We haven't been in touch.

92
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:21,324
- She asked for you.
- I don't wanna see her.

93
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,450
Kinda gone to the dog ears.

94
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,518
You got a full head of hair, Nick.

95
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,378
I'll follow this up.

96
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,652
- I'm glad to help, honestly.
- Good.

97
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,413
But I'm gonna rush to get
back to Washington.

98
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,265
Well, then we'll be quick.

99
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:47,313
What do you know about Sloane Easton
ending up dead outside of that bar?

100
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:48,780
Nothing, really.

101
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,157
Then why were you talking 
about it last night?

102
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,907
That is your writing, isn't it?

103
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:56,887
But, I don't really know 
what happened.

104
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:59,128
Tell us what you do know.

105
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:05,975
All I remember is she was pretty and 
drunk and hanging out with Gareth Caine.

106
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,623
That was a bad combination.

107
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,866
Who's Gareth?

108
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,802
President of our fraternity.

109
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:13,344
He kind of became known as
the guy to stay away from.

110
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:15,332
- Why's that?
- He was rough..

111
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,266
..with women.

112
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,489
You see him get rough 
with Sloane that night?

113
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:21,205
I spent four years with these guys.

114
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,069
I knew what the lead-up looked like.

115
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,897
Pitcher of Rolling rock.

116
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,039
Nice hat.

117
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,993
- Thanks.
- You a suffragette?

118
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,437
Yeah, I'm gonna 
go vote right after this.

119
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:37,468
I'm Gareth.

120
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,592
Who are you?

121
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:44,948
- I'm just here to drink.
- Well, let me buy you one.

122
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,249
I'm only here for a minute.

123
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,223
- How you doing, Sloane?
- Oh, lordy.

124
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,293
- How many you had?
- I don't wanna see you.

125
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,646
You need me to drive you home?

126
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:58,230
Hey, are you getting that drink?

127
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,076
Yeah.

128
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,685
Rick, make it a night and
get the hell out of here, okay?

129
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,704
D'you wanna sit with us?

130
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,168
Yeah.

131
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,815
For you.

132
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:13,423
- I have your number.
- I'm not scared of a 3 a.m. phone call.

133
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:17,876
So, it's Sloane, huh?

134
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,703
- Yeah.
- Do you like the beach, Sloane?

135
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,839
I knew where things were headed.

136
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,177
I told Gareth I had to go study.

137
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,745
That's all I saw.

138
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:32,162
You guys ever 
see this Rick before?

139
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,176
Nah. / Was this town-and-gown
thing with Gareth?

140
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:38,570
Rich college boy slumming
with some local tail?

141
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,336
It was a ZKE thing.

142
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,624
Beach night.

143
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,335
What's that?

144
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,595
We had a room called a beach.

145
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:47,630
Our guys could bring a girl,

146
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,617
do it with her while a bunch of
other guys watched.

147
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:51,037
Unbeknownst to her.

148
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,435
- 'Course.
- Sounds like a riot.

149
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:55,654
We were jerks.

150
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,755
So, you guys were looking 
for someone to beach.

151
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,974
And it looked like Gareth had
chosen this girl.

152
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,724
You can't hold a guy responsible for 
something that happened 10 years ago.

153
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,712
Actually, you can.

154
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,070
We do it all the time.

155
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,591
Guys, it was a fraternity thing.

156
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,210
Beach night.

157
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:22,976
How'd you know about that?

158
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,667
We picked stuff up.

159
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,704
So, maybe we thought this girl
was up for a walk on the wild side.

160
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,965
There's no crime there.

161
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,852
So, you ply her with drinks,

162
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:33,275
talk nice to her, and invited her
back to the house?

163
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:36,015
- Some version of that.
- But, she never makes it.

164
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,442
Maybe tries to resist you
in the parking lot.

165
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,899
You rough her up a little
and leave her in the snow.

166
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,326
Cuz you get rough with women,
what we hear.

167
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,712
No.

168
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,557
We didn't close the deal.

169
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:48,998
- Sarajevo.
- Lillehammer.

170
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:51,780
- Lake Placid.
- It wasn't an Olympic city.

171
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,095
- 1980.
- No.

172
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:54,860
- Yes.
- She's right, Gareth.

173
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,990
No.

174
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,275
- Drink.
- I almost went there as a skater.

175
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,804
Sure you did.

176
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:02,783
Me, too.

177
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,237
Well, it's been real, guys.

178
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:10,807
Why don't you go back to
the house with us?

179
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,383
No, I gotta be some place.

180
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:13,888
Hey, we got a keg at the house.

181
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:16,023
- Sorry.
- Come on.

182
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,603
Hey, save it for the tri-delts.

183
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,150
- Hey, let's go back here.
- I said I gotta go.

184
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,321
I'm sick of college girls.

185
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,356
Don't touch me.

186
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,519
Get off me.

187
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,949
Philly PD.

188
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:34,117
- Back to campus, boys.
- We're just having some fun, officer.

189
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,796
Walk out of here.

190
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,776
Now.

191
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:42,410
This cop just showed up
out of the blue, broke it up?

192
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,559
And we left.
That's it.

193
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,759
You know Sloane ended up
dead  that night?

194
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,966
Vaugely remember hearing that.

195
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,512
She was just a lush from West Philly.

196
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,431
Who cares?

197
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:58,069
Hey, how'd a beach 
night work out for ya?

198
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:01,402
Not allowed to say, amigo.

199
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:11,690
Lab found two types blood
on Sloane's coat.

200
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,086
One's hers and 
one's unidentified.

201
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,516
Maybe the doer's.

202
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:18,413
well, good luck getting that
jackass Gareth to give blood.

203
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:19,830
I'll call the M.E.

204
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,025
Got a rush job going.

205
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:25,419
We know who this guy at the bar was, 
who offered to drive her home?

206
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,111
- Someone name's Rick.
- Sister might know him.

207
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,923
Why don't you ask her, Nicky?

208
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,326
- Can't someone else?
- No.

209
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:36,997
Julie Owens from South.
Our mystery cop at the tavern that night.

210
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,259
How you doing?

211
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,016
You worked West in '95, Julie?

212
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,905
Narcotics.
I knew your victim Sloane.

213
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:44,108
Just happened to be at Sansom's
when she got in trouble?

214
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:46,056
No. I was there to see her.

215
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:50,663
How come? / Sloane got a DUI in '94, 
drove a car into a newsstand on Broad.

216
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:53,597
Wanted off her record.
Guess what, we made a deal.

217
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:54,837
What kind of deal?

218
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:57,340
Owner Sansom's was slinging
out of that place.

219
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,616
She had a front row seat
to the action.

220
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,545
- So she was working for you.
- She was my CI.

221
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,247
Nicky.

222
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,250
Hi.

223
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,086
Long time.

224
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,491
No kiddin'.

225
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,446
You never come to the reunions.

226
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,953
I'm pretty busy.

227
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:33,659
You look good.
I'm on a diet.

228
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:36,454
I'm sorry about Sloane.

229
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:39,411
Yeah, it was bad.

230
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,823
We found some things out.

231
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:47,884
Did you know she got a DUI?

232
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,016
- The newsstand thing?
- Yeah.

233
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:52,127
That's why her husband finally left her.

234
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:54,012
Kids were in the car.

235
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:56,339
- Rough.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,238
She was always a party girl.

237
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,292
She started working for the cops.

238
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,738
Informing on her boss.

239
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,667
I didn't know that.

240
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,963
But I guess there was a lot
I didn't know by the end.

241
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:10,910
Any idea if she had 
a boyfriend or anything?

242
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,517
I don't think so, why?

243
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,729
There was someone there 
that night. Rick.

244
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:18,099
Oh, Rick wasn't her boyfriend.
He was her sponsor.

245
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,761
Do you know where we can
find him?

246
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah.

247
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,298
Oh, good.

248
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,562
You look exactly the same.

249
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,379
Oh, yeah?

250
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:35,537
You think I'd pass 
for a high school girl?

251
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,971
To me, you will.

252
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,591
I came here every week,
gave my card.

253
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,645
Every week, she tossed it.

254
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:54,612
This is where she was found.
By that dumpster.

255
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,552
Crummy place to come to your end.

256
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,993
Bar's the last place 
she should've been working.

257
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,343
Go talk to the owner.

258
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,451
Did Sloane seem upset about
anything that night?

259
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:07,846
Scared? / She seemed just like 
the stubborn drunk she was.

260
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,831
- You call her that to her face?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:13,708
I thought I'd get through one day.
I really thought I could save her.

262
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:18,635
- Well, people have to save themselves.
- Sounds like you've been in the program.

263
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,481
Well, we run into it a lot.

264
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,351
You know, cops.

265
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,426
Stressful job.

266
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:28,789
What do you know about 
this bar owner, Powell?

267
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:32,469
I know he hired an acoholic
to serve drinks. That's pretty shady.

268
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,660
Did Sloane ever make a real
effort to kick the booze?

269
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,807
No.
Just came to one meeting.

270
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,013
But you were 
pretty persistent with her.

271
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,682
Helping other people keeps me sober.

272
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,462
Okay, Rick.

273
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,901
I noticed you didn't answer
my question.

274
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:51,282
About the program.

275
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,150
If you ever wanna talk,

276
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,243
I'm not scared of 
a 3 a.m. phone call.

277
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,103
Something happen 
in the neighborhood?

278
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:03,113
Something happened here,
ten years back.

279
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,553
Sloane Easton.

280
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,127
That was a sorry case.

281
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,197
Worked for you, right?

282
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,948
Drank more than she poured.

283
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,739
Was she doing any of the drugs
you were dealing?

284
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,484
That's ancinet history.

285
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,491
Sloane worked for the cops, too.

286
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,567
Informing on you and 
your side business.

287
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,029
You saying she 
was snitching on me?

288
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,566
Which gives motive to hurt her.

289
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,634
Then, she ends up dead
in your parking lot.

290
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,001
Lousy drunk.

291
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,738
Maybe you found 
out she was a CI.

292
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:33,563
If I had, I woulda hurt her.

293
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,449
You two get into a lot of disputes?

294
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,845
She was a pain in the ass,
but I never touched her.

295
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:39,650
So who did have it out for her?

296
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,579
That night, her ex.

297
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,306
- Seth?
- Yeah.

298
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:47,203
I can't say that I blame him
after what she did.

299
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:56,137
Come on, don't do that.

300
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,866
You want another, just ask.

301
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:03,288
- He's real hungry, Powell.
- I need him that way.

302
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,050
Come on.

303
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,659
- Damn it, Sloane.
- Seth?

304
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,403
- You know where the kids are?
- Don't you have them?

305
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,123
No, Sloane, you had them.

306
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,522
You left them at Rodeo Rocks.

307
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,182
- Just for 15 minutes.
- 5 hours.

308
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,741
I just needed one drink.
I lost track of time.

309
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:29,056
- You're unbelievable.
- Where are they?

310
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,535
Don't pretend you care.

311
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:31,671
I wanna see them.
Are they outside?

312
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,626
- Forget it.
- They're my kids.

313
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,753
- And you're never seeing them again.
- You can't do this.

314
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:39,427
Sloane, stay away from us.

315
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:47,751
Seth was supposed to be 
in New Jersey that night.

316
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,493
No, he was right here.

317
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,995
Pretty heated up, huh?

318
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:52,539
Wouldn't you be?

319
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,140
Girl was a disaster.

320
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,670
You willing to give up 
some blood, Powell?

321
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,471
- What for?
- Eliminate you from the suspect pool.

322
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,421
No way, you ain't 
pitching me for this.

323
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,424
Well, saying no 
looks pretty suspicious.

324
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,475
So suspect me.

325
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,549
It says here you were at the shore
the night Sloane died.

326
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,759
- That a mistake, Seth?
- No.

327
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,707
That the truth?

328
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:19,882
- Yeah. 
- We have witness who says otherwise.

329
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:22,001
Says you were 
at Sansom's in fact.

330
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,204
Giving Sloane hell for leaving 
the kids down the street.

331
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:27,670
- Who said that?
- It's not important.

332
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:33,102
We had a bad fight 
when I was there.

333
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,760
So we hear.

334
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,174
I even put my hands on her.

335
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,690
And the next day, she's dead.
I know how that looks.

336
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,726
So you were in Philly.

337
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:46,209
At Sansom's.

338
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:49,828
I went to Jersey later with
my girlfriend Rose.

339
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,782
It doesn't matter anyway.

340
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,292
She died of her own drunkeness.

341
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,270
We think someone 
helped her along.

342
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,636
Well, how do you mean?

343
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,917
Someone tangled with her that night,
smacked her in the head.

344
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,664
She followed you up 
to the parking lot.

345
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,331
Maybe you got into it out there.

346
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,094
- No.
- You were pretty mad, Seth.

347
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,119
Furious.

348
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:16,871
But out in theparking lot,
everything changed.

349
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,980
- Wait, I gotta see them.
- Stay away.

350
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,880
Just to say I'm sorry.

351
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,468
You want them to see you like this?

352
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,898
Seth, your kids are cold.

353
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:32,238
- Look, one minute, Rose.
- Mommy.

354
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:36,897
- Hailey, baby, I'm sorry.
- Just close the window, I'm coming.

355
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,783
You know I love them, Seth. You know 
how I cried when they were born.

356
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,459
I cried.

357
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,471
Cuz now I had even more of you.

358
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,244
Oh, Sloane.

359
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:03,459
How did happen to us?

360
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,877
- It's my fault.
- Why can't I help you?

361
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,462
- Come on, Seth.
- Should I been harder on you?

362
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:10,918
Easier?

363
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,105
It wouldn't have mattered, baby.

364
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,696
It wouldn't be different.

365
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,108
That's what we learned 
the second time and the third time.

366
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:19,500
Why not?

367
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,717
Cuz I can't beat it.

368
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:27,188
You haven't called me baby
in forever.

369
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,978
Go with Rose.

370
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:38,439
Make a life with her.

371
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,057
She wasn't much at the end.

372
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,115
But there were moments

373
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:03,372
we could still connect.

374
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,601
- And in her good years...
- I know.

375
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:11,033
I knew her before you did.

376
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:13,356
Immaculatta High.

377
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:15,806
Wasn't she something?

378
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:19,215
Everyone's all American.

379
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:22,978
How could booze kill all that?

380
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:36,709
- Valens.
- Where you goin, Franny?

381
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,719
I got lab results for your boss.

382
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,680
Well, you can give them to me.
I'm reliable.

383
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,604
I've been meaning to say..

384
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:47,068
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

385
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:48,617
Thanks.

386
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,952
That's a tough illness.
Can get to be too much.

387
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,437
We don't know exactly 
what happened.

388
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,674
- Sorry I heard...
- A suicide?

389
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,862
No, no, we don't know that.

390
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,861
Well, I shouldn't 
speak out of school, then.

391
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:03,129
But, thanks.

392
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:06,836
So, the blood on your victim's coat,
weird result.

393
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,530
- Like what?
- Like out of my jurisdiction.

394
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,266
The predominant stains are her blood, 
but the other spots are canine.

395
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,433
How's a woman at a bar 
get dog blood on her?

396
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,577
Owner Sansom's had a rotweiler.

397
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:26,542
Her husband's girlfriend Rose
had a dobermann.

398
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,439
So two dogs to follow up.

399
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,335
The bar owner 
refused the DNA test.

400
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:35,020
And the liquor board has five 
open investigations on him.

401
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:39,342
So this Rose was 
at the scene earlier?

402
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,386
She was in the car when Seth
and Sloane went down memory lane.

403
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,947
Maybe overheard something,
could give her motive.

404
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:47,934
Lil's chatting with her.
Woman to woman.

405
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:50,632
Nicky, how did it go with Megan?

406
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,504
Fine.

407
00:21:56,367 --> 00:22:00,407
We're going to this place tonight.

408
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,690
Hangout from high school.

409
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,211
Shut up.

410
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,481
I thought Sloane's death was
an accident.

411
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:16,844
Well, that was one theory.

412
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:18,585
I don't know how I can help you.

413
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,515
You were there that night,
with your vicious dog.

414
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,696
Tuck wasn't vicious.

415
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,989
Well, you saw the way 
she and Seth were talking,

416
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:28,752
how she touched him.

417
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:31,972
- They had history.
- Rose, there was dog blood on her coat.

418
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:33,929
You were angry a
nd you had a dog.

419
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,349
I wasn't angry. / You were with a guy 
who wanted to be with someone else.

420
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:41,161
That's something you sense.

421
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,807
You'd think after Sloane,
you'd run to someone like me.

422
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:48,287
Responsible, steady.

423
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:53,050
But Sloane had his heart.

424
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,380
Hurts.

425
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,640
Let's talk about the dog blood.

426
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,260
Do you know how it got there?

427
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:03,013
Yeah.

428
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:05,344
But it wasn't from Tuck.

429
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:15,092
You're gonna be okay.

430
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:18,800
You just need a little help.

431
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,064
- Out of the way, Sloane.
- No, Powell.

432
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,175
One good crack and it's open.
No big deal.

433
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,938
- Give him another chance.
- Just cost me 400 bucks.

434
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,691
Can't fight worth crap.

435
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,422
I'll take him.
I'll fix him.

436
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:33,363
Oh, yeah.
You'll take great of him.

437
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:35,984
Then leave him at Rodeo Rocks.

438
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:39,383
- Move.
- No.

439
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,265
I'll tell the cops.

440
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,589
Yeah, you'll tell the cops what?

441
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,804
About the dog fights and the bets.
I'll get this place shut down.

442
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:48,629
- Stop running your stupid mouth.
- I will.

443
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:57,152
You want the mutt?
Take him.

444
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,403
- I'll make him better.
- I don't care.

445
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,077
Just get the hell off of my property.

446
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:03,981
- I work here.
- Not anymore.

447
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,698
Get lost.
For good.

448
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,513
Or you'll get cracked.

449
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:14,728
It's okay, baby.
You'll make it.

450
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,708
She looked crazy, 
that blood all over her.

451
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,884
I just left.

452
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:30,471
So you went back but never
even talked to her?

453
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:34,197
What could I say?
Make him stop loving you?

454
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,082
That wasn't possible.

455
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,717
Dog wouldn't work the Alpo,
I fed him.

456
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:51,486
Well, Sloane thought so.

457
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,632
Then, they're both good for nothing.

458
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:55,448
Losers unite.

459
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,789
Hit ya?

460
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,546
Look, pal.

461
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:03,810
You were swinging a bar around that night, 
Sloane ends up trauma to her head.

462
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,980
- You get my meaning?
- All I did to her was fire her ass.

463
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,777
That's all?

464
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:12,365
- That's all.
- She didn't come back.

465
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,652
Yeah, she came back.

466
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:18,735
Well, what for?

467
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:21,182
To get her job back.
Begged me.

468
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:23,481
She persuade you?

469
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:27,714
- Kind of.
- What's kind of, Powell?

470
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,241
Not saying I'm proud of it.
I'm just saying it happened.

471
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,612
I told you to beat it.

472
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:51,978
- Ravage's cold.
- Your problem now.

473
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:01,836
Bourbon, please.

474
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:03,602
Forget it.

475
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:07,036
- I'll work a week for free.
- You don't work here anymore.

476
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:09,633
Powell.

477
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:14,993
I need this job. / There's 100 
watering holes in West Phily.

478
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:16,290
Pick one.

479
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,452
I have to work here.

480
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:25,524
It's a bad life, Sloane.
For the birds.

481
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:28,744
I'll work here for free.
I'll scrub the floors.

482
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:30,848
- I just need one...
- No.

483
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:38,238
Powell.

484
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:44,263
I'll do anything.

485
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:47,500
I mean it.

486
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:56,478
Got on her knees for you?

487
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:59,419
Not my finest moment.

488
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:02,436
But she got to keep her job.

489
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:05,666
Middle of it, in walks Richy Rich.

490
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,350
Who's that?

491
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,825
College boy from early in the night.

492
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,920
Are we talking about Gareth?

493
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:16,643
When it's over, I look up,
he's standing there.

494
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,988
Think he was 
watching the whole time.

495
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:21,803
- Why did he come back?
- Buy drugs.

496
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:24,311
I sold to him, then left.

497
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:28,084
- Then where's Sloane?
- Back room, locking up.

498
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:33,891
So last you saw, 
Gareth and her were alone again.

499
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,830
How could they close 
Anna's Kitchen?

500
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,987
Cuz that's not where 
it's happeneing anymore.

501
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,527
Well, cheers anyway.

502
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:58,727
The years have been 
good to you, Meggy.

503
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,408
Right,

504
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:03,575
I guess I already told you that.

505
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,543
I've been okay.

506
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:08,984
What's your husband like?

507
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:12,289
Nice, works hard.

508
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,692
Good.

509
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,256
But, um..

510
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,127
I don't know.

511
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:24,617
We ran out of conversation.

512
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:31,201
We haven't been 
doing so hot either.

513
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,294
- Me and Julie.
- How come?

514
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,662
We wanted a baby.

515
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,679
For a lot of years, but no go.

516
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,240
- You talked to doctors?
- Yeah, we tried all the stuff.

517
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,405
Yeah.

518
00:28:56,405 --> 00:29:01,954
And somewhere along the line,
it killed off the love.

519
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:07,068
I think about you sometimes.

520
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:09,820
That summer.

521
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,842
Me, too.

522
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,767
What things would be like now.

523
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:28,058
We'd have a 19 year old, that's what.

524
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:36,368
What if we would've made it.

525
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:40,773
Oh, Megs.

526
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:46,133
It should've been you and me.

527
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,245
So Gareth likes to watch.

528
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:59,935
Got your beach night 
after all, amigo.

529
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:02,354
- What are you talking about?
- You.

530
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:05,345
Peeping while the bartender
got serviced.

531
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,068
- Pretty homoerotic if you ask me.
- I didn't ask you.

532
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:10,428
You went back, Gareth.
Late night.

533
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:13,125
Found Sloane all by herself.
Few hours later, she's dead.

534
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,904
I went to buy pot.

535
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:18,905
- That's it.
- Yeah, I don't think so, Gareth.

536
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:21,852
At Happy Hour, 
you get thrown off by this girl.

537
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,888
So you went back to campus,
shake it off.

538
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,012
But on 3 a.m., parties are over
and you didn't hook up.

539
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,314
So where are you gonna get some?

540
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,315
Then you remembered 
the trash from the bar.

541
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:34,798
Figure, let me go buy some weed,
bang the skank, call it a night.

542
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,563
- I didn't kill her.
- You did something.

543
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:40,334
Penn student health records.

544
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:44,005
Day after Sloane died, you went in
with an ugly gash on your arm.

545
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:46,065
- Is that against the law?
- Did she fight back?

546
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:48,010
She bite you?

547
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,254
Hey, listen up, Gareth.
You are the last to see.

548
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:55,230
A cop saw you handling this girl
earlier, everything's pointing at you.

549
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:00,256
I went to use the head.

550
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,864
I come out,

551
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:05,579
she's yacking on the phone.

552
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,871
I did a bad thing.

553
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:11,637
Worst I ever did and I can't..

554
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,762
I can't have this anymore.

555
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:18,317
Yes, please.

556
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:20,036
Okay, bye.

557
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:24,092
- What do you want?
- I'll take what Powell had.

558
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,422
We're closed, okay?

559
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,279
It's private party?

560
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,630
Someone's coming for me.
So don't try your crap.

561
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,515
What crap is that?

562
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,685
Whoa, killer.

563
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,059
- That is one ugly dog.
- He's mine.

564
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:41,046
- His name's Ravage.
- That's approriate.

565
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:44,215
He got hurt, 
but he's gonna get better.

566
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:46,002
Let's finish what we started..

567
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:47,449
Stop. Stop.

568
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,909
Get off.
I mean it.

569
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,218
Get off.

570
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,107
What the...
Call him off.

571
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:56,868
Oh, my god.

572
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:59,031
Call him off.
Stop him.

573
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,542
Keep going, Ravage.
Attack his ass.

574
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,848
- Damn it.
- Run away.

575
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:09,512
Run away, little college punk.

576
00:32:12,854 --> 00:32:15,387
Psycho dog chased me 3 blocks.

577
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:17,968
- Jumped you on pretty good.
- Lucky I didn't get freakin' rabies.

578
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:20,358
Sloane said someone 
was coming for her?

579
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,561
Probably lying.

580
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:23,328
Unless it was 
the person on the phone.

581
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,601
Who was she talking to?
That time of night.

582
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:31,754
Someone who wasn't scared of
a 3 a.m. phone call.

583
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:42,065
I could've called.

584
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:44,375
I didn't mind coming in.

585
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:45,814
Can I get you anything? Water?

586
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,314
No.

587
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:50,244
Just tell me what's going on.

588
00:32:55,442 --> 00:33:01,277
Sloane had fallen real...
low that night, ran into trouble.

589
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:03,319
What did she do..

590
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,337
that was so low?

591
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:07,921
You don't need to know that.

592
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:17,708
I used to look up to her so much.

593
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,558
You just think of her that way.

594
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:22,863
Skating, winning.

595
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,180
Yeah.

596
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,366
We should remember people
at their best, not how they ended up.

597
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:32,279
Yeah.

598
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,887
So what if we had lunch?

599
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:51,042
I couldn't do that, Meggy.

600
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:55,008
Not with you.

601
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:03,014
I'm just sad so much.

602
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:10,709
Last night I wasn't.

603
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:14,422
Me, too.

604
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,924
Detective.

605
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:15,867
Lilly.

606
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:18,892
You okay?

607
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:24,336
I've been staring at the little swirls
in this scotch for about an hour.

608
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:27,669
I've been there.

609
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:31,647
- I haven't had a drink in 8 years.
- Don't start now.

610
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,039
And I never forgot how good
it feels knocking one of these back.

611
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:40,718
It turns bad real quick.

612
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,481
Thanks for coming so late.

613
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,162
We get into trouble.
All time's at night.

614
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,173
I was wondering about that.

615
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:04,840
There was a pull 
right when we met.

616
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:08,386
Yeah.

617
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:10,219
It was a bad place.

618
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,198
Let's go.

619
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:14,809
- I'm not sure we should.
- I am.

620
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,524
Isn't it against the rules?

621
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,494
Don't worry, Lilly.

622
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:22,388
Oh, so that's 
how it works, huh?

623
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:23,384
What?

624
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:28,673
When the girl calls you in the
middle of the night, weak, needy.

625
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,611
- That's when you score.
- That's not what's going on here.

626
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:35,754
I looked for you tonight 
at the meeting in your area.

627
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:38,739
Yeah? / They said you 
hadn't been there in years.

628
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,332
I go to a chapter near I work.

629
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:45,579
They said you're not welcome in any 
meeting cuz they don't trust you with women.

630
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,981
- Well, you're obviously getting hostile.
- Did Sloane get hostile?

631
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:53,000
- Call you out on your act?
- Sloane?

632
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,512
Well, she called you that night.

633
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:58,787
- No.
- Phone records, Rick.

634
00:36:58,787 --> 00:37:03,395
She asked for help. And a good 
sponsor always comes running.

635
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:06,042
- I tried to help her.
- Like you tried to help me?

636
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,866
Yeah.
And she was ungrateful, too.

637
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,563
Good reason to bash 
someone in the head.

638
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,501
I never talk to you.

639
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,997
Well, my boss and 
partner are right outside.

640
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:20,107
You wanna talk to them?

641
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:41,797
I didn't know she was gonna
lay there all night in the snow.

642
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:43,609
How could you?

643
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,376
I didn't mean for that to happen.

644
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,741
Ravage.

645
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:54,240
Ravage, come back.

646
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,992
Please, come back, boy.

647
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:59,235
You're my test.
You're my way back.

648
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,567
Please.

649
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,489
Please. Please.

650
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,065
- Sloane.
- Rick.

651
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,259
- I lost my dog.
- We're going home, come on.

652
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:08,430
- I gotta find him.
- It's cold out here, come on.

653
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,343
He's my test. And if I can take 
care of him and be good for him,

654
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:14,175
then I can do it 
for Seth and the babies.

655
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,083
- Okay, okay.
- Rick.

656
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,306
I did such a bad thing.

657
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:21,170
Booze does that to us. / I don't know 
how I'm gonna live with myself.

658
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,923
- Help's right here.
- I'm sleepy.

659
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:26,703
- Let's get you to bed, come on.
- No, I gotta find Ravage.

660
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:29,450
- I said it's freezing.
- He took care of me.

661
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,075
- Now, I gotta take care of him.
- So get in. Get in.

662
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:33,462
We'll drive around.
We'll call for him.

663
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:36,395
- Ravage, come back.
- Come on.

664
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:50,461
- Ravage.
- Oh, god.

665
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:58,785
- He needs a vet.
- Just leave it, Sloane.

666
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:00,419
Leave it?

667
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,086
Warm bath.

668
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,523
Babe, you're not gonna be
thinking about a dog.

669
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,675
Oh, god, you're sleazy.

670
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:09,807
Excuse me? / I'm so drunk I can't 
even see and you wanna screw me?

671
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,442
- I'm trying to help you.
- I just whored myself for a drink.

672
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:14,489
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm in the gutter.

673
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:17,152
And you still want a piece?

674
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:18,866
- You must be desperate.
- It's late

675
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:21,680
and it's freezing and
you're starting to piss me off.

676
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,571
- You're lower than me, Rick.
- I'm lower than you?

677
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,984
That is funny.
Because you are nothing.

678
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:31,167
And even I won't have you.

679
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:36,575
- Don't you talk to me like that.
- I gotta go sleep.

680
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:39,396
You go to hell, what do I care.

681
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:42,672
- Can someone help Ravage?
- Screw you, Sloane.

682
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:47,119
Screw you, you sloppy, 
stumbly drunk.

683
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,877
Sleep and it'll all be better.

684
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,495
It's all gonna be better.
