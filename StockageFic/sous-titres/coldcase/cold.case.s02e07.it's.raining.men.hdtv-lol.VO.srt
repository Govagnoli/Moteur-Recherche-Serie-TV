Joan Collins is not a man in drag.

3
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:13,181
- How do you know?
- You believe everything you hear.

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,462
I do not.

5
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:15,551
What don't you believe?

6
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:19,383
I don't believe pop rocks and 
coke makes your stomach explode.

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,866
I don't believe Rock Hudson 
has liver cancer.

8
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:23,043
Face it, honey.

9
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:24,455
You're gullible.

10
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:26,309
And a conspiracy nut.

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,312
Sticks and stones.

12
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,909
Who killed Kennedy?

13
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:37,971
Lyndon Johnson and Fidel Castro.

14
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,222
Oh, and Jimmy Collins.

15
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:43,028
He was the ringleader.

16
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,592
What?

17
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,494
- No, no, don't come here.
- Artie, I'm coming there.

18
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,001
What is it, honey?

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,327
I got it.

20
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:05,409
Detective Rush?

21
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,594
I'm Artie Russo, I called.

22
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,821
Have a seat.

23
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:11,625
Scotty,

24
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,518
Artie Russo.

25
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:18,312
I'm an AIDS survivor.

26
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,326
I was supposed to be dead
twenty years ago.

27
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:22,707
Lucky, huh?

28
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,753
I got into an early drug trial.

29
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:29,177
I was diagnosed in 1983,
given six months.

30
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,755
Instead my partner Jeff 
was dead in six months.

31
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:33,923
From AIDS?

32
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:37,158
Murdered in Rittenhouse Square.
Strangled.

33
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,368
Was there any suspects?

34
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,818
Yeah. Me.

35
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,220
What was the theory?

36
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,604
That I killed the love of my life
in a rage because he gave me AIDS.

37
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:46,868
Did he?

38
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,490
No one knows.
In '83, there was no test for it.

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,407
You found out you had it
by getting sick.

40
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,171
And Jeff never did?

41
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,879
No.

42
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,752
The strange thing is,

43
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:59,327
I accepted my death coming.

44
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,408
It was Jeff who was in a rage.

45
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:02,961
Over what?

46
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,875
The dying of the light,

47
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,300
as he put it.

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,492
He rage against anything 
besides the light?

49
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,412
The government, doctors, 
the gay community,

50
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:14,584
the newspapers, the president.

51
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,773
- It's a long list.
- And twenty years is a long time.

52
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,737
What brings you in now?

53
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:23,138
I'm getting married
to my partner of ten years.

54
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,910
But before I do,

55
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:31,235
I wanna put an end to 
any doubt that I loved Jeff.

56
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:34,457
You want us to reopen a cold job
for your wedding?

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
It'd be a nice gift.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,022
This ain't Pottery Barn.

59
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,045
The gift I want is justice.

60
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,903
We'll read the job again. Maybe

61
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,965
we'll beat the odds.

62
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,591
Like you did.

63
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:50,260
Thank you.

00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,924
About AIDS?

69
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,565
I guess high school.

70
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,299
I got the talk from 
a nun at Saint Francis.

71
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,882
That's something 
you don't forget.

72
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,306
Here it is.

73
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,068
Kern, Jeffrey.

74
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,735
When Brother Donely died of it,

75
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:43,198
it really hit home.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,108
Jeff was 25 in 1983.

77
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,867
Unlucky timing for gay men.

78
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,896
No warning what was out there.

79
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:52,852
Take it upstairs.

80
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:00,193
They put the rock, strangled.

81
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,894
From the front, bare hands.

82
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,249
Sounds personal.

83
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,491
No robbery, either.

84
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:06,380
Lab didn't get 
much blood to test.

85
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,228
Maybe they were 
scared to collect it.

86
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:09,990
The guys on the scene 
knew he was gay?

87
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,419
Earring in his right ear.

88
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,199
Not a lot of unknowns 
about AIDS in '83.

89
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,291
Nick is probably right.

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,712
All we have are a few 
blood stains on Jeff's shirt.

91
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,003
Never analyzed.

92
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,784
Lab would have to deal with it now
if your victim fought back.

93
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,232
Might be the killer's blood.

94
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:23,645
Anything else to go on?

95
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,964
You ever hear the 
Benjamin Kern Foundation?

96
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,488
I heard the current building.

97
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,788
Cool, big fountain up front.

98
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,690
This is Jeffrey Kern.

99
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,094
The victim's rich.

100
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,515
Might be significant.

101
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,486
Who stood to gain from Jeff dying?

102
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,136
He got any sibling, Scotty?

103
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,617
Yeah, a brother.

104
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,178
Well, you got that,

105
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,611
and you got the blood.

106
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,780
So where's that cool building?

107
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,292
Is your dad able to join us?

108
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,762
He's able but unwilling.

109
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,656
Lotta art.

110
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,278
Beats our wanted posters.

111
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:56,015
I'd like a wante poster.

112
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:58,637
With my brother's killer on it.

113
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,858
Never bought Artie is the doer?

114
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,718
No.

115
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:05,742
And I don't think the cops knocked 
themselves out trying to find the killer

116
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:07,887
of this low status gay kid.

117
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:09,616
His family was high status.

118
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,533
Fear of AIDS trumped 
everything in '83.

119
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,895
The paramedics left Jeff's body
in the rain for 3 hours,

120
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,775
cuz they didn't wanna touch him.

121
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:21,790
Jeff being from this flush family
kinda makes us look at money as motive.

122
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,411
He didn't have any money.

123
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:26,170
My dad disinherited him 
a year before he died.

124
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,087
Because he was gay?

125
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,609
Dad couldn't accept it.

126
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:32,080
So, Jeff being cut off, then dying

127
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,556
left you sole heir of the family fortune.

128
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,174
I didn't profit from his death.

129
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,513
His half of all that money...

130
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,240
Goes to three charities.

131
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,316
I convinced my dad to do that much.

132
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,811
You were close to your brother?

133
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:45,857
He made me crazy,

134
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:48,787
but he was the kind of 
guy you just love anyway.

135
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,934
My dad adored him too.

136
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:55,244
But their relationship ended 
at my engagement party.

137
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,472
- You came.
- I wouldn't miss it.

138
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,784
You're brave.

139
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:08,045
Look who's here.

140
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,577
I'm so glad.

141
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:11,403
Congratulations, Ann.

142
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:14,090
- Where is he?
- Walking over here.

143
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:24,693
- Do you have to do this, Jeffrey?
- There is the perfect Kern manners.

144
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:26,439
Are you making 
some kind of a point?

145
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,188
I'm attending a family event 
with Artie who's part of my family.

146
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,157
Nice to see you again.

147
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:36,207
If you wanna flaunt your life style,
there's a time, a place.

148
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,260
- When, where?
- Not at Paul's party.

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,938
We don't mind.

150
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,140
I don't want this for you.

151
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,872
If Artie can't stay, I can't either.

152
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,827
Congratulations.

153
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,900
I know you'll have a happy life.

154
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:17,585
After that, my dad acted like 
he only had one son.

155
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,330
So what'd Jeff do for money?

156
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,972
Worked as a towel boy 
at a bath house.

157
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,663
To really stick it to dad.

158
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,925
- Didn't last too long though.
- What happened?

159
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,081
There was some trouble there.

160
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,877
- I never knew the whole story.
- Would Artie know the details?

161
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,998
Yeah, probably.

162
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,824
Jeff was supposed to be passing out 
towels in that place.

163
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:41,230
Instead he was
posting warning signs.

164
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,351
About AIDS?

165
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,994
That must've gotten over big
with the owner.

166
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,858
Artie, they need an answer.

167
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,756
The white chair covers 
or the light blue?

168
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,711
Uh, this is Russ.

169
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:53,941
What do you think?

170
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,082
White goes with a wedding.

171
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,222
I like white too.

172
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:06,074
So was Jeff trying to shut 
this bath house down?

173
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,329
Basically.

174
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,738
Did he have any success?

175
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,584
The fire was pretty effective.

176
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,307
He burned the place?

177
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:14,053
He never admitted it, but...

¢Ü Loverboy 
'Working for the Weekend' ¢Ü

179
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:26,017
- You could've killed people.
- You're killing people.

180
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,558
This place is
a hot bed of disease.

181
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:31,540
- No one knows how it's spread.
- Whoever set this fire did a public service.

182
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,440
Whoever.
I like that, whoever.

183
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,045
- Jeff, what's going on?
- This is my boss, Barney

184
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,525
who has no conscience.

185
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's go home, calm down.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,178
Hey, hey, Jeff.

187
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,896
- How we gonna take care of this, huh?
- I didn't do anything.

188
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,337
- I'll have you locked up.
- Let's be reasonable.

189
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:49,324
Reasonable is you reaching into your 
dad's deep pockets and compensating me.

190
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,530
I don't have a dad anymore.

191
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,965
- You seem rational.
- I am.

192
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:58,686
Why don't you talk to your lunatic 
boyfriend and stop him or I will.

193
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,517
You ever see Barney again after that?

194
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,460
I only hoped he was content 
with just firing Jeff,

195
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,000
cuz there wasn't
any money to give him.

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,662
You float the Barney theory 
with detectives in '83?

197
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,388
Gave'em his name,

198
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,834
never heard back.

199
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,907
It was a terrible time,

200
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:24,498
terrible.

201
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,720
Okay, but through 
all the terribleness,

202
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,503
- you were raking it in.
- Bath houses were hot in the '80's.

203
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,349
No one knew what was
coming down the pike.

204
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:36,123
And you made a couple mil a year.

205
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:37,856
So, you did your research.

206
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,390
And here comes this towel boy, Jeff,

207
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,443
decides to save the world by shutting 
down your booming business.

208
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,806
It was the turning point, anyway.

209
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:47,876
Virus is making the papers.

210
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,927
AIDS shut down my bath house.

211
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,634
But Jeff lit the match.

212
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,389
- Kid was a hothead.
- You a hothead, too?

213
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,441
I can be.

214
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,521
But insurance paid for all my losses,

215
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,518
then Jeff got out of my sight for good.

216
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:03,751
This Jeff sounds like he pissed off
every other person he met.

217
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,949
Roughly.

218
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:07,864
Anyone else on that 
place get into it with Jeff?

219
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:12,072
There was someone 
Jeff targeted in particular.

220
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,274
¢Ü Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers 
'You Got Lucky' ¢Ü

221
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,291
Carlo, we gotta talk.

222
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,582
Talk? No thanks.

223
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,430
Five minutes.

224
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,750
I thought you said 
you just wanted to talk.

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,120
All that time you spend in front of 
the mirror, I know you've noticed this.

226
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,938
It's nothing.

227
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:38,038
- You're sick.
- I'm fine.

228
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,621
Did you tell that guy you just
had sex with that you have it?

229
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:41,811
It's cancer

230
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:43,652
and cancer's not contagious.

231
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,022
You're purposely giving it to people?

232
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:48,472
- You're such a drama queen.
- What are you, a sociopath?

233
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,969
I think you're still upset 
that we stopped.

234
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:53,496
You and me.

235
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,409
Carlo,

236
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,793
it kills people.

237
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,760
Stay out of my way

238
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,150
and I'll stay out of yours.

239
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,798
Carlo was the prettiest of them all.

240
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,197
Literally got by on his good looks.

241
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,380
I thought I'd save this.

242
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:23,110
Jeff made these,

243
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,984
handed them out 
around Queens Village.

244
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,482
I'm seeing motive.

245
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:33,470
This man is sick
He won't tell you

246
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:44,763
Carlo is spreading the gay cancer
to 10 men a night at Barney's.

247
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,940
10 a night?

248
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,420
That pace, 
Carlo must be long dead.

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,198
We need a last name to find out.

250
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:52,080
Barney didn't know it?

251
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,926
This Carlo said something 
about when 'we' stopped.

252
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:57,300
It sounded like him 
and Jeff were together.

253
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,682
Did Artie know that?

254
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:02,731
Did Artie get the bug from Jeff 
who got it from Carlo?

255
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,150
Sounds like the cops in '83
were on to something.

256
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,077
Better go back to the bride-to-be.

257
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,810
Y'know, I think technically
they're both grooms.

258
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,493
I knew about Jeff and Carlo.

259
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,455
- And you didn't mind?
- I didn't like it.

260
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:21,954
- But?
- You're not gonna find this palatable.

261
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:24,314
Consider me warned.

262
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,859
Most gay men were living out 
what a lot of straight men fantasize.

263
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,036
Which is?

264
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,214
Spouse in home 
and affairs on the side.

265
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,410
That was our arrangement too.

266
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:35,861
Until I got sick.

267
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:42,339
¢Ü Cyndi Lauper 'Time After Time' ¢Ü

268
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,680
How is he?

269
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,645
He's the same.

270
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:56,022
He's very brave.

271
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,202
He's sleeping.

272
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,566
If you keep your voices down.

273
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,067
Sure.

274
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,009
Hey, Artie.

275
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,581
Is it my birthday?

276
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:06,784
It's a metaphor.

277
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,718
Everyday is a celebration.

278
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:11,466
Everyday is going to be 
my birthday from now on?

279
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,642
Yes.

280
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,037
We'll be in a never-ending 
production of our town.

281
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,788
Treasuring every single 
moment as we live it.

282
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,291
That's right.

283
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,113
Don't do that.

284
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,130
Now stay back.
Don't get this.

285
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,883
I saw Carlo today.

286
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:40,138
How is he, 
don of Queens Village?

287
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,477
He can't believe 
I only wanna be with you.

288
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,228
Neither can I.

289
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,571
Well, it's true.

290
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:56,161
Jeff left Carlo for me.

291
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,050
Who would've thought?

292
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,160
Carlo getting dumped, 
that must've been new to him.

293
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,286
Brand new.

294
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:04,374
You think he was dangerous?

295
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:08,367
I think he purposely infected 
hundreds of men in the city.

296
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,081
That's murder, isn't it?

297
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,250
You know his last name?

298
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,533
Fishman.

299
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,356
First name is Melvin.

300
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,885
Carlo is Melvin Fishman?

301
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,264
He's an Ohio boy,

302
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:25,911
reinvented himself when 
he moved to the big city.

303
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,415
He alive?

304
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:29,599
Try South Philly.

305
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:35,479
Now, how's a guy like him 
make it when so many others don't?

306
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,589
If God was punishing 
people for their sins,

307
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,967
he had a badly researched list.

308
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:54,764
I was Melvin for 18 miserable years
in Shaker Heights.

309
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:57,300
Here, I'm Carlo.

310
00:15:57,448 --> 00:16:00,224
Here, hold Louise.

311
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:02,940
Let's talk about homicide.

312
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,430
You wanna know
if I murdered Jeff Kern?

313
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:06,747
No.

314
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:10,423
You had a reputation for playing
roulette with people's health.

315
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,877
This just put me more in demand.

316
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:15,678
I'm ugly now.

317
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:18,359
I make money cleaning bird cages.

318
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,527
But look at me there.

319
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,429
I was gorgeous.

320
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,907
Nobody cared about 
the 'he'll kill you' part?

321
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,881
Jeff was seen as hysteric.

322
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,187
Like a lady who smashed up liquor 
bottles with an axe.

323
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,445
People laughed.

324
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,001
So guys still wanted you?

325
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,481
Jeff was the one 
who ended up ostracized.

326
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,965
Even though he was right in the end.

327
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,029
People don't know how 
to act in an emergency.

328
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,363
When AIDS hit the world,

329
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,580
most of us froze in disbelief.

330
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,785
Not Jeff.

331
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:50,219
No, he fought.

332
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,028
In the ways a lot 
more stupid than this.

333
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,016
Like?

334
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,264
Jeff usually hid his background.

335
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,026
Now he decided to use it.

336
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:00,131
How?

337
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:06,206
A fundraising party for rich, closeted
gay men who wanted to stay that way.

338
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:12,009
¢Ü Billy Idol 'Eyes Without a Face' ¢Ü

339
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:15,509
Be sure not to set off the alarm.

340
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,701
Thanks for helping me do this.

341
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:20,100
- Don't tell dad.
- Are you kidding.

342
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:23,285
- You should call him.
- He should call me.

343
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:28,077
We'll be in the guest house.

344
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:41,925
37 men have died in Philadelphia.

345
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:46,024
425 in New York and the 
government is ignoring it.

346
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,022
Ronald Reagan, 
interfere with God's work.

347
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,015
Everyone in this room 
has money and clout.

348
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,644
So we're the ones 
who have to do something.

349
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,569
We could hire a lobbyist,

350
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,012
a doctor maybe.

351
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:01,095
Giving money isn't enough.
We have to put ourselves on the line.

352
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,507
How do you mean?

353
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:03,759
Come out.

354
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,375
Make a joint statement.
We're gay, we're powerful,

355
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,972
and attention must be paid.

356
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,120
Your father would love that.

357
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,113
My father would have to handle it.

358
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:17,342
If we came out, we'd lose 
whatever credibility we might've had.

359
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:19,045
People are dying.

360
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:21,930
- This is a crisis.
- Don't be alarmist.

361
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,291
There's no cure.

362
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,110
No one's even looking for a cure.

363
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,515
This is a press release 
from everyone in this room.

364
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:31,729
Are you crazy?

365
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,169
I'm sending it out in a week.

366
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,500
I'd like your signatures,

367
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,673
but I don't need them.

368
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:49,214
Jeff was gonna break the biggest 
taboo in the gay world.

369
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:53,116
Outing. / He had more guts 
than brains threatening those men.

370
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:56,049
So who were these guys 
who had everything to lose?

371
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:57,762
You want me to out them?

372
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,809
For a homicide investigation?
You bet.

373
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:04,407
Screw 'em.

374
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,032
What have they done for me lately?

375
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,163
Right, Bobo?

376
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,391
Got a pen?

377
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,106
Terrence Overton,

378
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,966
President of Eastline Bank.

379
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,134
Christopher Duncan,
Chief of Staff to Councilman Bias.

380
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:22,527
Bias, he's right of the two of the hum.

381
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,022
Don't ask, don't tell.

382
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,519
Just hide it in the log cabin.

383
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,984
Chief of Emergency Medicine
at Penn General.

384
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,765
Russell Bennett.

385
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:31,606
Who's that?

386
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:34,843
Russ.

387
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,318
It's Artie's fiance.

388
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:46,517
You were at Jeff's party the week
before he was murdered.

389
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,440
Yes.

390
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,301
This is unbelievable.

391
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,703
Lotta people in that room
had motive to kill Jeff.

392
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,953
Not me.

393
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:55,444
I've been out since I was 16.

394
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,591
How could you not tell me this?

395
00:19:57,591 --> 00:20:00,020
It's a time of my life
I'm embarrassed about.

396
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,953
I was a drunk and an addict
who dated older men.

397
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,298
I was there with one.

398
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,592
He have a lot to lose by being outed?

399
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:08,777
Only everything.

400
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,715
Who are we talking about, Russ?

401
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,065
You better tell them.

402
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,856
You better tell them every detail.

403
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:16,802
I will.

404
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,998
So?

405
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,884
Carson Finch.

406
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,861
This just gets worse and worse.

407
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,816
- Who's that?
- A conservative columnist for the Times.

408
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,898
It'd be like finding out 
Pat Buchanan was gay.

409
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,330
If I'd been sober for five minutes 
while I was with him,

410
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,326
I might have realized 
he was the devil.

411
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,763
You think Finch could've hurt Jeff?

412
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,696
I know he read him 
the riot act after the party.

413
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:48,380
Things don't get done when 
you rant, rave, and threaten.

414
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,477
Things get done quietly.

415
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:53,170
We'll be dead.
That's quiet.

416
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,934
Russell, I need five minutes.

417
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,016
Lovely family.

418
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,533
They're ok.

419
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,966
Powerful, too.

420
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,344
I've never met your father,
but I see his name everywhere

421
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:12,346
on hospitals, libraries.

422
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,546
He's a major donor in Philadelphia.

423
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,587
I know all that.

424
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:22,151
You had some people here tonight who 
could bring his empire crashing down.

425
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,308
Now you're the one threatening.

426
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,345
I'm just saying.

427
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:31,112
Even a picture of 
Kern's family has dirty secrets.

428
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,673
I grew up here.

429
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,013
I know hard ball.

430
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,468
You don't

431
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:40,916
want to play it

432
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,990
with me.

433
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,946
Satan himself.

434
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,283
How far would Finch go?

435
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:59,028
I thought he was content eviscerating 
people in print, but who knows.

436
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:10,189
So is the wedding off?

437
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,124
It's between them.

438
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:14,448
Mine was on and off three times.

439
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,020
New police resource.

440
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,733
Yeah? What?

441
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:22,268
Half the guys on the party list
are now on the AIDS quilt.

442
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:23,773
Gone, huh?

443
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,125
Yeah.

444
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,625
Ain't all Mary's.

445
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,274
Women, kids.

446
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:30,290
IV drug users and

447
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,237
my niece being one of them.

448
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:36,891
Two panels for Jeff Kern.

449
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:40,005
One from Artie, 
one from his brother.

450
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,609
Guess where Finch lives.

451
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:46,345
Rittenhouse Square.

452
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,098
Yeah, where Jeff ended up.

453
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:55,517
Jeff Kern was lucky he lived 
through the night of that party.

454
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:56,844
Highball

455
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,320
We heard about the threats 
especially from you.

456
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,034
I just warned him.

457
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:02,818
You hurt me, I'll hurt you.

458
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:05,614
Like maybe with a rock to the face?

459
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:06,944
That wasn't necessary.

460
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,283
Why is that?

461
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,994
Between my friend 
at the Eastline Bank and I,

462
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:14,088
we had plenty of dirt on 
the magnificent Kern family.

463
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,225
And that made Jeff back off?

464
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:18,659
Cuz he doesn't seem to be 
the backing off type.

465
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,810
Who knows what 
he would have done?

466
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,341
Maybe he died before 
he knew himself.

467
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,661
Or mayb he died so he couldn't 
put out that press release.

468
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,491
Maybe.

469
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:34,399
But I fight with words,

470
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,627
not rocks.

471
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:38,206
For what it's worth,

472
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:41,895
I never believed that Jeff died 
at the hands of a gay man.

473
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:44,570
Beating him with rock,

474
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,743
I'd look for a heterosexual.

475
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:49,005
Got one in particular?

476
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:52,069
Jeff found out I was gay 
because we both had friends

477
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,541
on the AIDS floor at Penn General.

478
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,260
I saw him there.

479
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,826
Yeah, so?

480
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,509
Artie shared a room 
wih a boy who had AIDS

481
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,887
and the boy's father was ...

482
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:04,843
rageful.

483
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,889
Carson Finch.

484
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:13,896
Jeff. Hello.

485
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,313
Hi.

486
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,059
Sick friend?

487
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,998
¢Ü The Scorpions 'Still Loving You' ¢Ü

488
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,600
Can I get you anything?

489
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,238
Food?

490
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,305
You can give me a cure.

491
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,694
I know.

492
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:35,893
He's dying.

493
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,855
I'm sorry.

494
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:43,069
Take your hand off me.

495
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,112
Kenny got sick 
because of people like you.

496
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:46,161
Excuse me?

497
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,232
He's innocent.

498
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,224
He should be helped 
before your friend.

499
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,142
I'd like to help everyone.

500
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,822
He's eight.

501
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,594
Please.

502
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:58,818
I don't know if I can help Artie.

503
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:01,223
Damn you.

504
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,287
What happened?

505
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,165
Jeff walked away.

506
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,929
Now, how did this guy think 
that Jeff could help his son?

507
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,057
I don't know.

508
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:15,113
But he knew where to find Jeff.

509
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,738
And I know hate when I see it.

510
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:30,468
We gotta talk to you about Jeff Kern,
the guy you fought with at the hospital.

511
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:32,456
I don't remember half of what
came out of my mouth that night.

512
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:33,764
You threatened him.

513
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:36,101
Two weeks later he was killed.

514
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:38,405
Not by me.

515
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,385
I was angry, yeah.

516
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,332
I thought Kenny got AIDS 
from his second grade teacher.

517
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:46,554
Now I know it was the transfusions 
he had, skateboard accident.

518
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,552
Why'd you target Jeff?

519
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,059
It just seemed unfair.

520
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,874
I mean, if there was some miracle,

521
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:57,240
my kid should get it, 
not the gay guy.

522
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,030
What miracle do you mean?

523
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,281
That guy Jeff said he had a way 
to get his boyfriend into a drug trial,

524
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,189
- maybe save him.
- How?

525
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,650
I don't know,

526
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,278
but they kept arguing about it.

527
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,573
The sick guy saying, 'it's not worth it,
I accept my death'.

528
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,301
I'm thinking, 
you accept your death, great.

529
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:17,579
Give my kid the drug.

530
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,291
How do you get access 
to these drug trials?

531
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,144
Connections, clout, 
know a board member,

532
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:24,842
be a major donor to the hospital.

533
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:26,361
What hospital are you talking about?

534
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:27,926
Penn General.

535
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:30,191
They do a lot of research there.

536
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:34,698
Jeff's father's on the board of directors 
for Pennsylvania General.

537
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:36,895
That qualifies as a major donor.

538
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,259
Has been for years.

539
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,614
So Jeff needs dad to 
save Artie's life potentially.

540
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:43,497
Only Jeff and dad are estranged.

541
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:46,029
But Jeff will do anything.
He and Artie are in love.

542
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,204
Which is why dad will say no.

543
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:51,956
That writer Finch told Jeff
he had something that could ruin his dad.

544
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:56,118
Maybe Jeff asked him what the dirt was 
so he could throw it at dad himself.

545
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,738
We gotta talk to the old man 
whether he likes it or not.

546
00:26:58,738 --> 00:27:02,426
You think a father would kill his 
son to save his business empire?

547
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:04,012
Why not?

548
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:06,124
Jeff was dead to him already.

549
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:25,239
Did Jeff come to you for help
before he died, Mr. Kern?

550
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,176
He called,

551
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,313
asked if we could meet.

552
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,586
Said it was important.

553
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:34,005
I made him beg.

554
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:35,388
I was a jerk.

555
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,481
Dad, don't say that.

556
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,522
Sorry, if it offends you.

557
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:41,437
What happened 
when you two met?

558
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:43,051
We didn't.

559
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,471
He was murdered the night before.

560
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,769
So you don't know 
what he wanted to talk about?

561
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:50,083
No and I never will.

562
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,419
I think Jeff wanted you to help Artie 
get into the drug trial at Penn General.

563
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,450
Yes, you've told me.

564
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:58,206
What would've you said?

565
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,215
I would've said no.

566
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:02,315
But Artie got into that trial.

567
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,943
Yes,

568
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:11,090
after Jeff died,
I made sure his friend got a place.

569
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:12,936
How strange logic.

570
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:16,800
Maybe it was guilt,
something you did, Mr. Kern?

571
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,061
You have something 
to say to me, say it.

572
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:22,848
Be a man.

573
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:25,534
Carson Finch had dirt on your family.

574
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,031
Finch is a dilettante.

575
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,531
Jeff knew what it was 
and was gonna use it against you.

576
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:33,437
You've got fire, huh?

577
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:36,333
Just like Jeff did.

578
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,119
What did Finch tell him?

579
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,144
What did he hold over you?

580
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:44,464
What could be worse than 
what Jeffrey flaunted everyday?

581
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:45,921
- Dad.
- It's unnatural.

582
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:47,036
Let's not go into that.

583
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:53,414
The only thing more unnatural is for 
a father to bury his son.

584
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:57,163
Hearing of his death

585
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,949
was the worst day of my life.

586
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:03,360
You should go now.

587
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,830
Yes, go.

588
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,003
You getting Artie into that 
trial may have saved his life.

589
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:11,009
Furthest thing from my mind.

590
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,704
I don't believe you, Mr. Kern.

591
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:16,467
I think you loved Jeff.

592
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:19,845
Well,

593
00:29:21,062 --> 00:29:24,131
he was always my favorite.

594
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:28,008
They both are.

595
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:34,469
You really think Jeff would 
blackmail his own father?

596
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:36,824
He wasn't shy about confrontation.

597
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:39,413
I suppose that's true.
He was a chip off the old block.

598
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:41,052
You told him you had 
something on his family.

599
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,684
We need to know what it was.

600
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,103
That's water under the bridge.

601
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:46,595
Something on the foundation,
financial scandal?

602
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,487
Or personal.

603
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,520
I believe in discretion.

604
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:54,025
A man was murdered.

605
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,759
Bludgeoned, strangled.

606
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,734
That ain't discreet.

607
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,733
Do right by this kid, Finch.

608
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:16,788
Summer of '78.

609
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:19,345
That's me in the swim trunks.

610
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,593
Lord have mercy.

611
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,249
These are our housemates,

612
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:26,447
Brian, Doug, Leonard.

613
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,388
And this man

614
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:31,463
is Leonard's hot summer romance.

615
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:40,197
Paul was thinner then.

616
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,206
When I went to the party that night,

617
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:46,557
I didn't know he was Jeff's brother.

618
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,616
How'd you find out?

619
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:50,389
I recognized him from family photos.

620
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,398
Same swim trunks.

621
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,333
I realized Jeff didn't know.

622
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,626
- So you told him? 
- No.

623
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,459
Then when I sat for a smoke,

624
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,898
there was the man himself.

625
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:09,931
¢Ü Bob Seger 'Shame On The Moon' ¢Ü

626
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:12,140
Paul.

627
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:14,177
Carson Finch.

628
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:15,962
Of course.

629
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:18,712
I had no idea you were Jeff's brother.

630
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:21,752
Listen, this is..

631
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,993
I'm married now and

632
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,700
- my family doesn't know.
- Say no more.

633
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,401
I understand.

634
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,105
I read your column.

635
00:31:31,196 --> 00:31:32,872
You're crazy.

636
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:36,612
Miss Finch isn't 
everyone's cup of tea.

637
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,977
How's Leonard?

638
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:44,449
I've been thinking 
of sending him a card.

639
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:47,699
Leonard died last year.

640
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:23,405
Why didn't you tell anyone?

641
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,612
I didn't believe in outing.

642
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,342
And then death outed us all.

643
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:35,871
Paul was worried that his brother
will out him to their dad at this meeting.

644
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:40,110
Which his dad treats his kids equally
means Paul gets disinherited too.

645
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,896
So he kills Jeff the night before.

646
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,254
Ipso facto.

647
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,515
Except we don't got no factos.

648
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,438
Blood results were inconclusive.

649
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:48,430
How come?

650
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,733
85 percent match to Jeff's DNA.

651
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,053
The lab's assuming 
the sample's degraded.

652
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,517
But there's another explanation 
for an almost match.

653
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,503
A sibling.

654
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:58,099
You can't take that to court.

655
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:59,494
We need a confession.

656
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,482
He'll lawyer up 
in record time, Scotty.

657
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,217
Maybe not.

658
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,337
I think Paul wants to 
tell someone what he did.

659
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:11,489
He put it on the quilt panel
he made for Jeff.

660
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,088
- He was lost and is found.
- The prodigal son.

661
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,953
Someone wanna catch me up here?

662
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,846
I missed all of Sunday school.

663
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:21,414
It's a story about 
two sons and a father.

664
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:24,771
The one son does everything that 
pleases father, the other one...

665
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,491
- Bad.
- Goes off whoring and drinking,

666
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:28,713
shaming family.

667
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:31,457
While the good son is
home working the field.

668
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:34,616
Then one day the bad son 
wants to come back home.

669
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,127
And the father instantly forgives him,

670
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:40,586
welcomes him and 
gives his fatted calf.

671
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:41,871
All his stuff.

672
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:47,137
Which makes the good, 
dutiful son very, very angry.

673
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:57,947
I have a meeting in 10 minutes.

674
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:00,031
Not today, Paul.

675
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:02,262
What are you doing?

676
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:04,500
Telling you a story.

677
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,192
Then we want you to tell us a story.

678
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:09,251
Sorry, you're losing me.

679
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:12,603
He was lost and is found.

680
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:15,417
The prodigal son.

681
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,289
Wendy, get Ben Keltman on the phone.

682
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:25,089
I think you should talk to my attorney.

683
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:27,447
Look at that kingdom.

684
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,995
All yours,

685
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,671
the good son.

686
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:34,767
You sacrificed for it.

687
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,817
Gave up your own desires.

688
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:38,579
Did everything right.

689
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,020
- You earned this.
- While Jeff went out and played,

690
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,832
- defied your father.
- I loved my brother.

691
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,590
As long as he was 
exiled from the family.

692
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,613
But what if Jeff went 
to your dad for help,

693
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:55,304
and they made amends?

694
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:59,013
What if dad welcomed him home?

695
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:02,787
Would leave you on the outside.

696
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,208
You couldn't risk that.

697
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,867
So you made sure that 
meeting never happened.

698
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:10,599
At least, that's the version 
Paul likes to tell himself.

699
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,507
- He's cleaner, 
- straighter.

700
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:15,484
But it was simpler than that.
Wasn't it, Paul?

701
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,006
You had a secret.

702
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:22,977
You were terrified

703
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,768
Jeff would tell dad.

704
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:28,286
Come on, Paul.

705
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:30,994
You wanna make it right.

706
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:36,779
You confessed 20 years ago.

707
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:39,681
Ben Keltman on the line.

708
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,069
Tell him

709
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:47,559
I'll call him back.

710
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,205
Yes, sir.

711
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:57,718
I tried to talk to Jeff.

712
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,093
- Thanks for treating.
- Yeah.

713
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:03,438
I'm gonna walk that way and
pick up some mocha chip for Artie.

714
00:36:03,582 --> 00:36:06,407
I'd like to be at dinner tomorrow night
with you and dad.

715
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,857
I have to do it alone.

716
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:09,094
Do what?

717
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,391
Get Artie in the drug trial.

718
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,450
- But how?
- Any way I can.

719
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,589
Beg, bribe, blackmail.

720
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,607
Would that include ruining my life?

721
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,864
What are you talking about?

722
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:29,013
You saw me with Finch.

723
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:33,570
You think I didn't know 
you were a closet case?

724
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:36,549
It was one summer.

725
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,557
Dad can't know.

726
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:43,119
I would never out you.

727
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,455
You threatened to out 
a room full of men.

728
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:46,529
They're not my brothers.

729
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:49,875
I know you. You can't control 
yourself when you want something.

730
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,314
- Don't be crazy.
- He'll piss you off,

731
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,439
you'll do anything to help Artie.

732
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:57,152
- Paul, I won't hurt you.
- You don't want to, but you will.

733
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:59,275
- Cool off.
- Me?

734
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:02,293
- Cool off?
- Go home to your wife.

735
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,432
No. I won't let you.

736
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,014
- Paul.
- No,

737
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:14,018
I gave up too much.

738
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:35,677
