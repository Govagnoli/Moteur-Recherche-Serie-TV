July 4, 1963

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,315
Those marched in 
the streets were just kids.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,711
And the police were using 
fire hoses and dogs on 'em.

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,443
Fillin' their jails with children.

7
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:21,763
I'm just thankful we left Biloxi.

8
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:23,514
I think Dr. King's right.

9
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:25,329
That march on 
Washington next month?

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,951
That'll change people's minds.

11
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:29,313
Marching the streets? 
Isn't the asnwer, son.

12
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:30,662
What is Pops?

13
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:34,167
Dignity, hard work, education.

14
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,956
Things in life that matter most.

15
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,095
Dr. King says, 
our lives begin to end

16
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,664
the day we become silent 
about the things that matter.

17
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,390
- Your son's gotta point, Donald.
- Oh, my son?

18
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,598
- Where you think he get all his sass from?
- From your mother side.

19
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,915
But that's a whole other story.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,483
Donald Williams.

21
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,946
I'm Billy Jones.

22
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:03,593
From TBL defense systems?

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,580
- Glad to finally meet you, Billy.
- You're all moved in then, I suppose?

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,187
Looking forward to 
seeing the plant tomorrow.

25
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:10,662
- Why don't I take that from you?
- Thank you.

26
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,687
I'm Judith.
Billy's sister-in-law.

27
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:18,530
- So, pleased to meet you.
- Oh, Mary Williams, likewise.

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,510
This is my husband 
Donald, and our son Ezekiel.

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,729
You can call me 
Zeke for short, ma'am.

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,184
Zeke, it is then.

31
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,918
My husband Henry is 
around here, somewhere...

32
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:29,804
Sweetheart!

33
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,789
I understand you're 
in military, Mr. Willams?

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,594
Did they train you 
to work on planes?

35
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,208
Well, actually I'm an engineer.

36
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,531
I build'em.

37
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,402
Mr. Williams will be 
overseeing operations in TBL.

38
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,752
He's your boss, Billy?

39
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:47,504
Henry, the Williams are our new neighbors 
they just came up from Mississippi.

40
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,922
Welcome.

41
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:50,653
I better help Charlotte
get some dessert.

42
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,692
Jump in there, Zeke.
Before my neice gobbles it all down.

43
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,858
Jell-O!

44
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,429
I thought you 
wanted cake, Charlotte.

45
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:58,888
I don't like cake, Daddy.

46
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,206
Sure you do.

47
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,656
You love cake.

48
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:18,103
With this faith we will 
be able to work together,

49
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,514
to pray together, 
to struggle together,

50
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:24,250
to go to jail together, 
to stand up for freedom together...

51
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:46,466
Holy moly!

52
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,106
- What is that?
- Let's get out of here.

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,142
It's a kid.

54
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,623
Don't touch it, Willy!

55
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:58,270
The fuzz will put you in the slammer.

Last known address 
was this flophouse.

58
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,408
Word on the street is 
our guy surfaces today.

59
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:37,406
He's been wanted on 
this warrarnt for six months.

60
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,800
Better surface.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,567
This his posse?

62
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,292
Will?

63
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:51,074
Hey. What is it?

64
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,339
Body was found here, 
42 years ago.

65
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,873
Whose body?

66
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,660
Sixteen year old boy.

67
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,164
Zeke Williams.

68
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,371
Cold job?

69
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,483
Never came in.

70
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,932
Every year, 
folks would leave flowers.

71
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,869
- Not this year.
- People forget.

72
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:15,667
I was the one who found him, Lil.

73
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:21,393
I never forgot.

Hey, Scotty.

87
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,671
We miss you at first Thursdays.

88
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,260
Well, don't worry, we had a couple 
of cocktails put on you tab.

89
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,900
Live it up.

90
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,257
Looks like you were 
living it up yourself.

91
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,657
Uh, nah-. 
Just... under the weather.

92
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,323
Can't keep up 
with the barmaid, huh?

93
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,187
Will you drop it already?

94
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,927
Hey, Scotty. Take it easy.

95
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,513
Hey, Nun. 
You tell him to take it easy.

96
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,242
Just messing, will ya?

97
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,591
I'm heading in.

98
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,170
Smelling like a brewery, too.

99
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,436
Ezekiel Williams, 16.

100
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:46,717
Parents reported him 
missing night of August 27, 1963.

101
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,760
Next day his body was found.

102
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,055
Yeah. In gang territory.
19th and diamond posse.

103
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:55,398
AKA, 19 diamonds, ran that turf.

104
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,147
Thoery was, 
Zeke's murder was drug related.

105
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,448
Well, Zeke was 
a straight A student.

106
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,828
No prior drug or criminal history.

107
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:08,009
Yep, kids like me ran those streets 
dreamt of being a diamond one day.

108
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,763
Not kids like Zeke.

109
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:12,062
Gangster dreams, huh, Will?

110
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:15,726
Yeah, now I'm one of the good guys.

111
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,686
Petechial hemorrhaging,

112
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:22,266
possible suffocation, and body 
was beaten too badly to be sure.

113
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:26,054
With this kind of damage you'd have a river 
of blood flowing through that playground.

114
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,904
No mention of blood 
in the scene notes.

115
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,173
Body was moved?

116
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:30,977
Moved from where?

117
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,327
What's that?

118
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,185
Cops back then thought 
it was some kind of code.

119
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,931
Couldn't make heads or tails.

120
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,387
Maybe we'll get lucky 
this time around.

121
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,142
Maybe.

122
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:58,300
He broke Mary's heart.

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,255
She followed Zeke shortly after.

124
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,273
And your wife thought Zeke's 
murder was racially motivated.

125
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,066
We both did.

126
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,703
Police wouldn't listen.

127
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:11,898
Notherners never 
could face their own Emmett Tills.

128
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,683
Why do you say that, Mr. Williams?

129
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,960
Back then, racism was 
supposed to be a Southern vice.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,348
But the North had it's own version.

131
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:22,180
Just as deadly.

132
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,105
Especially, when 
the black man was boss.

133
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:27,658
Zeke had a run-in with 
someone on your job?

134
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:33,198
He got a taste firsthand of
what I had to go through every day.

135
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,324
Bell UH-1s.

136
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,803
Defence contract.

137
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,191
Top of the line.

138
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,246
You tell all these people 
what to do Pops?

139
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,269
I oversee engineering and quality control.

140
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,016
Meaning you're the boss.

141
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,693
A man is limited to nothing...

142
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,475
But his dreams.

143
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:51,961
Noticed some problems in the 
fuel system flow switches.

144
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,219
You want to double check those.

145
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:58,165
Lunch ended ten minutes ago.
Let's go.

146
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,302
Get back on the floor before 
I dock you the rest of the day.

147
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,402
I'm taking a smoke first.

148
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,360
You heard the man 
quit your dilly dallying.

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,778
Can't I get a smoke first, Billy?

150
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:12,442
No, get on the floor.

151
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,668
Gotta give them a kick time to time...

152
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:19,639
- That's how we run things here.
- Yeah, you tell him boss.

153
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,485
You said it, boss.

154
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,237
You gonna stand by 
and watch that Pops?

155
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,924
He's not your boss.

156
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,663
My Father is.

157
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,183
Boy's got a mouth on him.

158
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,762
What d'you call him?

159
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,967
Ain't a man, is he?

160
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:40,269
That's all he meant, Donald.

161
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,137
Let's go, fellas. C'mon.

162
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,313
I'll never forget the look 
on Zeke's face.

163
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:00,046
I dissapointed him.

164
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:03,229
Zeke had any other encounters 
with your employees?

165
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,659
I wasn't inclined to have another 
bring-your-son-to-work-days.

166
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,698
So, no.

167
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,748
And you told the cops 
all this back then?

168
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:12,220
I did.

169
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,548
So, why do you care now?

170
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:22,764
I was the one who found 
Zeke in the playground.

171
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,532
That's why we're here.

172
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,080
Trying to make it right.

173
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,922
You're 42 years late, son.

174
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,331
Zeke was steping out of line, 
he should've known better.

175
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:47,658
So maybe your boys decided 
to school him in the proper etiquette.

176
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,635
They weren't my boys.

177
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:51,212
And they were 
young and dumb, but...

178
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,564
Not dangerous.

179
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:56,031
You didn't agree with 
their philosophical outlook?

180
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:59,229
I was there for the job and 
a paycheck, not the politics.

181
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:01,969
Did they ever bring up 
this incident with Zeke again?

182
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,044
Not to me. They knew 
how I stood on it.

183
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,024
Boss's kid?

184
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,521
Leave it alone.

185
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:11,362
Well, someone didn't
leave it alone.

186
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,767
If you've got something to say...

187
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,840
Now's the time.

188
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:19,784
Look.

189
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,435
Zeke, he was a good kid.

190
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,576
But?

191
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,589
Even good kids play with fire.

192
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:34,060
Henry just doesn't understand 
how heavy groceries can be.

193
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,021
Well, maybe you should 
learn how to drive, Judith.

194
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,225
Oh, silly me on the road?

195
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,656
That's what Henry would say.

196
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,353
What's going on here?

197
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,929
Where's Charlotte?

198
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,245
- What are you doin?
- Mommy?

199
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,015
Oh, my God!

200
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,191
It's not what you think, Mrs. Judith!

201
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,009
You just walk into my brother's 
house to chase some tail?

202
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,737
Carrying on in front of a child!

203
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:12,454
You never told the cops this?

204
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,723
Or your boss?

205
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,585
I thought it wasn't 
any of my business.

206
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,619
Whatever he was doing 
with that maid Matilda.

207
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,165
But you think that 
'whatever' it was got him killed?

208
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:24,253
I thought Matilda 
already had a boyfriend.

209
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:25,934
A real unsavory fella, too.

210
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,648
What do you mean?

211
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,831
Heard he dealt dope.

212
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:33,111
He hung out with one of 
those gangs from North Philly.

213
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,968
North Philly?

214
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:36,921
You know what gang?

215
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:40,968
They call themselves 
the '19 Diamonds', I think.

216
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,147
Crazy name, huh?

217
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,527
Well, Zeke was 
in over his head.

218
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,621
Hooked up with a gang
member's girlfriend.

219
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,814
19th and diamond ruled 
the roost in '63.

220
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,415
Spoke the langauge of retribution.

221
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,797
We got a name on this boyfriend?

222
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,318
Still looking for surviving members.

223
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,576
And shelf life being what it is on 
the streets, we're lucky if we find any.

224
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,705
What about Matilda?

225
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,950
Autotracked her. 
She's not in the State of PA.

226
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,445
Well, Valens and Vera wiill check it out.
This kid she took care of, you find her?

227
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:09,730
Charlotte Jones.
She's in Center city.

228
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,660
Maybe she's got some answers.

229
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,479
It's a place I used 
to play as a child.

230
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:24,352
I was nine when Zeke died.

231
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:28,376
Do you remember the time your mother 
and Uncle Billy found Zeke in the house?

232
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,589
Yes, I do.

233
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:33,106
Were there other guys ever coming 
around the house looking for Matilda?

234
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:36,951
No. / Well, Matilda had a boyfriend, though. 
Someone besides Zeke?

235
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,181
If she did, I never knew.

236
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:42,087
She loved Zeke like 
he was her one and only.

237
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,845
Even as a kid I could see that.

238
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,211
That day was the 
first time they ever met.

239
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,068
Did he come in to look for her?

240
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,165
No, me.

241
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,642
Why?

242
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:59,425
Oh, some neighborhood kids 
and I stole his flag off his front porch.

243
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,637
He caught us.
They got away, I didn't.

244
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:04,596
So he chased you 
into your house?

245
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,679
He didn't hurt me 
if that's what you thinking.

246
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,411
Then what'd he do?

247
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,100
He made his move.

248
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,313
You're sure they 
won't get mad, Tommy?

249
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,365
See the cross on that flag,
Charlotte?

250
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:22,172
Negroes are real religious.
They like crosses.

251
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,698
Come on, give me that.

252
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:34,081
What are you doing?

253
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,937
Tommy said negroes like crosses.

254
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:39,222
Give it back.

255
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,880
I said give me my flag back.

256
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,596
How many times 
I gotta tell you, Charlotte?

257
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,790
Quit slamming that door!

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,751
I want my flag.

259
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,814
What do you think 
you're doing in here?

260
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,438
Girl who lives here took my flag.

261
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:20,430
I'd like it back.

262
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,325
I gotta leave right now! You can't 
just barge onto other people's property!

263
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,740
She barged onto mine!

264
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,376
I'm not leaving until I get my flag.

265
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,762
Alright, stay here and keep quiet.

266
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:34,730
I'm Zeke.

267
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,286
By the way.

268
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,375
Matilda. Hi.

269
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:45,241
- What's going on here?
- Where's Charlotte?

270
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,116
What are you doing?

271
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,590
Mommy?

272
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,211
Oh, my God!

273
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,256
It's not what you 
think Miss Judith!

274
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:56,312
You just walk into my brother's 
house to chase some tail?

275
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,003
Matilda! How could 
you bring that boy in here?

276
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:03,850
Miss Judith. 
I can explain it to you.

277
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,949
Did he touch you, baby?

278
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,011
He touched that.

279
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:10,506
I can explain, Miss Judith.

280
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,796
Like I said,

281
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,918
Zeke made his move.

282
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,837
The Ruy Lopez.

283
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,558
What's that?

284
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:27,070
White knight to F3, 
black knight to C6.

285
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,233
It's a chess opening.

286
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,572
That's what that 
piece of paper was.

287
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:32,806
Chess moves.

288
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,732
So, Zeke was a chess player.

289
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,976
A very good one.

290
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,308
So was my Mother.

291
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:40,966
That's why she was smiling.

292
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:43,844
She knew she had
finally met her match.

293
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,611
Your mother and Zeke met again?

294
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,650
Every afternoon.

295
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,134
Matilda and I would 
watch the games.

296
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,659
It was our secret.

297
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,405
So how long did this go on for?

298
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,914
Till the day Zeke died.

299
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,877
Your daughter says your chess 
games were secret, Mrs. Jones.

300
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,878
Why?

301
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,248
Back then, it was one thing,

302
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,635
sharing pot lucks 
with your black neighbors.

303
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:21,807
Another thing, inviting
their grown sons into your home.

304
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,231
The world wasn't ready 
for your kind of friendship.

305
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,688
The world treated me 
like a dumb housewife,

306
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,294
Zeke like a boy.

307
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:33,171
We treated each 
other like much more.

308
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,034
He was my friend.

309
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:38,360
You never told the police about 
your games, after he was murdered?

310
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,220
I didn't think our games had anything 
to do with what happened to Zeke.

311
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,562
No one in my world knew.

312
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,152
How about his?

313
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,849
Zeke and I went out in public once.

314
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,387
We didn't think anyone would mind.

315
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,183
Because we'd be among our own.

316
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,907
Your own?

317
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:02,375
People who loved 
nothing more than the game.

318
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,973
Best players in Philadelphia 
are here in this park.

319
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,488
I heard a grand master's coming 
next Wednesday.

320
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:10,485
Are you planning to go?

321
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,807
I was hoping to go to 
Washington that day for the march.

322
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,549
Father doesn't believe in that stuff.

323
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:16,688
Never let me.

324
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:17,869
You'll find a way.

325
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,566
If you really want to.

326
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,189
You think I should go?

327
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,769
A great man once said, our lives 
begin to end the day we become silent...

328
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:27,174
about the things that matter!

329
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,521
I think you should do 
what you believe is right, Zeke.

330
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,267
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Jones?

331
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:38,887
When a young lady likes someone.

332
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:40,630
How can you tell?

333
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,474
By the way she acts.

334
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:50,085
She smiles a lot, laughes at little 
things, like the way Matilda does.

335
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,955
When you're around.

336
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,881
Clyde!

337
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,251
Didn't know you played.

338
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:03,791
You know Mrs. Jones, right?

339
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,601
Blitz. One minute each.

340
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,512
You play white. 
Seems you got affinity for it.

341
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:13,855
Like brother Malcolm said, coffee 
gets weak when you mix it with cream.

342
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,434
I thought we were 
playing game here.

343
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,331
Question is, 
what are you playing.

344
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,645
Black stud to your white queen?

345
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,259
Maybe we should go, Zeke.

346
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,072
Don't talk about her like that!

347
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:28,878
Man who doesn't stand for 
something, falls for anything.

348
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:30,220
Malcolm X.

349
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,612
We must learn to live together as 
brothers or perish together as fools.

350
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,515
Dr. Mrtin Luther King.

351
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,417
Who's the fool here?

352
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,311
Black man who think he's white?

353
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:43,823
At least I know what I am.

354
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,183
But not who.

355
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,909
Clock ran out, I win.

356
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:59,036
Be peaceful, be courteous, 
obey the law, respect everyone.

357
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,051
Malcolm said that, too.

358
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:06,520
But if someone puts his hand on you, 
send him to the cemetery.

359
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,975
Forgot the last part.

360
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,944
Fool.

361
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,536
Who was this Clyde?

362
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:23,744
He did gardening work in the 
neighborhood, from time to time.

363
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:26,022
You two have had 
any run-ins with him?

364
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,889
I never went back there.

365
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:30,663
Zeke may have.
I don't know.

366
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:34,333
Where was this chess park located?

367
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,813
Up near Temple University.

368
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,589
19th street and Diamond.

369
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:43,247
That's where Zeke's 
body was found.

370
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:45,370
Yeah.

371
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:51,180
Zeke was found a block away 
from your little chess club, Clyde.

372
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:54,410
What my chess club?

373
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,729
Opened to public, 
as far as I knew.

374
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,143
But not white public.

375
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,008
Boss man sent you in here

376
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:06,071
Talk to the black man?

377
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,420
You got a penchant for 
assualting police officers.

378
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,990
Black police officers.

379
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,885
Oxymoron, you ask me.

380
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:19,058
Sellouts, race traitors, right?

381
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,626
Blind, deaf and 
dumb is more like it.

382
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:24,123
And Zeke was the worst 
kind of blind, deaf and dumb.

383
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,505
Fraternizing with the white woman.

384
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:30,333
I didn't have a problem 
with the white woman, junior.

385
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,535
I had a problem with that woman.

386
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,139
- Mrs. Jones?
- That's right.

387
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,115
Why is that?

388
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:40,236
Mrs get her hair 
done every Tuesday.

389
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:45,155
Blind, deaf and dumb
as to what goes on on her house.

390
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,903
Figured one Tuesday, 
I'd share with Zeke.

391
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,669
Mrs is barely out of her house.

392
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,374
And already it's starting up.

393
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,765
What are we doing here, Clyde?

394
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,123
Told you there's 
somehing you should see.

395
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,845
I'm not looking in there?!

396
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,472
Get over here!

397
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,079
I'm leaving.

398
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,003
You like that girl, don't you?

399
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,729
Matilda?

400
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,653
Listen.

401
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:52,224
You love white people so much.

402
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:58,728
See how they love you back?

403
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,648
Turned up dead the next day.

404
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:11,199
Zeke do something 
about what he saw?

405
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:15,075
Must've done something.

406
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:17,463
He dead, ain't he?

407
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:25,330
This world a rich happy man, 
three years ago.

408
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,125
You think Judith knew about 
her husband's indiscretions?

409
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,970
Sounded like she 
was out of the loop.

410
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,810
How about Matilda, 
we find her yet?

411
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,415
Still looking. Turns out 
she wasn't Philly born.

412
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:37,877
Family was from outside 
Wilmington, Delaware?

413
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:42,050
Came up here for work, left town 
the day before Zeke was murdered.

414
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,366
Wonder what made her run?

415
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:44,387
Well, maybe this.

416
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,939
A complaint filed with the old 
sex crimes unit by Matilda Jefferson.

417
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,753
Report of a rape.

418
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:53,997
Accompanying her was a negro male 
companion, unidentified.

419
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,274
- Could be Zeke.
- Must be Zeke.

420
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,610
Young girl, no family, who else 
could she have turned to?

421
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,447
Who's the officer on the report?

422
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:05,020
No officer listed, the only name we've got  
is a secretary who typed it up, Linda O'Hara.

423
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,586
We know where she is?

424
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,539
In town, still alive and kickin'.

425
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,645
It's Miss O'Hara.

426
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,076
Never did have a ball and chain.

427
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,445
About time they got some 
female detectives on the force.

428
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,310
They didn't let girls 
in the club til '73.

429
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,588
Pretty rough for 
female cops back then?

430
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:27,978
Rough?

431
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:30,927
Commissioners put first timers 
on the worst drug corners.

432
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:34,227
No patrol cars, no back up.

433
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:37,101
Can't live with'em, 
can't kill'em off.

434
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:39,929
Yeah, you got that right.

435
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:41,944
Never got past secretary myself.

436
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:44,210
Their loss, you ask me.

437
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,747
You remember this report you filed?

438
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:49,174
Back in '63.

439
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:52,537
'Course I do.

440
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,981
My superiors wouldn't 
let me, did it anyway.

441
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,493
Why didn't they let you?

442
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:03,137
Back then they said rape was 
when a lady changed her mind.

443
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,099
But you believed Matilda.

444
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,113
she was a brave little girl.

445
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,667
So was her friend.

446
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,751
I was the only one 
who believed them.

447
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:16,857
And you saw what 
happened, young man?

448
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:19,617
Told you they'd listen.

449
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:21,664
What's going on, Linda?

450
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:25,664
This young girl was raped.

451
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,145
That right, Miss?

452
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,983
You know the person 
who did this to you?

453
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:41,452
His name is Henry Jones.

454
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,866
He runs Emmerson Bank.

455
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,602
I know who he is.

456
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:57,818
Take it.

457
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,526
Show me what he did.

458
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:13,209
- What?
- This isn't right, sir.

459
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:17,964
She wants to charge a man 
with rape, she proves it first.

460
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:23,593
Show me.

461
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,004
Stick it in.

462
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,684
C'mon.

463
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:38,204
C'mon~
C'mon!

464
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:42,129
Stick it in.

465
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,954
Can't rape a woman, 
if she don't let you.

466
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,646
But you can make her let you.

467
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:54,836
Sir!

468
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,223
Zeke!

469
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,572
You're under arrest for 
assualting a police officer!

470
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,005
Get him out of here.

471
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,293
And throw that damn thing away.

472
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:22,124
Right after that, sergeant 
went to the phone made a call.

473
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:25,028
- To who?
- Henry Jones.

474
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:29,143
I heard him yakking about how 
he couldn't let some uppity colored boy

475
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:33,779
humiliate an upstanding citizen, 
blah-blah-blah.

476
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,000
How long was 
Zeke there that night?

477
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
My shift ended at midnight.

478
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,922
That poor boy was 
still in the cell when I left.

479
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,118
And you never reported this?

480
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:49,643
After Zeke was found dead?

481
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:52,104
Who would I report it to?

482
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,029
The police?

483
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:02,134
Report wasn't in the box because 
Zeke was never officially arrested.

484
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:05,160
And we've got no 
record of who got him out.

485
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,477
Making it real easy for our sergeant to 
call up Henry and hold Zeke unofficially.

486
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:12,883
Until our upstanding 
citizen shows up to claim him.

487
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,131
Maybe Matilda saw him go down.

488
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:17,259
She was at the station earlier.

489
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,613
Any luck finding her yet?

490
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:22,977
Yeah, I found her.

491
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,730
You found Matilda?

492
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:31,598
Yeah, oh yeah. 
I thought I told you. She's  uh-,

493
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:35,419
living on a Jersy shore.
Ocean City.

494
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:37,223
Thanks for the heads up.

495
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,888
Don't put yourself out.

496
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,405
Hold on a second, Scotty.

497
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:52,806
You found our witness, 
didn't bother letting us know.

498
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,198
Hey, I'm uh- sorry, okay?

499
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:57,282
- Thought I did...
- You didn't.

500
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,719
- You've been drinking?
- No.

501
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,359
No, that's crazy.

502
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,697
I can smell it on you, Scotty.

503
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:14,366
Well, look.

504
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,381
I was off the clock at lunch, so...

505
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:20,376
I'm fine.

506
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:25,478
I've given you every shot I can, pal.

507
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:29,870
I get yourself cleaned up, 
you do your job or you're gone.

508
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,699
You get me?

509
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,915
Get out.

510
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,194
I was 16.

511
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,594
Alone in the big city.

512
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:56,817
Family miles away.

513
00:28:56,817 --> 00:28:59,007
Zeke was my first love.

514
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:02,637
Didn't ever wondered why he never 
contacted you after you left Philly?

515
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:05,339
I thought he'd forgot about me.

516
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:07,703
What'd you do after 
Zeke got arrested?

517
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:11,209
I waited outside the 
station house for hours.

518
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,780
Scared, alone...

519
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,969
- And then she showed up.
- Who?

520
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:17,991
Miss Judith.

521
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,885
Judith Jones?

522
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,933
I thought she'd come to help.

523
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,447
Being Zeke's friend and all.

524
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:28,641
But she was the 
furthest thing from it.

525
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:37,982
- Mrs. Jones!
- Zeke! Did they hurt you?

526
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:41,686
I want you out of my house, tonight.

527
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:43,920
Don't bother picking up your things.

528
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,667
- What's going on?
- And you.

529
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,272
I never want to see you again.

530
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:51,891
I got a call from sergeant Petoskey.

531
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,988
He told me what 
you were doing here.

532
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:55,679
It's not Matilda's fault.

533
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,317
Or mine.

534
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,227
What your husband did.

535
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:02,879
Why couldn't you just 
keep your mouth shut?

536
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,323
You once told me to do 
what you believe is right.

537
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:07,459
Well, I was wrong.

538
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:12,726
And that our lives begin to end the day we 
become silent about the things that matter?

539
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:15,415
Remember, Mrs. Jones?

540
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,036
Didn't this place teach you, Zeke?

541
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:26,713
What you have to say, 
doesn't matter.

542
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:30,403
Maybe here it doesn't.

543
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,918
But to those people going to
Washington tomorrow?

544
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,671
To Dr. King?

545
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:37,708
It matters.

546
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:41,088
That's why I need to go to 
get someone to hear me, then I'll go.

547
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,080
Tonight.

548
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,647
To tell the truth.

549
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,399
Wanna come?

550
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,044
Thank you, officer.

551
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,713
Go to Washington.

552
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,002
Go wherever you want, Zeke.

553
00:31:04,002 --> 00:31:07,841
Just get out of here. 
Get out of my life.

554
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,975
And don't you ever come back.

555
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,186
It was almost morning when we left.

556
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:25,870
Zeke walked me to the train station.

557
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,276
Spend his last dime on 
my ticket back to Wilmington.

558
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:31,739
Promised he'd come 
back for me one day.

559
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:33,961
Where'd he go after that?

560
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:36,115
He was gonna hitchhike, walk...

561
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:38,578
Do whatever it took to 
get to Washington, DC.

562
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:40,478
For the march.

563
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:43,132
Zeke meant what he said.

564
00:31:43,132 --> 00:31:45,319
Always did.

565
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,888
And only one other person 
knew where he was headed.

566
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:53,517
The day he was killed.

567
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:56,728
Mrs. Jones.
his supposed friend.

568
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,999
- That right, Judith?
- Some friend you were.

569
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,985
When it hit the fan, 
you ran for cover.

570
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:07,524
Zeke never did follow the rules.

571
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:10,683
I admired that, believe me!

572
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,584
But I wasn't as strong as he was.

573
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:18,445
And couldn't stand all the neighbors 
knowing your dirty little secret.

574
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:20,930
What your husband 
was doing to the maid?

575
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,391
So you told Henry where to 
find him to shut Zeke up for good.

576
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,026
I said those things 
to scare Zeke!

577
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,234
To make him go 
faraway from here.

578
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,807
Why?

579
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:36,860
Because I knew it was only a matter 
of time before Henry did something.

580
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,343
So you were trying to save Zeke.

581
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:41,295
I owed it to him.

582
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,003
Because in some ways 
Zeke saved me.

583
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,937
Yeah? How?

584
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:48,619
He cared about what I thought.

585
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,784
There weren't many who did.

586
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,639
Like your husband.

587
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,112
So why did you tell him 
where to find Zeke?

588
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,995
I'll regret that for the rest of my life.

589
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:05,283
You have no idea.

590
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,809
Where've you been, Judith?

591
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:17,812
I uh-...

592
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:21,718
I was spending 
the night at Marge's.

593
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:27,549
Billy says a friend of his 
at the station house saw you.

594
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,201
Getting that colored boy out.

595
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:34,412
I did it for you, Henry.

596
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,674
So you wouldn't go to jail.

597
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:42,128
You believe that boy's lies?

598
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:45,294
More than your husband.

599
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:48,282
Where is he?

600
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,567
You tell me right now,

601
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:55,100
or you pack your bags, 
and you get out,

602
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,410
and you will never 
see your daughter again.

603
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,022
You can't do that.

604
00:34:00,022 --> 00:34:04,567
None of this would ever 
happened if wasn't for those people.

605
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,669
Moving into our neighborhoods,

606
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:10,922
taking a man's livelihood,

607
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,339
his job,

608
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:15,760
his woman.

609
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,007
That's why she 
got him out, Henry.

610
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,777
I don't know what 
you're talking about, Billy!

611
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:21,920
You're sleeping with 
that colored boy aren't you?

612
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,154
No!

613
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,160
God, I don't even know him!

614
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,017
Mommy?

615
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:33,311
What do you got there, honey?

616
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:35,118
Something for Mommy?

617
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:37,580
It's his winning chess move.

618
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,480
Whose chess moves, sweetheart?

619
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,757
Zeke's.

620
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:50,191
Please don't take her from me.

621
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,498
Where is he?

622
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:00,744
Headed to Washington.

623
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:02,597
Please don't take her!

624
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:06,419
Wanna come see your
friend Zeke, sweetheart?

625
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,204
Henry! What are you doing?

626
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:09,698
Mommy?

627
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:25,431
Well, that piece of paper 
was found in Zeke's pocket.

628
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:28,832
Your daughter was 
there when Zeke was killed.

629
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:35,603
That day, I lost my 
one friend in the world.

630
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,284
I couldn't lose my child, too.

631
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:43,670
We know you were there, Charlotte.

632
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,099
When Zeke was killed.

633
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,549
I was in bed asleep.

634
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,361
You were with your father 
and your uncle Billy.

635
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,825
Looking for Zeke.

636
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:58,335
You loved your daddy a lot.

637
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:02,475
You're uncle Billy, too.

638
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,264
And that's why you never told.

639
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,204
Remember this?

640
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,913
Zeke's winning move.

641
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:14,063
The Ruy Lopez.

642
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,100
He taught it to you.

643
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,718
And you left it with him.

644
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:25,020
I found it on his body.

645
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:28,696
He was left in the 
middle of the playground,

646
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:32,943
beaten so badly his 
own mother barely knew him.

647
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,630
I was twelve.

648
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,169
I'm sorry.

649
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,427
It was my fault.

650
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:45,136
I forgot our chess 
games were secret.

651
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,188
Tell us where your 
father took you, Charlotte.

652
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:59,533
A place in the woods 
I used to play.

653
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,882
My father, he...

654
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:07,470
put up on a swing for me and...

655
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,913
Show us where.

656
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:30,964
Zeke was hitchhiking 
on  the side of the road.

657
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:36,469
And my father and 
uncle Billy and their friends...

658
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:39,398
they made him get into the car...

659
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,938
and they brought him here.

660
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:55,902
Where do you think 
you're going now?

661
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,231
Ain't DC.

662
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:21,932
We interrupt our regular braodcast to 
go live to the march on Washington...

663
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,881
Sorry.

664
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:31,313
I am happy to join with you today

665
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:38,186
in what will go down in history 
as the greatest demonstration-

666
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,924
You stay in here.

667
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,548
I got him, I got him!

668
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,095
Get him up, get him up!

669
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:02,248
Where you going now, boy?

670
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:05,832
- Ain't DC, boy!
- You'll learn to shut that big mouth.

671
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:10,106
Shut that big mouth,
Shut that big mouth!

672
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,945
Who you gonna tell now!

673
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:15,732
... quest for freedom left you battered 
by the storms of persecution

674
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:20,259
and staggered by 
the winds of police brutality.

675
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,904
You have been...

676
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:26,659
C'mon! C'mon!

677
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:36,262
No one's ever gonna
hear about this, right?

678
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:40,559
Especially not your daddy.

679
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:49,588
You mean, your boss?

680
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:54,761
I'll tell him.

681
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:58,757
I'll tell everyone.

682
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:01,198
What you did to me.

683
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,007
To Matilda.

684
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:08,142
You can't stop me.

685
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:14,532
Yes, I can.

686
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,643
Billy, enough's enough.

687
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:21,517
I have a dream

688
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:27,258
that one day 
this nation will rise up

689
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,749
and live out the true 
meaning of its creed:

690
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:33,954
"We hold these truths 
to be self-evident...

691
00:40:33,954 --> 00:40:37,932
Daddy! / You don't want your 
daddy to go to jail, do you, Charlotte?

692
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,624
I have a dream

693
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:46,272
that my four little children

694
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:50,359
will one day live in a nation where 
they will not be judged by the color

695
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,334
of their skin but by the 
content of their character.

696
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:56,075
I have a dream today!

697
00:40:56,852 --> 00:41:00,355
With this faith, 
we will be able to work together,

698
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:02,896
to pray together, to struggle together,

699
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,410
to go to jail together,

700
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,606
to stand up for freedom together,

701
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:10,715
knowing that we will be free one day.

702
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:12,764
This will be the day 
when all of God's children...

703
