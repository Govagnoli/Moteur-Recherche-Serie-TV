00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:05,428
August 11, 1939

2
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:06,847
Here's to big Bertha
and her big old...

3
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:09,081
Oh, she was something else.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,624
You best keep it down 
before miss Marion hears you all.

5
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,138
She gonna kick us all out.

6
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,473
Sadie, honey, miss Marion's 
not hearing nobody

7
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:20,269
when she done drunk a whole jug
of hooch herself.

8
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,398
You're damn right.

9
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,303
Don't you talk mean about my mama.

10
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,941
Who you think you sassing, girl?

11
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,778
Can I have a nip?

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,111
Your mama gonna have a fit
she catch you up.

13
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,241
I'll tuck you in a sec.

14
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:38,022
Hey, Sadie, you said you was
going to the juke joint.

15
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,211
Not tonight.

16
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:42,897
Well, honey, my candy man pay 
me plenty, but I still got to...

17
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,745
work tonight.

18
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,713
Candy man give you candy, miss Blanche?

19
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,739
You wanna call it that, honey.

20
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,131
Go on to bed.

21
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:51,994
Go on.

22
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:57,898
Arletta make you think on your 
own little girl, huh, Sadie?

23
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:01,263
Where you say your girl stay at?

24
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:04,067
Virginia. 
She with my cousin.

25
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,795
I bring her up when I get 
the money saved.

26
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:10,503
Blanche? 
Manross waiting!

27
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,591
Miss Blanche, miss Sadie.

28
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,516
Go, Manross, go!

29
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,140
Wait proper-like.

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,315
Candy man looking mighty fine.

31
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,991
I thought you said
you was working tonight.

32
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,065
I am, honey.

33
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,554
Whoo!

34
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:35,529
You a big ten years old today.

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,509
Happy birthday, baby girl.

36
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,437
When my mother passed away a few weeks ago,

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,781
I found this letter among
her belongings hidden away.

38
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,642
It's the last letter that my 
grandmother ever wrote to her.

39
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,771
When was your grandmother murdered?

40
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,972
1939.

41
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,467
Her name was Sadie douglas.

42
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,123
Came from Virginia.

43
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,291
Moved north to find work in the '30s.

44
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,731
I don't know much more than that.

45
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,087
Your mom didn't talk about her?

46
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,645
She was only ten years old
when Sadie was killed.

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,741
And she never really forgave 
her for what she was.

48
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,620
Which was what?

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,542
The police called her a common
two-bit hooker.

50
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,556
My mother referred to her
as a white man's whore.

51
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:11,426
It was hard for her, knowing 
that that's where she came from.

52
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,609
How about you?

53
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,676
Maybe it's affected me somewhat, too.

54
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,809
These letters you have are from 1939?

55
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:22,243
Sadie wrote one to her every week.

56
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,346
Look, I know I'm asking a lot,

57
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,299
but Sadie mentioned someone,

58
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,854
here.

59
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,523
"He best not hurt me.

60
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,812
That milkman
best not hurt your mama."

61
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:38,187
- What milkman?
- I don't know.

62
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,391
She never referred to him
in her other letters.

63
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,197
Back then, the police said Sadie was

64
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:49,732
a prostitute killed randomly 
by a John, but...

65
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:53,556
I think my grandmother knew her killer.

66
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:04,220

77
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:34,849
Homicides,

78
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,187
assaults, rapes...

79
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:41,160
basically every criminal record
before 1950 is filed here.

80
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,766
County even sticks us with 
their medical charts, too.

81
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,758
We need homicides.

82
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:46,884
Right down there.

83
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:48,972
I thought you said they were filed.

84
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,404
They were, once.
I mean, what's the point?

85
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,910
Doers are probably dust in the wind.

86
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,172
Thanks.

87
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:57,507
Don't want to waste any more
of your precious time.

88
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:01,529
Or cut into your 
web-surfing activities.

89
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,466
1920.

90
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,595
White woman stabbed.

91
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,913
Suspect, White male with...
get this,

92
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:18,146
slender build and black whiskers.

93
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:20,594
1918...

94
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,098
1910...

95
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,411
05...

96
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,990
it's a murder ledger, Scotty.

97
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,701
Going all the way back to 1903.

98
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,898
100 years of murder and mayhem.

99
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,094
All in a you-stash-it off the highway.

100
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,137
Yo.

101
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,609
I found Sadie.

102
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:57,442
I had to put them in plastic.
They were falling apart in our hands.

103
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,506
Sadie douglas. 
Colored female.

104
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,611
Nativity, Virginia.
Occupation, Prostitute.

105
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,782
Resided at a boarding house 
for colored women.

106
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,020
Proprietor was a miss Thea marion.

107
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,145
Women in the boarding
house were all hookers.

108
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:13,917
Sadie was raped and suffocated
at the hand of an unknown assailant.

109
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,223
Maybe our milkman.

110
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,210
A ticket for New York 
dated the night of

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,330
the murder found
in the victim's belongings.

112
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,488
Sadie's daughter 
was living in Virginia.

113
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,294
So why is she going to New York?

114
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,643
Last to see her was another tenant
at the boarding house,

115
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,010
colored female, 26.

116
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,739
Blanche D.

117
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,151
The rest of her name is missing.

118
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:37,858
You find Blanche, 
maybe we find out
why Sadie was going to New York.

119
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,473
Like the geezer's gonna remember.

120
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,408
You and Mr. Sensitivity track 
down the milk companies

121
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:45,395
that delivered to Sadie's 
boarding house.

122
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,277
Rush and Valens'll be on geezer patrol.

123
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,998
Looks like she fought back.

124
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:52,362
Something under her nails?

125
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:53,944
Back then it didn't matter.

126
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:55,459
It does now.

127
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:00,133
So if the family gives the green light...

128
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,776
maybe we dig her up?

129
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:05,223
Yep. Go talk to her granddaughter.

130
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,589
An exhumation?

131
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,069
Is that really necessary?

132
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,403
She may have fought her killer, Sarah.

133
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,210
We might get something useful.

134
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,816
Match the DNA to the doer 
or his descendants,

135
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:18,031
if either's in the system.

136
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:19,835
All right.

137
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,934
I'll sign whatever papers you need.

138
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:25,893
Last to see your grandmother alive
was a woman named Blanche.

139
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,285
You recall that name
in any of her letters?

140
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,450
Blanche...

141
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,893
Sadie wrote about a fair 
she went to with a Blanche.

142
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,785
That's them.

143
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,571
I had my first cotton candy today.

144
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,144
Like eating sugar from a cloud...

145
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,414
First thing you come up,

146
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,999
I'm gonna get you your own 
cotton candy, baby.

147
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:58,168
We'll be so happy together.

148
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:03,911
Your mama misses 
you like dry land for rain.

149
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,735
Love, mama.

150
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,943
She sent that photo with this letter.

151
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:15,066
Could I take this and the letters?

152
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,025
Will you bring them back?

153
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:21,490
They're all I have left of her.

154
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,653
Thing's making me seasick.

155
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:36,522
At least I got my roll on.
You can't even do yours.

156
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,363
Yeah.

157
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,725
Stop.

158
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,931
Damn thing's gonna explode.

159
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,506
Good lord.

160
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,871
Looks like a Baylor's
milk company delivered

161
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,204
to north 15th street through the 1930s.

162
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:57,052
Where Sadie's boarding house was.

163
00:08:57,052 --> 00:09:02,428
Board of revenue's got Baylor's
employee records 1930 to 1938.

164
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:05,606
But nothing for 1939.

165
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,913
So why is that year missing?

166
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,810
Fire.
January 1939.

167
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,590
Company stopped keeping
records after that.

168
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,530
Fire must've really wiped them out.
They went out of business a year later.

169
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,390
If this fire cost lives, newspapers 
would have carried accounts, right?

170
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,317
Yeah.

171
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:28,024
So maybe our milkman's in one 
of those newspapers?

172
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,088
We sure this place got prostitution
arrests before 1950?

173
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:37,679
Hookers, homicides,

174
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,581
the works.

175
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,036
If Blanche got picked up,

176
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,478
we'll find her here.

177
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:42,860
Wonder where she is now.

178
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,641
Wherever hookers who make 
it to 91 end up.

179
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:47,806
Let's hope it ain't hooker heaven.

180
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,331
Debbins, blanche.

181
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:51,916
This our girl?

182
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:59,346
She's a dead-ringer for this Blanche.

183
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,985
Arrested for prostitution in 1940.

184
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:06,991
Delaney manross paid for her bail.

185
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:10,322
Manross delaney? 
The candy man?

186
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,228
Delaney's delights?

187
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,855
You never had a Delaney delight?

188
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:15,668
No.

189
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:20,449
Guy's got a candy franchise.
Been raking it in forever.

190
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:24,387
Maybe our hooker's moved up
in the world, hmm?

191
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,694
Blanche debbins?

192
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,890
I ain't used that name in decades.

193
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,334
Whaddya you want, honey?

194
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,853
Philadelphia homicide, 
miss Blanche.

195
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,079
And the police, too.

196
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,026
Make me feel young again.

197
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,128
Honey! Manross!

198
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,556
- I'm watching my talk show, honey!
- Well turn it off, honey!

199
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,223
We got guests.

200
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,918
That was the depression, honey.

201
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,823
Times were hard all over,

202
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,770
especially for colored women
coming up alone from the south.

203
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,029
You did what you could 
to make ends meet.

204
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,803
Today's young people 
don't understand.

205
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,630
You all help yourself.

206
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:08,861
Try my number nine.

207
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:11,466
He gets on his high horse sometimes.

208
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,583
Don't mind him.
That's what I do.

209
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,389
Isn't that right, candy man?

210
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,744
Day she called me candy man,

211
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,807
I fell head over heels.

212
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,597
Been falling for her ever since.

213
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:24,620
Do you know anything about a trip

214
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,375
Sadie was taking to New York, 
miss Blanche, night she was killed?

215
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,021
She told us she was going to bed.

216
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,260
Not to New York.

217
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,519
Well, did Sadie ever mention anyone,

218
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,063
maybe a milkman she was afraid of?

219
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,643
That rebby boy, what's his name?

220
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:41,486
Southern rebel wannabe.

221
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:43,400
Wasn't more than northern white trash.

222
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,767
what was his name?

223
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,738
I don't recall, honey.

224
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,292
Pierce. That was his name.

225
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,812
Had burns all over his face.

226
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,533
I'm telling the story, honey.

227
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,690
He had burns all over his face.

228
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,936
Had it out for Sadie, too.

229
00:11:56,936 --> 00:12:00,682
All because of that damn milk.

230
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:19,947
I ain't getting out.

231
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,915
Not for no colored whorehouse.

232
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:26,266
Let them get their own damn milk.

233
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,622
Oh, here comes another one.

234
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,901
She looks almost white, don't she?

235
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,489
Come and get it!

236
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,088
Who that cooze think she is, huh?

237
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,315
Hey, dump it! / Huh?

238
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,494
I said dump it, Jonesy!

239
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,465
Let her clean it up.

240
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,990
Don't.

241
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:14,459
Sadie turned and walked
right back into the house

242
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,060
and left that milk out in the street.

243
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,246
That other milkman wasn't no better.

244
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:20,945
Didn't I say I'm telling the story?

245
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:23,511
This, uh, Pierce 
cause any other trouble?

246
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,621
Not that Sadie mentioned.

247
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,892
I avoided him and his milk truck after that.

248
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,124
But Sadie was afraid he might hurt her.

249
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:34,073
Wrote about him 
in a letter to her daughter.

250
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,757
Honey, Sadie couldn't read or write.

251
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,364
None of us could back then.

252
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,751
But she sent letters to her daughter.

253
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:41,626
Lots of them.

254
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:44,427
Well, she might have sent them,

255
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:47,887
but she sure didn't write them.

256
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,853
So who wrote Sadie's letters?

257
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,503
No one in the house could read or write.

258
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,768
A John, maybe?

259
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:00,261
Whoever it was might've
known more about the milkman.

260
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,915
Well, if the milkman was this guy Pierce,

261
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,333
then we might have the answer.

262
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,254
Newspaper from 1939.

263
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:08,976
Pierce mcclintock listed as a burn victim
in the Baylor's milk company fire.

264
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:11,771
The same company delivered milk
to Sadie's boarding house.

265
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:13,847
Yep. Fire was set by pissed off 
white workers

266
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,084
when the company hired blacks.

267
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,525
Killed ten, injured five more,
including Pierce.

268
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,386
But lucky for us,

269
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:24,373
newspapers back then printed 
the victims' addresses.

270
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,641
6922 north 5th street.

271
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:31,521
We just got to pray that Pierce
is still there. But yeah.

272
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:35,426
And I'll throw in a hail mary,
we find who wrote this letter.

273
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,653
So this is from 1939, huh?

274
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:39,555
Interesting.

275
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,009
Well, you can tell from someone's
handwriting who they are?

276
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:42,973
No.

277
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,535
Gender, age, personality type,

278
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,824
region of origin, pretty much, yeah.

279
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,071
How?

280
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:50,859
See these looped letters?

281
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:53,025
Curved forms combined 
with medium pressure

282
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,750
are usually indicators of femininity.

283
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,332
Writer was female?

284
00:14:57,332 --> 00:14:58,913
Eh, best guess.

285
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:02,520
Kinda K.O.'s our theory
of a John as the writer.

286
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,676
So who the hell wrote this letter?

287
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:08,010
Give me a few hours,
I'll have an answer for you.

288
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:12,665
What's that tell you?

289
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:15,032
Ah. Firm.

290
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,397
Logical.

291
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,078
Running from something?

292
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,508
Your grandfather, Pierce mcclintock,
owned this house?

293
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:28,683
He passed away ten years ago.
I inherited the house from him.

294
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:33,481
I can't understand what he has
to do with this woman's murder.

295
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,318
We don't know either, miss Reilly.

296
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,743
That's why we're here.

297
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,974
He was a good man, 
my grandfather.

298
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,244
Not a murderer.

299
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,451
So you'd agree to volunteer your
DNA to prove that?

300
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,319
I don't need to prove that to anyone.

301
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,600
We can get a search warrant.

302
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,530
For what?

303
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,376
An old man's knickknacks?
A dead man's diary?

304
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,457
Pierce kept a diary?

305
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,491
After the fire at Baylor's milk,

306
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,977
Pierce refers to something
called the fifth day in his diary.

307
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:02,088
- The fifth day?
- Mentioned it a bunch of times.

308
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,992
Don't you dare put that in your mouth.

309
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,908
I like cheez whiz on
my cheesesteak. So what?

310
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,934
Fifth day sounds like some 
sort of group Pierce started.

311
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,233
Guys from the milk place
injured in the fire.

312
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,526
What'd they do?

313
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:19,623
Doesn't say. 
But check that entry out.

314
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,118
May 1939.

315
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:27,432
Pierce's milk bottle war with Sadie.
He writes about it.

316
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:29,413
Thing Blanche told us about?

317
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,643
The aftermath...

318
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,680
Delivered to that colored's
boarding house today,

319
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,912
and that flooze just left them
bottles out on the street.

320
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:41,635
Damn it.

321
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,182
She didn't even pick them up.

322
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,127
Look at that coon, will you?

323
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:49,451
Standing there like
she runs the joint.

324
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,598
Fifth day ought to teach her a lesson.

325
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:55,193
Fifth day is right.
Take that gleam outa that quiff's eye.

326
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,281
Go on, Jonesy. 
You show her.

327
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:09,003
Here's your milk.

328
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:16,871
So maybe Jonesy was our 
evil milkman and not Pierce.

329
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,208
No Jonesy listed as a victim in the fire.

330
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,676
But all them fifth day guys got
messed up in the fire, right?

331
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,585
So how'd Jonesy get involved with them?

332
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,956
And what's he mean the fifth
day ought to teach her a lesson?

333
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,850
Maybe that's what their little club did,

334
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,334
teach lessons to women like Sadie.

335
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,553
Let's check criminal records
for Pierce mcclintock.

336
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,331
Maybe his fifth day activities
made the books.

337
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:38,204
Any word on the city okaying
the exhumation?

338
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:41,734
- Kite's been in court all day.
- So ask him tonight.

339
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,481
Or tomorrow.

340
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,633
I've called you three times
about this exhumation.

341
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,620
Closing arguments on the wicker job.

342
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,698
Besides, you've ignored
a few of my calls lately, too.

343
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:01,970
Been busy.

344
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,499
Well there you go.
We're both busy.

345
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,157
Anyway, we got direction on this job.

346
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,090
From '39. / So?

347
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,808
So it's hard to make a case
that the exhumation is pressing,

348
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:13,903
you know what I mean?

349
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:16,176
Maybe the judge should meet
the victim's granddaughter.

350
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:17,214
It's pressing to her.

351
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:19,078
Look, Fisk hasn't gotten to it,

352
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,905
but I'm guessing you'll need
more probable cause.

353
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:23,163
The city's strapped for cash.

354
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,406
And this granddaughter 
wants answers.

355
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,446
Don't we all.

356
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,905
- How're the cats, anyway?
- Good.

357
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,367
Call me.

358
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:46,406
When you hear from Fisk, I mean.

359
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:47,575
Sure.

360
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,179
Get anything in criminal records?

361
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,221
Long rap sheet on Pierce.

362
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,068
Assaults on males and females, 
all black.

363
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:57,931
Victims claimed they were attacked
by a group of young white males.

364
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:02,004
African american history museum
had a listing of hate groups in '39.

365
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,251
They list the Fifth day as one in Philly.

366
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,465
White supremacists.

367
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,964
Took their name 
from the Fifth day of creation.

368
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,219
God said, let us make man in our image

369
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,027
and let him rule over all the earth.

370
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,962
Meaning the white man, of course.

371
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:15,363
Mission was to terrorize blacks

372
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,439
coming up from 
the south looking for jobs.

373
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,406
Every Fifth day, 
they'd go on a rampage.

374
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:22,442
Beat up some black person
for the crime of being alive.

375
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:23,873
Murder part of their game?

376
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,050
Could be. 
Check it out.

377
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,877
The Fifth day.

378
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:32,076
Meet Pierce and our friend Jonesy.

379
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:35,581
Jonesy don't look burned.

380
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,865
Could have them 
where the sun don't shine.

381
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,149
Museum didn't have last names
on these clowns.

382
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,493
Id'd them here only by their
monikers or first name.

383
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:44,834
We'll keep looking.

384
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,950
Lilly still with the ADA?

385
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,593
Our handwriting expert came back
with a profile of the letter writer.

386
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,802
It was a kid.

387
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,080
Only child in the boarding house
was the owner's daughter.

388
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,059
Ten years old at the time 
of the murder.

389
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,809
I'll go pick up Lil.

390
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:17,731
This was miss Sadie's favorite room.

391
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,365
My mother took in boarders
during the depression.

392
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:28,915
I hear this place is a bed 
and breakfast now?

393
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,022
Owners say it was okay
for us to come in.

394
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,559
Bring you back to your old home.

395
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,042
I'm glad no one tore it down.

396
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,850
Did you write Sadie's letters here?

397
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,989
I wrote them, yes.

398
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,776
But the words were hers.

399
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,695
Her baby girl meant 
the whole world to her.

400
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:48,074
Do you remember writing about
a milkman who might hurt Sadie?

401
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:49,767
Jonesy.

402
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,293
I remember him well.

403
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,357
Why?

404
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:57,072
Because of what Sadie 
found in the milk.

405
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:02,396
Show her who's boss.

406
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,475
Here's your milk.

407
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:16,370
Nothing but poor white milkman trash.

408
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,157
Who he think he is, trashy ol'...

409
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:34,472
Poor white milkman trash
left a note, miss Sadie. / Shush, girl.

410
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,589
What's this say?

411
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,627
He says, forgive me.

412
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:52,627
Crazy white trash.

413
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,204
He's saying he's sorry.

414
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:57,097
I still say he trash.

415
00:21:57,097 --> 00:22:01,885
That ain't nothing but tinder for the fire.

416
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:04,030
Go on, Arletta.

417
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,992
Throw it in.

418
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,600
Wait.

419
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:16,120
Write something for me.

420
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,833
Why should I?

421
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:06,657
Because you are a lady.

422
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,607
I forgive you them.

423
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,897
What's your name?

424
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:35,853
My name is Sadie.

425
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,183
Those notes went on and on
for months,

426
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,042
right till she died.

427
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:59,556
Why did she think 
Jonesy would hurt her?

428
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,972
I think it was her heart, she meant.

429
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:06,646
Did they exchange notes
the day she was killed?

430
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:10,093
Jonesy wanted her to meet 
him here that night.

431
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:12,867
For a proper visit.

432
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:16,098
Miss Sadie kept each and every note.

433
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:19,002
Hid them behind the stove
where no one would look,

434
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:20,764
and no one ever found them.

435
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:21,669
Why not?

436
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,553
Because I took them.

437
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:26,345
Still have them, too.

438
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,072
I was raised by other people, Sadie.

439
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,126
Don't even know my own folks.

440
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,914
Jonesy was an orphan?

441
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:42,565
Maybe check the children's homes 
in the area, look for his name.

442
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,855
I'll care for your little girl,
even if she ain't my own,

443
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:49,244
because she's like me.

444
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,858
Every child deserves to be loved.

445
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,430
He wanted to make a life with her.

446
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,169
And take her kid in, too.

447
00:24:58,169 --> 00:24:59,946
A real 180 from the Fifth day.

448
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:04,365
So was Sadie killed by the man who
hated her or the man who loved her?

449
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:05,358
Pierce or Jonesy?

450
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:07,307
Maybe something happened that night
at the boarding house

451
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:08,918
that turned the tide of Jonesy's love.

452
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:11,098
Love can turn on a dime.

453
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,500
We know a candy man?

454
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:18,901
Do you love me, Sadie,
or do you love the candy man?

455
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,186
Blanche's husband.

456
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:32,392
Blanche and I, we...

457
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:35,226
just started dating,

458
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,949
and I, uh...

459
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:39,808
had a little crush on Sadie.

460
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:42,363
Don't you do this to me, Manross.

461
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:45,281
We can talk somewhere else,
if that would make it easier.

462
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:46,999
I was young...

463
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:49,239
foolish...

464
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:52,846
thought I could have my cake
and eat it, too.

465
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:56,212
Sadie never went for it.

466
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:59,269
Because she was involved with Jonesy.

467
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:04,641
- So you knew about the affair.
- Not till the night she was killed.

468
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,942
They hid it well.

469
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,636
You had to, back then.

470
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:11,513
If anyone found out,
one of them would be dead.

471
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,695
One of them is dead.

472
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:15,754
So how'd you find out?

473
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,300
the night of Sadie's murder...

474
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,347
We were all supposed to 
meet up at the juke joint.

475
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:24,089
I thought Sadie was going to be
there, but she... she wasn't.

476
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,455
So I went down to the boarding
house to get her.

477
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,616
We got to go tonight, Sadie.

478
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,208
We can't just go.

479
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,533
But we talked about this.

480
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:44,476
We was just going to visit.

481
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:48,013
- That's what you said in your note.
- I know, but...

482
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:51,322
Something came up.

483
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:52,298
What?

484
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,099
Look...

485
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:56,683
you gotta leave with me right now.

486
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,986
I already got the tickets,
the train leaves in a half-hour.

487
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:02,874
We go now and we could 
make it, Sadie. / I want to.

488
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:06,668
but why's it gotta be tonight?

489
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,546
What's wrong, Jonesy?

490
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,282
I went back to the juke joint.

491
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:19,327
Never seen her again.

492
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:23,190
Sadie was asking for trouble taking
up with that half-blind white boy.

493
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,741
What do you mean, half-blind?

494
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:28,955
Couldn't see out of one eye,
on account of the fire.

495
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:31,910
Why didn't you ever tell anyone
what you saw that night?

496
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,594
Because I didn't want to hurt...

497
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:39,647
the woman I love.

498
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:43,001
But I did, anyway.

499
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:50,546
Manross volunteered his DNA, 
fingerprints, shirt off his back.

500
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,379
You really think this guy's the doer.

501
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,977
Sometimes jealousy beats out 
love and hate, hands down.

502
00:27:55,977 --> 00:28:00,130
What I don't get is Jonesy was 
just gonna visit Sadie that night,

503
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,425
but then something happens.

504
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,935
And he's frantic to get out of town.

505
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:06,121
Something like what?

506
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:11,693
Pierce found out his 
white supremacist pal
fell in love with a black woman?

507
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:13,666
Threatens revenge on them both.

508
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,262
Got our milkman.
Nathan jones.

509
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,135
Just his name, but it's a start.

510
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:19,726
Grew up in a boys' home in Philly.

511
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:23,077
Ran him through autotrack, DMV,
even military records.

512
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,867
Got a thousand and one hits back.

513
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:29,178
Manross said Jonesy was injured 
in the fire, went half-blind later.

514
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:31,901
If he applied for military duty,
he'd have been rejected, right?

515
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:34,422
Wait a sec. My old man 
went through this.

516
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:38,203
A class 4F rejection.
Unacceptable for military duty.

517
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,928
Made him feel like he had to wear
a dunce cap, back in the day.

518
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,542
So we check Nathan jones
with 4F records.

519
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,717
Then maybe we finally nail 
down this son of a bitch.

520
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:48,665
Hey, rush.

521
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:51,666
Hi. how'd it go?

522
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:56,586
Judge Fisk K.O'd
the motion to exhume.

523
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,464
What?

524
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,212
Not enough probable cause.

525
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:04,300
We've got three possible 
doers here, Kite.

526
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,846
Look, it's an ancient case, okay?
And the bottom line is cold cash.

527
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,313
We don't have any to spare.

528
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,506
Sorry.

529
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,856
Sarah?

530
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,491
Hi. Any news?

531
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:28,188
I thought you might want these.

532
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:32,178
Notes to Sadie from
the milkman in her letter.

533
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:34,716
She wasn't afraid of him, Sarah,

534
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:37,311
she was in love with him.

535
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:44,383
I'll care for your little girl,

536
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,317
even if she ain't my own.

537
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,879
He wanted to take care of her.

538
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,015
And your mother.

539
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:58,790
I wish she had had a chance to 
see this, to, to know this.

540
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,290
Your mom?

541
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,809
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:07,778
It's okay.

543
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,287
I have some bad news, too, Sarah.

544
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:17,538
The D.A.'s office didn't
grant the motion to exhume.

545
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,147
But I'm the family.
Don't I have a say?

546
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,397
It's not that.

547
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:24,313
They need more of a reason to do it.

548
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:27,627
Solving my grandmother's murder
isn't a good enough reason?

549
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:30,135
It's complicated.

550
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:32,537
Financially difficult.

551
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,335
I'll pay for it.

552
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:35,528
Sarah...

553
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:41,995
An exhumation and autopsy
cost at least $10,000.

554
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,710
I've memorized all of her letters.

555
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,458
These past few days,

556
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:52,046
I feel as if I've come as close to 
meeting my grandmother 
as I ever will.

557
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,980
I know how she lived.

558
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,971
But I still need to know how she died.

559
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:05,667
Body is in an early stage
of dried mummification.

560
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,781
soft tissue.

561
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,158
desiccated down to the bone.

562
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:13,897
What are the odds on DNA, 
Dr. Barnsley?

563
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:17,389
This is my first 65 year old cadaver.

564
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:20,720
but DNA can last hundreds of years.

565
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,423
She fought back, 
broke three fingernails.

566
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,024
Maybe the doer left a souvenir.

567
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:30,686
The fingers are in advanced
stage of dehydration, but...

568
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:33,040
I might be able to
collect some scrapings.

569
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,547
Valens.

570
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,271
You're kidding.

571
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,729
Where?

572
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:39,813
All right.

573
00:31:41,072 --> 00:31:43,358
Jeffries and Vera found Jonesy.

574
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:45,038
He's still alive?

575
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,517
And kicking it in New York city.

576
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:53,541
Detectives, the index finger
of the right hand.

577
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,725
I think maybe we've got something.

578
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:59,859
Maybe Sadie's speaking 
from the grave.

579
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:07,057
Lab's trying Pierce's DNA 
from his granddaughter.

580
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,557
Manross', too.

581
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:11,420
1950's ticket, train to New York.

582
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,473
That's going on the cheap.

583
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,007
Taking SEPTA and New Jersey transit.

584
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:18,470
We gotta find Amtrak car way back.

585
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,198
take a free hop when we saw her.

586
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:23,614
Kite pissed you off, uh?

587
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:26,416
Not fight for the exumation.

588
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,224
It wasn't really his decision though.

589
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:33,793
Or was it something else with Kite
pissed you off?

590
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,955
I gotta be psychic in an answer outta you?

591
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:42,473
I, uh,

592
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:45,847
might've made a mistake.

593
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,127
Rush.

594
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,462
Okay.

595
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,461
Thanks, boss.

596
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,314
Manross' cleared.

597
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:00,325
His DNA didn't match to what was 
under Sadie's nails.

598
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,988
So candyman ain't our doer.

599
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,542
Gotta admit it. 
Glad for Blanche.

600
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:10,382
It must be nice to know and get 
someone grow old and useless with.

601
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:12,950
Yeah, it must be.

602
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:25,947
Grandpa?

603
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:28,193
You got visitors.

604
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,962
We're here about Sadie douglas,
Mr. Jones.

605
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,754
You remember how she got killed?

606
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,342
Raped, suffocated.

607
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:55,219
Hey. What are you saying to him?

608
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:56,802
Never mind.

609
00:33:57,314 --> 00:34:01,108
Frankie, why don't you go watch TV?

610
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,130
You didn't finish your soup, grandpa.

611
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,759
I'm done, Frankie.

612
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,869
Go on.

613
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:11,382
Yeah...

614
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:16,191
I remember how she died.

615
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:18,470
Cops back then said it was a John.

616
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,423
Oh, no, she wasn't a prostitute.

617
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:25,576
She lived in that house
because she had to.

618
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:29,064
Times were rough back then.

619
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:31,593
She didn't make her living hustling?

620
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:35,473
Sadie was a lady.

621
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,787
I gave her some money
from time to time.

622
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:40,240
Of course, she couldn't tell anybody

623
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,433
where she was getting it from.

624
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,090
Times being what they were.

625
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,395
Yeah.

626
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:48,029
And you being in love.

627
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:51,132
Who the hell is Sadie?

628
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:54,899
You know, her...

629
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,072
her little girl ought to know
that her mama was a lady.

630
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,768
She's dead.

631
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:03,398
Sadie's daughter.

632
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:05,271
Night of Sadie's murder,

633
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,081
you wanted her to leave town with you.

634
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,757
Why?

635
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,032
Because they were coming.

636
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,335
Who?

637
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,572
Them.

638
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,031
They were coming.

639
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:28,080
So then, I says to her,
you may look almost white,

640
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,948
but you is black as midnight.

641
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,539
Jonesy over there don't think I'm funny.

642
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,652
Oh, that's because he's giving
her his morning milk.

643
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:44,674
Time that bitch got a real taste
of white man's milk.

644
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,066
Yeah, sure.

645
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,784
Ain't that right, Jonesy?

646
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,887
Damn right. / Yeah!

647
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:53,815
Fifth day's rolling, boys.

648
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:54,748
Tonight!

649
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,331
Tonight!

650
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:04,442
Sadie?

651
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,839
Sadie!

652
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,631
Sadie!

653
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:10,166
I tried to save her,

654
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:15,498
but she wouldn't go.
I begged her, but she wouldn't go.

655
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,991
And I left.

656
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:19,845
A man loves a woman...

657
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,313
and leaves her to that?

658
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,912
All this was forever ago.
Why you care now?

659
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:27,980
Because a woman died,

660
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,154
and a family wants to know why.

661
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:34,175
And because what happens
in the past

662
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:38,293
never really goes away, does it?

663
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:42,445
No. It don't.

664
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:45,741
My grandpa didn't do nothing.

665
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:50,325
Would you volunteer your DNA
to prove that?

666
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,289
We got a sister lab here in New York.

667
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,521
It'll take a few minutes
to run your DNA.

668
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,002
And we can go right now.

669
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:58,605
He'll do it.

670
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,237
Right, grandpa?

671
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,039
I'll get your coat.
He didn't do nothing.

672
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,807
We'll settle this whole thing
in four or five minutes, Mr. Jones.

673
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:12,987
Lab's got a process called, uh,

674
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:16,272
electronic DNA sampling.
EDS for short.

675
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:19,058
Zaps your DNA through the internet.

676
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:22,338
Compares it with what we found
under Sadie's fingernails.

677
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:24,972
Finds a match.

678
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,831
Unless you want to skip the trip
and tell us what really happened?

679
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:34,063
If you have the question, ask it.

680
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,005
Thought I just did.

681
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,465
Come on, grandpa.

682
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:49,321
I'm ready.

683
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:52,649
Go ahead and ask your question.

684
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:57,203
What happened night 
Sadie was killed?

685
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,276
You gotta leave with me now.

686
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:03,724
Look, I already got the tickets.
Train leaves in half an hour.

687
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:06,278
We go now, we can make it, Sadie.

688
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:10,289
I want to, but why
it gotta be tonight?

689
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,339
What's wrong, Jonesy?

690
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:22,063
We gotta go.

691
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,017
- The train to New York is...
- New York?

692
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,068
But my daughter lives in Virginia.

693
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,291
We'll send for her.

694
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,262
You promised we was gonna be
a family together.

695
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:33,565
We will, but we gotta go now.

696
00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:34,723
What about her?

697
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,105
What about her, Jonesy?

698
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,185
That's, uh...

699
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,254
that's your daughter?

700
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:50,399
You promised to care for her
like she was your own, remember?

701
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:55,069
Because every child deserve loving,
you said.

702
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,659
You, uh...

703
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:03,134
never showed me that before.

704
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:07,644
Why won't you look at her, Jonesy?

705
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:11,273
You and me,

706
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:13,065
we can make it together,

707
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:15,867
because no one'll know, Sadie.
No one'll know what you are.

708
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,734
You barely look it, Sadie,
and you can pass.

709
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:18,718
Shut up!

710
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,689
She can't pass but you can.

711
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,966
And we can have a life together
and no one'll ever know.

712
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,877
Shut up!

713
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:28,287
Because I love you, Sadie.

714
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,673
I love you.

715
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:35,229
No. You don't.

716
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:39,868
Just told me so.

717
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:43,779
Well, look at what we got here.

718
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,924
Jonesy's getting a leg 
up on us, boys.

719
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,802
Ain't you, Jonesy?

720
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:11,660
Jonesy!

721
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:57,924
Let her be, Jonesy.

722
00:40:57,924 --> 00:40:59,825
What's wrong with her?

723
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:04,964
Get up!

724
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,513
Hey, I said get up!

725
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,142
Sadie...

726
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,028
Sadie...

727
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:41,389
Sadie was a lady.
