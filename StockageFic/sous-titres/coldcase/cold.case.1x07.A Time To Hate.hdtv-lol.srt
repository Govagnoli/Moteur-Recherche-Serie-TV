1
00:00:00,145 --> 00:00:02,126
# Does he love me #

2
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:04,078
# I wanna know #

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,692
# How can I tell if he loves me so? #

4
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:09,491
# Is it in his eyes? #

5
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,468
# Oh, no, you'll be deceived #

6
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,418
He could be a pro ball player.

7
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,441
He wants to be a lawyer.

8
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,416
I'll bet he wants to be a ball player.

9
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,322
If you're gonna marry him

10
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,893
it'll be better if he's a lawyer.

11
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:21,973
Why?

12
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:23,510
Then he won't be on the road.

13
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,846
All those baseball hussies?

14
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,171
Who said anything about getting married?

15
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,221
It never crossed your mind?

16
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,464
He keeps saying he has something

17
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,650
that he wants to talk to me about.

18
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,502
He sounds real nervous.

19
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:43,237
He's such a little boy

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,653
Hey, baby, how about a date?

21
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:15,165
# Seems like the other day #

22
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:18,788
# My baby went away #

23
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:25,917
# He went away across the sea #

24
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,444
# He said that we were through #

25
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:31,287
Hey, college boy.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,663
Did you see, uh, Callison choke

27
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:35,302
in the ninth inning last night?

28
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:37,543
He didn't choke. The ump robbed him.

29
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:40,059
The last pitch was low and inside.

30
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,949
# Oh, no #

31
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:45,049
# Oh, no, no, no, no #

32
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,167
# Remember #

33
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,383
# Walking in the sand....#

34
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,046
These degenerates.

35
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,222
You're not... you're not like
the rest of them.

36
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:53,685
'Cause I play baseball?

37
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:55,506
Are you sure you're a fag?

38
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:58,312
Are you sure you're Italian?

39
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,782
# What ever happened to #

40
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,571
Gin?

41
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,509
Yeah.

42
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,387
# The gal that I once knew #

43
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:14,618
# What will I do with it now #

44
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:15,117
# Remember #

45
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,608
God bless us nelly queens!

46
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:47,719
This domestic call

47
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,192
came in every Friday night... 
same damn couple.

48
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,435
We're finally shut'em down with 
the Blind Policeman routine.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,026
Blind Policeman?

50
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,124
Yeah.

51
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:01,942
We go to their door with 
a white stick and glasses,

52
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,601
start taking down their report.

53
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,968
Tell'em it's an equal opportunity program.

54
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:06,726
Grope their faces.

55
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,227
They're so thrown off 
they don't call for weeks.

56
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,915
You ever do Blind Policeman

57
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,036
in your patrol days?

58
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,782
Gets'em every time.

59
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:16,505
The, um...

60
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,721
The lady from Milwaukee is here.

61
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,422
She called twice yesterday 
for directions.

62
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,574
And she's an hour early.

63
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:26,483
Mrs. Holtz?

64
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:27,900
I know I'm early. I can wait.

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,835
No, no, it's fine.

66
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,192
I'm Detective Rush.

67
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:31,685
This is Detective Valens.

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,527
Is it true Milwaukee smells like beer?

69
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:36,831
I've lived there too long to know.

70
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:39,336
I haven't been here for a while.

71
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,062
What brings you now?

72
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:44,329
My son was murdered here in 1964.

73
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,872
He was a student.

74
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:46,881
A robbery?

75
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,976
They said it was, at first,

76
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,013
and then they said something else...

77
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:51,672
What?

78
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:55,651
They said he'd been at a gay bar.

79
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,304
My husband and I told them

80
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,516
that was wrong, that Danny

81
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:00,121
had a girlfriend.

82
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,379
The world has changed so much.

83
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,532
What was your son's name?

84
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:08,192
Daniel Holtz.

85
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,433
Please, have a seat.

86
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,824
You didn't know your son was gay?

87
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,769
I didn't wanna know.

88
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,637
And now, much too late,

89
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,008
I realize...

90
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,631
that kept me from really knowing him.

91
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,630
Cops back then

92
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,459
talk about other leads?

93
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,185
They mostly talked

94
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,273
about my husband and I being "nice people."

95
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,373
I have a heart condition.

96
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,583
Triple bypass.

97
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm running on fumes.

98
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,706
If there's one thing 
I want to settle before I go...

99
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:44,451
I think the police swept this 
under the rug.

100
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,006
And my husband and I helped them do it.

101
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:49,498
We didn't push.

102
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:54,202
We'll pull his case.

103
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:04,251
COLD CASE 1x07

A Time To Hate

네이트 드라마 24(http://club.nate.com/24)

104
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,181
I don't see a box.

105
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,573
Holtz with a "Z".

106
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:34,634
I know. There's no box.

107
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:38,654
Tough to live with, huh?

108
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:39,968
She must have told

109
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,994
the assigned detective to lay off.

110
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,032
A civilian tells you to lay off, 
you do it?

111
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:45,602
No. I go harder.

112
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,555
They got jumbled up a lot?

113
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:49,493
It's getting better.

114
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,014
People are learning the alphabet.

115
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,330
Except Vera.

116
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,935
Not every case is a box job.

117
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,025
If there isn't enough to fill a box...

118
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,621
Here it is.

119
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,447
Living in a group home.

120
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,213
Skimpy, huh?

121
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,269
Doesn't say High Priority.

122
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,715
Body was found in the alley

123
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,153
behind a bar.

124
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,719
In Queen Village. It's perfect.

125
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,741
This case gonna make you uneasy there, Scotty?

126
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,582
Nope.

127
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:16,985
Okay.

128
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:20,154
'64? That's back when patrol cars were red.

129
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:22,022
Mm. Random street murder.

130
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,669
Assigned detectives are both dead.

131
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,154
A gay bashing outside a bar 
that don't exist anymore.

132
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:29,024
Any you have three civilian interviews.

133
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:30,215
Sounds like a winner, huh?

134
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,922
We got a shot.

135
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,357
Joined the patron saints of lost causes?

136
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,411
Ain't lost if I'm looking for it.

137
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:39,544
Whoo, got him to drink the Kool-Aid?

138
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,949
So where you two gonna start?

139
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:41,759
Crime scene.

140
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,053
Queen Village.

141
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,270
That cracks him up.

142
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,071
Take Jeffries. 
Maybe he remembers the bar.

143
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,409
Someone saw what happened.

144
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,927
Someone always does that.

145
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,780
So we'll fine'em. Knock on doors.

146
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,209
Ask neighborhood people.

147
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,671
Someone'll remember our guy.

148
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,502
Another optimist.

149
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,906
The Hush Room was over there.

150
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,710
Corner of Sodom and Gomorrah.

151
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,230
Is that what the cops called it?

152
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,797
It's what the residents called it.

153
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,853
Nice, huh?

154
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,229
Now.

155
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,103
Neighborhood's changed?

156
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:37,714
Night and day.

157
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,120
All the neighbors are long gone.

158
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,185
Yuppies pushed'em out.

159
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,084
If it was so crappy

160
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,184
how come this Penn kid came 
all the way down here?

161
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:46,032
If you were in gay '64, 
this was the only game in town.

162
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,028
If you wanted to socialize,

163
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,725
this was the only place.

164
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,295
So why was Danny in this alley?

165
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,877
Got chased. Or ambushed.

166
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:56,791
Or lucky.

167
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,951
How would he have gotten back to 
campus in '64.

168
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,204
Subway.

169
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,665
The other direction from the Hush Room.

170
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,734
Maybe he found a friend 
who lived thataway?

171
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:09,473
Caller saw the body

172
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:12,031
"splayed and protruding in the alley..."

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,018
Who called it in?

174
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,215
Anonymous.

175
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,769
Boy, you got nada.

176
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,151
We got a neighbor who saw nothing,

177
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,426
a bartender who knew nothing

178
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,582
and a drag queen called Tinkerbell.

179
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,778
Plus a note tossed in that
Tinkerbell had a lead

180
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,968
on who liked to kick queer ass
in the neighborhood.

181
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,211
Let me guess. No follow-up, right?

182
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:28,090
Tinkerbell could have been

183
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,057
been a good ID, though.

184
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:31,127
Like a gang moniker.

185
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,845
That's how we find the thugs now.

186
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,315
You wanna look for Tinkerbell?

187
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,478
In Never-Never Land?

188
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:37,908
Or drag bars.

189
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,285
You sure that's the best job for me?

190
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:43,498
Definitely.

191
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,569
We should check the old arrest books

192
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,182
at the District Station House.

193
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,836
Figure out who the area bullies were.

194
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,466
I'll go to the district house with you,

195
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,867
you troll the bars with me.

196
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,291
Sure. I ain't scared.

197
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,113
So what violations are we looking for?

198
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:02,512
There wasn't a code for hate crimes.

199
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:04,973
Certainly weren't calling it 
"gay bashing".

200
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:08,767
So.... male-on-male assaults?

201
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:12,487
Assault, drunk and disorderly, 
disturbing the peace,

202
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,160
the whole constellation.

203
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:17,631
South Philly thugs.

204
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:19,529
I probably got

205
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,396
relatives in this book.

206
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,035
The Hush Room was managed

207
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:26,797
by Anthony DeSica from '61 to '68.

208
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:27,998
We'll go and see him.

209
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,543
Our boss, Lieutenant Stillman.

210
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:30,781
Yes, I remember.

211
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:31,599
Mrs. Holtz.

212
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,616
Thank you for looking at this case again,

213
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,767
so much time later.

214
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,201
Well, no case is too old to open again.

215
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,452
I never asked before.

216
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:44,296
Does it say in there 
how exactly Danny died?

217
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,700
Blunt force trauma.

218
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,781
Beaten?

219
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:55,392
Uh, with a round, wooden implement.

220
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,260
Baseball bat, maybe.

221
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,815
Oh, that would be too awful.

222
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,609
There wasn't much Danny loved 
more than baseball.

223
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,221
He was on the Penn team.

224
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,049
He must have been a decent player.

225
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,101
Shortstop.

226
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,217
In your original interview, Helen,

227
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:12,283
you mention Danny's fiancee.

228
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:14,146
Well, girlfriend.

229
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,551
He said "his girlfriend", at least.

230
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:19,150
The fiancee part maybe was 
my wishful thinking.

231
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,644
What about other friends?

232
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,308
Danny had a lot of friends.

233
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,917
Anyone that could have been 
a romantic interest?

234
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:27,783
Looking back?

235
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,632
You think he'll be there?

236
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:31,751
We are early.

237
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,219
I don't know, 
but my feet are killing me.

238
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,278
The Liberty Bell isn't that fascinating.

239
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,512
Oh, I hear him. Danny, it's us.

240
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,362
Honey, are you there?

241
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,764
Okay, Mom, uh, just a second.

242
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,715
This is a friend from the Law School.

243
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,630
We were just studying.

244
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,403
I thought you guys weren't coming back 
till later.

245
00:10:58,749 --> 00:10:59,477
I'm late.

246
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:00,664
I've gotta go.

247
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:02,045
So nice to meet you.

248
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:07,749
Did you guys have a good time?

249
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:09,757
We had a great time.

250
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,346
Your mother loved it.

251
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,650
What time are we meeting Deborah?

252
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,854
I don't even know that boy's name.

253
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:22,094
I know so little about his life.

254
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,214
Would Deborah know?

255
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:25,260
Maybe.

256
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,130
Last I heard of her, she was 
applying to med school.

257
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,448
You remember her last name?

258
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,332
I could get it.

259
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,446
She wrote us an awfully nice note 
when Danny died.

260
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,272
If you find that boy...

261
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,341
or whoever was important to Danny...

262
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,851
will you let him know I'm here.

263
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,243
Sure.

264
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,658
You, uh, still wanna go to the scene, ma'am?

265
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:45,868
I do...

266
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:49,827
but I'm feeling too tired now.

267
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,828
Maybe tomorrow.

268
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,358
I'll walk you out.

269
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,580
Hey.

270
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,391
Queen Village

271
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,519
bullies and thugs, circa 1964.

272
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,542
We extrapolated.

273
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,611
Thanks.

274
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,514
You boys have fun tonight.

275
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,629
We wanna talk to you about 
the Hush Room, Anthony.

276
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:19,499
Why you asking about ancient history?

277
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,311
That's the business we're in.

278
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:26,296
Ralphie, finish this, huh?

279
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:31,832
Everyone in the place don't need to know

280
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,567
I worked in a queer bar.

281
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:34,540
Yeah, okay.

282
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,710
My uncle owned it. What can I say?

283
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,987
I wasn't his favorite nephew.

284
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:39,641
I got the booby prize job.

285
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,655
You remember this kid, Danny?

286
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:45,762
Yeah, I liked him.

287
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:47,561
He was a baseball nut.

288
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,545
That was the year

289
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,857
the Phillies choked on the pennant race.

290
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,166
They were eight and a half games ahead,

291
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:52,733
and then they blew

292
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,244
ten straight in a row.

293
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,528
So I had something to talk with him about.

294
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,992
Any idea who killed him?

295
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:01,002
Everybody hated those people.

296
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,406
How about a drag queen called Tinkerbell?

297
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:04,856
You friendly with her?

298
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,904
They were all Tinkerbells to me.

299
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,342
You remember the night Danny died?

300
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:12,161
Yeah, 'cause of the raid.

301
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,485
What about it?

302
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,964
Cops was raiding us all the time.

303
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,232
So, we paid them off

304
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,921
to tip us as to when they were coming.

305
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:22,439
What did you do with the information?

306
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,282
I had a red light behind the bar.

307
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,612
If people were dancing

308
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:27,954
and the red light started,

309
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:28,735
they knew to hurry up

310
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,534
and get into boy-girl couples 
before the cops got there.

311
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,932
Only that night there was no warning.

312
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,405
How come?

313
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:36,469
I don't know.

314
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,884
Maybe my uncle was late with the payoff.

315
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,856
Cops ever do any damage?

316
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:11,595
Sure.

317
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,838
Those kind of raids was open season 
on them fags.

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,842
There's nothing on the books

319
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,358
about a police raid.

320
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,286
You're surprised?

321
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:22,005
This raid happened

322
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,453
the night of a murder.

323
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:24,871
That's pretty significant.

324
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:25,750
Yeah, well, things were different

325
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,272
back then, Scott.

326
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,001
The department isn't squeaky-clean.

327
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,108
There's a lot that's ugly in our past.

328
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:33,324
So, now we got two secret worlds

329
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:34,425
to break into...

330
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,672
gays and the history of the department.

331
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:41,552
You know about Russo's Raiders?

332
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:42,715
Heard stories.

333
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,900
Captain John Russo had an elite squad.

334
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,912
They took care of businesses...

335
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,641
payoffs, raids.

336
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:04,579
Probably gay bashing, too.

337
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,374
Nice.

338
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:08,219
So, how do we find out 
what cops were on this raid?

339
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,606
Not from the records, Lil.

340
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,805
That stuff was off the books.

341
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,113
How do we find out if Danny was beaten

342
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,528
with a nightstick, and not a bat?

343
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,577
We should stop calling them drag queens.

344
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:24,436
How come?

345
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,927
I think the last guy was offended.

346
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,578
I thought they call themselves
drag queens.

347
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,275
Don't mean we can.

348
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,230
Is it a slur? I don't think it is.

349
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,364
How about cross-dresser?

350
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:36,244
That's not offensive, right?

351
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,631
No, it's neutral.

352
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,940
All right, let's go with that one 
this time.

353
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,554
Hey, how's it going?

354
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,550
Super.

355
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:44,942
We're, uh,

356
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,855
looking for an older gentlemen...

357
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:49,427
a cross-dresser
who goes by the name of Tinkerbell.

358
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,493
Don't know him.

359
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,405
You got any old-timers that hang out here?

360
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:54,835
There's an older crowd 
in the rooms upstairs.

361
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,099
What rooms?

362
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,535
The conversation rooms.

363
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,515
Hell, we're not vice.

364
00:15:58,515 --> 00:15:59,660
We don't care about your rooms.

365
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,470
We're looking for a witness.

366
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:02,872
Go on up.

367
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,167
Just watch your body language

368
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,470
if you don't wanna get groped.

369
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,775
Danny's mom said

370
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:15,447
you two dated in college.

371
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:20,903
Mmm. I found about Danny the hard way.

372
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,027
I caught him and Hank kissing.

373
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:25,585
Damn you.

374
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:27,747
Damn you.

375
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:32,898
Everything's a big lie.

377
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,678
You're just a liar, using me?

378
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:40,341
No. I love you.

379
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,623
Nothing has to change.

380
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:44,291
What do you mean?

381
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,480
I mean, I do love you.

382
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,715
I love you.

383
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,381
But, not the way you're supposed to.

384
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:56,947
Tell me.

385
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,272
Not as much.

386
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:13,862
As much as what?

387
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,575
As I love him.

388
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,058
Did you kill him?

389
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,786
I mean, that would solve our case.

390
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,958
No, we became friends.

391
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:34,888
Oh. Gotta run.

392
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,603
Uh, can we walk with you?

393
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,178
Do you know how to deliver a baby?

394
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:39,496
I can learn anything.

395
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:43,840
You know, I always wondered

396
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,466
if it was just a random street thing.

397
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,136
Something really bad was happening
in his life.

398
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,250
Like what?

399
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,204
I think Danny was being blackmailed.

400
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,687
He needed a chunk of money, 
and obviously

401
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,214
he hadn't gotten a girl in trouble,

402
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:58,835
as we used to say.

403
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,357
But then I think,

404
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:02,653
why would anyone blackmail Danny?

405
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,212
He didn't have a cent.

406
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:05,734
He borrowed toothpaste.

407
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:09,112
Oops, last warning.

408
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:12,377
Um, did you know his boyfriend?

409
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:14,658
Hank? Mmm.

410
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:18,037
Ambitious, "Master of the Universe" type.

411
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,341
Law student.

412
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,946
What's Hank's last name?

413
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,356
Hank... oh...

414
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:24,576
What's the screwdriver?

415
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:25,440
Phillips?

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,477
Hank Phillips.

417
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:28,192
I don't know what became of him.

418
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,269
Danny didn't deserve what happened to him.

419
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,255
And even though I'm the one who got

420
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,262
her heart broken...

421
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,062
Danny wasn't cruel.

422
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,441
The world was.

423
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:47,529
The story is Tinkerbell had a nipple ring.

424
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,174
Way ahead of his time with that.

425
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,803
Anyway, in one of his many ass kickings,

426
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:53,772
a guy took a knife

427
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:56,097
and tried to slice that ring right off.

428
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,215
But there's a happy ending.

429
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,650
Tink got the nipple reconstructed for free

430
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,405
at the VA hospital.

431
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,989
A doc there wrote it up as a combat wound

432
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:07,157
she got fighting in Korea.

433
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:09,458
So, Tinkerbell was in the Army?

434
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,027
You know this doc's name?

435
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,841
Or Tinkerbell's?

436
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,807
But that old queen sure got beaten up a lot.

437
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:22,284
Someone at the VA may know her real name.

438
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,600
Thanks for your time.

439
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,470
Thanks for this.

440
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,193
What do you got?

441
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,820
A question I need answered.

442
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,015
Quietly.

443
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,729
The case is from 1964.

444
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,755
We need to know about a weapon.

445
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,039
Oh, no problem.

446
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,184
Oh, this is Shelly.

447
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:43,677
She's gonna do that research for us.

448
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:44,745
On the QT?

449
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,258
Mum's the word.

450
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:49,950
Thanks.

451
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:54,593
Vera should be finding true love
right about now.

452
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,233
Back in '64,

453
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,550
Tinkerbell came forward voluntarily.

454
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,743
Wanted to talk about being assaulted.

455
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,016
Tinkerbell's not a joke.

456
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,019
So far she's our most promising lead.

457
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,866
I got another one...

458
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,035
from the law school alumni office.

459
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:12,393
You found Hank?

460
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:14,589
Oh, yeah. Still lives in Philly.

461
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,357
Henry Phillips.

462
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,235
That Henry Phillips?

463
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,949
Your Honor. Detective Rush, Homicide.

464
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:26,469
I'm here on a personal matter.

465
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:28,398
A personal matter of yours?

466
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:30,386
Of yours.

467
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,404
I've reopened the Daniel Holtz case.

468
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,690
You and he were both at Penn in 1964.

469
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,992
You remember him?

470
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,551
He was murdered.

471
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,506
I understand you were close friends.

472
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,922
I'm not sure I can get into this.

473
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,579
I have no interest in prying into 
your personal life.

474
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,941
I'm just trying to solve a homicide.

475
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,036
We're looking into the theory 
it was a hate crime.

476
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,332
A gay bashing.

477
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,005
Who brought that theory to the table?

478
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,115
His mother.

479
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,368
I don't remember him well enough to help you.

480
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,842
Well, take my card

481
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:17,910
in case something jogs your memory.

482
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,352
Like the fact that you cared about him.

483
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,122
I don't talk publicly

484
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:26,120
about... these things.

485
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,715
I understand.

486
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:33,168
I'd like to help you.

487
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:37,119
But I need assurances...

488
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,700
It's between you and me.

489
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,796
No notes.

490
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:46,842
What do you wanna know?

491
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:50,405
Was Danny being blackmailed?

492
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:51,548
No.

493
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:52,059
His friend Deborah

494
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,664
said he needed money all of a sudden.

495
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:56,071
He wasn't being blackmailed. I was.

496
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:56,687
By who?

497
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:57,467
The management

498
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,902
at a certain bar.

499
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,703
The Hush Room.

500
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:02,733
I went to that rat hole with Danny twice,

501
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,168
and almost had my life ruined.

502
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,316
They were running an extortion scam 
out of there.

503
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:08,377
And a young law student

504
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:09,529
was a good target.

505
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:15,074
You couldn't be a lawyer 
if you were gay back then.

506
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,470
Moral turpitude.

507
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,992
So, why was Danny trying to get money

508
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:20,448
if you were the one blackmailed?

509
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:21,906
He felt responsible.

510
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,621
He was responsible.

511
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:27,379
I didn't mind being behind closed doors,

512
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,033
but Danny wanted to be out, on a scene.

513
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,527
That make you angry?

514
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,399
You think I killed him?

515
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:38,947
In a disgusting alley... 
as a career move?

516
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:40,696
Not my best theory.

517
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:46,298
You know who really hated Danny?

518
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,687
His teammates on the baseball team.

519
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,868
Hey, these yours?

520
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,498
I know this place.

521
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:05,639
You do?

522
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:10,534
Yeah.

523
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,653
Do you go there?

524
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:14,674
I may have, yeah.

525
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:23,674
Faggot.

526
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,149
From that day on,

527
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,774
they made things really bad for him.

528
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:42,594
Beaned him on purpose.

529
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:43,744
Wouldn't sit with him on the bus.

530
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:45,050
He ended up quitting.

531
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,563
But, in these days, 
there was no such thing

532
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:51,151
as a gay athlete,
not at Penn or anywhere else.

533
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:56,199
Thank you

534
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,879
for talking to me.

535
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,310
I need it to stay confidential.

536
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,938
There's one person

537
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:04,545
I'd like to tell about our conversation.

538
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,633
Danny's Mom's in town.

539
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,236
She'd like to hear from you.

540
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:13,751
I hear you're running a dice game

541
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,269
out of your warehouse, Anthony.

542
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,291
Dice game. What?

543
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,145
Yeah. I heard Bingo, dogfights.

544
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:19,550
Oh, all kinds of things to write you up on.

545
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,621
Come on, you guys what do you want with me?

546
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,117
Tell us about

547
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:23,267
the extortion scam.

548
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:24,855
Extortion? Why would we do that?

549
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,275
You tell us.

550
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:27,296
We was printing money,

551
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,357
selling watered-down drinks to the queers,

552
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:30,247
and it'd be bad for business.

553
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:31,312
Talk about bad for business...

554
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:33,279
how much, uh,
you charge for the dice game?

555
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,595
Ah, come on.

556
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,944
Okay.

557
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:46,102
My moron cousin hid a camera,

558
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:47,688
tried to hit up a couple of guys,

559
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,421
looked like they had something to lose.

560
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,026
My uncle almost ripped his throat out

561
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:51,899
when he found out.

562
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,530
For the reasons I cited above.

563
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,453
Bad for business.

564
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,173
My uncle shut him down.

565
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:58,271
End of story.

566
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:01,322
Believe me,

567
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:04,475
my cousin was way too small-time to 
plan a murder.

568
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,183
The raid that night... I need a name.

569
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,889
They taped over their name tags.

570
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,019
You usually got warning.
Who gave it to you?

571
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,464
The bagman for the District Captain.

572
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:13,084
The guy who picked up

573
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:13,953
the payoff envelopes?

574
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:14,680
Contributions

575
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,646
to the police Athletic Foundation.

576
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:17,797
His name.

577
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:19,842
He was a rookie.

578
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,640
Nelson.

579
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:27,059
Was Officer Nelson

580
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,942
at the bar the night Danny was killed?

581
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:30,944
He was always there.

582
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:35,292
That's very helpful, Anthony.

583
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,586
No. This is not a put-on.

584
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,910
He went by the name Tinkerbell.

585
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,069
A Korean War vet.

586
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:44,969
His chest area got

587
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:46,944
in a little accident with a knife.

588
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:50,969
43 guys named Nelson on the job 
in the '60s.

589
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,501
So we track them all down.

590
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:53,213
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,867
A cross-dresser. Had a nipple ring.

592
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:56,968
The Penn baseball team?

593
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:57,510
Yeah?

594
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,785
They were in Ithaca, New York

595
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:00,007
the weekend of your murder.

596
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,442
An away game.

597
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:02,174
The entire lineup.

598
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,312
You look that up?

599
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,171
I happen to have every 
sports record known to man.

600
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:08,442
Memorized.

601
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,259
20 less guys you got to check out.

602
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,384
We have so many other suspects, 
it's sad.

603
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:16,007
Blackmail ring, rogue cops,
neighborhood thugs...

604
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:16,636
No shortage of people

605
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:18,278
who had it in for a gay kid.

606
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:19,628
I got the results you asked for.

607
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,045
He's okay.

608
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,153
Oh, thanks.

609
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,090
I called in a favor at the FBI lab.

610
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,295
We  used a pig's head to simulate 
the bruise and wound pattern

611
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:30,726
for the weapon, and then compared that

612
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:31,971
to the victim photographs.

613
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:32,952
And?

614
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:33,573
And that kid was not

615
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:34,915
killed with a nighstick.

616
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:36,271
Well, that's a relief.

617
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:37,508
Thanks.

618
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:38,264
Thank the pig.

619
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,473
What's your guess about the weapon?

620
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,647
My money's on the classic baseball bat.

621
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,738
Thanks.

622
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,185
I found Tinkerbell.

623
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,694
Real name... George Polk.

624
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,366
Mr. Polk?

625
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:58,540
George Polk?

626
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:02,722
Detective Rush, Philadelphia Police.

627
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,158
Go away.

628
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:09,329
I'm here about the 1964 murder

629
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,913
of Daniel Holtz outside the Hush Room.

630
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,950
You wanted to give a statement to police.

631
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,660
I'm here to take it.

632
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:27,064
It took you a while to get back to me.

633
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:30,888
Yes, it did.

634
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,220
Decided to get dressed up?

635
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,483
Yes, I did.

636
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:41,614
You know, in my day, I was beaten up

637
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:44,722
by every cop and fag basher

638
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:46,227
in South Philly.

639
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:49,228
Hmm. Cops beat you up for no reason?

640
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:51,572
The reason, young man, was hatred.

641
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,623
And career advancement.

642
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:54,710
Now, Captain Russo

643
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,239
loved his fag-bashing.

644
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,183
We can only speculate why.

645
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:00,834
These are mug shots

646
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,149
from the early '60s.

647
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:04,362
Arrests out of the Third District.

648
00:28:04,678 --> 00:28:05,858
Is there a magnifier?

649
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:06,577
Yes.

650
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:09,419
Thank you.

651
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,041
These are old eyes,

652
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,023
you know, they need help.

653
00:28:15,801 --> 00:28:17,097
Can I ask you something?

654
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:18,961
Please.

655
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:21,947
Why did you flaunt the way you were

656
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:24,351
if you knew people were gonna attack you for it?

657
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,115
You're a homicide detective?

658
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:28,446
He's new.

659
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,064
With what you see

660
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,952
people do, you get upset 'bout 
how a man dresses,

661
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,662
and who he loves?

662
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:37,235
I ain't upset.

663
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,734
I'm just wondering, if you're getting

664
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,567
beaten up 'cause you dress like a woman,

665
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,176
and you don't wanna get beat up,

666
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,538
why not stop dressing like a woman?

667
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:47,291
'Cause I was never a practical girl.

668
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:55,141
Oh, he's one of them.

669
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:56,357
One of who?

670
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:57,206
The local monster.

671
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:58,266
I remember his eyebrows.

672
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,318
He was the ringleader.

673
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:00,564
What do you remember him doing?

674
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,289
I remember him hitting me and kicking me

675
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,474
and throwing things.

676
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:05,280
You're sure about him?

677
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,058
I'm sure. His mother would egg him on

678
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:08,924
from the window of their little slum.

679
00:29:09,677 --> 00:29:11,429
And his name

680
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:12,832
is Brian.

681
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:16,161
Timmy O'Brien.

682
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:16,797
Lived around the corner

683
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,006
from the Hush Room.

684
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:19,672
Uh-huh.

685
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,194
Fourth floor window, right?

686
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:24,958
Apartment 419.

687
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,981
If the local thugs

688
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,492
did in that poor boy,

689
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,577
this one was a part of it.

690
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:34,958
Thank you, Mr. Polk.

691
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,937
That Danny was a good one.

692
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,636
Lot of spunk.

693
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:43,151
But heartbroken

694
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,121
because the Phillies did something 
with a pennant.

695
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,417
They blew the pennant race in '64.

696
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,585
That was it.

697
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,545
That boy was thrown off of 
the baseball team.

698
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:54,752
And he was always trying

699
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:57,226
to organize a game at the bar.

700
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,211
I was going to be

701
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,113
a cheerleader.

702
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:06,744
I get the vapors just thinking about it.

703
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:07,808
Whoa.

704
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:25,067
You, uh, Timmy O'Brien?

705
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:25,492
Yeah.

706
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,035
What's it about?

707
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:32,317
Just, uh, following up a dog call

708
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,426
from a long time ago.

709
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:34,071
All right.

710
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:35,903
You recognize this individual?

711
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,086
Maybe.

712
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:41,022
Ever get on her case?

713
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:41,801
Her?

714
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,218
Word is, you took care of business

715
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,817
with the local drag queens.

716
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:48,811
I didn't ask them to come to
my neighborhood,

717
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,559
start parading around on the streets.

718
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,503
I hear you.

719
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,306
But I never hurt nobody.

720
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,736
I'm just carrying out a duty here.

721
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:57,929
So, uh,

722
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,835
what did you do to these fine citizens?

723
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,338
Kid stuff.

724
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,314
You know, harassing them, like.

725
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:05,707
Throwing stuff.

726
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:07,663
Bottles, sticks?

727
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:09,585
Chinese takeout.

728
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,261
How's that work?

729
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:13,445
Well, when we had some leftovers,

730
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,432
see a couple of fags on our street,

731
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:16,723
we'd dump the food on them.

732
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:17,617
What's that,

733
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:19,636
assault with a deadly egg roll?

734
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:22,939
Did you ever see this kid?

735
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:26,441
Nah.

736
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,149
'Cause he was a local fag.

737
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:35,897
I don't recognize him.

738
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,546
Okay.

739
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,473
I ain't proud of all that stuff.

740
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,456
I wouldn't want my kids to know I did it.

741
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,984
It was just pranks.

742
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:50,536
Have a good day.

743
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,461
Your Honor.

744
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:02,247
Thanks for letting me know.

745
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,420
Yeah, I wanted to meet her.

746
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,820
The hotel said she was brought here 
last night.

747
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,895
Mm. How's she doing?

748
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,276
Have you gone in?

749
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,619
No. I was nervous.

750
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:18,177
A grown man, and I'm scared to meet his mom.

751
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,137
So I'll go with you.

752
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,156
Helen, this is Hank.

753
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,010
You're the boy who ran out of the room.

754
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,080
I guess so.

755
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,264
Hank.

756
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,387
Any progress?

757
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:50,974
We've got at least

758
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:52,692
one person of interest.

759
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:53,661
Who's that?

760
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,619
Local thug in the neighborhood.

761
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:58,061
Told a story about throwing 
Chinese leftovers

762
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,218
at gay men out on the street.

763
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,349
You talked to that man?

764
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:04,525
Yeah.

765
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,176
You wanted to know about Danny.

766
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,315
In many ways, Danny was a man of his time.

767
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:16,779
He lied about his life to some people.

768
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:19,845
To you.

769
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:23,151
In other ways,

770
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,948
Danny was ahead of his time.

771
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,074
How?

772
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,638
He didn't hate himself.

773
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:33,816
Somehow, he knew

774
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:36,374
he had a right to exist.

775
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,646
You haven't told them, have you?

776
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:43,328
My parents? You crazy?

777
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:45,132
No way, huh?

778
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,567
If they even suspected I was rooting

779
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,675
for the Phillies against the Braves,

780
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:54,318
I'd be dead to them.

781
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,826
I could never go home again.

782
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,321
Hey, guys... ladies.

783
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:00,250
How's it goin'?

784
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,030
Here's a little Chinese for you.

785
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:05,627
I hear faggots like Chinese food.

786
00:34:13,326 --> 00:34:13,833
Hey!

787
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,664
Forget it.

788
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:17,561
No, I wanna see their faces.

789
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,024
Officer...

790
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:19,788
Come on, Danny.

791
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:20,792
Officer.

792
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,169
Danny was brave.

793
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:37,748
I wasn't.

794
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:39,649
What happened

795
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:41,640
after the Chinese food?

796
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:47,785
I went home, uh...

797
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,452
Danny came over later,

798
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,613
and we fought.

799
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:52,724
He stormed out... 
obviously went to the Hush Room,

800
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,812
and... and I never saw him again.

801
00:34:57,725 --> 00:35:00,115
Do you know the name of the officer 
he spoke to?

802
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:02,179
I have the paperwork.

803
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:04,602
Danny threw it at me that night,

804
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,601
called me a coward.

805
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,102
You kept it?

806
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:12,628
Anything I had of his, I kept.

807
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:14,709
You loved him.

808
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,095
Yes.

809
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,548
I'm glad.

810
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,071
Officer Paul Nelson took the report.

811
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:31,484
Nelson... same name Anthony gave us.

812
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:34,010
In '64, he was a rookie 
in the Third District.

813
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,181
He worked under the command of
Captain John Russo.

814
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,215
A Russo's Raider.

815
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:40,905
He booked the city

816
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,399
when he retired. Lives out in Alden.

817
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:44,983
Works at the cop shop

818
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:46,658
at the union hall.

819
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,563
Go pay him a visit.

820
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,086
Paul Nelson?

821
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:53,951
Yes?

822
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,234
Lilly Rush, Homicide.

823
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,684
Scotty Valens, same.

824
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,172
What can I do for you?

825
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,800
You took a complaint of harassment

826
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,427
from a Daniel Holtz in 1964.

827
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,058
Neighborhood boys

828
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:04,531
threw food at them.

829
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,405
This kid was murdered the same night.

830
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,299
Yeah.

831
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:15,868
Wanna tell us what you know?

832
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,031
I knew this day would come.

833
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,289
Let's meet tomorrow.

834
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:32,970
That kid Danny had moxie,

835
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:36,278
coming to me with the noodles droppin'
from his forehead.

836
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,867
I asked him if he was the shortstop

837
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,953
on the Penn baseball team,

838
00:36:40,758 --> 00:36:42,330
'cause I recognize him.

839
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,712
I went to some of them games.

840
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:46,185
You talked about baseball 
at a time like that?

841
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:47,745
I was embarrassed.

842
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:49,078
Embarrassed because he was a fag

843
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,820
and you had to talk to him?

844
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:51,944
I thought

845
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:55,454
the whole situation was embarrassing.

846
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:57,158
How old were you?

847
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:59,307
Twenty-two.

848
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:01,212
I just started on the job.

849
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:03,368
I thought, I'm set.

850
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:06,806
Next thing you know, 
I'm John Russo's bagman.

851
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,650
That didn't sit right with you?

852
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,500
Oh, I loved it at first.

853
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,171
It was like going behind the curtain

854
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:13,556
in the Wizard of Oz...

855
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:15,360
see how the whole thing works.

856
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,106
And the night of Danny's murder...

857
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:18,525
how'd it work then?

858
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:22,634
I took the kid's report. That's it.

859
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,371
Then they called a raid

860
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:28,015
that night... late...

861
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,627
and I saw him again.

862
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:44,589
# When you're young and so in love as we #

863
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:50,475
# And bewildered by the world we see #

864
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:53,761
# Why do people hurt us so? #

865
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,668
# Only those in love would know #

866
00:37:56,668 --> 00:38:01,946
# What a town without pity can do...#

867
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:07,269
Next time I saw him, he was dead.

868
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,932
You know what, Nelson?

869
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:12,675
That's the part I'm not buying.

870
00:38:16,432 --> 00:38:17,857
I don't need to be talking to you.

871
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:19,585
But you are. Why?

872
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,001
You feel guilty about something?

873
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,699
I'm telling you what I know.

874
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:27,222
Me and My partner chased a patron 
to the alley.

875
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,567
We saw the kid's body

876
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,432
splayed and protruding from the alley.

877
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:33,717
"Splayed and protruding."

878
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:35,397
That's what the caller said.

879
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,202
You made that anonymous call.

880
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,011
Don't do this to me.

881
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:45,950
Look... we're all cops here.

882
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,885
It'll be handled right.

883
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,109
A cop didn't do this.

884
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:53,522
Forensics says it was a cop.

885
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:55,449
Weapon was a nightstick.

886
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,263
That's wrong.

887
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,346
It's what the lab says.

888
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:58,663
Absolutely wrong.

889
00:38:58,663 --> 00:38:59,064
Which you know

890
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:00,283
is true, because you were there.

891
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:02,283
- You saw what happened.
- I didn't see...

892
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,574
all of it.

893
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,034
You walked away?

894
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:07,849
I didn't know

895
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,862
He was going to die.

896
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:14,206
They were beating on him, and...

897
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,649
yeah...

898
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,902
We looked the other way.

899
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:22,868
Who were they?

900
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:24,642
Some guys I knew in the neighborhood.

901
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,453
Names.

902
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:26,245
I don't know.

903
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:28,077
You can't not know.

904
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,051
It's what you're here for.

905
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,574
I wanna show you something.

906
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:40,412
That's my son

907
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,018
and his partner.

908
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,090
He thinks

909
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,771
his old man is a good guy.

910
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,830
Which one's your son?

911
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,259
So do it for him.

912
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,385
Be a good guy.

913
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:23,900
Hi, Timmy.

914
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:25,706
Paul Nelson.

915
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,273
Your brother John's friend.

916
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:32,022
Yeah. It's been, like... ten years...

917
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,426
Since your dad's wake.

918
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,418
What are you doing here?

919
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:45,786
He's here giving you up, Timmy.

920
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:46,711
You're goin' down for the murder

921
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:49,528
of Daniel Holtz in 1964.

922
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:51,138
Paul...

923
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:51,510
Sorry.

924
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,347
Paul, you can't... No, you...

925
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:55,326
You gotta tell'em what happened.

926
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:57,267
You gotta tell'em what you really saw.

927
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,954
It was self-defense.

928
00:40:59,393 --> 00:40:59,996
You gonna lie

929
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:01,672
or are you going to tell the truth?

930
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,429
I'm gonna tell the truth, Timmy.

931
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,683
Where do you come from, sweetheart?

932
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:16,033
You better start running.

933
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,674
Faggot.

934
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:19,932
Run, run, faggot.

935
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:20,677
Run, fancyboy

936
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,283
Keep running.

937
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:24,743
Keep going.

938
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:32,687
What are you stopping for?

939
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,081
What are you gonna do?

940
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:35,272
Come here.

941
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:35,962
Queer.

942
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:36,964
Coward.

943
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,963
Come on.

944
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:51,914
# To everything, turn, turn, turn #

945
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:56,973
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn #

946
00:42:56,973 --> 00:43:04,151
# And a time to every purpose 
under heaven #

947
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:08,216
# A time to be born, a time to die #

948
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:12,015
# A time to plant, a time to reap #

949
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:15,872
# A time to kill, a time to heal #

950
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:23,044
# A time to laugh, a time to weep #

951
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:28,582
# To everything, turn, turn, turn #

952
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:33,931
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn #

953
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:41,230
# And a time to every purpose 
under heaven #

954
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,219
# A time to build up,
a time to break down #

955
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:50,239
# A time to dance, a time to mourn #

956
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,126
# A time to cast away stones #

957
00:43:53,126 --> 00:44:00,383
# A time to gather stones together #

958
00:44:01,052 --> 00:44:06,126
# To everything, turn, turn, turn #

959
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:11,330
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn #

960
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:18,910
# And a time to every purpose 
under heaven #

961
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,782
# A time of love, a time of hate #

962
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:27,808
# A time of war, a time of peace #

963
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:30,728
# A time you may embrace #

964
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:38,182
# A time to refrain from embracing...#
