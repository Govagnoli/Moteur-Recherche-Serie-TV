00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,890
The floolwing story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,510
March24,1947

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,450
All right,open up,son.
I can't do it by myself.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,090
Come on,no half-steppin',ladies.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,240
push it up.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,090
six feet,girls.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,730
First shift burrowed under the river five feet.
That means that we go six.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,990
That's a nice shiny new helmet there,nate.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,840
Couldn't get one with a little flashlight?

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,650
Wife wouldn't let me back down
in the hole without a hard hat.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
At least your old lady cares
if you get cracked in the dome.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,620
Oh,my sister treating you that bad these days?

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,230
What do you mean "these days"?

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,590
Tell you what alice cooked up last night,
but I don't want to rub it in.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,390
You're lucky you got a woman like that.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,990
Woman who don't give a man no quarter,you mean.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,230
cave-in or blowout don't get your father-in-law,
that cough will.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,850
He ought to retire.
Let someone carry the weight of foreman.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,040
- That'll be you,donny.
- You think?

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,810
Like I said,my wife's counting on you
to bring all of us up out of here.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,570
All them stories you tell...

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,930
it'd be nice to finally meet old alice.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,920
Not in this here world.

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,860
Down here every joe's blood runs brown--
same as the muck.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,740
But not up there.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,350
- Get back to work.
- Hey,nate!

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,890
Watch it there,nate.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,460
Eight million ways to die every day.

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,120
Not today.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,590
Not today.

32
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,970
Figure on stretching that shirt out another day?

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,960
You want to check my shorts there too,hoss?

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,030
Transit workers found the body expanding the subway.

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,080
Five stories under the river.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,640
I ain't going down there.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,800
What's the matter,don't like tunnels?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,060
They got rats the size of badgers.

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,220
No,man,even the rats hate it down there.

40
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,730
Bulldozer broke through an old service tunnel.
Found the bones.

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,740
Still Adult male.
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Found behind a tunnel that got sealed in 1948.

43
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,580
Guy needs a paleontologist,not a detective.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,720
Could be one of those mole people?

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,430
Wasn't a mole,this was a sandhog.

46
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,680
- Sandhog?
- Urban miner.

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,660
Died with his boots on.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,150
S "compressed air worker,number 505.
"If found sick or unconscious,

49
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,450
"return to medical decompression lock
at bertleman construction site."

50
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,740
Sandhogs were required to carry those badges at all times,
in case of an attack of the bends.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,290
How's a miner get the bends?

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,460
Working deep underground in compressed air.

53
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,860
Tunnels,subways,sewers...
you name it.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,350
Say if it's deeper than a grave,a sandhog dug it.

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,350
Looks like this poor schmuck might have dug his own.

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,550
You see those miners trapped on the news,
they move heaven and earth to get a guy out.

57
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,790
At least,recover a body.

58
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,930
This guy didn't get left behind.

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,780
He got buried on purpose.

63
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,380
donuts...
is that some kind of cop joke?

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,710
What,cops are the only ones allowed
to eat fried dough?

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,800
- I never eat donuts.
- Never?

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,410
- oh,you have sugar on your cheek.
- Come on and get it.

67
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,530
- Get over here.
- Got to eat a donut first.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,440
- I don't want a stupid donut.
- No,first.

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,080
Come on.

70
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,490
Fine.

71
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,530
Give me the bag.

72
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,430
Attagirl.

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,080
Pretty damn good.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,600
I love you.

75
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,110
Yeah?

76
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,950
Yeah,definitely.

77
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,830
I,uh...

78
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know what to say.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Aw,you're a detective,you'll figure it out.

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,050
Look,okay,I gotta run.

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,060
- I'll call you later?
- Sure,right.

82
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,560
I had osha check the state archives
on this one...

83
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,190
compressed air 505 was registered
as a john donovan.

84
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,820
John "boomer" donovan.

85
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
You familiar?

86
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,280
Down-in-the-muck sandhog became head
of the local 37 back in the '40s.

87
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,100
He was reported missing in 1948.

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,670
Donovan turned hero after he took on
management then mysteriously disappeared.

89
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,010
Know your sandhog history,boss.

90
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,420
Neighborhood I grew up in,lil,you either
became a cop,a fireman or a sandhog.

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
And I got this thing about being
burned or buried alive.

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,740
So how do we know oui@guy wasn't
just crushed in a cave-in?

93
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,380
disappeared on a sunday back in '48.

94
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,090
He wasn't down there working.

95
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,620
Theory at the time was donovan took on
management in a labor dispute.

96
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,550
Thought he bought himself a pair of cement shoes
and a one-way ticket to the bottom of the river.

97
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,770
Couldn't prove it without a body.

98
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,970
Only surviving next-of-k's a brother-in-law.
Robert mccallister.

99
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,180
An old sandhog?

100
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,510
Former head of the union.

101
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,200
If he's not at home,check down at
mulrooney's in devil's pocket.

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,260
What's that,a sandhog bar?

103
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,970
We got jones tavern,they got mulrooney'S.

104
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,590
Keep donovan's photo up there with
the top-shelf whiskey.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,790
They're still buying him shots.

106
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,500
Donovan was married to your sister?

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,330
Yeah,I introduced 'em.

108
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,690
A lot of sandhogs in your family?

109
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,450
Third generation.

110
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,280
My old man spent 30 years in the hole.

111
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,690
Big mac.

112
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,030
Nice lighter.

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,530
Thanks.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,050
A gift from big mac on my wedding day.

115
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,170
Only thing that could hold a
flame in the tunnels.

116
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,810
We hear management had it out
for your brother-in-law.

117
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,460
Sam bertleman did.
Everyone knew it.

118
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,360
Head of bertleman construction?

119
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,800
None other.

120
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,260
The guys were going deaf down in the hole,
getting killed,maimed.

121
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,510
Didn't stop that greedy bastard.

122
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,760
But donovan tried to.

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,830
Donny became foreman,he was the only one
that had the stones to take the boss man on.

124
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,530
When did he start organizing the men?

125
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,130
Just after his pal nate died in the hole?

126
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,980
There was no stopping him.

127
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,860
Bobby

128
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,990
bobby!
- bobby!
- I'm here,pop.

129
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,860
Where's donny?

130
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,890
donny!

131
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,910
donny,you're ok?

132
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,260
you son of a bitch!

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,390
There was no masks in there,nothing!
You knew that!

134
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,290
- Leave it be!
- We didn't have a chance!

135
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,300
Nate?

136
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,290
nate?!

137
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,310
You're his wife?
You're alice?

138
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,370
Where is he?
Where is my husband?

139
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,010
You left him down there?

140
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,780
It happened so fast.

141
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,090
We could barely see.
The smoke was everywhere.

142
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,160
Nate?!

143
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,430
Nate!
Nate!

144
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,130
No!
Nate!

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,180
No....

146
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,970
wake up,nathan!
Wake up.

147
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,960
You promised me!

148
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,220
You promised me you'd come home to me!

149
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,240
Alice...

150
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,610
I'm so sorry,alice.
I really am.

151
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,010
you were supposed to watch over him!
You were his friend!

152
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,790
Couldn't blame her.
But it was misdirected.

153
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,660
Bertleman didn't give a rat's ass about
the safety of any of his workers.

154
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,320
And that's when donovan started
organizing the men?

155
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,240
Few months later,he disappears.

156
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,090
Mary said he went off to the pub,
never came home.

157
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,660
You figure bertleman had your
brother-in-law killed?

158
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,050
Donovan was about to lead a walkout.

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
You tell me.

160
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,070
Sam bertlemen?

161
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,850
Somewhere we can talk?

162
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,750
Yeah.
I'm kind of busy right now.

163
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,030
So are we.

164
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,150
Just found john donovan's body in
a tunnel under the schuylkill.

165
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,620
Not to slow you down or anything.

166
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,490
It's got nothing to do with me.

167
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,210
Might have with your old man.

168
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,400
My father built this city,every damn tunnel.

169
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,440
You think that's the first body that's
turned up underground?

170
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,460
This is one of his workers.
A union leader,too.

171
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,880
Look,the last thing my old man wanted was
to make john donovan some kind of martyr.

172
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,850
Funny how he turned up dead,then.

173
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,390
They blamed my pops 'cause it was easier
than looking at one of their own.

174
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,590
You saying another sandhog did it?

175
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,320
All that band of brothers union stuff?
Bunch of B.S.

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,280
There's this one guy zaccardo,
always causing trouble.

177
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,780
It ain't right what happened to nate.

178
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,200
But not a damn thing's gonna change
till we make it change.

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,870
Wrong tree,donny boy.
Go bark somewheres else.

180
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,030
Nate was one of us,zaccardo.
One of our brothers. We owe him.

181
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,030
You wanna walk off the job over some dead spade?
Go ahead.

182
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,020
What'd you call him?

183
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,450
You crossed the line,making a fool of yourself
with that bugaboo widow in front of everyone.

184
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,630
Shut your mouth!

185
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,010
- Enough!
- Not your concern,old man.

186
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,190
You don't talk about her like that!

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,920
Shut up,donny.
It's over.

188
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Oh,it ain't over.

189
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,700
I can promise you that.

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,990
scaling bar,huh?

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,160
Bash a man's skull in with that.

192
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,100
Donovan had stones,but mateo zaccardo
was a mean son of a bitch.

193
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,240
Didn't appreciate being humiliated.

194
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,550
You think he killed donovan?

195
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,250
He was a sandhog,and down in that hole,
anything can happen.

196
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,470
Any idea where zaccardo ended up?

197
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,530
Last I heard,prison.

198
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,370
Caved some poor bastard's head
in during a bar fight.

199
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,350
Life for second degree murder.

200
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,420
Killed a man with a crowbar outside a bar.

201
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,310
guy had it coming.

202
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,310
Did john donovan?

203
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,530
You had motive,opportunity,a serious beef.

204
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,250
He work for you?

205
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,350
It's time to set the record straight...

206
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,060
clear your conscience.

207
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,140
Your age,the D.A. Might work out a deal.
Time served.

208
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,750
I'll talk to you.

209
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,230
Or you can rot in prison for all I care.

210
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,450
It's always something with them.

211
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,460
What about you and donovan?

212
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,810
We had a difference of opinion.
We worked it out.

213
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,740
I'll bet.

214
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,920
Just because I wasn't gonna strike
don't mean I killed the guy.

215
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,030
No?

216
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,140
Then who did?

217
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,980
It was the coloreds.

218
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,650
They blamed him for stallworth's death.

219
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,460
You mean the west indian sandhogs?

220
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,290
West indians,afro-americans.

221
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,400
They can call themselves whatever they want.

222
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,790
They had it in for donovan in the worst way.

223
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,160
And how would you know?

224
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,010
Only place near the dig to get refills pwas
a coffee shop served coloreds.

225
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,270
So long as as you didn't touch
the silverware,it was fine.

226
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,670
coffee,please.

227
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,430
be ready in a minute.

228
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,530
It's good,you found something.

229
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,350
- Cream or sugar?
- Just black.

230
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,840
Like this place used to be?

231
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,470
the boys at the hoghouse passed the hat.

232
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,990
It ain't much.
It's the best we can do.

233
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,230
nate was right.

234
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,730
You give a man no quarter.

235
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,900
nate told you that?

236
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,050
He told me a lot of things.

237
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,210
Did he now.

238
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,580
- I miss him,too,alice.
- Not like I do.

239
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,910
What about getting her what's due?

240
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,680
The union is working on getting
some kind of settlement.

241
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,470
Me and nate,we paid our dues regular.

242
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,550
Bad enough we get shut out for the best jobs.

243
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,420
- I hear you,bishop.
- Do you?

244
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,580
Maybe a white man gotta die down in that hole
for the union sit up and take notice.

245
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,020
That it?

246
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,830
I'm gonna go.

247
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,440
Take care now.

248
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,250
I will.

249
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,440
you think bishop made good on that threat?

250
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,000
Well,put it this way.

251
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,130
I wasn't the only sandhog who ever served time.

252
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,000
Bishop had a record.

253
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,900
And a bad attitude.

254
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,430
You were never paid a settlement?

255
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,000
Bertlemen wouldn't give a dime for
a black man's life.

256
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,540
Bishop was pretty upset about it.

257
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,050
He was all bark,no bite.

258
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,650
You two keep in touch?

259
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,350
He passed...

260
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,390
20 years ago.

261
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,040
And,no,we didn'T.

262
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,880
What about you,alice?

263
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,000
You were pretty upset with donovan,too.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,010
I was upset that my husband died
and I can't make the rent.

265
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,400
Donovan helped me in a time of need.

266
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Donovan come by regular to give you money?

267
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,990
To check on me.
To see how I was getting by.

268
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,990
He ever talk about work,anybody
who might've had in for him?

269
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,650
No.

270
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,910
Mostly,we...
just talk about nate.

271
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,840
Now,you like talking to him,hmm--

272
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
donovan?

273
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,120
He was the first man to make me laugh again.

274
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,740
Got to be I looked forward to seeing
him on his way home from a shift.

275
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,120
Sounds like donovan was there quite a bit.

276
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,160
Well,he didn't have much to go home to.

277
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,550
Meaning his wife?

278
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,750
Couldn't get pregnant,
so she crawled up inside a bottle.

279
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,700
He didn't talk about it much,and...
and I didn't ask.

280
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,450
Back then,people stuck it out...

281
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,960
even if it didn't make sense.

282
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,220
Just the times.

283
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,360
He was still married and white,
and I was neither.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,970
Did that stop you?

285
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,860
One night,we were talking longer than usual...

286
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,440
and finally we just run out of things to say.

287
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,070
listen to that.

288
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,220
Ah,nothing in the world quite like it.

289
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,830
Like what?

290
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,130
The blues.

291
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,190
Nate always said you liked your music.

292
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,630
It ain't just music.

293
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,780
No?
Then what?

294
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,970
Makes me feel like I'm not alone
listening to that.

295
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,520
it's good to see you smile again.

296
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,880
Nate--
he always used to say a smile like that,

297
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
light up every tunnel in the city.

298
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,140
Come on now.

299
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,180
I always wondered what he meant.
Now I know.

300
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,980
ought to be getting home now.

301
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,930
All right.

302
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,510
- night.
- Good night.

303
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,210
what'd you say this song was called again?

304
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,380
I never said it.

305
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,110
- You like it?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,830
Yeah,I like it.

307
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,570
I like everything about it.

308
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,910
who is it?

309
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,040
Satchmo.

310
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,850
Hey.

311
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,630
Hey what?

312
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
You're not alone.

313
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,370
White,married man,black woman.

314
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,880
That could get you in trouble today.

315
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,200
I knew it couldn't last and it didn'T.

316
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,860
Must have been tough to let that go.

317
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,570
Anybody else know?

318
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,670
Just the brother-in-law.

319
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,950
Bobby mccallister?

320
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,330
Hey,lil.

321
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,580
Want to go for a ride?

322
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,270
What are you doing here?

323
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,970
Oh,gee,ray,it's nice to see you too,you know.
Hey.

324
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,100
I'd love to go for a spin.

325
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,840
Sorry.

326
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
At least I got a smile.

327
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,320
Nice to see you,ray.

328
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,590
You know,the way,uh...

329
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,080
we left it last time,that was...
nice.

330
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,260
Look,I,uh...

331
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,630
I gotta go.

332
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,660
Something I did wrong?

333
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,630
Something he did right.

334
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,880
You didn't take the call.

335
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm not taking a ride with you either.

336
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,670
Come on.
I just want to talk.

337
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,790
So talk.

338
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,650
Okay.

339
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,290
I,uh,I got hooked into this deal with a bunch
of street bikes up in bayonne,with my shop.

340
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,630
Turned out to be hot.

341
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,730
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

342
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,870
Call in a favor with the jersey state police?

343
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,070
I'm serious,lil.

344
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,300
These guys are,too.

345
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,890
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,520
Not this time.

347
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,990
Okay.

348
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,250
So,uh...

349
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,830
so...

350
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,730
See you around,ray.

351
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,560
Come on,bobby

352
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,730
You knew that donovan was stepping
out on your sister.

353
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,380
- With the widow of a sandhog.
- A black woman,no less.

354
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,210
Why open that up?

355
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,560
Bring shame to my family?

356
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,840
Dishonor my sister like that?

357
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,660
Oh,so this was a family matter?
That how you dealt with it,bobby?

358
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,390
I know mary had her problems,
but donovan was out of control.

359
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,090
Still Out of control how?

360
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,070
You gotta realize,donny had a lot
bigger problems on his plate.

361
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,150
Like what,bobby?

362
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,550
He was going ahead with the walkout,

363
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,920
but he had no idea what he was walking into.

364
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,420
chan of plans.
Things are getting stepped up.

365
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,350
Stepped up?

366
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,860
We need to know who's with us now.
Can't wait.

367
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,880
Why all of a sudden?

368
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,980
I think bertleman found out about the walkout.

369
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,900
What is it,bobby?

370
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,660
Heard bertleman hired goons.
Pinkertons.

371
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,530
- Who told you that?
- Guys are talking,donny.

372
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,780
Those pinkerton thugs are good for only one thing--
cracking skulls.

373
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,700
Guys don't need to hear that now.

374
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,560
Means the boss is brining in scabs,
and I got a family to feed.

375
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,170
What are you saying?
You're out?

376
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,300
Look,bobby,things get rough,
I need to know i can count on you.

377
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,760
Don't you see?

378
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,160
Bertleman knows what you're planning,
he knows everything.

379
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,520
What?
How's he know?

380
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,340
Aw,no.

381
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,130
- I'm sorry.
- Bobby.

382
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,480
He threatened my job.

383
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,250
Big mac,too.

384
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,790
I had kids.
A family.

385
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,340
So you told.

386
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm sorry,donny.

387
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,330
I never forgot the look in donny's eyes.

388
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,220
You never mentioned it.

389
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,390
Couldn't have help your big union career.

390
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,420
You being a stooge and all.

391
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,110
It's something I'm not proud of,believe me.

392
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,370
He was like a brother to me.

393
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,280
You got any idea what that's like?

394
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,090
What,bobby?

395
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,900
Wondering if I was the one that got him killed.

396
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,280
Hey,you.

397
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,920
Hey.

398
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,170
- Hey.
- Hi.

399
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,540
What's going on?

400
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,070
I got a meeting over in family court this afternoon,
and so I figured I'd stop by,see if you ate lunch.

401
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,590
Oh,uh,yeah.
I kinda ate on the run. This case.

402
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,380
Yeah.
No,I figured as much.

403
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,560
I know you called last night.
I,um,just got...

404
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
caught up on the job.

405
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,560
No,forget it. I was just seeing
if you wanted to gb dinner. That's all.

406
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,910
It turned into a long night.

407
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,340
Don't worry about it.
Some other time.

408
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,860
Great. Uh.
Maybe tonight?

409
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,260
Uh...
we'll see.

410
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,990
look,I better run.

411
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,300
- Wait.
- What?

412
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,040
Just a second.

413
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,390
I love you,too.

414
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,280
You don't have to say it just 'cause I did.

415
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,470
No,I want to say it.

416
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Okay.

417
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,390
Hey,kids!

418
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,350
- Hey,guys.
- Nick vera.

419
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,860
Joseph shaw.

420
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,020
- I remember.
- Yeah.

421
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,100
Will jeffries.

422
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,670
So you're still in town?

423
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,400
Yeah,I'm working with the dhs,court
and community services.

424
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,050
Yeah,that's right,delinquent youth.

425
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,340
At-risk juveniles,yeah.

426
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,670
-It's good work.
- Yeah. I-I think so.

427
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,320
We better go.

428
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,810
Why can't I meet a nice girl at a halfway house?

429
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,710
Save it.

430
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,900
I didn't know the guy stuck around philly.

431
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,620
Well,now you do.
Anything new on bertleman?

432
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,470
Mccallister's story checks out.

433
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,900
Turns out bertleman was going to squash
the strike by hiring pinkertons.

434
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,410
Goons for hire.

435
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,300
Specialize in bashing skulls.

436
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,560
Might explain the blunt-force trauma.

437
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,430
Real interesting guy,your old man.

438
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,510
Not the most ethical,but...
interesting.

439
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,350
He was a businessman.
Sometimes you gotta play hardball.

440
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,290
Yeah,the pinkertons were pretty handy with a bat.

441
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,520
He ever tell you about them?

442
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,840
Heard about that,but he didn't need
them to deal with donovan.

443
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,250
That rig?

444
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,430
already had him over a barrel.

445
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,230
What do you mean?
Donovan was for sale?

446
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,850
No.Let's just say donovan put himself
in an untenable position.

447
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,760
yeah.

448
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,420
That's something,ain't it?

449
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,160
You wanted to see me?

450
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,720
I know what you're planning,son.
I'm here to tell you it ain't gonna happen.

451
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,050
Ain't up to you,mr.Bertleman.

452
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,710
Either you drop this whole strike nonsense,

453
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,750
or your life's about to get a whole lot bumpier.
Got me?

454
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,810
The only way you're gonna stop this strike,
is across the table hearing our demands.

455
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,480
I don't think you're hearing me.

456
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,580
We lost a good man down in the hole--

457
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,190
nate stallworth,you might recall the name.

458
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,870
I can't be threatened,and I ain't for sale.

459
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,190
No.

460
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,530
Kinda figured that already,son.

461
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,980
And if I get hurt,that's just gonna put
more of a fire in the boys' bellies.

462
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,560
You're right.
But...

463
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,360
if another poor colored woman disappears on
her way home from work,

464
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,840
well,ain't nobody really miss her but you.

465
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,400
You son of a bitch.

466
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,630
It's my job to know what's going on.

467
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,490
What'd you say your friend's name was again?

468
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,840
You think about that real hard.

469
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,340
You leave her alone.

470
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,360
Now get your shovel and get back to work.

471
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,560
One thing I learned from my daddy
about being the boss--

472
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,300
most times it ain't what you do,
it's what people think you're capable of.

473
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,780
But alice lived.

474
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,280
He never laid a hand on her.
Heard she left town.

475
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,980
That right?
When?

476
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,590
Around the time donovan disappeared.

477
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,760
Alice stallworth left philadelphia
on april 28 of 1948.

478
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,550
The same day donovan went missing.

479
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,010
Right.
Move to chester,pa.

480
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,060
What's in chester?

481
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,160
I thought maybe a relative,
but we couldn't locate anyone.

482
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,870
Found this instead.

483
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,930
Hospital record from november,1948.

484
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,500
- Alice was sick?
- Not sick--

485
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,280
pregnant.
She gave birth to a nine-pound baby boy.

486
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,040
Nate had been dead 11 months.
No way he could have been the father.

487
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,450
So alice was pregnant when she left town.

488
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,370
With donovan's baby.

489
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,500
We know you left philadelphia,alE.

490
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,690
The same day donovan disappeared.

491
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,440
Like I said before,things got complicated.

492
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,420
Well,they were already complicated.
Him married,you a widow.

493
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,300
Black,white.

494
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,130
I know all the reasons
why it was wrong back then,thank you.

495
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,500
But then you found yourself pregnant.

496
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,210
It was foolishness from the jump.

497
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,850
I shoulda known better.

498
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,800
Donovan.

499
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,770
You gave your son his name.

500
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,820
I wanted to remember him...

501
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,870
to remember his words.

502
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,130
You're not alone.

503
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,390
Tell me what happened the night
he disappeared,alice.

504
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,890
I should have known it wouldn't last.

505
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,740
Something that special never does.

506
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,550
will you relax,baby?
You're gonna wear out the floor.

507
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,650
that the one big mac gave you?

508
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,680
When I made foreman.

509
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,820
Oh,that means something.
He chose you to lead those man.

510
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,150
Sometimes you gotta make touch choices,
choices you don't want to make.

511
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,020
Come close.
Got something special to tell you.

512
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,530
What's wrong,baby?
You here,but you ain't here.

513
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,960
This has to end,you and me.

514
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,520
What?

515
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,730
You knew this was going to happen.

516
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,170
What's really going on,donny?

517
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,690
You know what the boys would say
if they found out?

518
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,120
- Since when do you care about that?
- I'm a married man,alice.

519
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Do you love her?

520
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,760
Even if I left my wife,which I can't,
you know it could never work.

521
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,150
That's not what I asked you.

522
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,840
Oh,come on,alice.
Us?

523
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,930
Out there?

524
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,270
Forget it.

525
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,770
do you love me?

526
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,520
no,I don'T.

527
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,110
go to new york,
someplace you can start over.

528
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,890
- I can send you money.
- Get out.

529
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,300
Alice...

530
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,040
I'm so sorry.

531
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,220
Not like I am.

532
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,670
I never listened to that song again.

533
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,530
You ever tell your son about him?

534
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,030
It was just me.

535
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,990
I was all he ever knew.

536
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,180
Donovan's lighter,the one with the cross...

537
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,070
big mac gave it to him?

538
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,440
Alice...

539
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,000
donovan was trying to protect you.

540
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,160
Protect me?

541
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,990
He was about to take on some guys
that played rough.

542
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,930
Didn't want you to get hurt.

543
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,140
He broke it off so you'd leave.

544
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,660
Maybe he was just a man afraid of the times.

545
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,280
Or maybe he just loved you.

546
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,790
Built to last forever,those things.

547
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,570
You know,once they even found
one inside the belly of a fish.

548
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,740
They pulled it out,and it lit right up...

549
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,740
very first time.

550
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,120
It still works for me.

551
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,090
Nothing lasts forever,right?

552
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,320
Except the statute of limitations on murder.

553
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,330
This wasn't a wedding present from your father,
was it,bobby?

554
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,950
Big mac gave it to donovan when
he made him foreman.

555
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,500
Not you.

556
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,100
Belongs to me.

557
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,640
The only way you could have that lighter is
if you saw donovan the night he disappeared.

558
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,970
I was a sandhog,too,you know?
20 in the hole.

559
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,730
But you got passed over by your own father.

560
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,970
He made donovan foreman.

561
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,780
I was his son.

562
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
His blood.

563
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,880
The good one.

564
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,240
You'd think he'd respect you more.

565
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,050
He treated me like a mope with a muck stick.

566
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,610
Like I couldn't do anything more.

567
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,270
And donovan could do no wrong.

568
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,630
Donovan the natural.

569
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,830
Donovan the leader.

570
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,090
Nothing you did was ever good enough.

571
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,350
Damned if I was gonna sit back and watch
him become the big hero.

572
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,070
Instead it was you,bobby.

573
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,970
With donovan gone,
you became president of local 37.

574
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,140
Achieved what he never got a chance to do.

575
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,260
I did what I had to do.

576
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,630
You got rid of him.

577
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,660
Finally.

578
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,560
Hmbut you know the worst part?

579
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,810
They went and turned him into a damned saint.

580
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,570
Heard there were scabs down here.

581
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,540
**********

582
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,150
Aw,look at this.

583
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,740
Idiots were in the dynamite.

584
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,200
Lucky they didn't blow a head off.

585
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,470
Better check the rest of the supplies.

586
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,100
- I'll check over at the shaft.
- All right.

587
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,090
Watch your step.

588
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,480
They probably left the misfires in the muck.

589
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,160
Bobby,I'm glad you're with us.
Rough as it's gonna get.

590
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,400
Couldn't live with myself,
letting you go it alone.

591
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,120
In the long run,
it's gonna be better for all of us.

592
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
All because of you.

593
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,110
What is it?

594
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,440
- Donovan?
- Yeah?

595
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,910
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,680
Here.

597
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,890
Thanks.

598
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,250
Bobby?

599
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,590
Always gotta be the hero.

600
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,610
What are you talking about?

601
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,960
Bobby?
What are you doing?

602
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,190
Not this time.

603
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,260
Bobby...

604
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,110
bobby... help me,

605
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,740
bobby...

606
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,050
Bobby...

607
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,470
alice...

608
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,310
you're not alone.

609
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,180
I wonder,my little darling

610
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,430
where can you be this moonlit night?

611
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:57,720
Are you holding someone tight,baby?

612
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,160
I wonder

613
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,710
my heart is aching,

614
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,350
but I'm a fool

615
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,080
to let it go on breaking

616
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,600
maybe I'll awake to find that I'm mistaken

617
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,440
mm,I wonder

618
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,670
baby,since we're through,
I've been through lovers' lane

619
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,790
but in my heart,there's only pain

620
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,620
you went traveling,but will it last?

621
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,510
Well,I'm traveling nowhere fast

622
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,280
mm,sweetheart,mm,sweetheart

623
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,610
I wonder where,where,where,little baby

624
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,800
if this new love dies where will you be?

625
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,030
Will your heart come running back to me?

626
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:21,770
Mm,baby,I just wonder.
