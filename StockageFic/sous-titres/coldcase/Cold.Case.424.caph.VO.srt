00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,550
- Thing's gonna break my back.
- Dad,it's slipping.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,150
{a6}October 17,2006

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,510
- Honey,let me help you.
- It's okay.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,900
Exercise.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,560
It's good for me.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,490
King Warlord strikes again!

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,640
Why is it guns all the time?
I'm getting him karate lessons.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,620
Awesome!

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,080
- How much are those?
- I don't know. Not much.

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,860
Probably not a lot. I knew a
lot of kids who took 'em in Ohio.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,660
We can manage,Adam.
Your job starts tomorrow.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,680
Don't need a pep talk,Emily.

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,210
Honey?

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,350
Are you gonna get the rest
of the boxes out of the truck?

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,370
Just give me a second,will ya? I
need one second for my stuff,okay?

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,210
Remember the night of
the tornado in Cincinnati?

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,240
Mom made us all sleep in the basement.

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,280
No.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,510
We stayed up all night. Made popcorn.

21
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,090
It was fun.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,120
Remember,Dad?

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,530
Yeah.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,100
Gonna be a lot easier life here,guys.

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,100
I promise.

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,450
Pop...

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,180
pop...

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,420
Help me.

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,060
Family massacre.

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,490
Mom,Dad and son shot and killed.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,030
Dad's prints were all over the gun.

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,120
The Jacobis.

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,770
Dad was an out-of-work
computer programmer.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,310
Looked like he was the doer. It
was a John List kind of thing.

35
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,590
The older kid,the daughter,survived
a bullet to the head.

36
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,150
Can't decide if that's lucky or not.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,430
You're alive,but you got to face
knowing your dad tried to off you.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,610
We could never confirm
the father was the doer,

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,840
but now that Kim's awake and talking...

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,190
Your boss wants a statement.

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,550
Doctor says Kim's memory is spotty,

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,810
but we can try.

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,420
Boss wants to close the case.

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,430
Meaning the DA wants
himself on the front page

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,430
with his arm around little orphan Kim

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
and us doing the work for him.

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,390
We can't all have bosses like yours.

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,650
Hey. I'm Ed.

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,250
Been working with Kim
for the last five months.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,740
Detective Rush and Valens.

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,110
- How's she doing?
- Lot better since she came to a few weeks ago.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,270
Real progress.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,490
Hi,Kim.

54
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,900
We need to talk to you about what
happened the night of the shooting.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Kim...

56
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,180
was it your father who did this to you?

57
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,310
He loved you.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,610
Your mom,too.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,300
- How do you know that?
- I can see it in these photos.

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,600
I don't really remember
that night. I'm sorry.

61
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,880
You were in the house with your family.

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,370
Do you remember what you were doing?

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,000
- Is she okay?
- Kim,I'm right here.

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,130
Was there a fight?

65
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,870
Your father get upset about
something? I don't remember!

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,620
No,don't. Dad.

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,580
- Please.
- No!

68
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,240
Always. Romeo.

69
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,840
Kim,look at me.

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,360
You sure you saw your father's
body before you were shot?

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Means the dad wasn't the shooter.

72
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,140
Maybe she should rest.

73
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,560
Okay.

74
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm sorry,Kim,

75
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,140
for putting you through that.

76
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,660
Someone else was in
that house that night.

77
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,840
Someone calling themselves Romeo.

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,740
Left a witness behind.

79
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,070
Witness who's starting to remember.

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,280
Gun was registered to
Adam. Prints on it were his.

84
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,540
The Jacobis were on
the verge of bankruptcy.

85
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,250
Adam had recently lost
an IT job in Cincinnati.

86
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,480
Dad moved the family to Philly
for work. Got fired a month later.

87
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,600
Neighbor said Adam was depressed.

88
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,230
Original investigation found the
family computers behind the house,

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,010
all smashed up,hard drives erased.

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,170
- Presumably by Adam.
- I can relate to that part.

91
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,470
Let's get those computers. Maybe the Tech Unit
can find something pointing to our shooter.

92
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,650
Lil do the interview with
you this morning,Scotty?

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,180
Said she was stopping
at home on her way back.

94
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,450
Had a dream you were reading to me.

95
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Your favorite book when you were a kid.

96
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,490
I can't remember the name.

97
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,150
Brought you some lunch.

98
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,620
Came back from work for that?

99
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,950
Didn't want you going
hungry,complaining nonstop.

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,130
Mom,you okay?

101
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,110
Yeah,I'm fine.

102
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,170
Go on now before they
wise up and fire you.

103
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,680
You call me if you need anything.

104
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,070
- You got my cell,right?
- Yeah,yeah,I'm fine,so go.

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,230
Go.

106
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,700
Go get 'em,Lilly.

107
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,330
The Velveteen Rabbit.

108
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,470
That was the book.

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,890
Made me read it a million times.

110
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,280
The stuffed rabbit
who wanted to be real,

111
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,390
and the boy he belonged to.

112
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,340
He became real,remember?

113
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,910
When the boy let him go.

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,540
Bet he missed him for
the rest of his life.

115
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,900
That stubborn old thing came back.

116
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,920
Make sure the boy was okay.

117
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,080
- He did?
- Couldn't keep him away.

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,120
Go on now,Lilly.

119
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,960
Bye,Mom.

120
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,480
Bye,baby.

121
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,190
So you're the one who
found the bodies,Mr. Reed?

122
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,360
Our kids were pals. We shared a carpool.

123
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,320
Waited in the driveway 20 minutes,

124
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,420
then I went in.

125
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,650
Is it true that the wife was
the family's main breadwinner?

126
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,550
Dental hygienist,plus parent in charge.

127
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,010
- Kids didn't listen to Adam?
- The daughter didn't listen,

128
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,160
not when it came to
that boyfriend of hers.

129
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,870
Boyfriend?

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,980
That wasn't in the report.
You ever meet this guy?

131
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,980
No.

132
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,360
But one morning,it was my turn
to drive the kids to school,

133
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,550
and,as usual,the Jacobis were late.

134
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,450
Adam,my hands are full.

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,550
Please,just get his lunch ready.

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,170
Hey.

137
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,050
I just found something on this computer.

138
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,480
We need to have a family
discussion,young lady.

139
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,730
- I found your online chats.
- What online chats?

140
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,650
That's none of your business.
Don't read her e-mail.

141
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,090
You are too young to write
those... things to that boyfriend.

142
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Me and Rick don't talk online,Dad.

143
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,890
We need to meet this Rick. And have
you guys fight in front of him? No way.

144
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,740
Martin and Jeff are here!

145
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,050
What's taking you guys so long?

146
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,130
I was just,uh...

147
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,620
So,ready?

148
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,680
No more computer for you,Kim.
And no more cell phone.

149
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,790
Adam,come on.

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,870
Emily,if you'd read them
you wouldn't trust her either.

151
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,120
You know,just because you're miserable,
Dad,doesn't mean the rest of us have to be.

152
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,610
Teenagers.

153
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,850
Glad I've got that to look forward to.

154
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Where'd Kim meet this boyfriend?

155
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,320
School,I guess.

156
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,940
Adam said the kid called at all
hours,wouldn't leave his name.

157
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,730
You ever hear Kim
refer to him as "Romeo"?

158
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,370
No. I did see him once,though,
from my living room,at night.

159
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,880
He was skulking around
the Jacobis' house.

160
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,050
Getting ready for a balcony scene?

161
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,210
Rick Lambert?

162
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,230
Detectives Jeffries,Rush.

163
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,830
I didn't do it.

164
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,410
Want to talk to you about
your girlfriend Kim Jacobi.

165
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,050
Whoa. The new girl that got shot?

166
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,800
She was,uh,

167
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,080
not my girlfriend.

168
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,230
Her family thought different.

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,890
Oh,man.

170
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,930
Kim had the wrong idea about us.

171
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,450
How so?

172
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,530
I was breaking in the new girl. "Friends
with benefits" is what it's called.

173
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,200
Youth of today-
real inspiration.

174
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,360
We know about the online
messages you two were exchanging.

175
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,020
Nah,not me.

176
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,180
Me and my mom don't have a computer.

177
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,450
You think Kim could've been
chatting with some other guy?

178
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,450
Mmm,yeah.

179
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,260
Name "Romeo" mean anything to you?

180
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,270
Oh

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,320
That's the dude finally
spoke her language.

182
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,980
- And what language is that,Rick?
- You know,feelings.

183
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,880
- What the hell is this?
- It's not from you?

184
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,560
Uh,no. And you better not
be telling people it is.

185
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,450
Well...

186
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,490
you're the only person
I know at this school.

187
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,460
Read the frickin' card,yo.
It's got hearts on it.

188
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,510
"I'm the only one who
knows the real you,

189
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,960
"how unhappy you've
been,Kim,for a long time now.

190
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,430
- I've watched... "
- Give it back,Rick!

191
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,190
"I've watched you at
school,"outside your house.

192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,950
"In fact,I'm watching you right now. "

193
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,540
Um...

194
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,020
...stalker.

195
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,240
"Always,Romeo. "

196
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,620
"Always,Romeo. "

197
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,060
Kim was needy.

198
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,400
She was loving that card with
all the sentiments and what not.

199
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,830
Thanks for your insights,Rick.

200
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,120
Hey,wish I could tell you more,but...

201
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,140
Right,you're not her boyfriend.

202
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,040
So maybe those online chats really
weren't between Kim and Rick.

203
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,840
They were between her and a secret admirer.

204
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,340
Romeo

205
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,610
Tech Unit recovered the shadow
drives of the Jacobi computers.

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a mess,but they found
the messages Adam was mad about.

207
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,260
- Who was Kim writing to? 
- Montague01.

208
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,190
That's Romeo.

209
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,570
- I know my Shakespeare.
- Same guy who Kim claims shot her.

210
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,520
Messages go on for a month,then
all online communication stops.

211
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,750
- Week later,he sends her the rose.
- What's that?

212
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,970
Photo Kim sent him.
High school insignia.

213
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,600
Could be how he tracked
her,sent her the flower.

214
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,040
These two would chat for hours.

215
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,340
All this soul-baring stuff.

216
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,890
This guy's rap is they're like Romeo
and Juliet,meant to be together.

217
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,500
It's fate.

218
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,940
- Did Kim respond to that?
- Yep,

219
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,300
till his messages took
a turn for the loony

220
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,760
a few weeks before the murders.

221
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,330
"I see you crying in
your bathroom at night.

222
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,190
"Your family brings you so much pain.

223
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,310
"If they were gone,we could
love each other wholly.

224
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,510
'Violent delights have violent ends. '"

225
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,940
He's offering to get rid of her
family. Declaration of his love.

226
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,250
She stopped returning his
messages at that point.

227
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,180
But maybe it was too late. Romeo
decided to take out the Capulets.

228
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,670
"Romeo,Romeo,wherefore art thou...?"

229
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,400
I knew the man who shot my family?

230
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,180
You talked to him on the
computer every night for months.

231
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,470
Told him you were lonely.

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,390
Lonely?

233
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,520
You ever meet him? Romeo

234
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,390
I don't think I'd do that.

235
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,240
He watched you some
nights. Outside the house.

236
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,380
Saw you crying in the bathroom.

237
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,460
Bathroom?

238
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,020
- I used to hide there.
- Hide? From what?

239
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,400
I remember steam on the windows.

240
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,600
I could hear voices.

241
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,390
- I wanted to disappear.
- What were you hiding from,Kim?

242
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,340
I tried to call someone,but
I didn't have any friends.

243
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,110
Because you don't tell me what's going
on with you and I'm trying to help!

244
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,400
Just figure this out alone!

245
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,060
Did you like the rose?

246
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,840
- Who are you?
- did you?

247
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,860
I liked the card.

248
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,460
I'm sorry your parents are fighting.

249
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,810
I'm used to it.

250
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,180
I know you wanted to
call someone and cry,

251
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,680
but there was no one to call.

252
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,850
How'd you know I wanted to call someone?

253
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,500
Because...

254
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,530
I'm watching you.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,450
I see you.

256
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,250
Sort of.

257
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,310
I'm your Romeo. Come to rescue you.

258
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,070
Why do you care?

259
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,900
I mean,why do you like a
girl you've never even met?

260
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,180
'Cause...

261
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,310
I understand you.

262
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,310
Wanting somebody to really ask you
how you are and care about the answer.

263
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,890
I want that,too.

264
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,130
How are you,Romeo?

265
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,680
Better...

266
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,110
than I used to be.

267
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,370
I'm in love.

268
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,400
Really?

269
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,780
- Draw an arrow through it.
- Why?

270
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,290
Cupid's bow.

271
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,220
- Good night,Kim.
- Don't go.

272
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,260
I can't believe I
talked to him like that.

273
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,970
You saw red and yellow
lights in the yard?

274
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,570
Stuart's laser gun had red lights.

275
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,640
Yellow lights could've
been from another gun.

276
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,720
- Maybe he had a friend over.
- Neighbor's kid?

277
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,600
Could be he got a look at Romeo.

278
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,540
I know that wasn't easy. Thanks.

279
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,800
Who sent this?

280
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,820
I don't know.

281
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,190
It was him,wasn't it?

282
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,910
Put a police detail on
Kim 'round the clock.

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,120
- Any luck tracking Romeo?
- Canvas at the school was a bust.

284
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,500
No high schoolers using his moniker?

285
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,850
And no luck tracing the Jacobis'
phone records to our stalker.

286
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,610
Looking into their personal cells now.

287
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,410
Thanks for coming back in, Martin.

288
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,040
Sure

289
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,520
You and Stuart played laser
tag in the front yard at nights?

290
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,780
- Am I in trouble?
- Now why would you be in trouble?

291
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,000
Jeff,if you have something to tell
us about the Jacobis we won't get mad.

292
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,120
Um...

293
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,440
the night that Stuart died,

294
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,600
I went over to his house.

295
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,630
- What?
- To play laser tag.

296
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,000
And you saw someone outside the house?

297
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,580
No.

298
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,070
Someone inside.

299
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,070
- Jeff!
- Gotcha. Now you got to get me.

300
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,860
It's late,guys. We're
all hittin' the hay.

301
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,430
- I can watch them if you want to go to bed,Em.
- Oh,you said you were tired.

302
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,230
What the hell is that?

303
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,040
Oh,my God.

304
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,310
Look,Dad.

305
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,320
Who did this,Kim?

306
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,560
Romeo,I think.

307
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,310
Romeo?

308
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,900
- Is that who you were messaging?
- I never messaged anybody,Dad!

309
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,160
I saw your screen name,Kim,and now he's been
in our house; you need to stop lying to me!

310
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,370
She's not!

311
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,750
Kim didn't send those messages.

312
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,270
I did.

313
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,940
Why didn't you tell me?

314
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,780
Emily was posing as her own
daughter on the Internet?

315
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,960
And she brought the stalker into her home

316
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

317
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,060
Any luck tracking the slide
show on the Jacobis' computer?

318
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,790
Nope.

319
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,020
Romeo's a hacker pain in the ass.

320
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,860
- Got something off of Kim's cell phone.
- One she wasn't supposed to be using?

321
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,880
Teenage girls don't listen to their
parents. That's good news for us.

322
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,740
She made a call,night of the shooting.

323
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,760
To Romeo?

324
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,000
No,to her friend with benefits.

325
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,650
Rick.

326
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,990
- Homeslice forgot to mention that.
- Right.

327
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,710
- Hey,you see Lilly this morning?
- No.

328
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,330
Everything is okay?

329
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,390
Door's unlocked.

330
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,860
My mom died.

331
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,410
Last night.

332
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,090
Uh,no,Lil.

333
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,700
I found her...

334
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,890
she was alone... when...

335
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,790
I sat here... with her.

336
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,740
She was so...

337
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,110
still.

338
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,660
She called the office...

339
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,680
I told her to call my
cell... if she had...

340
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,370
she... wouldn't died alone.

341
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,250
Lil,you gotta know it wasn't your fault.

342
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,740
- I should been here,scotty.
- Lil,you did everything you could.

343
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,770
Never say goodbye.

344
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,390
I'm here for you,

345
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,820
anything.

346
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,890
You know that.

347
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,040
Just wanna be alone now,okay?

348
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,970
Yeah.

349
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,400
When you need me,

350
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,930
just say,

351
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,970
"hey"

352
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,720
I'll be there.

353
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,780
Kim called you the night of the murder.

354
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,090
- Got the phone records.
- I didn't kill anybody.

355
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,190
You saying that ain't quite
good enough for us,Rick.

356
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,970
- She called me. You're right.
- Yeah,we know.

357
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,860
She was crying about her family.

358
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,690
So you head over there thinking she's
vulnerable,up for some easy play?

359
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,540
That is not why I went to her house.

360
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,870
Then,why'd you go,genius,the
night of the murders?

361
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,490
'Cause she was crying and I
wanted to make sure she was okay.

362
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,190
She was a really sweet
girl. You know,I...

363
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Don't say you liked her.

364
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,890
I kind of got attached,okay?

365
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,030
Kim was a good person.

366
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,360
Maybe she was a little depressed,
but her parents,like,ignored her.

367
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,970
- Sounds like you're defending her,Rick.
- Why would you have to defend Kim?

368
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,990
Like I said,she was depressed.

369
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,420
get rid these danm computers.

370
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,370
I'm sorry,Adam.

371
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,730
I'm sorry,Kim.

372
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,230
- It's okay,Mom.
- No.

373
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,320
No,honey.

374
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,740
You don't have to tell your mother that
putting you,putting all of us in da...

375
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,480
Dad,stop!

376
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,620
Don't let your daughter
think this is okay.

377
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,730
I went on the site thinking...

378
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,280
maybe I'd connect with some old friends.

379
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,280
Okay. Okay.

380
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,580
And... I went to make my profile and

381
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,870
all of the pictures of me were...

382
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,190
And I don't want to be this person

383
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,130
whose husband doesn't think
she's appealing anymore,

384
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,010
and her kids think she's
boring and annoying,

385
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,200
so...

386
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,620
I used to look like you.

387
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,100
I used to be so happy
and vibrant like you.

388
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,830
Is that what you think?

389
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,430
That I'm happy?

390
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,020
Well,yes.

391
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,160
You don't know me.

392
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,840
Only Romeo really knows me.

393
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,200
Honey?

394
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,770
Kim had a gun?

395
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,340
She tried to talk to me sometimes

396
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,180
about how...

397
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,700
bad she felt.

398
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,630
And I only made things worse.

399
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,400
I could have helped her and...

400
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,680
Maybe the Jacobis would have lived.

401
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,790
Lil,I heard.

402
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,770
I'm so sorry.

403
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,550
I need to be here.

404
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,790
Keep busy.

405
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,180
Kim

406
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,310
come with me.

407
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,860
Sit here. It'll be a while.

408
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,470
Ever read Romeo and Juliet?

409
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,950
Crazy kids,those two.

410
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,380
Do anything for love.

411
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,480
Kind of like you.

412
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,900
I don't understand.

413
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,060
Well,Rick saw you with the gun.

414
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,700
Gun?

415
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,050
What are you saying?

416
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,080
Is that the real reason you can't
remember? 'Cause you don't want to?

417
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,830
Why are you saying this? I would
never do anything bad to them.

418
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
Your mom put your photo on the Internet,

419
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,480
pretended to be you.

420
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,450
That's crazy.

421
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,660
Your family didn't know
you. They didn't even try.

422
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,890
I didn't hate my family.
I wouldn't hurt them.

423
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,180
No?

424
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,160
How do you know?

425
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,910
I wanted to hurt myself...

426
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,790
not them.

427
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,750
Kim.

428
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,160
Oh,my God!

429
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,570
Adam!

430
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,030
What?

431
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,050
- I thought it was locked up.
- There was someone in the house,so I took it out.

432
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,200
- Kim,sweetheart... Stuart,go to your room.
- No,let him stay.

433
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,180
We can't stand to watch the two people we
love most in the world tear each other apart.

434
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,690
So you're tired from
work or you need work.

435
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,670
Is that more important than our family?

436
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,350
- Fix your problem.
- It's not that simple,Kim.

437
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,430
We were happy before once.

438
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
Remember that time in Cincinnati?

439
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,400
The tornado.

440
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,820
Maybe we should make some popcorn.

441
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
That's a good idea.

442
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,610
I'll do it.

443
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,060
I know where it is.

444
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,490
Dad!

445
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,760
You saw him,Kim.

446
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,830
You know who he is,don't you?

447
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,760
Who is he?

448
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,080
You're not going to take her from me.

449
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,340
Not again.

450
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,430
Hey!

451
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,690
I'll kill her before I let you do it.

452
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,850
I'll kill all of you.

453
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,970
No one's going to get hurt,Ed.
We're going to work it out.

454
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
Shut up!

455
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,070
Put your handcuffs on now.

456
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,500
Cuff yourselves to the
door. You,file cabinet.

457
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,420
You,take the keys! Now!

458
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,610
Come on. Let's go,lady.

459
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,500
- Get his keys!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

460
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,800
I said shut up!

461
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,680
Listen to me,Ed. I want to help you.

462
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,150
I don't want anyone getting
hurt. You understand?

463
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,190
Give me the keys now.

464
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,730
Get me a helicopter on the roof.

465
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,950
I can make that happen,
but it's going to take time.

466
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,050
And I need to make a call.

467
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,890
We got a situation in Homicide.

468
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,230
I need to talk to your
tactical commander.

469
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,000
Get the sharpshooters into
position. Third floor,east side.

470
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,590
Hostage taker's a guy named Ed Marteson.

471
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,520
Just got texted by someone inside. Marteson
smuggled a.38 in with the wheelchair.

472
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,210
It's Vera again. "Hostage
taker at southeast window. "

473
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,420
Southeast window. If your field
of fire is clean,take the shot.

474
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,440
- Hey,you miss,you're going to kill one of ours.
- Back off,Detective. Let me do my job.

475
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,180
That's why I got that job,Kim.

476
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,080
To be close to you.

477
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,830
So my face'd be the first
you saw when you woke up.

478
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,850
Ed,listen to me now.

479
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,160
Let the others go. I'll stay.

480
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,350
No!

481
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,620
No one is going anywhere.

482
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,990
SHARP SHOOTERS IN POS.GET DOWN.

483
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,450
Do you feel happy now?

484
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,420
Just tell me

485
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,690
because,because...

486
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,550
that's all I wanted.
That's why I did this.

487
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,670
You're disgusting.

488
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,910
She's just scared,Ed.

489
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,250
Helicopter's coming right now.

490
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,360
It'll come from behind that building.

491
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,370
To your right.

492
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,730
Hey!

493
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,380
Hey!

494
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,480
I hate liars.

495
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,270
- You're gonna die.
- She doesn't love you!

496
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,460
She doesn't love you. She
didn't even write those e-mails.

497
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,430
You want to say that again?

498
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,780
Shots fired from inside. One
hostage down. White male,50s.

499
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,280
- That's our lieutenant.
- Stand down. Stand down.

500
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,390
- I told you not to fire,you idiot.
- You understand I outrank you?!

501
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,830
Let go of me!

502
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,710
- I'm getting in there.
- What about him?

503
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,420
Screw that guy.

504
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,830
Lil.

505
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,550
- They lied to you. But I won't.
- Get away from me.

506
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,380
Listen,you got to get away from
those windows or they'll kill you.

507
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
There's no windows in
there. You'll be safe.

508
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,840
- You're coming,too.
- You don't need her.

509
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,480
I'm going.

510
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,610
There's a room behind that.

511
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,400
It's safer.

512
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,960
You better not be lying to me.

513
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,380
They can see you in here.

514
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,780
There,they can't.

515
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,600
Come in and I'll kill them both!

516
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,900
Shut the door.

517
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,990
John.

518
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,840
???

519
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,520
Nick hurry up

520
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,050
Bullet weakly troughed. Let's get a dress.

521
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,060
Hang in there, boss.

522
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,510
Hey.Where's Lil?

523
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,220
in there

524
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,180
I used to be an EMT.

525
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,440
Which means I knew how to care for you when you got hurt.

526
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,120
You got to know that it's fate with us.

527
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,250
Look

528
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,260
I have to make a call.

529
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,580
Put it down.

530
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,370
You want to get out of here,right?

531
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,290
They're gonna come in if I don't call.

532
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,660
Trust me.

533
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,900
OK?

534
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,190
I need a helicopter on the roof right now.

535
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,080
We're outside the interview rooms.?

536
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,040
You can't see in here,so...

537
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,580
don't try anything.

538
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,230
You're not in the interview rooms?
You're in observation?

539
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,550
That's what I said.

540
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,000
What do you want me to do?

541
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,130
Hey.

542
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,120
You hear me?

543
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,800
Hey.

544
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,690
You want me to come in?

545
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,290
Get him to turn away from the two-ways
and stay down.

546
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,620
- They're,uh...They're on their way.
- You're lying.

547
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,060
Maybe I should just kill you now!

548
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,810
Why do you take such good care of someone
who doesn't love you?

549
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,480
She does.

550
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,830
You're trying to make her into a different person

551
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,870
who loves you the way you want to be loved,

552
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,960
but it's not gonna happen.

553
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,160
She wrote things to me.

554
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,130
but you don't know.

555
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,650
See...

556
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,160
you hold on to the good things,

557
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,820
but there were bad things,too.

558
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,930
Right,ed?

559
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,890
she rejected you.

560
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,030
She rejected you.

561
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,090
- That's not true.
- Well,you shot her.

562
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,200
Why do you think you did that?

563
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,790
She called me her romeo.

564
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,470
Promised to love me forever.

565
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,120
But she lied.

566
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,990
It's me.

567
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,840
- It's me-- romeo.
- Dad!

568
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,630
No one ever rescued me from my family,

569
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,560
but I'm gonna do it for you
because I love you,kim.

570
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,200
No,don'T...!

571
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
- Don't!
- Please!

572
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,770
No!

573
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,740
Oh,my god,adam!

574
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,580
Mom!

575
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,750
You've caused her so much pain.

576
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,080
- But not anymore.
- No,it's not true!

577
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,290
Don't do it.
Don'T.

578
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,830
You-you can take me.

579
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,600
You can take me,
but just let my kids out,okay?

580
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,520
Just let them go out the back,all right?

581
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,840
I don't want you.

582
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,360
No!

583
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,230
I love you.

584
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,530
Do you feel better?

585
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,060
'Cause they're gone.

586
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,280
They're gone.

587
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,950
No more crying,my love.

588
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,810
My juliet.

589
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,240
- Kim?
- Get away from me!

590
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,580
- But you said you loved me.
- Don't touch me!

591
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,880
I hate you!

592
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,060
But I love you!

593
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,630
Always.

594
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,620
Romeo.

595
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,150
you have to let her go.

596
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,320
It's not gonna be how you wanted it to be.
It's over.

597
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,170
It's over.

598
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,640
You don't think somebody could love me?

599
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,930
Huh?

600
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,090
You don't?

601
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,420
You want to shoot me?

602
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,170
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me now.

603
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,670
- You're gonna die.
- Then do it already!

604
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,610
Shoot me!

605
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,580
Do it now!

606
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,490
Lil!

607
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,850
He got me.

608
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,700
Lil?

609
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,430
Get the paramedics.

610
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,730
Get the paramedics!
