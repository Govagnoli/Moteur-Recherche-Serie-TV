Joe! Come on, man!
You're gonna make me late!

5
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,173
Hey, mom, going out with Derek!

6
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:42,770
Man, you gonna
get me killed, man.

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,189
I mean, damn, why you 
always gotta wear that thing?

8
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,033
Hey, Della says any man works in her 
place gotta respect themself and wear a tie.

9
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,249
Oh, you want some respect?

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,805
You and me cruising in an escalade.
That's what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:53,098
Man, how you 
gonna get an escalade

12
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:55,038
when you gotta beg Della
for a free dinner every night?

13
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,771
All that'll change
when we take over this hood.

14
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:01,270
See, once we running things,
she'll be pouring cristal in that place.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,186
Yo, Derek.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,529
I thought you said 
you was gonna get clean.

17
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,517
I am. This, man...

18
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,426
It's no thing.

19
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,797
Just walk like you own the block.

20
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:27,351
Della! You got trouble.

21
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,942
If I'm not back in 60 seconds, Tom,

22
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:33,530
call the police.

23
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,471
Glad I ain't on the
receiving end of that.

24
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:47,180
I always say my wife
is like a force of nature.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,800
except with most forces of nature,

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,561
folks usually get a warning
so they can take shelter.

27
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,685
Behave yourself with that.
Come on, now.

28
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,505
Derek in trouble?

29
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:59,814
Della's breaking it up.

30
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,280
Get yourself an apron.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,257
Uh, can Joe get 
a chicken basket?

32
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,861
Joe can have a job if he wants.

33
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,779
Oh, no thanks, but some
extra fries'd be good.

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,455
What happened out there?

35
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,088
Oh, it ain't no nothing
I can't handle.

36
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,263
You think those dishes might up
and bus themselves, Derek?

37
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:17,219
No, ma'am. Here I go.

38
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,559
Doyle give you a hard time?

39
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,611
No, you gotta buckle your chin strap
when she gets you on the stand.

40
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,039
Walking back to PPD?

41
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,991
Hmm, Vera's testifying at the prelim on 
the chicken and ribs job from a year ago.

42
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,373
The triple?

43
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,891
That started out being my job.

44
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,657
Yeah, the fugitives finally
picked up the shooter,

45
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:27,243
been hiding out 
at grandma's for a year.

46
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:29,250
Well, you knew 
Della and Tom, right?

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,172
Over 40 years. Their girl, 
Nora is my goddaughter.

48
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,771
Thank you, detective Vera,
and what did you find when you

49
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:38,106
searched the home of Squeak 
minter the day after the murders?

50
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:40,483
A key to the restaurant
where the shooting took place,

51
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:43,923
$1,200 cash, 
and a .38 caliber pistol.

52
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,269
The daughter? / The same type 
of gun that killed the three victims.

53
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,003
That's right.

54
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:51,326
No more from the commonwealth.

55
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:00,997
Detective Vera, you seem awfully sure
my client committed these murders.

56
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:05,267
He had the key, the gun, and the exact
amount of cash taken from the register.

57
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,306
So, would it surprise you to learn 
that Mr. Minter was actually robbing

58
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:12,243
- a store in West philly that night?
- West philly? Yes it would.

59
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,302
What if I showed you a videotape?

60
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,536
This is from a security camera
at the Wawa convenience store

61
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,726
on the corner of Spruce and 60th.

62
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,932
It clearly shows my client was

63
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,737
six miles away from the scene
when these murders took place.

64
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,384
Does that change your
opinion detective Vera?

65
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,270
You know you could've 
objected a few times in there.

66
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,783
- Yeah, you screwed the pooch, Vera.
- I screwed the pooch?

67
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,474
- Yeah, how'd you miss this?
- West detectives missed it.

68
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:41,009
- This was a bum case.
- Your office approved the charges.

69
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,653
- How did we not know about this tape?
- His lawyer didn't even know till today.

70
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,795
Look, Squeak thought he was
gonna walk on that murder rap

71
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:47,894
and when it wasn't in the cards,

72
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,981
he pulled that tape he stole
when he did the robbery.

73
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,189
Hey, hat squad.

74
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,942
Way to go. You know, 
you guys lost this one, big.

75
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:58,055
We can't lose this one.

Vera got his ass kicked in court?

87
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,267
Case died before our eyes.

88
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,024
And Squeak took a plea
on the Wawa robbery.

89
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,483
Gonna do five years.
He didn't do this triple, boss.

90
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,524
So we start again, Lil,
and we'll see who did.

91
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,882
Hey, your name's on this interview.

92
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,809
It was my last job on the line.

93
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,837
Vera took it over 
when I went to cold jobs.

94
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:57,706
Takes it over and fumbles it, huh?

95
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:01,110
Della and Tom lincoln,
owned the restaurant for 25 years.

96
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,156
Derek jackson, 17,

97
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:04,976
worked there
for two years, no record.

98
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,664
All three were shot
and her throat was cut.

99
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,603
Makes you think 
she was the target.

100
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,296
- And that it was personal.
- Della was a block captain.

101
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:15,276
Probably didn't make her too popular
with the neighborhood dirt bags.

102
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,357
Vera got some prints and DNA
from the dinner trash, but no hits.

103
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:21,419
We'll re-run everything. Maybe the 
doer's in the system a year later.

104
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,600
Can't wait to break his stones.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,630
Here's the touchy part, Scotty.

106
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:27,933
Jeffries knew the victims.

107
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,034
This was a solid investigation.

108
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,748
Yeah. / No way homicide's 
gonna know about a robbery.

109
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:38,554
That's West detectives.

110
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:41,845
So, uh, you landed on Minter
pretty quick last year, huh?

111
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,367
Yeah. He worked there.
He had the key.

112
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,807
- It was practically gift-wrapped.
- Well, we all thought it was him.

113
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,719
We were wrong. Black eye.

114
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,760
What can you tell us
about Della and Tom?

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,585
Della's was a kind of sanctuary.

116
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,331
If you kept your nose clean,
you were welcome.

117
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,208
If you didn't, you were gone.

118
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,111
Not easy keeping a business 
open in the Badlands.

119
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,857
Della's was hopping every night,

120
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,029
but since the murders...

121
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:05,002
the whole neighborhood's 
taken a slide.

122
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,205
Will, Della and Tom had a daughter?

123
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:08,562
Nora.

124
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:12,452
- MBA student at Temple.
- Why don't you and Lil start with her.

125
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,111
And, uh, what am I gonna do?

126
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,882
This other victim, Derek.

127
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,170
He have any family?

128
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,081
- Addict brother.
- Want us to track him down, boss?

129
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,638
Yeah.

130
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,531
Guy didn't even know his 
own name when I notified him.

131
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,984
Let's see if he does now.

132
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,730
Squeak minter's on trial.

133
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,270
- Thought he was going down.
- Case was thrown out this morning.

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,152
For real?

135
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,584
You know of anyone else might
have had a beef with your brother?

136
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,678
People loved Derek.

137
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,116
He was a good kid.

138
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,188
You mind?

139
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:02,558
So how did he stay so good
with you on the needle?

140
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,388
Della and Tom.

141
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:05,636
Weren't you his guardian?

142
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,360
Technically, but, uh, they're
the ones looked out for him.

143
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,670
How'd you clean up?

144
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,760
Derek's dying shook me up.

145
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,293
I met a guy in recovery.
Told me the guard teaches a trade.

146
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,865
Gonna try and lock a union job.

147
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,087
Did you see Derek the night he died?

148
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,231
Is that a yes or a no?

149
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,294
I saw him,

150
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:29,024
but I was distracted.

151
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,713
Oh, you know Derek.

152
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:35,788
I thought you said you 
was gonna get clean.

153
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,816
I am. This, man...

154
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,255
It's no thing.

155
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,987
Just walk like you own the block.

156
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:47,408
Yo, check out the player.

157
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,423
Yo, Simms. Back off, man.

158
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,338
Where you think you're going?

159
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:53,612
Market street?

160
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,832
Look, man, I ain't got no
problem with you.

161
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,164
But I got a problem with you.

162
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,941
See, like... 50 problems.

163
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,285
I ain't giving you no money.

164
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,698
You pay the tax, or you
come roll with my crew.

165
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

166
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,298
- I want you outta here.
- This ain't your business.

167
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,660
You disrespect yourself,
that's your business.

168
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,655
You mess with this block, it's mine.

169
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,727
- You think this is your block?
- Oh, that's right,

170
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,442
and unless you want your friends to 
see you get smacked by an old woman,

171
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,628
you best move.

172
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,025
You don't wanna mess with me.

173
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:26,102
You got to ten to make 
your ass disappear.

174
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:28,511
One.

175
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,754
Two.

176
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,033
Three.

177
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,272
We'll see you later.

178
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,310
Let's roll.

179
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:52,589
I never even moved.

180
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,635
You think Simms might have
come back for her that night?

181
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:58,362
Della stared down thugs.

182
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,432
In the neighborhood,
that makes people love you,

183
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,770
but it also makes you enemies.

184
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,140
You know where Simms is now?

185
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,728
I stay away from that life.

186
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:11,842
Would have been nice if you
told me this last year, Tre.

187
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,959
I was sick. I was scared and...

188
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,398
I'm trying to do 
some good now. / Hey,

189
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,960
you kicked drugs,
did a stint in the guard.

190
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,721
A resume like that,
you could end up president.

191
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:41,556
It's crazy how you take
out one small place

192
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:45,039
and a whole neighborhood 
suddenly feels hopeless.

193
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,849
That big a difference, huh?

194
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:51,108
Well, stop the heart, the body dies.

195
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,596
So you didn't want in
on this case last year?

196
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:59,620
Stillman thought I was too close.

197
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,705
Will!

198
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,160
Hi, Nora.

199
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,748
- Sorry about this morning.
- I'm okay.

200
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:07,275
This is Lilly rush.

201
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,044
She was the first 
detective on the job.

202
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,830
Thanks for meeting us here. / Sure.

203
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,409
No one's stepped foot in here
since the police left that morning.

204
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:18,500
No one?

205
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,618
I just locked the door 
and walked away.

206
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,099
Why don't you talk out here?

207
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,556
I'll go in.

208
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,751
How you doing, detectives?

209
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,832
It's a bad case of death.

210
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,318
Lil?

211
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,807
You had dinner here that night?

212
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,468
Yeah, um...

213
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:15,262
while they were setting up.
Before my class.

214
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,830
Remember any conversations
your parents had?

215
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,507
Arguments?

216
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,799
Just some back and forth
with my mom and the waitress.

217
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,901
What about?

218
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,965
I couldn't really tell.

219
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,735
I know what I saw.

220
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,431
You're wrong.

221
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,516
This kind of problem 
doesn't go away by itself.

222
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:38,297
There is no problem.

223
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,012
Honey, look me in the eye.

224
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,878
You don't want to get into this.

225
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:46,350
- It'll get you hurt.
- I don't scare.

226
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,923
Now, come into the light
and look me in the eye.

227
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,065
Mom, leave her alone.

228
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,564
The girl needs help.

229
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:56,804
Daddy? / Don't look at me.

230
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:58,134
I got a daughter majors in business,

231
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,392
a wife who majors in 
other people's business.

232
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,415
Me, I'm just a restaurant owner.

233
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,252
Mom...

234
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:05,991
you keep sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong,

235
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:08,285
you're gonna get it cut off.

236
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:11,627
That's the last thing
I ever said to my mother.

237
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,644
Where can we find the waitress?

238
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,954
My mother collected strays.

239
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:23,203
Her name was Tyra.
Her number's probably in the back.

240
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,114
You might want to call
a cleaning service, Nora.

241
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:27,667
I'll clean up.

242
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,544
I'd hire someone.

243
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:35,160
once the bodies are removed,
the department's work is done. So

244
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,162
no one's cleaned up in there.

245
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,045
I'm gonna stay a few minutes.

246
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:32,856
Della was nosing in this Tyra's 
business the night of the murders.

247
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:36,766
So? / So Tyra didn't 
take too kindly to it.

248
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,657
I interviewed that waitress.
She ain't our shooter.

249
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,975
Still worth a second conversation.

250
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,965
Way more likely 
it's this Simms guy.

251
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,908
- What's his story, Nick?
- He's a thug.

252
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,631
Deals drugs on the corner,

253
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,612
he's flashing a gun around.

254
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:51,156
He had words with 
Della and Derek that night.

255
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,915
Well, her throat being cut
says it was more personal than that.

256
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,147
She dissed him in front of his crew.

257
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:58,321
That's personal 
to these mugwumps.

258
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,607
J.T. Simms' juvie records.

259
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,299
2001,

260
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,254
he robbed a white castle,
right at closing.

261
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:06,086
Same M.O. 
as the chicken and ribs job.

262
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,901
- Getting better all the time.
- How'd we miss Simms last year?

263
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:13,249
You know how chatty people are,
ratting out the neighborhood badass.

264
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,294
We'll follow up on Tyra.

265
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,931
Simms is the better bet.

266
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,398
Run them both down.

267
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:21,213
Check on Derek's friend, Joe,
while you're at it.

268
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,348
Let's hit the Badlands.

269
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:35,897
We understand the 
night of the murders,

270
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:37,890
you and Della were arguing.

271
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,991
No, I don't think so.

272
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,462
Della's daughter says it was over
some problem you were having.

273
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:45,389
Probably it was just some
misunderstanding about my schedule.

274
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,938
This is Jammal.

275
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,694
They're asking about Della and Tom.

276
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:53,895
So what, that boy Squeak
didn't do that?

277
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,623
No.

278
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,811
You don't seem surprised.

279
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:59,850
You tell them about Frank?

280
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,860
No. / Who's Frank?

281
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,084
He, um, he did odd jobs, at Della's.

282
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,750
Oh, he did other things, too.

283
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,704
Tell them what you saw.

284
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,487
Della was messing with Frank?

285
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,651
It's, it's just what I saw.

286
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,729
You never told anyone?

287
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,346
People shouldn't get messed up
in other people's relationships.

288
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:54,544
I don't know.

289
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,970
No.

290
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,335
Never seen him.

291
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:59,377
J.T. simms.

292
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,044
Hung on the corner here for two 
years, right in front of your stoop.

293
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:03,636
Nope.

294
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,118
Thanks a million.

295
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,943
- She give you anything?
- Told me to go pound sand.

296
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,468
Who else can we find to lie to us?

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,217
You still seeing that girl?

298
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,825
Elisa? Nah.

299
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,943
What happened?

300
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:29,004
Nothing. Just, uh, time to move on.

301
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,428
So you're back in the hunt?

302
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,482
Uh... I guess.

303
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:39,576
Well, a couple of nurses at 
st. Joe's, up for a night out.

304
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,594
Your wife coming?

305
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,358
Someone's trying 
to get our attention.

306
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,586
You looking for stick Simms?

307
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:59,436
I'm putting this place on the market,

308
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,238
hoping someone's 
looking for a tax write-off.

309
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,078
Ever think about opening it again?

310
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:06,838
Not in this neighborhood.

311
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:10,366
We're aware of whoever killed my parents
probably lives within two blocks of here.

312
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:13,191
I can't smile and 
serve them every day.

313
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,938
So, um...

314
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:17,775
you wanted to know about Frank?

315
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,778
Well, Tyra said he might have
been close with your parents.

316
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:22,103
With my mom maybe.

317
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:25,966
Why's that? / She had a weakness 
for men who needed to be saved.

318
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,035
Um, are you hiring?

319
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,205
No, honey. I'm sorry.

320
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,459
Do you know Frank's last name?

321
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,767
Morgan, I think.

322
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,425
Buster morgan, the boxer?

323
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,825
Yeah. My dad called him that.

324
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:41,143
You know where he stays?

325
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:43,139
He never had a permanent situation.

326
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,687
Why are you asking about Frank?

327
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,699
His name came up is all.

328
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,835
Guy from the shelter said try 
the tent city round the corner.

329
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:54,256
It's behind big Ed's gym.

330
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:56,065
You know this area 
pretty good, huh?

331
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,565
I grew up two blocks over.

332
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:00,862
I used to go to that gym
and watch the guys spar.

333
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,009
You ever get in the ring?

334
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,211
No, I got hit enough 
in my own house.

335
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,505
Frank, Frank morgan?

336
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,515
I'm Frank.

337
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:17,453
- What? 
- It's Will jeffries, buster.

338
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,139
Will who?

339
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,732
We're here about Della lincoln.

340
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:25,372
- You know Della?
- We're investigating her murder.

341
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,837
Right. Stupid.

342
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,298
Della's gone.

343
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:34,184
We got a witness saw you and 
Della kissing the night she died.

344
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,686
- Tom?
- Tom's dead, too.

345
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,321
Because it was a mistake.

346
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,153
What was?

347
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:43,748
Come on, Frank.

348
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,191
Tell us what happened that night.

349
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,713
Did you lose something?

350
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,547
Where'd you get that?

351
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:00,469
Tom found them in the trash.

352
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,977
You gotta take them, Frank.

353
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:04,812
You can't forget, 
not even for a day.

354
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,303
They make me tired.

355
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,614
They keep you right. / I know.

356
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:11,443
We're gonna get 
you back on your feet.

357
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:14,114
No. No. No, Frank.

358
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,255
What is going on?

359
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,678
I'm, I'm...

360
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,195
I'll just...
I won't come back.

361
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,444
I'm sorry. / Frank. Frank!

362
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,879
Della cares about you,
just like I do,

363
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:30,979
but there's different kinds of caring.
You can't confuse the two.

364
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,899
I know. You can't go kissing
on other men's wives.

365
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,321
Oh, I won't. I won't.

366
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,254
Give me that stuff.

367
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,299
Dinner crowd's gonna be in soon.

368
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:49,865
He didn't kick me out,

369
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,601
when by rights, he could've.

370
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,334
What were E meds for?

371
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,519
I get extreme.

372
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,445
Did you get extreme that night?

373
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,869
Hurt Della and Tom?

374
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,546
Hurt them? They was the 
only thing holding me together.

375
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,336
Frank, do you remember
a fight between Della and Tyra?

376
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,382
Della caught her putting on makeup.

377
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:13,958
What do you mean?

378
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,308
Her boyfriend hit her

379
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,559
and Tyra was trying to 
cover up the bruise.

380
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:25,335
You couldn't fool Della, see?

381
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,702
J.T. simms?

382
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,484
What'd I do?

383
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,937
You tell us.

384
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,743
It's about the murders at the 
chicken and ribs place, last year.

385
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,365
Don't remember nothing about it.

386
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:50,988
You sure?

387
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:56,091
Because if my boys saw me almost 
get bitch-slapped by an old woman,

388
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:58,220
I know I'd remember.

389
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:01,036
You better get biggie here
out of my face.

390
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:02,599
Della made you look small.

391
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,836
Maybe you went back later
to settle the score.

392
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:09,109
Using that gun you flashed at Derek
jackson and Joe moore that night.

393
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,206
I ain't talking no more.

394
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,699
Why not?

395
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,068
Who you scared of, Joe?

396
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:17,567
Who you think runs the game now?

397
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,970
So he took your place out there, huh?

398
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,589
How'd that happen?

399
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:25,052
Hey, stick, we got you 
at the scene that night.

400
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,847
You beefed with two of the victims,
got priors with the same M.O.

401
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,433
And don't play that cripple card.
Triple murderers get no love.

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,335
I've seen Joe outside
the restaurant the next day.

404

Three in there.

405

Don't leave till you talk
to the detective on this job.

406
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,682
That ain't you?

407
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,854
Not anymore.

Ask for detective Vera.

409

00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,125
Yeah.

Your boy Derek in there?

414
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,872
- Yep. 
- Roll with me,

415
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,483
be my soldier.

416
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:33,855
You don't got to worry about 
something like that happening to you.

417
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,695
- Yo, dawg...
- yo, I ain't your dawg!

418
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,236
Then what are you?

419
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:40,227
Somebody you got to step around.

420
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:41,788
Take a look.

421
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,964
See what I can do?

422
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:49,745
You saying you took 
your own boy out?

423
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:53,549
Maybe you can be my soldier.

424
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,533
It was biblical, man.

425
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,515
Ice cold.

426
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:06,081
And you just believe him,
just rolled over, give up your turf?

427
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,140
That brother turned hard, man.

428
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,556
He backed it up,

429
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:11,058
came down on my crew.

430
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,301
Where do we find Joe?

431
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,754
Man I tell you that, I get killed.

432
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,333
Not if he goes away for this.

433
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,146
Triple murder gets you a date
with the needle real quick.

434
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,717
So we're off Frank as a suspect?

435
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,876
He's goofed in the head,
but he doesn't have murder in him.

436
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,972
Told us Tyra's secret, though.

437
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,553
Her boyfriend Jammal 
was beating her up,

438
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,626
and Della was wise to it.

439
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,794
Scotty called in.
They're looking to pick up Joe moore.

440
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:44,967
Derek's friend? / Yeah, guess he 
bragged to Simms about being the shooter.

441
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,997
That kid? He was 
in shock at the scene.

442
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,589
Playing dumb?

443
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,997
Something hinky in this lab report.

444
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:55,086
- Like what?
- Well, the first time they ran the prints,

445
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:58,013
they excluded 
matches for the victims.

446
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,115
They did a blanket search this time.

447
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:05,099
And Derek's prints are
all over Della and Tom's shoes.

448
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,236
Dragging the bodies?

449
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:09,819
Oh, god.

450
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:12,280
Tell me Derek wasn't in on this.

451
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,138
Derek and Joe were pals, right, Lil?

452
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:18,824
Maybe an inside job gone bad.

453
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:33,258
We wake you, Joe?

454
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:38,563
Yeah, can I get 
a coke or something?

455
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:40,246
Why don't we visit here a minute.

456
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:42,347
You had a busy year.

457
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:44,645
Possession, ag-assault,

458
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,524
assault with intent.

459
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:49,006
Taking down Della's gave
you a taste, is that it?

460
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,519
How'd it work that night? Did Derek 
leave the back door open for you or what?

461
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,120
- Why you talking about Derek?
- You and him robbed that place.

462
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,223
Maybe so you could pay for that 
sweet escalade you're pushing.

463
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,483
Have some respect, all right?
You know, Derek is dead.

464
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:06,007
Well, he wasn't dead when he dragged
Della and Tom's body into the bathroom.

465
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:08,251
We got those prints, Joe.

466
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:11,891
Maybe Derek lost it after 
you shot Della and Tom.

467
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:15,591
You couldn't trust him to shut up,
so you had to pop him, too.

468
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:17,640
Nah, nah, me and Derek was tight.

469
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,319
Yeah, but you were going 
different ways. Derek was straight.

470
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,874
- He had no stomach for the life.
- Not like you.

471
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,005
You were tough.

472
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:28,520
Getting sick and tired of having no scratch
and getting hassled on the block, right?

473
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,423
That night...

474
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,966
was your coming out.

475
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:36,879
You want to know where I was
at when Derek got shot?

476
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,334
Taking a boot to the head
from my mom's boyfriend.

477
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,698
Nine stitches.

478
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,816
Ask at the Temple ER.

479
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:48,476
So why'd you brag to everyone
you did the murders?

480
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:53,254
You think anyone on that block's
looked at me since then?

481
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,182
Tyra's here.

482
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,443
Say, I got some kind of 
bench warrant or something?

483
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:13,914
Yeah...

484
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:16,677
This isn't really about the warrant.

485
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,778
It's about Jammal.

486
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:30,590
What about him?

487
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,848
I know he hits you, Tyra.

488
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:35,084
No, he don't.

489
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:45,761
Della knew, too.

490
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:48,435
And from what I hear about Della,
she could be pretty forceful

491
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:50,406
if she wanted something.

492
00:27:50,406 --> 00:27:51,836
That's the truth.

493
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,235
And I bet she wanted 
you to leave Jammal.

494
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:58,135
That's what you were 
fighting about that day.

495
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:04,525
We're talking about Della here.

496
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,543
Don't you owe her the truth?

497
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,305
She said I could come stay with her.

498
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,767
Must have pissed 
Jammal off pretty good.

499
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:16,597
Well, Jammal didn't know.

500
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:21,122
If he was pissed at anyone...

501
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,217
it was Derek.

502
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:25,621

Too bad you ain't five years older.

You're going places. / Yeah, who 
says I don't have room for two?

- So give me a few years.

he was, he was a sweet, sweet boy.

Did Jammal kill those people?

00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:46,231
I don't know.

522
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,299
I really don't.

523
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,611
But, uh...

524
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:54,166
he never came home that night.

525
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,351
Okay.

526
00:29:57,351 --> 00:29:59,743
This is a place you can be safe.

527
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,467
And I'm gonna write 
my number on the back.

528
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,861
Don't go home, Tyra.

529
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,334
No.

530
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,179
Where am I gonna find Jammal?

531
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,245
Joe's ER alibi checked out.

532
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:21,280
Had to cut him loose.

533
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,239
I like Jammal's motive more anyway.

534
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,466
So,

535
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:27,106
did Vera screw this job up
after he took it from you?

536
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:28,439
I don't know.

537
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:32,045
He did have some trouble
at home this time last year.

538
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,213
Scotty. Rush.

539
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,314
Hi.

540
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,479
I'll get the car.

541
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,577
You kind of snapped out
in court the other day.

542
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,551
I kind of got made a fool of.

543
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,223
We got new direction on the job,
might bring it back to you.

544
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,787
Really? Will Vera testify again?

545
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:52,363
Kite.

546
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,263
So what's the new angle?

547
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:58,317
Looks like a jealous boyfriend had it 
out for the kid who worked there.

548
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,747
It's always love isn't it.

549
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:02,270
Or money.

550
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:05,259
We're gonna have 
to work together, Rush.

551
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,925
We will.

552
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,934
So, how are you anyway?

553
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,985
Great. Thanks.

554
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:14,749
Or good, at least.

555
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:17,006
You regret it?

556
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,853
No.

557
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:20,770
Me neither.

558
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,500
You been to first Thursdays lately?

559
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,346
Not lately, no.

560
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,553
Bye, Kite.

561
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,495
I barely knew that kid.

562
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:37,422
All you needed to know was 
he was touching the merchandise.

563
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:42,521
Your girl left you for a 17 year old.
That'd be pretty embarrassing.

564
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,828
She wasn't gonna leave.

565
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,255
Derek painted her 
a pretty nice picture.

566
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:46,313
You heard it yourself.

567
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,230
Trust me. 
Tyra wouldn't leave.

568
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,846
Because you'd break 
her face if she did?

569
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:55,963
- I didn't do those murders.
- You don't have an alibi.

570
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:58,189
But you got motive and opportunity.

571
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:02,080
You better start talking about what
happened in that alley, Jammal.

572
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,700
Just a little life lesson.

573
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,513
"Don't touch the merchandise".

574
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:11,806
Let's go in.

575
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,057
Just tell me I'm not crazy.

576
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,822
Derek...

577
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:19,579
Jammal, leave him.

578
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,065
You trying to get with my girl?

579
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,870
- Jammal!
- You messing with my girl, man?

580
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,889
You gonna hit me like you hit her?

581
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:27,793
You want to get hit.

582
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,607
I can't hear you!
I can't hear you!

583
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:32,010
He's just a kid!

584
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,686
Hey, hey, hey!

585
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,559
Mess with my brother, hmm?

586
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,522
Messing with my brother, huh?

587
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:41,440
What is going...?

588
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,401
Don't come back, Jammal!

589
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,203
Whatever!

590
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,221
So I left, okay?

591
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,655
My business was done.

592
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,499
Where'd you go?

593
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:53,487
Hey, you need an alibi, brother.

594
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,015
A girl.

595
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,359
A girl that ain't Tyra.

596
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,106
Scotty.

597
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:01,458
Don't go nowhere.

598
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,546
Shooting in the Badlands.

599
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:08,659
J.T. simms got gunned 
down in his wheelchair.

600
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:15,317
Life's cheap, huh, Joe?

601
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:19,766
Take down a guy in a wheelchair,

602
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,917
- that's pretty brave.
- Wasn't me.

603
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,869
No? Who else you figure
would want to shoot down stick Simms?

604
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,107
Someone talks to the cops,
they gonna get smoked.

605
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:30,190
What happened, Joe?

606
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,540
You and Derek steered 
clear of the streets.

607
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,961
You were on the path.

608
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:38,285
What would Derek think if 
he saw you sitting in here?

609
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:40,561
Derek is dead.

610
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,012
Della and Tom are dead.

611
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:43,948
Rest of us do what it take to survive.

612
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,787
Nothing more important
than street creds, right?

613
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:47,167
Hey, don't talk like you know me.

614
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,219
Vera, you wanna 
get Joe a soft drink?

615
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,461
I was friends with Della and Tom.

616
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,532
- Good for you.
- Don't disrespect them.

617
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:10,513
They deserve better.

618
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,749
You and I are alike, Joe.

619
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,317
You see me working for the man?

620
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:17,868
I grew up in the Badlands.

621
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,601
Had crap parents who 
didn't have any interest in me

622
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,860
except to send me out 
to buy their cigarettes.

623
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,800
So? / So, I had a football coach.

624
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,880
Got me off the corners.
Showed me discipline.

625
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,843
Said I could be something instead 
of just another street hanger.

626
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:37,007
And I had a best friend like Derek.

627
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:40,222
We made plans to get a better life.

628
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:41,608
If I'd lost either of them,

629
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:44,644
I don't know which way
I would have turned.

630
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:47,511
I know you woke up one morning,

631
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:50,639
and everyone you 
put hope in was gone.

632
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,490
- I got by.
- Look around, Joe.

633
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,294
This is the end of the line.

634
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:04,720
I don't know who 
killed Derek and them.

635
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,439
Help me figure out who did.

636
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,287
You two always went home together.

637
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,518
Why not that night?

638
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,787
Because Derek wasn't going home.

639
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:16,782
What is going on?

640
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,590
Don't come back, Jammal.

641
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,770
Whatever, man.

642
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,732
Tyra, honey?

643
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:25,936
Go on inside.

644
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:28,093
Give me a hand with him.

645
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,132
Are you okay?

646
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:31,520
Yeah, I'm fine.

647
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,341
I'd take some blows for her, too.

648
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,062
Tre?

649
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:39,273
Tre jackson?

650
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,320
Oh, son.

651
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,951
I stopped him from beating on you.

652
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:45,569
How many times you tell me 
you were cleaning yourself up?

653
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:46,896
He promised.

654
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,835
It breaks my heart 
to see you like this.

655
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:51,724
But if you can't look after
Derek, it's best if I do.

656
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:53,411
Tell her how I look out for you.

657
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,939
You get yourself together.

658
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:57,130
You come back.

659
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,840
Go on home.

660
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,330
Derek's gonna stay here a while.

661
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,361
Tomorrow.

662
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,498
Woke up the next day...

663
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:26,075
everything was different.

664
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:28,229
Right.

665
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:35,036
So he go for shooting Simms?

666
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,635
Not yet.

667
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:38,333
Community service murder, right?

668
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,483
Now they're both off the streets.

669
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:44,337
Yeah, it's just the Badlands.
Who cares?

670
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:46,363
Just two thugs.
So, no, I don't care.

671
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:51,529
Ever think there'd be one less murder
if you'd worked this job right a year ago?

672
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,506
I worked a good case.

673
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:58,073
Look, you wanna be sloppy in your 
personal life, your marriage, you go ahead.

674
00:36:58,073 --> 00:37:02,623
- Don't you talk about my marriage.
- But don't be a bum on this job.

675
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:04,972
Will, let's take a walk.

676
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,616
Lil, um...

677
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:22,050
Tre told us he saw 
Derek early that night,

678
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:26,540
but, uh, he didn't mention 
this bottle incident later on.

679
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:54,939
What's up? / You said last time 
you saw Derek was early in the night.

680
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:57,040
Yeah.

681
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,393
But you came back 
later all strung out.

682
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:03,970
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
Da, da, damn,

683
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,096
I forgot. I...

684
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:09,372
It was an ugly fight.
It's tough to forget.

685
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:11,502
We've got DNA from the scene.

686
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:14,687
Maybe we run it through 
the military data bank?

687
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:23,322
Let go of the rifle, Tre.

688
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:28,307
Tre, let it go.

689
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:39,996
I wouldn't have let 
someone go to jail for it.

690
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:46,147
I would've told the truth.

691
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:51,571
Tell us.

692
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:10,236
Why'd you come back here?

693
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:12,168
I need ten bucks.

694
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,745
You heard Della.

695
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:16,276
You can't keep coming
here wasted, man!

696
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,336
It's for food, man.

697
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:20,578
Look, I'm hungry.

698
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:23,297
Fine. Come on.

699
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:24,602
You can have some chicken.

700
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:26,266
But be quiet.

701
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,709
Tom and Della are in the back.

702
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:46,991
What you doing?

703
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,982
I'm good for it, man.
Come on.

704
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:50,411
- Put it back.
- I'll pay you tomorrow, man.

705
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:53,083
- I said put it back, Tre!
- What's going on?

706
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,719
What's going on out here?

707
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,386
No, Tre!

708
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,499
- Tre, what you doing, man?
- Don't be crazy, son.

709
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,992
Step off!

710
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:05,324
- Just step off.
- Give me the gun, Tre.

711
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,429
Tre, what you doing, man!

712
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:12,868
Oh, god... / Tom!

713
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:14,435
Get back!

714
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:17,149
Get back!

715
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,076
Get them, man!

716
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,554
We gotta call an ambulance.

717
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,360
Grab them and put 
them in the bathroom!

718
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,991
Man, we gotta call an ambulance.

719
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,074
- Grab the rope, Derek!
- Tre, we got to get them help!

720
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,988
No!

721
00:40:31,504 --> 00:40:34,453
Help me, Derek!

722
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:36,532
Help me, man!

723
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,614
You an me, look,

724
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,322
we'll start over.

725
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,653
We'll take the cash and 
everything will be okay.

726
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,297
What'd you do, Tre?

727
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:51,263
This is my family! / No,

728
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,838
I'm your family.

729
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,684
I'm blood, man!

730
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:57,525
This is right. This is a plan.

731
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,857
No. / We go away.

732
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,199
We need to get her help.

733
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,297
- It'll work.
- She's alive, Tre!

734
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:05,090
She ain't your family!

735
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,910
But it's Della!

736
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,073
I'm your family!

737
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,387
You got it now?

738
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:20,996
I'm calling for help.

739
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:27,305
No. No, don't make me 
hurt you, Derek.

740
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:31,293
No.

741
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,733
You're not gonna shoot me.

742
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:37,684
I'm your brother!

743
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,173
I love you.

744
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:43,835
