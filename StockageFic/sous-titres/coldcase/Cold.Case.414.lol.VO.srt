00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,460
Will he ask me or won't he?

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,580
Maddy?

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,630
Hey,Michael.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,420
I wanted to ask you something.

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,280
Um,about the Valentine's dance?

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,250

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,430

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,470
- If someone already asked,just...
- No.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,500
Forget it.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,050
I mean,no,nobody asked.

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,450
- You sure you wanna go with me?
- Yeah. Yeah,I'm sure.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,990
Then...yes.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,410
I'm late for first period,but I...

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,010

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,410
See ya.

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,080
"But to whom can I be responsible

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,110
when you refuse to see me?"

20
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,850
Help!

21
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,080

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,640
You're okay.

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,810
You're okay,you're okay.

24
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,430
ADA Thomas stopped by.
Asked about you,Scotty.

25
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,180
Yeah. What about?

26
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,000
Just asked about you.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,580
She's hot.

28
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,780
If you like that type.

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,130
And what type is that exactly?

30
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,230
Ballbuster.

31
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,420
Like I said,smokin'.

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,620
That ballbusting neighbor still giving you grief
about that basketball?

33
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,090
- Way past grief.
- Oh yeah? Do tell.

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,910
Another one bites the dust.

35
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,750
Get out while you still got time.

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,640
Thinkin' long term on this one,Nick?

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,210
He got tickets to the ballet.

38
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,910
Sensitive guy. You like that?

39
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,340
Yeah. Don't be late. Again.

40
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,610
Toni gets it. Life of a cop.

41
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,850
Where's Miller?

42
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,990
Storage. Been mopin' all morning.

43
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,610
Oh,yeah? What's up?

44
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,360
Probably hormones.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,030
Hormones?

46
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,590
Yeah,you know,that female cycle thing.

47
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,660
Sensitive guy.

48
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,370
What?

49
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,210
What?

50
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,520
Cold job?

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,790
Skill Jones.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,530
Knew him,so to speak.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,050
- That right?
- I was working undercover.

54
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,970
Doing drug buys in North Philly.

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,930
It was a lifetime ago.

56
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
Looks like a nice kid.

57
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,500
Dealer.

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,850
Deep in the game.

59
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,090
I was the one who found him.

60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,360
Help!

61
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,050
Help!

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,320
Somebody! Help!

63
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,310
Look at me. Look at me,look at me,

64
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,370
look at me,look at me.

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,950
Keep looking at me.Keep looking at me.</i>

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,000
Kid died in my arms.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,430
He was 15.

68
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,610
Is that why you came down here?

69
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,800
First time since I made murder cop.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,320
Always wondered when I would.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,730
So why today?

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,820
Fifth-year anniversary of his death.

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,010
I found that box next to his.

74
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,580
Madison Reed. Chestnut Hill rich kid.

75
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,570
Both shot and killed same day.

76
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,590
Exact same time.

77
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,250
8:03 A.M.

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,910
Weird.

79
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,370
Jobs could be connected.

80
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,380
White girl from the 'burbs,dealer from the projects?

81
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,690
Seeing someone die...

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,810
...kinda changes you forever.

83
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,560
Yeah. It does.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Don't know much about him.

85
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,390
'Cept his name.

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,510
You need a reason to open a job.

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,260
No one left to speak for Skill.

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,170
For Madison.

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,000
Except us.

90
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,570
Maybe that's reason enough?

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,070
Madison Reed.

95
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,660
Shot with a .357 magnum at close range.

96
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,340
That's a rare weapon.
Any luck tracking it down?

97
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,150
Turned that school inside out.

98
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,100
Got no weapon,no motive.

99
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,830
Kinda crime doesn't happen in Chestnut Hill.

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,870
Chalked it up to random violence.

101
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,700
Job went cold after a year.

102
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,460
- What about Skill Jones?
- Small-time punk.

103
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,960
- Theory was a drug deal gone south.
- Gave up on him after a few weeks.

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,070
We have a last to see?

105
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,420
Not on Skill.

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,340
But another kid,Michael Ellis,

107
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,050
saw Madison at school right before she got shot.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,160
Well,Scotty and I'll have a talk.

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
Madison was a straight "A" student,

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,110
track star,student government type.

111
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,160
What's the connect to Skill?

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,210
We don't know yet.

113
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,650
You got any informants left from your narc days?

114
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,910
Toomey Nelson.

115
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,710
Crackhead,junk peddler,

116
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,920
North Philly 411.

117
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,710
Can't say I don't take you anywhere nice.

118
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,220
Least I don't go to the ballet.

119
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,030
Yo,wassup,dawg?

120
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,860

Five-oh! Five-oh!

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah,that's right.

124
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640

125
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,550
Yo,baby girl,where's them stilettos and the tube top?

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,180

128
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,260
Says you.

129
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,880
So,what? You the boyfriend?

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,540
Philly Homicide,homeslice.

131
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,600
No doubt.

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,830
* Toomey got somethin' for ya. *

133
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,880
I give you the po-po discount. Two dollar.

134
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,590
Think I'll pass.

135
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,060
How 'bout the bling?

136
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,160
Well that's not for sale,baby girl.

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
That's my dreamcatcher.

138
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,190
How 'bout some tube socks,instead?

139
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,080
Thinkin' I might need some 411.

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,480
Oww! Bring it!

141
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,940
Remember that dealer got shot?

142
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,180
Skill Jones?

143
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,840
Skill was good people.

144
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,770
Gave Toomey respect.
That don't come cheap out here.

145
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,860
- You owe him then?  
- No doubt.

146
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,810
I didn't speak my piece back in the day

147
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,480
but now Champ's audi...

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,830
- Who's Champ? 
- Dealer.

149
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,560
Worked the Wilson projects back in 2002.

150
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,280
Word was he was movin' in on a house run by Skill's posse.

151
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,420
- Turf war?
- Well,over new product.

152
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,400
Tried to take Champ oua commission for real.

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah?

154
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,300
- Who'd you hear this from?
- Seen it with my own eyes.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,470
- When'd this go down?
- Few weeks before Skill get hisself shot.

156
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,230
And of all nights... on the New Year.

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,240
Champ,don't never wanna catch you near the house.

158
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,150
Hear? I can't hear you.

159
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,650

You a man now,Skill.

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,530
It's time you earned them stripes.

163
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
- Huh? 
- Huh? You a bitch,too?

164
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,310
- Nah,man. Nah.  
- Then get to it,homey.

165
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,820
Took half of Champ's ear off with them pliers.

166
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,640
Cold.

167
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,020
- Champ go after Skill?
- Tried to,but Skill went underground.

168
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,130
Where to?

169
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,910
Only fams was his gramps up in the projects.

170
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,250
So what was the turf they were warrin' over?

171
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,610
Shootin' gallery on 6th and MLK.

172
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,350
Cookhouse for a lil bit o' hell called methamphetamine.

173
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,200
All right,Toomey.

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,020
Holla at me if you hear anything else.

175
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,060
I don't touch the crunk myself.

176
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,280
* Gotta keep tip-top for the ladies. *

177
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,960
You were the last to see Madison alive,Michael.

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,050
I asked her to some stupid dance that morning,yeah.

179
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,140
Were you two boyfriend and girlfriend?

180
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,120
No,we kinda grew up together,but,not really,no.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
She have a beef with any of your classmates?

182
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,460
No way. Maddy was like totally popular. 
Everyone loved her.

183
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,470
Was she dabbling in drugs at all,Michael?

184
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,280
Nah. No,no way.

185
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,670
Wanna look at me when you answer that?

186
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,240
Maybe you'll feel more comfortable talking downtown.

187
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,290
- Wait a minute,are you arresting me?
- Not if you stop lying.

188
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,730
It was like a few weeks before she was... you know.

189
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,740
Shot.

190
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,890
Yeah.

191
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,250
Our moms had this book club.

192
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,520
That day it was Madison's house.

193
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,260
Go on.

194
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,320
Her dad had just took off,

195
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,910
leaving them penniless basically.

196
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,460
It was really awkward

197
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,420
'cause in Chestnut Hill,money's everything.

198
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,300
Hey,Maddy.

199
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,330
Uh,my mom sent this.

200
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,960
She,uh,couldn't make the book club.

201
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,700
She...

202
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,030
Had another engagement?

203
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,780
Funny how busy everyone's mom is since my dad left.

204
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
Are yookay?

205
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,940
Got a "D" in Orman's English class.

206
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,690
That wench gives Ds to everyone.

207
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,850
Maybe if I didn't,he would have stayed.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,750
Your dad didn't leave because of your "D," Maddy.

209
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,300
How do you know?

210
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,270
It's,like,gonna burn you if you don't put it down.

211
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,170
Oh.

212
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,700
Please don't tell anybody.

213
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,450
Why,Michael.

214
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,090
I thought I heard you come in.

215
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,490
Is your mom here,too?

216
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,110
She,uh,had something to do.

217
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,540
So good seeing you,Michael.

218
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,190
You grow an inch every time I do.

219
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,020
Madison,how many times do I have to tell you
to clean up your stuff?

220
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,490
Yearbook,Mrs. Reed.

221
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,090
Madison never stops,does she?

222
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,090
Uh,I should go.

223
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,180
See you,Maddy.

224
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,890
See ya.

225
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,460
I didn't tell anyone.

226
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,500
Maybe I should have.

227
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,140
Those vials.

228
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,840
Sounds like crack or meth.

229
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,940
Looks like we got our connect.

230
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,000
You ever seen this guy,Michael?

231
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,290
- No. Who is he?  
- A drug dealer from North Philly.

232
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,410
Drug dealer? Whoa,I don't think Madison 
went to that part of town,like,ever.

233
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,890
No kidding.

234
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,540
I know I'm late

235
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,330
LikeI said:life of a cop.

236
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,610
Life of a cop,huh?

237
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,740
Cop who's still got those tickets
in case someone's interested.

238
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,550
Think it's too late for that.

239
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,550
It won't happen again,Toni.

240
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,930
You said that the last time.

241
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,760
I was working this job.

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,380
Kid wasn't much older than Andre.

243
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,850
Never seen Andre take to someone the way he does to you.

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
He's a good kid.

245
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,890
He's mine.

246
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,510
Don't want to make promises I can't deliver.

247
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,210
Who's saying I can't deliver?

248
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,960
You can't make it to a date,Nick,come on.

249
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,740
What's this really about,Toni?

250
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,130
I never intended to settle down with a cop.

251
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,660
Wondering every night if he'll walk through that door.

252
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,310
I never intended on being Insta-Dad,

253
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,590
but sometimes life throws you a curve.

254
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,200
- Are you saying my son's a burden?  
- No.

255
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,390
I'm saying give me a shot.

256
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,030
I can't.

257
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,470
sorry

258
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,450
A super achiever like Madison could have used meth
to pull all-nighters.

259
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Hoit usually starts.

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,620
Next thing you know,you're hooked to the grave.

261
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,930
No tox report from her autopsy.

262
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,520
Goody Two-Shoes like her,no need.

263
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,400
Could be Skill was her dealer.

264
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,880
Or someone closer to home.

265
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,290
Gibby Hanes,senior at Madison's high school.

266
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,360
Misdemeanor arrest for slinging meth.

267
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,550
Pleaded out as a minor.
First-time offense.

268
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,000
yep.

269
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,870
Chestnut Hill bling talks.

270
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,680
- North Philly bling don't.
- Let's bring Gibby in.

271
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,340
And Mom.

272
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,490
Any 411 on Skill?

273
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,040
Suspect numero uno: local drug rival named Champ.

274
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,290
Bit the big one a few months back.

275
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,850
Is that right?

276
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,870
Clockers' shelf life being what it is.

277
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,030
Leaving us high and dry.

278
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,460
But Skill's gramps is still around.

279
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,020
Maybe that's where he hid out.

280
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,140
- You'll have a talk?
- Yes,we will.

281
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,210
You think Madison was a drug addict?

282
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,810
- Excuse me,you are...?
- I'm her mother.

283
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,270
And you're wrong,dead wrong.

284
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,700
Maddy was a good girl.

285
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,560
Michael had no right to tell you that.

286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,900
- Why don't we talk in private?
- It's bad enough that you never found her killer.

287
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,080
And now you're blaming her?

288
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I think you've done enough already.

289
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
What a parent doesn't know...

290
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,040
Skill lost his daddy to the needle,

291
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,250
his mama to the pipe.

292
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,080
You might say white powder is the family curse.

293
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,230
You were all Skill had left in the world.

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,470
Since he was but a baby.

295
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,320
I loved that boy like he was the sun and the moon.

296
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,100
But... you know Skill was in the game.

297
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,770
I tried to stop him,

298
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,780
but then the Word showed him the error of his ways.

299
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,680
You want to elaborate,Mr. Jones?

300
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,180
New Year's Eve,about three weeks

301
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,700
before the Lord took him from me.

302
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,630
Same night they worked over Champ.

303
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,890
What happened on New Year's Eve?

304
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,410
My grandson finally came home.

305
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,800
Six... five... four... three... two...

306
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,670
one!

307
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,540
Skill?

308
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,310
Skill,that you?

309
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,740
Skill.

310
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,960
What's wrong with you,boy?

311
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,160
- You're bleeding,son.
- Don't touch me!

312
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,330
I can't get it off!

313
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,350
Grandpa.

314
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,950
What'd you do,boy?

315
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,700
I... I hurt a kid.

316
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,150
You got to get out the game,Skill.

317
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,960
You hear me?

318
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,380
Who's gonna take care of the bills?

319
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,520
Who's gonna take care of you,Grandpa?

320
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,020
Who?

321
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,940
Ain't the answer.

322
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,390
Never was,it never will be.

323
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,200
All I know is banging,Grandpa.

324
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Then you got to dream bigger dreams.

325
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,310
Like what?

326
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,240
Go back to school.
Make something of yourself.

327
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,610
I... I,I just want...

328
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,900
What,Skill?

329
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,640
To find peace.

330
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,260
Skill got out the streets,

331
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,560
stay here with me
and went back to school,

332
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,290
but then he died.

333
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,520
What kind of gun did Skill have?

334
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,720
.357 Glock.Why?

335
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,300
Same type of gun that killed Madison.

336
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,800
You ever see this girl,Mr. Jones?

337
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,920
Maybe with Skill?

338
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,040
White girl?

339
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,390
I don't think so,no.

340
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,260
Who is she?

341
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,520
Killed the same day your grandson was.

342
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,020
Anything else,

343
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,750
give us a call.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
That why y'all care now?

345
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,390
About Skill?

346
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,600
'Cause a white girl died?

347
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,500
I was the one who found him,

348
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,650
Mr. Jones...

349
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,920
...on that playground.

350
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,000
Did he find peace?

351
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,220
I don't know.

352
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,590
Stockbroker?

353
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,770
Pay as well as drug dealing?

354
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,350
- Your partner's funny.  
- You remember a kid named Madison Reed?

355
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,560
- Shot down in the schoolyard.
- And that's relevant to me how?

356
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,070
We know about you slinging,Gibby,
so lose the "aw,shucks" act.

357
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,400
I was small potatoes,okay?
The most I sold was dried out pot from my sock drawer.

358
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,320
- Says here you dealt meth.
- Look,I peddled a few vials at school,okay? So what?

359
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,570
Selling to rich teenyboppers.

360
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,780
- Tough guy.
- At least I got laid.

361
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,640
Wasn't a jock,so I was Chestnut Hill's Tony Montana.

362
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,100
Say hello to my little friend.

363
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,240
Big man on campus,huh?

364
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,880
- So why'd you quit slinging?
- 'Cause I almost blew up my mom's Viking stove.

365
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,400
- She would have freaked.  
- So...Madison bought from you?

366
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,100
Like I said,I was done dealing it,
so I brought her to the source.

367
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,480
- Out of the goodness of your heart.
- She was hot.

368
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,780
Freshman. Drool,drool.
Plus she gave me 20 bucks.

369
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,670
Talk about where you took her.

370
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,860
Was a cookhouse on 6th and MLK in North Philly.

371
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,110
Where the big boys played.

372
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,400
In the same house Skill's boys worked.

373
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,540
- That where she scored?
- Wrong again.

374
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,790
Let's just say that she had a soft spot for the crunkheads.

375
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,010
What a bunch of sad sacks.

376
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm audi in,like,two seconds.

377
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,050
You cannot leave me here.

378
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,110
Mom.

379
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,890
Mom!

380
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,560
Mom!

381
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
- Maddy.  
- Mom?

382
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,980
Is that you,baby?

383
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,940
I've been looking for you everywhere.
For two days!

384
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,170
You're such a good girl,Maddy.
You know that?

385
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,580
You promised you'd quit,you'd stop this time!.

386
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,800
I know .I know,I tried,I did.

387
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,620
But I just want to not feel things anymore,

388
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,700
- so just let me do that,okay?
- I want to go home.

389
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,100
Please,Mom.

390
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,160
But it's just like heaven here,sweetie.

391
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,790
Don't you see how pretty it is?

392
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,910
We're in heaven.

393
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,910
Pathetic,huh?

394
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,890
Some people have no self-control.

395
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,770
Her mom was the meth addict?

396
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,290
- Not Madison?
- Bingo.

397
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,090
I sold to Mrs. Reed once at some PTA meeting.

398
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,840
- Middle-aged loser.
- But then you stopped dealing.

399
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,660
So Shirley had to look for her fix elsewhere.

400
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,870
In Skill's sort of heaven.

401
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,900
Too bad you weren't.

402
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,620
I'm not sure I understand.

403
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,410
The Jenny Crank diet,does that ring any bells?

404
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,310
Coming in here with an attitude
when you were nothing but a tweaker,

405
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,800
a junkie,a crankhead.

406
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,340
You have no right to talk to me like that.

407
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,470
You bought drugs from a kid in Madison's school.

408
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,680
And when that well dried up,
you left your daughter for days looking to score.

409
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,740
- You've got no proof of that.  
- You want proof?

410
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,720
Your daughter is six feet under because of you.

411
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,740
You've known for five years why she was killed,
so enough with the bull.

412
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,300
I was trying to hold it together after my husband left,okay?

413
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,440
The bills and the house,

414
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,660
trying to pretend that we were okay
when we were drowning.

415
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,350
Oh,smoking meth.

416
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,250
That's the answer?

417
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,670
It was a nightmare.

418
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,270
And I couldn't wake up.

419
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,720
I had no one to turn to.

420
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,290
You recognize him?

421
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,340
Someone I'd buy from at the house.

422
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,240
Madison used to give me that look,too.

423
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,330
So... disappointed in me...

424
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,430
again.

425
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,640
Looks like you got clean.

426
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,890
I tried so many times.

427
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,410
But if addiction was a battle,rehab was war.

428
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,310
I'll get clean,Maddy.

429
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,180
This time I will.

430
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,330
Okay,Mom.

431
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,320
You don't believe me,baby.

432
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,470
You always say that and it always ends up the same.

433
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,820
Not this time.

434
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,390
I promise.

435
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,700
Do you remember when Dad left?

436
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,060
What?

437
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,020
- You promised we'd be okay.
- I did? I don't remember.

438
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,420
I do.

439
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,120
Then we will.

440
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,620
Excuse me?
Mrs. Reed?

441
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,300
Yeah? That's my mom.

442
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,430
We can't admit you tonight.

443
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,360
What? Why not?

444
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,350
We don't have the room.
The city's been overwhelmed.

445
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,620
All the clinics are filled to capacity.

446
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,640
- If you don't take her,she'll go out again.
- Madison,please.

447
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,540
I sleep in her bed every night so if she leaves I know

448
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,140
and I can stop her,but sometimes I can't stop her.

449
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,750
There's nothing I can do,I'm sorry.

450
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,340
Please,help us.

451
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,120
Please.

452
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,570
There's a number you can call.

453
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,490
I'll get it.

454
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,260
Maddy?

455
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,710
Maddy,what are we gonna do now?

456
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,260
I went out that night and got high.

457
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,720
And the next night.

458
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,880
Until one day my little girl was gone.

459
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,540
Too late for her.

460
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,330
It takes everything I've got,

461
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,340
every single day not to go out and score.

462
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,450
But I made my daughter a promise,

463
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,580
and I intend to keep it.

464
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,080
It's Skill's high school?

465
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,640
Grandpa said that he had came back here before he died

466
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,290
It's none of my business,
so if you don't want to answer,that's fine by me.

467
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,080
Toni dumped me.

468
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,570
For real?

469
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,900
Why?

470
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,420
Cop's hours,the life,who wants it?

471
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,110
Yeah. I hear that.

472
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,090
You okay?

473
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,280
For a second there,I thought she was the one.

474
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,560
Skill Jones.

475
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,650
His grandfather said he was in school
before he was killed.

476
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,050
He was in my class for exactly three weeks.

477
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,450
And then he dropped out.

478
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,750
Why?

479
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,980
Because he realized he had no future in academia?
I don't know.

480
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,640
You remember any interactions
Skill might have had with fellow students...

481
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,940
over this?

482
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,240
.357 Glock.

483
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,100
There was one kid,came looking for Skill,

484
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,740
but I don't think it was a gun he wanted.

485
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,520
Take your seats,now.

486
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,400
Deshawn,Shanelle,do I look like I'm playing?

487
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,240
Now if you'll open your books,I'd like somebody to read.

488
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,970
Skill?

489
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,420
"I...a-am...

490
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,790
"one... of the... "

491
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,280
"...the most irresponsible beings..."

492
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,180
"that's... e-ever...
lyved."

493
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,440
Lived. The correct pronunciation is lived.

494
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,870
"Ir... irr...

495
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,530
"Irresponsibility is part of my invisibility."

496
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,410
Come on,Skill.

497
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,340
"to...who-m...

498
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,150
"can-can-can...

499
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,370
This is 9th grade level,for goodness sakes.

500
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,630
Don't you know how to read?

501
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,910
Go on.

502
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,550
No.

503
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,620
- What did you say to me?
- I said no.

504
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,740
If you won't obey the rules of my classroom,you can leave.

505
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,850
Now.

506
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,250
"But to...

507
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,030
"who-who-m...

508
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,050
"can I-I be...

509
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,250
"re-re-spon-sible...

510
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,450
...when you refuse to see me?"

511
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,370
Skill!Skill!

512
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,640
Get in your seats!

513
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,110
Now!

514
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,290
Skill!

515
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,060
Skill!

516
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,700
Skill!

517
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,650
- One of your customers is calling.
- I don't deal no more.

518
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,430
Once a hood,always a hood.

519
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,470
No doubt.

520
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,940
Is this the kid you saw?

521
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,120
Yes.

522
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,270
Now if you don't mind,
the hordes will be storming the fort any minute now.

523
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,840
Looks like our Chestnut Hill prep and our North Philly drug dealer were pretty copasetic.

524
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,860
**************

525
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,920
****Skill were tight,Michael.

526
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,710
- I didn't know that kid.
- Got an eyewitness who saw you with Skill.

527
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,310
It's time to come clean.

528
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,950
Look,

529
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,740
I knew about Madison's mom,okay?

530
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,010
And the drugs.

531
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,890
How?

532
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,260
Because I kept going over to their house.
I saw how she got.

533
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,830
- So why not tell anybody?
- Because stuff like that doesn't happen in Chestnut Hill.

534
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,050
People were already treating them like dirt.

535
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,650
You had to protect Madison.

536
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,160
Then one weekend she just disappeared.

537
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,860
- When was this?
- The weekend before she died.

538
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,610
Did you find her?

539
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,460
I asked Gibby,he knew everything about drugs.

540
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,690
He said that she was probably out looking for her mom again.

541
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,990
- Told me about Skill.
- That's why you were at Skill's school?

542
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,600
At first,he wouldn't take me to Maddy.

543
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,970
Wouldn't take my money or anything.

544
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,170
Then I told him,you know...

545
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,310
Told him what?

546
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,460
That I loved her.

547
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,000
I was gonna be the big hero.

548
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,510
But when I found Madison in that house,

549
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,240
she was already gone.

550
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,310
Hey,hey.

551
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
That her?
That your girl?

552
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,590
Hey,Yo.

553
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,910
I came for my mom.

554
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,190
To bring her home.

555
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,210
But I-I can't find her.

556
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,430
I got so tired,you know?

557
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,320
I just want to...

558
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,110
not feel things anymore.

559
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,220
Go to her,man.

560
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,260
Hey,hey.

561
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,080
Your boyfriend here,

562
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,480
came to bring you home.

563
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,020
- There's nothing for me there.
- Nothing for you here,either.

564
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,440
Yo,come on. Get on up.

565
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,120
You don't belong here.
You're just a kid.

566
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,330
So are you.

567
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,010
Me and you?

568
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,290
We're worlds apart.

569
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,350
I just wanna...

570
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,950
disappear.

571
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,010
Become invisible.

572
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,650
'Cause no one even sees me.

573
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,610
Hey.

574
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,510
You ain't invisible.
'Cause I can see you.

575
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,940
And you got to,too.
Even if no one else in the whole world does.

576
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,170
Let's go home.

577
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,510
You and me both.

578
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,800
Okay.

579
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,690
Come on.

580
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,350
- Take this. 
- Nah.

581
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,210
You ain't gotta pay me.

582
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,050
It's a dreamcatcher.

583
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,880
My mom gave it to me.

584
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,510
It's yours now.

585
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,520
So you can get home,too.

586
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,410
I took her home that night.

587
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,480
And the next day she was dead.

588
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,540
That necklace,she gave it to Skill?

589
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,270
Then how did Toomey end up with it?

590
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,370
Michael,you're sure that Skill had that gun on him?

591
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,990
He told Madison he was giving up on dealing.

592
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,020
- And that he'd sell it.  
- Sell it to who?

593
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,730
- To some white guy.  
- What white guy?

594
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,360
Somebody that brought her to the house.

595
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,170
Gibby?

596
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,220
Come on now.
Why you gotta get all po-po on ol' Toomey?

597
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,280
Sit down.

598
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay.

599
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,610
Where'd you get that necklace,Toomey?

600
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,020
One on your cart?

601
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,200
Dumpster,I don't know.

602
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,430
- You been lyin' to me from the get-go.
- Come on,baby girl,Toomey don't play like that.

603
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,810
Don't baby girl me,you two-bit junkie liar.

604
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,080
So it's like that now,huh?

605
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,290
Straight up.

606
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,030
Talk about where you got that piece of junk necklace.

607
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,450
It ain't a piece of junk!

608
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,040
It's a dreamcatcher.

609
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,470
Dreamcatcher,huh?

610
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,700
We all got dreams,baby girl.

611
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,760
You think I planned this?

612
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,210
Pushin' that cart,even the cluckheads laughin' at me?

613
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,020
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

614
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,990
Skill gave you respect.

615
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,830
- It's payback time.
- Please.

616
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,070
He like all the rest in the end...

617
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,290
What'd he do to you,Toomey?

618
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,350
He looked at me the way you lookin' at me right now.

619
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,850
Like I wasn't a man.

620
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,470
"But to whom can I be responsible

621
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,570
when you refuse to see me?"

622
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,310
You like my piece,Skill?

623
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,420
Ol' Toomey be packin'.

624
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,890
Where you get that?

625
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,860
Dumpster behind the bodega.

626
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,110
Say we trade it for some vials?

627
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,770
Gave it up for good.

628
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,530
Slingin'.

629
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,050
Dreamcatcher.

630
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,950
Gotta think bigger dreams than that,man.

631
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,710
Look around,boy.

632
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,500
Streets paved with all sorts o' dreams.

633
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,400
- Come on,Toomey hurting here.
- I ain't invisible.

634
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,360
- Ain't gonna end like this for me.
- You think you better than this or somethin'?

635
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,630
I can't end up like you,Toomey.

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,860
Like me?
What you talkin' about?

637
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,890
I mean,look at you,man.

638
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,380
Look at you.

639
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,040
Then what happened,Toomey?

640
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,120
- I've been here for hours... 
- Like we care.

641
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,470
I'm not some dumb hood from the ghetto.

642
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,660
No,you're some dumb ass
whose daddy can't bail him out for murder.

643
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,420
- I want my lawyer.
- Are you sure?

644
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,600
- Take a few hours.
- Maybe we lose your paperwork.

645
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,630
Let you ride it out in lock-up over the weekend.

646
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,960
Oh,guys down there'd love to test drive
that Chestnut Hill smile.

647
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,750
We know about the gun,Gibby.

648
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,890
- How you bought it off Skill.
- Same gun that killed Madison.

649
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,940
I never bought some stupid Glock off that hood.

650
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,500
Never said it was a Glock.

651
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,750
- I don't have to listen to this crap.
- You're the worst kinda scum.

652
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,720
Selling drugs to kids to get laid?
You think it's some sorta video game?

653
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,470
- You can't touch me. That's police brutality.
- On a second thought,get over here.

654
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,880
You wanna get laid?

655
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,580
- Cons will rip a kiddie pusher like you in two.
- Don't put me down there!

656
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,730
Start talkin',maybe we work something out with the DA.

657
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,400
Nah,nah,nah,no deals,no way.

658
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,970
- Justice time for you,Gibby...
- I'll talk,okay,I'll talk!

659
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,150
Look,I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

660
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,750
Why'd you kill her,Gibby?

661
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,740
Talk.

662
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,940
I just wanted to be cool.

663
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,380
I mean I was Tony Montana,you know?

664
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,210
She was gonna take that all away.

665
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,630
Take a look at my lil friend.

666
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,080
- Get away from me!
- Keep your voice down,you moron.

667
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,720
You're nothing but a stupid drug dealer!

668
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,800
- At least my mom's not a methhead.
- I'm gonna tell the cops what you did.

669
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,440
Newsflash,girlfriend,rich kids like me don't do jail.

670
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,690
You'll still get kicked outta school.
Lose all your stupid friends.

671
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,500
You know,the only reason people like you is 'cause you deal!

672
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,680
Wanna say that again,bitch?

673
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,060
Look at me,huh?

674
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,070
Look at me?

675
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,350
Look at you,boy.

676
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,770
Toomey,this ain't gonna change who you are,man.

677
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,860
You wanna bet?

678
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,810
Say it again,loser.

679
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,710
- You're the loser not me.
- Shut up.

680
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,900
- You're worse than an addict.
- I told you to shut up!

681
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,710
Everybody laughs behind your back
'cause you're a joke!

682
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,690
Oh!

683
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,780
Help!

684
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,140
Somebody! Help!

685
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,930
Oh,okay,okay.

686
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,740
Look at me,look at me.
Keep looking at me,right here.

687
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,600
Right here,look at me.
Look at me,look at me!

688
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,220
Look at me.
