 ¢Ü Happy birthday, dear Roween ¢Ü

00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:14,916
 ¢Ü Happy birthday to you ¢Ü

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:20,653
Aw, geez. What a beautiful cake.
Could've done without the candles, though.

6
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,433
Oh, Baloney. When you were a kid, 
you couldn't wait to blow out the candles.

7
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,710
Yeah, back then,
there weren't 30 of them.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,369
Oh, go on, Ro, make a wish.

9
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:35,334
Go, go, go, go!

10
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,091
What did you wish for?

11
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,256
I can't say,
or it won't come true.

12
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:44,008
Oh, look who likes being the kid now.

13
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,863
Okay, but don't laugh.

14
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,151
I wished I'd win the lotto.

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,240
Then I could take a cruise,

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,313
go on safari, travel to Greece,
travel the world.

17
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,994
I think your wish was perfect, Ro.
And now...

18
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:05,320
you'll be ready for anything.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,299
Oh, Terri.

20
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,301
And don't you dare say they aren't you.

21
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,679
You can't afford these.

22
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,842
Oh, the store gives me half-off.

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,757
Sorry, Ro, I do have to run.

24
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,893
You sure you don't want to come out?

25
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,393
You're sweet, I can't.

26
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:31,420
Tomorrow I have to be 
at work first thing.

27
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,831
Go!

28
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:44,779
Let me see your hands!

29
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,798
Back away from the alarms!
Go! Do it now!

30
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:51,703
You, get down on the ground!

31
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:34,920
Got something off the teletype.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,176
Robbery at Emerson bank
this morning, southeast branch.

33
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:40,000
- Big heist?
- All told, $300,000.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,850
Robbery have something to do
with a homicide?

35
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,820
Nick and I caught a case six years back.

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,319
Lady teller was killed during a holdup.

37
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,844
Same branch.

38
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:50,762
Bank getting hit twice
makes it the same crew?

39
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:54,433
Well, these guys were wearing Johnny 
Cash masks, just like six years ago.

40
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,729
Plus, this crew was armed with sawed-off 
pump-action shotguns, same as last time.

41
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:00,904
So catch who took down today's score,
and we put down your old case.

42
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:05,415
If I remember right, the victim was a real 
wallflower type, minding her own business.

43
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:08,504
Right. Wrong place, wrong time.

44
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:13,471
Sad./ Soon as they shot her, 
armed robbery became murder one.

45
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:15,324
There you are.

46
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,424
Hey, you been looking for me?

47
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:20,253
- Not me, uh, some dude on a Harley.
- Oh?

48
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,257
Yeah, Ray something-or-other.

49
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,048
Well...

50
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,772
It must be something personal.

51
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,473
I'm just saying.

52
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,069
Guy on a Harley, always sexy.

53
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,449
Sure there's nothing
you want to share, Lil?

54
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:49,129
Yeah. He shows up again,
tell him I'm dead.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/02/26

69
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:31,782
Roween Ryan, 30 years, 3 weeks.

70
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:33,561
Died from a shotgun blast to the chest.

71
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,589
Johnny Cash crew, three in all,
was never identified.

72
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,374
But one of them had a nickname, 
the Hat. / The Hat?

73
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:41,747
How one Johnny Cash was
overheard referring to another.

74
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,414
According to a fellow bank teller,
Darla Dunaway,

75
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,389
they were warned not to press 
the silent alarm. Roween did it anyway.

76
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,304
Brave lady. Sticks her neck out
in the name of what's right.

77
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:52,843
- Don't see that every day.
- Prints?

78
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,523
Uh, three lifts.
Never got a hook on them.

79
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:59,255
I'll grab Scotty. Go tell Roween's family
we're re-opening the case.

80
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,936
You and will hit the bank,
see what's what with the FBI.

81
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,284
Playing second fiddle
to the feds, fun times.

82
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:07,567
Probably rolling out
the red carpet as we speak.

83
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,870
Darla, you were a teller five years ago,
when the bank was robbed the first time?

84
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,164
I got my start at the window next to Ro's.

85
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:23,376
Worked my way up to branch manager.

86
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:26,084
Today marks my one-month anniversary.

87
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,014
Supposed to have cake.

88
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,849
- Instead, you got robbed.
- Like dejavu.

89
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,518
Three men in Johnny Cash masks,

90
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,743
half-hour before opening, 
they overpowered the security guard.

91
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,602
Is there anything you can tell us?

92
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,832
Maybe something one of them said?

93
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,566
It was just a lot of yelling.

94
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,108
Any other details make an impression?

95
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:48,814
I wasn't gonna do this.

96
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,452
Do what?
Here, have a seat.

97
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,683
See, it's flimsy, but I think
I sort of got a look at one of them.

98
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,062
I thought they were wearing masks.

99
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:03,857
Yeah, but the one who held the gun on me,
on his pinky finger, he had a skull ring.

100
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:06,257
- I recognized it.
- Okay.

101
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,778
Before the first robbery, say...

102
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,901
two weeks, a man came into the bank.

103
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:14,760
I remember, because he went
to Ro's window instead of mine.

104
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:18,561
I was sort of competitive in those days.

105
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,696
Next.

106
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,983
uh, $50 Cashier's check, please.

107
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,866
There's a two-dollar service charge.

108
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:36,821
All right, you're worth it.

109
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,358
Just joking you.

110
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,848
Enjoy romance and adventure, Roween?

111
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,513
What?

112
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:52,024
The book you're reading.

113
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:54,285
Oh, I guess.

114
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,971
I like everything.

115
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,476
What about a decent place
to have lunch around here?

116
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:01,304
Oh, the soft shoe cafe.

117
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,065
It's a little eatery up the street.

118
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,473
I go there all the time.

119
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:07,171
I may have passed by,
uh, art deco place?

120
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,655
Yeah.

121
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,116
It's been there since the '40s.

122
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:17,077
Makes you feel like you just stepped
into one of those old-time movie pictures.

123
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:19,086
Known for their pastrami sandwich.

124
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:22,121
- Sit up at the fountain or a booth?
- Fountain.

125
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:26,079
Make sure you treat yourself
to the velvet ice cream for dessert.

126
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,164
Hey, gal, can I borrow a scrunchie?

127
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,062
Um, okay.

128
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,734
Sure.

129
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:39,934
You're a doll.

130
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:43,190
Hey, you should come to Zebra tonight.
We're going dancing.

131
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,475
And, uh, bring your cutie-pie friend.

132
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,680
Sign here.

133
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,095
Pastrami, huh?

134
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:09,761
Almost hot in a bad boy sort of way.

135
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,915
You see the skull ring
he was wearing?

136
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:14,295
Uh, didn't notice.
I just thought he was nice.

137
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:15,864
What's his name?

138
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,046
Julius.

139
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,882
Julius what?

140
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,530
Sorry, Darla, you know
I can't tell you that.

141
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,481
When I saw that skull ring today,
I knew it had to be him, this Julius.

142
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,525
And you never learned his last name?

143
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:42,789
For me, it was always 
about one-upping Ro.

144
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,758
I was pretty awful back then.

145
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,431
Maybe you're making up for it now.

146
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:01,754
This is Roween's bedroom.
I left it just the way it was.

147
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:05,275
- It's nice.
- Don't let Terri hear you say that.

148
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,975
Your other daughter?

149
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:10,001
Says I need to start using
the room for something else.

150
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:14,561
It'll help me move on.
I say different strokes.

151
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,656
These your daughters here?

152
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:22,450
Always loved that picture.
Their faces smushed up against one another.

153
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:27,230
Two kinds of sisters. Sounds like yours 
were the kind that got along.

154
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,597
Roween was shy, loved to read,

155
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:32,856
whereas Terri was more the glamour girl.

156
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,755
So your daughters
always lived at home then?

157
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,348
Oh, not Terri.

158
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:39,642
The boys were crazy for her.
She couldn't wait to leave.

159
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,466
But Ro's calendar wasn't as full...

160
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,780
why the timing of her death was so tragic.

161
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,305
Because she never had a chance
to find someone special?

162
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,365
No, I think she had found someone.

163
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:53,496
I even heard her gushy
on the phone one night.

164
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:56,581
Ask me, she was in love.

165
00:09:56,581 --> 00:10:00,254
I did.
I read the autobiography.

166
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,671
June adored Johnny.

167
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,305
He never would've survived without her.

168
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,075
Mother, What are you doing?

169
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:15,121
Oh, I was, I was getting some tea.

170
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:17,900
I got to go.

171
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,340
Yes, it's on then.

172
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,412
Friday. 8:30.

173
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,555
Bye.

174
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,885
Who were you talking to?

175
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:31,595
No one, just a friend.

176
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:35,733
A friend, huh? And where is this friend
taking you on Friday night?

177
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,600
Mom, have you lost weight?

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,880
All right, you two, I'm off.

179
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,607
Thanks for dinner.
Bye.

180
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,080
Uh, hold your horses.

181
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,800
- Roween was on the phone with a man.
- Really?

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,709
Don't give me that jazz.

183
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,966
I have a sneaky idea
you know exactly who it is.

184
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:56,806
Mom, have you lost weight?

185
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,211
How is it I suffer 18 hours 
of labor with you two,

186
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:06,132
and now, when it comes time for a mother 
to reap the small joys of motherhood,

187
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,930
this mother gets cut out.

188
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,043
Sounds like your girls could keep a secret.

189
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,501
Thick as thieves.

190
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:26,682
Roween mentioned she was reading
about June and Johnny.

191
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,825
Was that June Carter
and Johnny Cash?

192
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,907
Johnny Cash was one of her favorites.

193
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:34,101
Bank robbers wore Johnny Cash masks.

194
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:37,142
Well, there's a coincidence for you.

195
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:42,781
Ro also mentioned something
about 8:30 on Friday, right? / Yes.

196
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:47,187
The time the bank was robbed,
8:30 on the dot.

197
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,889
Mrs. Ryan, did you ever get them
to tell you who that guy was?

198
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,970
Who it was Ro was supposed
to meet at 8:30?

199
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,557
It took some doing, but, yes.
His, his name was Julius.

200
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,045
You've been smoking them up
pretty good today.

201
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,305
What can I say?

202
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,105
A delightful little addiction
I picked up in narcotics.

203
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,882
Where you got shot.

204
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,628
Guess word really does get around.

205
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:22,426
Heard in Fishtown.

206
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:27,718
Me and my partner were undercover.

207
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,727
Guy stops in to make a buy.

208
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:31,566
Makes us for cops.

209
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,323
Instead of walking away...

210
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,313
He started blasting.

211
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,205
Got me in the leg.

212
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,998
My partner took him out.

213
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,382
Partner made a good shooting.

214
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,188
But I hesitated.

215
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:48,719
It wasn't long after that
shooting in New York.

216
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:53,499
Black guy reached into his coat,
pulled out a wallet instead of a gun.

217
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:56,645
So you had that on your mind. You 
didn't want to make the same mistake.

218
00:12:56,645 --> 00:13:00,522
And now I got a pack-a-day habit
trying to get my head around that.

219
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,229
I still don't believe it.

220
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:11,870
Ro was the perfect citizen,
not a crook.

221
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,313
Terri, your mom said you and Ro 
were close, kept secrets. / Yeah.

222
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:17,991
Not about bank robberies.

223
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:20,351
But she did tell you about Julius.

224
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,108
That's what blows me away.

225
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:23,532
What do you mean?

226
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,629
Because I met the guy.

227
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,459
You met Julius?

228
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,799
- When?
- A few weeks before Ro died.

229
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,216
She'd gone to lunch and ran into him.

230
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,860
He asked her for drinks that night.

231
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,058
And you went along?

232
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:36,971
Ro was nervous.

233
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,852
Besides, she really wanted 
me to meet him.

234
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:44,444
Said he was kind of Rock 'n' Roll looking, 
but regular, nice.

235
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:47,835
- And was he?
- Yeah. A perfect gentleman.

236
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,091
The soft shoe cafe. Who knew?

237
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,248
I've never been here at night.

238
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:01,514
Uh, Julius, this is Terri.

239
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:03,908
A heads up about my pal.

240
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:07,237
Bet you anything he hits on you
the second he brings the drinks.

241
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:10,113
I love him, but he ain't the best.

242
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,815
And you are?

243
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:14,337
I'm the one you got to watch out for.

244
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,920
Just joking you.

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,271
You're classier than some of the winners
I've been out with lately.

246
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:23,452
About ready to lock myself away
with one of your books, Ro.

247
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,899
"Lonesome, but never lonely" right?

248
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,979
What's that?

249
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:30,526
She teases me about curling up with a book
instead of going out Saturday nights.

250
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:31,802
Says, "aren't you lonely?"

251
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:34,488
And Ro goes, "lonesome, but never lonely."

252
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:36,815
Well, I'm like that, working on my car.

253
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:39,204
Can spend a whole weekend by myself.

254
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:43,195
Of course, that's also given me time
to dream up my high wire act.

255
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:46,458
I'm not against a little danger myself.

256
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,455
Cocktails! All right!

257
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,318
Who's parched?

258
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:55,024
The sisters, huh?
Outstanding.

259
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:59,267
Better say which is which, Julius. 
Otherwise, I'll make a run on them both.

260
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:04,627
Well, I'm Terri, and I'm leaving.

261
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,247
The Hat strikes again.

262
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,802
Okay, so, what happened?

263
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,450
He got his hooks in her,

264
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,734
she helps him rob the bank,
and then he kills her.

265
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,249
We're working on all that.

266
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,832
And the guy I met was a bank robber, too.

267
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:25,056
Julius called him "the Hat."
Sounds like he was.

268
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:28,445
He wanted me to go dancing with him.

269
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:32,675
Dancing? / Yeah. Chased me outside, said 
he was a bouncer at the layback club.

270
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,468
Um, we'd get right in.

271
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,319
Layback club.
That was a hot spot for a while.

272
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,259
Well, the place is still open.

273
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,882
Maybe "the Hat" is still bouncing.

274
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,841
I don't know anything about a nickname,

275
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,581
but the man you're talking about
sounds like Rick Carver.

276
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,792
Rick still the muscle around here?

277
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:51,884
On the door up until yesterday,
then he retired.

278
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,657
- Retired?
- His word, not mine.

279
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,100
Pretty young to retire, right?

280
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,840
Still had his bon voyage party
here last night,

281
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,607
buying drinks for the whole club.
Bar bill was sick.

282
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,191
It was so sick, why did you have 
confidence he could pay the tab?

283
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,248
Exactly.
At first, I was leery,

284
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,516
but then he flashed me the wad
of hundreds in his pocket.

285
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,857
He give you the 411
where the money came from?

286
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:16,486
He said his granny died,
and he got a big inheritance...

287
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:18,870
- What? That's not what happened?
- No.

288
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,350
Stop it. What did he do,
stick up a gas station?

289
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,837
- Bank.
- Come on.

290
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,003
Come on!

291
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:31,438
So that's why Julius
was so pissed last night.

292
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,394
- Who's Julius?
- Rick's brother.

293
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,820
Stopped in at the end of the night
and was chewing him out.

294
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,352
I was so drunk,

295
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:42,871
couldn't get all the super loungers
to find out what was going on.

296
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,452
Probably for burning through
that roll of hundreds, don't you think?

297
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,873
Making sense.

298
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:50,662
I'm gonna need to take the money, Ivan,

299
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,899
run those serial numbers against the bank.

300
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,663
How many you need, one?

301
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:57,432
All of them.

302
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,324
Crap.

303
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:05,936
Up, up, up!
On your feet.

304
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:08,372
Whoa, whoa. Man, this is 
unconstitutional.

305
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,967
- Rick Carver.
- What is this?

306
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,273
- Detective Rush and Valens.
- You did a robbery, Rick.

307
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:16,335
- No, I didn't.
- And your brother Julius, too.

308
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,757
It's just a case of mistaken identity.

309
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,836
Yeah? We'll see about that.

310
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,931
Hey, man, don't be grabbing that, yo.
I just got that phone.

311
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:25,955
Gonna take your prints and run them 
against that first bank job you pulled.

312
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,495
- You're going down.
- It's a shame, too.

313
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:31,034
Looks like you were 
kicking butt in text twister.

314
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,147
- I want a lawyer.
- It won't do you much good,

315
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:36,024
not after buying drinks last night
with that bank loot, Rick.

316
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,907
We don't care about the robberies.
FBI will bust you for that.

317
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:42,660
We're here because you murdered
the teller, Roween Ryan.

318
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:46,262
I didn't shoot that girl.

319
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:48,104
Then who did, your brother?

320
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:49,770
After he tricked her into helping you?

321
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,882
Boy, he sounds lower than you, Rick.

322
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:55,873
Hey, Julius never tricked anybody.

323
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,356
He was square with her, okay?

324
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:01,951
Way before we ever hit that bank.

325
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:24,287
We've been having fun together, right?

326
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,137
Yeah, these two weeks have been a ball.

327
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,540
So, you want to go to Tahiti with me?

328
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,244
Don't.

329
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,385
Julius, are you serious?

330
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,249
But I haven't even stayed over yet.

331
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,374
And I'd like for us to 
wait on that till we get there,

332
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:44,529
after a walk on the beach at sunset.

333
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,857
You sure...You sure know how to
sweep a girl off her feet.

334
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:51,439
I need to tell you the rest.

335
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,644
What? The suspense is killing me.

336
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:59,368
I want to rob your bank on Friday,
and I want you to help me do it.

337
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,660
Is this one of your jokes?

338
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:10,626
I don't get it. / And the boys,
they're in it with me.

339
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,679
You're not fooling around, are you?

340
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,371
You know that high wire act
I've been talking about? This is it.

341
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,360
Julius, you can't rob a bank.

342
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,567
Ah, nobody'll get hurt,

343
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:25,047
and you know yourself,
all that money's insured.

344
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,347
Ro, hear me out, please?

345
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:36,923
I used to visit this elderly lady,

346
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:42,063
Mary on her last legs, 
she liked to say.

347
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:46,329
One day, I asked
if she had any regrets.

348
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:49,752
She, said, "Yes, a big one."

349
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,563
Said she played it too safe.

350
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:55,471
Said, "as long as you 
don't hurt no one,"

351
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,208
"go have the time of your life,"

352
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,853
"because before you know it,
you're 87."

353
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,045
Undefeated and still champion.

354
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:15,476
That other friend of yours...

355
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:18,578
The way he stares, 
it's like he has it out for me.

356
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:21,186
Oh, Phil, don't worry about him.

357
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,687
We're not getting any younger, Ro.

358
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,271
So how would it work?

359
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,819
Who's Phil?

360
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,744
Phil Jorgensen.

361
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,344
I wasn't real big on him.
He was an old-time pal of Julius's.

362
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,979
Saying Phil shot Roween?

363
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:56,009
My brother fell on his face
for that girl, okay?

364
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:59,012
He wasn't gonna hurt her.

365
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,076
And that's my bro's lady, bro,
so you do the math.

366
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,781
Where are they?

367
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:06,221
I don't know.

368
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,666
Damn, bro.
You were doing so good, too.

369
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,581
Guess it doesn't matter much.
Jackie, Jake...

370
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:16,795
Julius.

371
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,881
FBI called, said we get Rick's
phone back in the morning.

372
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:29,480
So tomorrow, we use it to call
Julius first thing.

373
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,642
That's the feds.

374
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:33,893
Just gives Julius more of a head start,
while we sit around 12 hours.

375
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,700
Hey, let them have it, Scotty.

376
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,469
It is a bank robbery,
it's their baby.

377
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,659
Yep.

378
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,000
Good night.

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,807
Good night, boss.

380
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:45,028
See you tomorrow then?

381
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,769
Sure thing.

382
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:50,497
Yo. Heads up.

383
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,073
Crap.

384
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:00,036
You want me to take care of it?

385
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,251
I'm good.

386
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:11,028
I got to deal with him 
sooner or later.

387
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

388
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:54,804
Boss?

389
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,149
Rick's prints match up?

390
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:58,833
Good for both bank jobs.

391
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,304
What do you got on the brother?

392
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,812
A Julius Carver,
the younger of the two.

393
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:04,817
Did a stint for burglary.

394
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,274
Okay. Let's make the call.

395
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:08,877
We're on it.

396
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:23,000
Where the hell you been?

397
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,266
- Julius.
- Who's this?

398
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,894
John Stillman, lieutenant,
Philly homicide unit.

399
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,562
We've got Rick.

400
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,562
You still there?

401
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:37,509
- We need to talk, Julius.
- About?

402
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,846
About the murder of Roween Ryan.

403
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,177
- Rick says he didn't shoot her.
- He didn't.

404
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,876
So...
come in and tell us that.

405
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:47,039
You're asking me 
to turn myself in.

406
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,685
You want to see Rick
get lethal injection, Julius?

407
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:52,665
Keep dreaming.
I'm not doing it.

408
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:56,699
Unless...it was 
you who shot Roween.

409
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,094
Is that what happened, Julius?

410
00:23:58,094 --> 00:24:01,199
Buddy, we were face-to-face,
I'd take a swing at you.

411
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:04,387
- Say again?
- You don't talk to me about Roween.

412
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:08,051
And don't tell me
about sleepless nights.

413
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:10,496
You saying you were
in love with Roween, Julius?

414
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,973
So much that I decided I could run
from my old life and start new.

415
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,120
Want to come inside?
You look cold.

416
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,793
Oh, no, it's just these boots.
I'm trying to break them in.

417
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:33,101
Those the ones your sister gave you?

418
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,405
Yeah, they just don't feel right.

419
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,400
So maybe you should take them off.

420
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,881
No, I want to get them ready, so...

421
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,253
I can wear them on Friday.

422
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:54,007
Look, I'm starting to worry
that I won't show up.

423
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,975
Ro...

424
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:58,096
I've been thinking about Friday.

425
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,727
Oh?

426
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,646
Let's call it off.

427
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:02,857
What?

428
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:05,178
It doesn't feel right.

429
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,317
Julius, are you serious?

430
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:11,200
Well, what about Tahiti?

431
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:12,902
I know how you want to go.

432
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,566
No, I got something way better.

433
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:20,237
We'll have our own little personal 
adventure right here in Philly.

434
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:25,114
Oh, I'm so relieved.

435
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:30,175
This has just all been so perfect 
from the moment you walked in the bank.

436
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:32,121
It's like...

437
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,686
being down at the shore and
getting swept up by the tide.

438
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,762
It's the same for me.

439
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:41,679
But now we can catch a breath.

440
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:46,540
But what about the others?

441
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,124
No, don't worry about them,
I'll tell them we're not doing it.

442
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:54,948
But I do have one request.

443
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,831
What?

444
00:25:57,394 --> 00:26:00,368
I don't want to wait anymore.

445
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:17,515
I tried to call it off,
but Phil nixed it.

446
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,476
So this Phil's a scary guy, huh?

447
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:22,235
He's not someone you say no to.

448
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:25,403
Maybe it's time to break free of him.

449
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:28,859
Yeah. Maybe so.

450
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,227
I'll tell you where he is.

451
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,802
- Hums like you would not believe.
- Really?

452
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,662
You ought to take her out sometime.

453
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:45,665
Not sure that's the wisest thing.

454
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,612
What's not the wisest?

455
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,264
Hi, Lil.

456
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:52,435
I was just telling Scotty here
he needs a bike.

457
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:57,057
Let's talk in private.

458
00:27:09,382 --> 00:27:11,136
What were you saying out there?

459
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,958
Nothing.

460
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,395
- Tell him about last night?
- No.

461
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:21,453
- Did he ask?
- Yeah, he did.

462
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,759
Come here.

463
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:28,756
No.

464
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,413
Give me a kiss.

465
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,908
- Forget it.
- Hey...

466
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:39,944
- Look, I'm the one who should be mad.
- You? / Yeah.

467
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,782
Took a page from my playbook.
I woke up this morning, you were gone.

468
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,695
Well, you know, I have a job.

469
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:49,530
Thought you'd be on the road by now.

470
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,052
Nope.

471
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:55,370
You don't have to...
clock in? / Not today.

472
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,213
- Still fixing those custom bikes?
- Better.

473
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,128
Now I'm the boss.

474
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:06,599
- That's why I wanted to see you.
- Oh?

475
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:10,704
So what do you think about that?

476
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,600
- Uh, boss is looking for you.
- I need another minute.

477
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,512
- What should I tell him?
- That I need a minute.

478
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,601
- I gotta go, huh?
- In a sec.

479
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,543
Why don't you just ditch work?

480
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:51,005
Let's just go for a ride.

481
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,812
So, that's it, huh?

482
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:04,834
Sorry, I can't.
Boss is calling.

483
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:08,502
You did everything you said
you were gonna do, Lil.

484
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,515
Made murder cop.

485
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,405
I'm proud of you.

486
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:21,047
But I guess things change, right?

487
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,985
I'm in town for one more night.

488
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:32,600
Bye, Ray.

489
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,222
Philly PD!
Show me your hands!

490
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:55,342
What?

491
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:57,763
- Phil Jorgensen?
- Yeah.

492
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,406
You're under arrest
for the murder of Roween Ryan.

493
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,100
And a couple of bank robberies, Phil.

494
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,476
I didn't kill Roween.

495
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:04,656
Yes, you did, you hated her.

496
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:05,776
Why would I hate her?

497
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:08,333
Because she was Yoko Ono
trying to break up the band.

498
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,901
She was throwing Julius off his game.

499
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:14,181
Okay. That part is true.
I did think that.

500
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,296
So when Julius 
came begging off the job,

501
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:19,055
- you shut him down.
- What?

502
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:23,216
No. Julius didn't want to stop the robbery.
He was telling stories.

503
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:25,417
- Stories to whom?
- Roween.

504
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:29,431
He knew she was gonna go south on him,
so he beat her to the punch.

505
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:30,880
So it was all just a con?

506
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,479
Sure, that's what he does.

507
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,229
The thing was going forward as planned.

508
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,570
We already got everything
from her we needed.

509
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,802
Still, you're not concerned?

510
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:41,932
Now Ro's not expecting it.
She could be a problem.

511
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:46,708
Julius said she'd be too scared
to be a problem, and if so, shoot her.

512
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:50,895
- Cut and dried.
- hat's why I had to warn her.

513
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:54,985
He's lying to you, Ro.
About the robbery, about the two of you.

514
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:57,092
You weren't saying this
the other night at the apartment.

515
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:58,762
Just glaring at me.

516
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:00,417
You haven't even said boo till now.

517
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,563
There's lots of reasons
why people don't talk.

518
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,703
Don't mean they don't want to.

519
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:12,719
It's a setup, Ro.
Besides, he's got someone else.

520
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:18,704
Someone else? / Be honest.
You really think you're his style?

521
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:21,279
And I don't mean that in a bad way,
I mean it in a good way.

522
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,272
Oh, you think it's just impossible
that I could turn someone's head, huh?

523
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:25,831
No!

524
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:29,333
No, you're something, Ro.

525
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:31,713
Yeah, right.

526
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:34,920
Maybe it's you that's
handing out the lines.

527
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,012
That wasn't a line.

528
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:43,163
Ro, Julius has a way on people, all right?

529
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:46,913
He spots your weakness,
mine was booze.

530
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:49,140
You telling me he's got
you under his thumb?

531
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,227
I haven't made a decision
for myself till now.

532
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:56,015
I'm not putting moves on you, Ro.

533
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,099
But after tomorrow,
I'm gonna be my own man.

534
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,929
I know I'm good for someone.

535
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,486
Tomorrow...

536
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,710
- The bank.
- There's nothing we can do about that.

537
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,130
You have to go along
or he's gonna hurt you. I swear.

538
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,576
- Who is she?
- Who?

539
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:22,089
You said he has someone else.

540
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,540
You don't need to know that.

541
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,462
Phil, if you're really being sincere,
you'll tell me.

542
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:33,858
- And did you tell her?
- Yeah.

543
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,227
Spill.

544
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:38,483
Darla Dunaway.

545
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,564
Bank teller worked alongside Ro.

546
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:42,883
And current branch manager.

547
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:46,897
So "worked-her-way-up" Darla
was Julius's real squeeze, huh?

548
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:51,060
And our other inside connection
on the bank job.

549
00:32:56,338 --> 00:33:01,894
Darla, you were the one making 
it with Julius, not Roween.

550
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:05,187
And it was my idea to get Ro involved.

551
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:06,657
Because she was the head teller.

552
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:10,608
So the tale you told about Julius 
stopping in for a Cashier's check

553
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:13,615
was really you two reeling Ro in.

554
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:19,030
That day was like a game.
Great fun.

555
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,506
So they rob the bank,
shoot Ro and split.

556
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,705
But you stay so you can do it
all over again three days ago.

557
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:27,848
No. I wasn't a part of it this time.

558
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:29,228
And why should we believe that?

559
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:32,311
- Because Julius dumped me, too.
- When?

560
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,559
After the first heist.

561
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,817
I told him I wasn't some Roween.

562
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:39,403
He told me that's exactly what I was.

563
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:43,026
And Julius knows you won't rat him out 
now because you're an accomplice.

564
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:47,517
But I couldn't swallow it any longer,
not after what he did to us.

565
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:49,149
Us?

566
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:50,996
This was for Roween, too?

567
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:54,027
Under the impression you hated Ro.

568
00:33:55,025 --> 00:34:00,213
Probably what she thought, too,
that last morning before she died.

569
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:10,153
- What's your problem?
- I know.

570
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:12,704
- Know what?
- About you.

571
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:17,019
How you're part of the robbery.
How you're with Julius.

572
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:20,339
Ro, think of it this way.

573
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:24,112
It's me and Julius's car.
You and Phil are in the backseat.

574
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:27,937
Be grateful you're not
getting kicked to the curb.

575
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:33,130
I guess it is true then.

576
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,783
- Don't let that mirror fool you.
- Excuse me?

577
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:44,631
Julius sees us the same way.
He's playing you, too.

578
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:48,137
If you could just see that,
together we could stop this.

579
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,533
Stop the robbery?

580
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,420
On your own there, Ro.

581
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,227
Don't sell me short.

582
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,522
What are you gonna do, call the cops?

583
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:01,005
It's risky, but there's still time.

584
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:03,025
Do it.

585
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:08,431
I knew it.
Face it, Ro.

586
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:11,831
You're a toad, I'm not.
It's not my fault.

587
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,475
You try so hard to be a bitch,

588
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:17,181
and one day you'll see 
you don't need to.

589
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,979
Even now,

590
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:25,602
you still believe the knight on 
the white horse is coming to take you away.

591
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:31,469
8:20. Better get your little heinie 
out there. It's almost time.

592
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:35,148
Turns out Ro was right.
Julius screwed me.

593
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:39,335
We've got Rick and Phil in custody.
Now we need Julius.

594
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,745
Been tracking him.
We think he's in upper Darby somewhere.

595
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:46,179
- Any ideas?
- Luke's lodge.

596
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:51,878
His favorite B and B, and where 
he turned me into a bank robber.

597
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,225
Good.

598
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:59,469
Now tell us Julius shot Ro,
and he'll take the worst of it.

599
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:05,419
All I know is Julius went to the vault
and Rick was covering the door.

600
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:10,469
Leaving Phil at the teller window...

601
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,740
where Ro was shot.

602
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,696
Well, things just went from bad
to worse for you, Phil.

603
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,228
What do you mean?

604
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:22,445
You're all going down for the robbery but

605
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,775
you're taking the heat for Ro's murder.

606
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:26,721
I told you, Julius was the one.

607
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:28,525
But the brothers joined forces against you,

608
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:33,391
and Darla supports their theory,
so three against one, you know.

609
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,909
Funny.

610
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:38,952
I had no reason to go this time.

611
00:36:38,952 --> 00:36:40,982
Before, I was desperate.

612
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,382
My boozing put me in the red.

613
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:46,534
This time around,
my house was in order.

614
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:48,681
Still, Julius talked you into it.

615
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,778
He found out Darla's branch manager now.

616
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:54,927
Job would be a piece of cake,
we'd score big this time.

617
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:57,067
Hyped it pretty good, huh?

618
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,949
He could've been the world's 
greatest car salesman.

619
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,655
But it didn't matter.

620
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:07,290
I just thought, why not?
I'm empty, anyway.

621
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,332
Empty? Why?

622
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,779
Because the one you loved
didn't love you back?

623
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,489
No.

624
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,494
In the end, I think she would've.

625
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:29,085
Thing is, when someone opens a door,
you got to be ready to go through.

626
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:32,475
So Ro was holding the door for you?

627
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:35,287
She offered me a way out.

628
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,980
Should've taken it.

629
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:43,400
But...

630
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,027
shoulda, woulda, coulda, right?

631
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:51,425
Go! Open that door!
Open that door!

632
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:53,452
Go, go, go, go!
Get down!

633
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:55,494
Everybody, down!
On the floor!

634
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:57,480
Everybody down!

635
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,557
Stay down!

636
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,686
Get down! Stay down!

637
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:09,801
You! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Open it!

638
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,571
Let me see your hands!
Back away from the alarms!

639
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:14,973
Do it! Do it now!

640
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:17,272
Come on, come on, come on!

641
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,955
You, get down on the ground!

642
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,649
Let's go.

643
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,665
- Give me her!
- You, go!

644
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,975
Go on, do your part.

645
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,617
Come on!

646
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:50,650
Come on, baby... Baby, I couldn't tell 
you we were going forward. You okay?

647
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,677
- Even calling me "baby" now, huh?
- What?

648
00:38:54,677 --> 00:39:01,531
You're a liar, Julius. I know about Darla.
I know about everything.

649
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,311
No kidding.

650
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:10,273
So if you knew,
why not tip off the police?

651
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,611
I guess one percent of me was still hoping
that night on the fire escape was for real.

652
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:19,043
Just joking you.

653
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:26,603
The Hat is losing it on the guard.
Let's go. Hurry up!

654
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,640
Move it, come on.

655
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:38,969
Right here.
All right, open it.

656
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:41,551
I'm gonna push the alarm.
What are you talking about?

657
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:44,683
It's time for us to stand up, Phil.

658
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:49,992
Stay with me.
We'll do it together.

659
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:53,114
- He'll hurt you.
- It's worth the risk.

660
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:57,082
You can be your own man 
right now, Phil.

661
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:04,858
Bitch!

662
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,685
She pushed the alarm.

663
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:08,752
- What?
- She screwed us.

664
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:10,671
We got to walk.

665
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,986
What are you waiting on?
Do her.

666
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,220
- No.
- No?

667
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,890
What, are you trying to be someone now?

668
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,112
You're worthless, a zero,
a frigging lap dog.

669
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:40,196
Now!
Do it.

670
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:44,366
I said do it!

671
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:49,123
Don't try to decide.
You can't make decisions,

672
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:52,851
not on your own, not without booze.

673
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,479
Good boy.

674
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:02,456
That's it.

675
00:41:04,122 --> 00:41:06,787
Steady...

676
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:34,772
 ¢Ü Lee Ann Womack's "I hope you dance" ¢Ü

677
00:41:53,716 --> 00:41:58,717
 ¢Ü I hope you never lose
your sense of wonder ¢Ü

678
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:05,056
 ¢Ü you get your fill to eat 
but always keep that hunger ¢Ü

679
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:11,899
 ¢Ü may you never take one
single breath for granted ¢Ü

680
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:17,998
 ¢Ü god forbid love ever 
leave you empty-handed ¢Ü

681
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:24,830
 ¢Ü I hope you still feel small
