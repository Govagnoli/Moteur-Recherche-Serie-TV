1
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,200
First round's
on me, ladies.

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm all right, Roy.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Think I'll get
some real food.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,700
Nah, you're coming
down to Shiny's.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,800
Come on, Mike.
You don't like vodka breakfast?

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Got to work
on my boat, fellas.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,100
Thing's a frigging
masterpiece by now.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,600
Well, I'm taking it
to Florida this year.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,400
Yeah. I'll bet you a round
he doesn't do it.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,100
Double or nothing,
next five years,

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,300
he still
doesn't do it.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Funny.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,700
Yeah.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,400
Um, you guys
just, um...

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,100
I'll see you.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Hello?!

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Hello?!

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,700
Are you okay?

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
What's, um...

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Hey, what's wrong with her?

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh, God.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
She's burning up.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,900
Hey. Hey.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,400
I am taking you out of here.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,200
No.

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,200
Yes.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
You're sick.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm taking you.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Here we go.

30
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
 <i>Feds have been building a case</i>

31
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,100
for years against
an Eastern European criminal.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Big-time guy,
goes by Nachalneek.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,300
Nachalneek?

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Russian for "boss."

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
He's the puppet master
of a brutal organization.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,900
They have him?

37
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,000
He's a phantom.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,100
Never been ID'd.

39
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
What do his puppets do?

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Human traffic at the docks.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
Port of Philadelphia's been ID'd

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,600
as a hub for importing
young girls.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,700
Forced prostitution.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,700
Perfect access

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,300
for New York, Jersey, DC.

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,600
Had a female floater
in the Delaware yesterday.

47
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,900
Jane Doe so far.

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Think she was
trafficked?

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Dental work's
Eastern European.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,900
Poor quality, metal fillings.

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,500
How she connect to Nachalneek?

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
Right age, ethnicity.

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Other signs of his MO.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Like?

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,100
Cigarette burns.

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,900
Soles of her feet.

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
South detectives are working
the Jane Doe floater.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Where do we come in?

59
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Got any cold jobs like her?

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,500
Solve that, might help the feds'
case against Nachalneek.

61
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,300
Don't recall
any Jane Does like this.

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,800
But we had a guy.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Polish name.

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,000
Cigarette burns on his feet.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
'05 job.

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,500
You know him, boss?

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,400
Case caught my eye.

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,000
He was a longshoreman
at the port.

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,800
Working the docks,
he could've

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
crossed paths with Nachalneek.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,100
Might be the key
to solving this guy's murder.

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,900
And catching a ghost.

73
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,500

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,700
Mike Chulaski, 35

76
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,900
 Longshoreman at
Harrison Marine Terminal.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,900
  No family.

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
 Six days before
anyone reported him missing.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
 Guy was invisible.
Barely left a footprint.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,500
 Workers on the docks
said he never missed a day.

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,000
   And this...

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
was his pride and joy.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
  Nice boat.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
 Wouldn't mind one
like it myself.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
  Mike lived on it.

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,900
 Went missing
after he was killed.

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,600
 I'll start looking for it.

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,700
 Motel he was found in
was on the other side of town.

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
 They were working a theory
Mike was killed  by a pimp.

90
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,400
Bludgeoned
with a lamp.

91
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,300
 Lots of prints, no matches.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,100
 Motel clerk said another guy
rented the room.

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Can't describe him.

94
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
 No-tell motel for you.

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,600
 Copies of the bills of lading
for the boxes that came

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,300
  into the terminal.
Boxes?

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,000
  Containers.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,300
The FBI says the ones
with the human cargo arrived

99
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,800
 when Mike's dock gang
was working.

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,500
 Maybe Mike was in on it?

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
  We can't tell.

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,600
But in shipping, nothing happens

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,900
 without the foreman
knowing about it.

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,300
 Says here that
was Roy Gardecki.

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
 Mike's boss.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,500
  I'll go talk to him.

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
 Know a lot about the port.

108
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,900
 I worked on the docks
when I was 16.

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,900
Boxes from
your terminal

110
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 were used to transport
young girls, Roy.

111
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Fellas, I already
talked to the FBI.

112
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,100
Not about
Mike Chulaski's murder.

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,300
  Could be just what they need
to push their case through.

114
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,500
  And you get 20 years inside.

115
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,100
The feds don't know
what it's like down here.

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
  Of course
they don't.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
They don't know about
the lowlifes coming around,

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
preying on the working man
trying to earn a decent wage.

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,600
  And you do?

120
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,800
 Worked here when I was a kid.

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,500
Things I saw.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,700
 Then you know
it's backbreaking.

123
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,300
 It's hard work.

124
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,400
 Lot of temptation
for the easy money.

125
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
 Regular guy like
Mike Chulaski gets tempted.

126
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,500
  Ends up dead, right, Roy?

127
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
 So you and Mike
line your pockets,

128
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,900
 look the other w when
those containers came in.

129
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,300
Money was good.

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
Mike never knew about it.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
Why not cut him in?

132
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Wasn't that kind of guy.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
He had no idea.

134
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Till that morning.

135
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,600
No, it's okay.

136
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
What are we gonna do, Roy?

137
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,300
She's so young.

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Where are her parents?

139
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Alright, easy there.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,900
Fifteen.

141
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Not so young.

142
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm calling the cops.

143
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,800
Mike, think about what you
could be getting into here.

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Phone.

145
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
Kiril... for job.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
For me.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
No, no, no, no, no.

148
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
You don't want
a job with that guy.

149
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
Mike. Mike!

150
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,400
Come here.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Look.

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
You can put her back.

153
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,900
Right now.

154
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,300
????

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Let me... go.

156
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,900
You got anybody

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,900
in America that we can
call right now?

159
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Family?

160
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,900
No.

161
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
No family, anywhere?

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
From orphanage.

163
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Ukraine.

164
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't have family either.

165
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
Orphan.

166
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Me.

167
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,400
Mike!
What if that was you
lying on that couch, huh?

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,300
Sick kid?

169
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
These people are running
a business!

170
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,800
She doesn't have
anyone in the world!

171
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
You know what that feels like?

172
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,800
No one to look out
for you.

173
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,300
I do.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
You're gonna keep her?

175
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
It's crazy.

176
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,800
I'm not putting her

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,900
in that van, Roy.

178
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
And if you tell me
to do it one more time...

179
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Well, maybe you and me...

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,400
we'll go to the cops together.

181
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,700
Who was this Kiril
she wanted to reach?

182
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
American.
Transported the girls.

183
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,800
Middleman.

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,300
Got a number
for him?

185
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,600
Look, I told you what I know.

186
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Meet you back
at the car, Nick.

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
I know the
waterfront, Roy.

188
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Mike stood up
against the lowlifes.

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
It got him crushed.

190
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,100
You looked
the other way.

191
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Now's your chance
to make it right.

192
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm not asking.

193
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Give me a number for Kiril.

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Never had one.

195
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,000
Runner dropped a message,
which box to set aside,

196
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,200
he'd show up to unload.

197
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,600
That's it.

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,900
Any idea who he was working for?

199
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
Called him Nachalneek.

200
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Kiril was terrified of the guy.

201
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,100
What'd Mike do with Lena?

202
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Took her to his boat.

203
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,500
Said he was gonna help her.

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,700
He say how?

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
Try and get her a visa,
take her to some

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
community center for advice

207
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,300
where people would know
about that stuff.

208
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
We don't deal with illegals.

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Must get a few in here.

210
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,900
I mainly deal with exchange
students who want to stay.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Occasionally,
these girls show up.

212
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,400
Girls like Lena?

213
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,200
They lie about
how they got here,

215
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
but we all know.

216
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,000
Out of the containers.

217
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,300
Any of the
girls mention

218
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,200
the name Nachalneek?

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,900
No.

220
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,800
They never give any details.

221
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
I do what I can
for them,

222
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,500
but they're not supposed
to be here.

223
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,300
You try helping Lena?

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Can't help someone

225
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,700
who doesn't want it.

226
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,300
I have no
money, Mike.

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,900
This lady helps
you for free.

228
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,700
In America
people do stuff

229
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
'cause they're
kind, you know?

230
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Not 'cause they want
something from you.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
You okay?

232
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
She doesn't qualify

233
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
for the T1 visa.

234
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,200
Why not?

235
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
She wasn't prostituted, was she?

236
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,100
No, course not.
Then technically,

237
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,000
she's here illegally.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,500
That's how the embassy
will see it,

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,600
and they will
deport her.

240
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
That doesn't
make sense.

241
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,400
Back to Ukraine?

242
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,700
No!
Lena.

243
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't go.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,900
You don't understa
what could happen to you.

245
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Can't go back.

246
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
No money. No family.

247
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,800
Nothing there.

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600
You got someone

249
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
who cares about you now.

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,200
You don't have to go it alone
anymore.

251
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,700
I'm hungry.

252
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,700
Can I have candy bar?

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,300
Why don't you eat a real meal?

254
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,800
Get your
strength up.

255
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
Better than nothing, I guess.

256
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I got some change.

257
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,300
Machine's that way.

258
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
Growing up
on your own...

259
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
it's hard.

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,500
People treat you

261
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,800
like a punching bag.

262
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
I don't want that
to happen to her.

263
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
Knocks the life out of you.

264
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,000
There's not much you can do
for her, I'm afraid.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
I can look out for her,

266
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,400
you know?

267
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,200
Like family.

268
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,200
Young girl.

269
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Can be difficult.

270
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,900
Lena?

271
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,500
Lena!

272
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,700
Lena?

273
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,000
Lena!

274
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
She makes a phone call
and she's gone.

275
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
I wish
I could've helped more,

276
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,100
but there's a new one
every day.

277
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,900
Think of anything else,

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you can reach us here.

279
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
There's only one person
Lena wanted to call.

280
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,300
Kiril.

281
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,800
So she goes
to meet him?
And Mike knows it.

282
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Tracks them down.
Gets himself killed,

283
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,600
playing hero.

284
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,200
What do you got?

285
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,400
I... need some lost hours.

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,300
 <i>I didn't know who else to call</i>
 <i>since the husband took off.</i>

287
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
I last saw her
a week ago.

288
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,900
She won't answer
the door.

289
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,800
Okay.

290
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,000
She's always saying

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,800
how her daughter's
got a good job.

292
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,900
Smart girl.

293
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Is she?

294
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
So, I thought maybe you cod
take care of the rent.

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,900
Due three
weeks ago.

296
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Yeah, sure.

297
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
You said it's been a week?

298
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Yeah.

299
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,100
Mom?

300
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,800
She all right?

301
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Mom?

302
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,300
No.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,100
Call 911.

304
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,000
You said you'd clean up
this time.

305
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,000
Nice job.

306
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Ending up in the ER.

307
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,800
I gotta go home.

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,200
You're not going anywhere.

309
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm going home,
Lilly... Oh.

310
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,200
Doctor said
you can't drink again.

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
Help me out here,
will ya?

312
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Where's my coat?

313
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,400
You have late-stage
cirrhosis.

314
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,200
You're getting admitted.

315
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
You can't...
have another drink again.

316
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Not one.

317
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm fine, Lilly.

318
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Yeah,

319
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,500
you look great, Mom.

320
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,300
What do you want from me?

321
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,800
You'll have to come stay
with me.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I thought you were
"getting too old for this."

323
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,800
I said that
when I still had a choice.

324
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,100
Kiril's in custody.

325
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Tracked him
to a pay-as-you-go cell.

326
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,500
Kiril faces federal
trafficking charges.

327
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,800
Any deal's possible
if he points to Nachalneek.

328
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,300
Even if he killed
Mike Chulaski?

329
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,400
Any deal. US Attorney's
gunning for Nachalneek.

330
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
It's all about
the big fish, huh?

331
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,700
Never mind a poor working guy
getting offed.

332
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
Nachalneek's the prize.

333
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,300
Prize...

334
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,900
is locking up Mike's doer
for life.

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,200
Not for the feds.

336
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Yeah, we'll help them
get their phantom.
Good.

337
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Ain't gonna
cut a deal

338
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,700
with a murderer,
though.
Don't go cowboy on us,

339
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,300
okay?

340
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,600
What the hell
does that mean?

341
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,700
The Burrell job, Scotty.

342
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,200
Vigilante dad?

343
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,800
You screwed up.

344
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,700
Don't screw this up.

345
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,500
I put dirtbags away.

346
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,700
You do the paperwork.

347
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Can't handle a strong woman,

348
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,400
can you?

349
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,100
No, maybe I just don't like you.

350
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
Broken wing's more your type.

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,900
You don't know me.

352
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Yeah.

353
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,700
I do.

354
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,400
Can't stand it, huh?

355
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,700
Stand what?

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
That I can handle you.

357
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,700
So, how'd it
go, Kiril?

358
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Mike steals away
one of your girls,

359
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
so you have him killed?

360
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,200
My girls?

361
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,300
I'd love to help you gents,
but you got the wrong guy.

362
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,500
Cut the BS.

363
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,200
A witness saw you loading
those girls into a van.

364
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, look, I was
just a driver.

365
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,100
Picked up the girls, TVs,
whatever needed delivering.

366
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
You work for Nachalneek?

367
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,700
Nah, just, just heard the name.

368
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
But friendly advice?

369
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
You might as well stop looking.

370
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,100
Why's that?

371
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,200
You talk about Nachalneek,
you disappear.

372
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,800
So where'd you
take the girls

373
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
and the TVs?

374
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,400
That's where my memory fails me.

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,300
Sorry, gents.

376
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Lay of the land, Kiril.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,800
You're looking at 20
in federal prison.

378
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,300
For what?

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Trafficking.

380
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,500
Witness, remember?

381
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,500
Unless you prefer

382
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
a murder charge

383
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
for Mike Chulaski.

384
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,700
I never killed nobody.

385
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,000
Help us with
Mike's murder,

386
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
do a reduced sentence.

387
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
So where'd you take Lena?

388
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,500
Some..

389
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
crap building.

390
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,900
12 Pearl Street.

391
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,800
What went on there?

392
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,100
Dump full of underage tail?

393
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
What do you think?

394
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
And Mike?

395
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh, Mike was a dumbass
of epic proportion.

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,100
He find you on the docks

397
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,000
after Lena disappeared on him?
Yeah.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Wanted something
wasn't his property.

399
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Excuse me.

400
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,800
What?

401
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
Excuse me. Can you, uh...

402
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
I gotta talk to you.

403
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,100
Can you...?

404
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,300
What?

405
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,100
Where's Lena?

406
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Curly hair.

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,100
Yea high.

408
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
She's one of your girls.

409
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,300
Oh.

410
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,700
Agh...
You're a rube.

411
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,200
You're way out of your depth.

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,700
Better walk away.

413
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,600
I want her.

414
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,800
What's that?

415
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,900
I want her!

416
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,100
You think you can get
your rocks off for free?

417
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Hey, wake up. It's America.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Nothing's for free.

419
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,300
She's a kid.

420
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
It's not like that.

421
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,300
You're begging for this girl,
and you say it ain't for sex?

422
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,500
So what, you wanna
watch TV together?

423
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,900
Admit it.

424
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,100
All right!

425
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,700
All right what?

426
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,400
I want to...

427
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,800
bang her.

428
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
You were right.

429
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,200
Just...

430
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
tell me where I can do that.

431
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,400
12 Pearl Street.

432
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,300
Knock yourself out.

433
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,100
Guy was just a horny perv

434
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,400
like all the rest.

435
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
That's all I know.

436
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,200
So...

437
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm done, right?

438
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,400
Sit your ass down.

439
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,500
Your next stop's
the federal pen.

440
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,800
12 Pearl Street's
abandoned.

441
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,300
Previous tenants
all fake names.

442
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,200
Dead end.

443
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
So, Kiril played us?
Not quite.

444
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Found a 911 call
for an overdose

445
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,900
to that address
two years back.

446
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,000
Gave the girl's real name.

447
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Kateryna Yevchenko.

448
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,500
Accurint's got
an address for her

449
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
in Long Island.

450
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Town called Bellport.
If Kateryna worked

451
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,300
at Pearl Street,
maybe she knew Lena.

452
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
And saw Mike
when he came looking for her.

453
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,300
Didn't think
you were coming in.

454
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Me neither.

455
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
We've got everything covered
if you gotta be somewhere else.

456
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
I'd rather be here
than where I was.

457
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,500
Fair enough.

458
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,900
You have an appointment?

459
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,500
Kateryna Yevchenko?

460
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Detectives Valens
and Miller

461
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
from Philadelphia.

462
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
We're looking
into a homicide.

463
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Mike Chulaski.

464
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,600
Ring a bell?

465
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
He came to Pearl Street

466
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
looking for a girl named Lena.

467
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,700
Long time ago.

468
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,300
I don't remember.

469
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,000
That why you OD'd?

470
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,500
What went on
in that place, Kateryna?

471
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Bad as you imagine.

472
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,800
Worse.

473
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,200
We were slaves.

474
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,600
How'd you get out?

475
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,700
After I am too old
for Pearl Street,

476
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,800
I go on my own.

477
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,200
I am good, so
I get nest egg.

478
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
What about this guy Mike?

479
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,900
I take money from Mike
to bring him to Lena.

480
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
She wasn't with the others?

481
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,900
In different room
because she resisted.

482
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Another $50.

483
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,700
Mike.

484
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,400
Lena. Oh, God.

485
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,200
They lied about job, Mike.

486
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I know.

487
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,100
They lied.

488
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm gonna
get you out.
They won't let you.

489
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,500
They will kill her.

490
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,600
What's wrong?

491
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
My feet.

492
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Cigarette burns.

493
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
She can't walk.
You get her hopes up,

494
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
you make it worse for her.

495
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,900
You cannot save her.

496
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm not leaving you here Lena

497
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
I can't walk, Mike.

498
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,400
Nachalneek's coming.

499
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,600
Listen, this
necklace,

500
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,700
you see this?

501
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,200
It's St. Nicholas.

502
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,500
He'll keep you safe until i came back.

503
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,600
I've seen you before.

504
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,400
You should know better, Katya.

505
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,300
Get him out.

506
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,400
Mike, don't leave me here.

507
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,700
Don't leave me.

508
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,500
Don't leave me here!
Don't leave me here!

509
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,400
I'll come back for you,
I promise!

510
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,000
Come back and you're dead.

511
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
Nachalneek was Boyka?

512
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,700
I will never testify
against her.

513
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
That was her thing?
The burning?

514
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,100
What she did to us.

515
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,400
Punishment.

516
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,200
So Mike promises
he's going back for Lena...

517
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,100
????

518
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
So you're the famous Nachalneek.

519
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,100
Lot of people
looking for you.

520
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,800
"Nachalneek" just means boss.

521
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Could be anyone.

522
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
There's a witness.

523
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,600
This person wants to testify?

524
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,300
The FBI is charging
you with violation

525
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,800
of the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act.

526
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
And this person
wants to testify?

527
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,800
That's their issue.

528
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
We have you for murder.

529
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,800
Mike Chulaski.

530
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't know who that is.

531
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,500
You met him when he came
looking for Lena,

532
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,500
one of your girls.

533
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,900
Winds up dead
with your trademark

534
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,000
cigarette burns on him.

535
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,500
Someone has framed me.

536
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
You got to do better
than that, boss.

537
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm happy to.

538
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,200
Honesty is the best policy.

539
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,100
Let me in!

540
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm not leaving!

541
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,300
You are risking your life
for nothing.

542
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,100
What do you want for her, money?

543
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,800
I need a young one.

544
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,400
Take Kateryna instead.

545
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,500
Blonde, beautiful,

546
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
doesn't complain.

547
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,700
I want Lena.

548
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Everybody left her, but not me.

549
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,900
I won't.

550
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,400
You can't afford Lena.

551
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll give you $50,000.

552
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
You have this kind of money?

553
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
I'll get it.

554
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,000
She has potential,
but she's difficult.

555
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
Get the money, you can have her.

556
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,100
Kiril will contact you.

557
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
So Mike and
Kiril met up?

558
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
Starlight Motel.

559
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,800
Kiril went for my money,
but I never saw it

560
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,300
or Lena
or Kiril again.

561
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,300
You're locked up, Boyka.

562
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,400
On what charge?

563
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
Prostitution
and conspiracy.

564
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,100
I'll be in jail one night.

565
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
Don't fool yourselves.

566
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
But thank you for finding him.

567
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Kiril.

568
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
He's in custody.
You can't touch him.

569
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Oh, no?

570
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,700
<i>You got stones, Kiril.</i>

571
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,500
Turned on Nachalneek.

572
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
Pocketed Mike's money,
killed him at the motel swap.

573
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,100
Who told you that?

574
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,700
Nachalneek herself.

575
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,100
AKA Boyka.

576
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
She know I talked to you?
Yeah.

577
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,100
You two got a lot to sort out.

578
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,900
Maybe they should talk
face-to-face.

579
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,400
You got to get me
out of general population.

580
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
You want that,
you better start singing.

581
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,900
For starters,
how is it

582
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,300
you're in a motel room
with Mike,

583
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,400
and he ends up
with his head bashed in?

584
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Okay, I'll tell you.

585
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,300
Just protect me from her.

586
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,400
Listening.

587
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,600
I got two rooms
at this motel in Point Breeze.

588
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,800
Why two?

589
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,900
I met Mike in one;
Lena's in the other.

590
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,100
The plan was,

591
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,300
when I got the cash,

592
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
I'd call Lena, bring her to him.

593
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,800
That was pretty
cloak-and-dagger.

594
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Was Boyka's idea.

595
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
That way, Mike would
never know where Lena was,

596
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
if he got stupid.

597
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Mike bring the money?

598
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,500
No. The dumbass
got stupid again.

599
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
$50,000.

600
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,000
I got eight grand here.

601
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,700
And I got the rest
coming from a loan.

602
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,500
????

603
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,800
Deal's off.

604
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I got a bo.

605
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
It's a beauty.

606
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,700
Perfect, actually.

607
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,200
I don't need a boat.

608
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,800
You'll make
money on this.

609
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,100
You could sell it,
get $70,000 in a heartbeat.

610
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,200
70? How do you figure?

611
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,700
I spent the last ten years
of my life fixing it up.

612
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
I mean it.

613
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
It's a prize.

614
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,600
That's coming from you, though.

615
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,900
You're a capital "T" tool.

616
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,100
Go look at it.

617
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,200
Tacony Marina, slip 220.

618
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Keys.

619
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm not giving them up
without Lena.

620
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Forget it, then.

621
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,500
You take the boat.

622
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,300
I take her.

623
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
She's my family now.

624
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,500
Your boyfriend's acting
like a dumbass, as per usual.

625
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
So sit pretty.
I'll be back in an hour.

626
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,700
Stay put.

627
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Mike was still alive
when you left?

628
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,900
Yeah.

629
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,400
Watching me from
the door, that idiot.

630
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
And when you got back?

631
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
Head's smashed in,

632
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
boat keys missing.

633
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,000
Lena still in the other room?

634
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,300
You think I
stuck around

635
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,200
to find out?

636
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,200
I screwed up a job for Boyka.

637
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,900
That's the end of the road.

638
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,000
I got lost.

639
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,000
Miller found Mike's boat.

640
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
The marina
up in Connecticut.

641
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,600
Find an owner?

642
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,700
Guy says he bought it
in cash

643
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,200
here in Philly from
a young girl, foreign accent.

644
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,900
Lena.

645
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,100
Kid didn't have a heart
of gold after all.

646
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,800
Kiril give this up?

647
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
New house run by Boyka.

648
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,600
Thinking one of these girls
knows where Lena ran?

649
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Locked in a house together.

650
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,900
Must've shared
something.

651
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,100
Don't really want to see this.

652
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,700
Lena?

653
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Lena.

654
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm not Lena.

655
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,900
Lena, we found Mike's boat.

656
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,600
Stop calling me that.

657
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,800
It's not my name.

658
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,800
You want to forget
who you used to be?

659
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,000
When you first came here,
met Mike.

660
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,700
He saved you.

661
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,800
I know you remember.

662
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,600
'Cause you kept his necklace.

663
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
That thing.

664
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
I don't know what it is.

665
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
You remember, Lena.

666
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,100
How Mike told you'd always be
safe with this necklace,

667
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,300
and how you betrayed him.

668
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,700
Me betray him?

669
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,300
I did not!

670
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
You took his money,

671
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,100
and you left him to die.

672
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
He is dead?

673
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,200
He was murdered.

674
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,300
Mike said...

675
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,800
in America,
people do things

676
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,900
to be kind.

677
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
But they don't.

678
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,100
Mike didn't want anything
from you.

679
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
That's right.

680
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Not from me.

681
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,900
His house is a boat.

682
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,700
Ow!

683
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
I make you look nice.

684
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Sit still.

685
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,200
And he says that
you never are dizzy

686
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
after you live there
for a few days.

687
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,700
And he say I can go to school

688
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
for free, no problem.

689
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Ow!
Shh.

690
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,200
I don't want you to get
your hopes up, little duck.

691
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,800
But Mike promised me.

692
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,200
How many time I've seen people
in this country tell lies.

693
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Not Mike.

694
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,900
He is different from everybody.

695
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,500
Mike?

696
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Your boyfriend's acting
like a dumbass, as per usual.

697
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,800
So sit pretty.
I'll be back in an hour.

698
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,500
It is Mike?

699
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Lenushka.

700
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,600
I am so sorry.

701
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
What?

702
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,400
It is good

703
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
you did not hope too much.

704
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
What did he say?

705
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,500
Mike wants a girlfriend.

706
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,900
For sex.

707
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,300
He asked for me,

708
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,400
the pretty one.

709
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
My poor little duck.

710
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,800
He said he would come for me.

711
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,700
He wants me now.

712
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Stay here.

713
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,700
Someone will
come for you.

714
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
I gave up hope like she said.

715
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,300
Doesn't hurt anymore.

716
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,100
Wait. He came for you.

717
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,900
Not Kateryna.

718
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,500
She lied,

719
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
not Mike.

720
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,800
No.

721
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
They all lie.

722
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
He gave up

723
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,700
????

724
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,900
His boat is... is where he live.

725
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,700
And he was willing to give it up.

726
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,700
For me?

727
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
He was killed
trying to save you.

728
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,800
He said that

729
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,800
you were his family.

730
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
 <i>Get what you wanted,</i>

731
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,700
Kateryna?

732
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,300
I earn it all.

733
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I work very hard to
get what I deserve.

734
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
The American dream.

735
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,400
Now I can be new person,
hold my head up.

736
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Every dream
takes sacrifice.

737
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,000
What was yours?

738
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,400
I sold my body.

739
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,200
Does things to you.

740
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,000
Makes you
desperate.

741
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,600
You were at
the motel.

742
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Went to Mike's room,
night he died.

743
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
You lied to Lena.

744
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,500
Said Mike didn't want
to save her.

745
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
He didn't.

746
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,300
He was like all the others.

747
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,200
Like the other men
who hurt you?

748
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Why'd you take away her chance
to have a decent life?

749
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,100
I was dying in that house, too.

750
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,100
So you killed a man.

751
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Finally get
something

752
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,800
for yourself.

753
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
You don't understand
what it was like.

754
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
How could you?!

755
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,900
Ten men a day?

756
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Spitting on you,
ripping you apart.

757
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,100
When I first got there,

758
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,300
I resisted, too.

759
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,400
I used to believe
someone would come

760
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,100
and take me away.

761
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,200
But no one came.

762
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,800
Mike did.

763
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Not for me.

764
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,800
You've seen Lena?

765
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,400
Where has Kiril gone?

766
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,200
Huh?

767
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,500
Uh, to see my boat.

768
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm giving it to him

769
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,200
for Lena.

770
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,600
Where's Lena?
Is she okay?

771
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,400
She is not here.

772
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,700
Now relax, Daddy.

773
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,300
Yes, yes.

774
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,600
Did something happen to her?

775
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,400
Okay.Get off me!

776
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,300
Choose me instead.

777
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,600
I am much better.

778
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,300
You want me to be sister,
daughter?

779
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,700
Please. I will.

780
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,000
What are you doing?

781
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,900
Don't make me go back
to that house.

782
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,800
Mike, you are a nice man.

783
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,900
I give you anything.

784
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,900
I just want Lena.

785
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,300
That's all.

786
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,400
No, no. Help me.

787
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,500
I'll help you

788
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,500
once I've got her, okay?

789
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Please.
Can't let
her down.

790
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm all she has.

791
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,100
I want somebody to care for me
so I am not alone.

792
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm sorry.

793
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,000
I got to find Lena.

794
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,300
What about me?

795
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,000
I got to go.I'm sorry.

796
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
What about me?!

797
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,700
What about me?!

798
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
