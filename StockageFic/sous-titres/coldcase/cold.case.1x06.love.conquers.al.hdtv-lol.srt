May 15, 1981

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,445
# You should have seen  
by the look in my eyes, baby #

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:22,582
# There was somethin' missin' #

6
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:28,224
# You should have known  
by the tone of my voice, maybe #

7
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:33,740
# But you didn't listen #

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,722
# And I meant, every word I said #

9
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,560
# When I said that I loved you #

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,497
# I meant that I loved you forever. #

11
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:52,960
# And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you #

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,873
# Cause it's the only thing 
I wanna do #

13
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,770
# I don't wanna sleep, #

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,124
# I just wanna keep on lovin' you. #

15
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:14,052
# Baby, I'm gonna keep 
on lovin' you #

16
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:20,303
# Cause it's the only thing 
I wanna do #

17
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,724
# I don't wanna sleep, #

18
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:30,517
# I just wanna keep on lovin' you #

19
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:37,839
Hey.

20
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:40,078
- He here?
- Room "A".

21
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,210
Doing what?

22
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:51,676
Meet your new partner.

23
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,129
Figured he'd make a good impression,

24
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:01,190
bringing his girlfriend 
to headquarters his first day?

25
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,020
- He says she's an informant.
- Really?

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,411
Fugitives has something interesting.

27
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,128
Sherman picked up 
a guy in Virginia last night.

28
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,863
Wants to trade information 
on an old one.

29
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:14,280
Do I break this up and 
bring the new kid?

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,718
You get me what I need,
I get you that steak dinner.

31
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:20,026
I know you will, too, Scotty.

32
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,247
Get outta here now.
I'm working.

33
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, how's it going?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,435
Scotty Valens, from West.

35
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,144
Nick Vera. 
Congratulations.

36
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:37,603
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,505
Big leagues now, huh? / Yeah.

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,199
That Hammond job was 
some good work.

39
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,217
Yeah, talk about a bag of bones.

40
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:48,540
But I got an angle on it. Figured
that's what got to me Homicide.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,412
This is Detective Rush.
Her partner transferred out.

42
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,281
You'll be working with her.

43
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:58,336
Good luck. / Yeah.

44
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,918
I see... you're Rush.

45
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:03,092
Yeah. Congratulations.

46
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,946
I...I pictured a guy.

47
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,790
You got the one girl in the joint.

48
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,811
Yeah... okay.

49
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,798
We got an interview in Fugitives.

50
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,580
Cool. What's our angle?

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,030
Our angle is I talk, you listen.

52
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,239
Got something on a murder.
What's that get me?

53
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,585
Depends on what you did.

54
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:29,459
Ricky was the driver in a Fishtown
drug shooting, two months back.

55
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,856
I was driving a guy to a conversation.
I didn't know he had a gun.

56
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,679
Don't tell lies, Ricky.

57
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,424
Kite okay making a deal?

58
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,509
Yeah. Ricky here's small-time.

59
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,595
Okay.

60
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:39,702
What do you got?

61
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,370
High school girl got iced back in '81.

62
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,044
It was big news, remember?

63
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:44,852
Remind me.

64
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:46,721
Paige Pratt.

65
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,062
Keep going.

66
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,772
I ain't saying 
I saw the bullet leave the gun,

67
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,694
but I did see something good.

68
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:58,113
I was working at this  
auto repair shop back then.

69
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,225
Had the keys,

70
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,944
so I was gonna sneak in.

71
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,377
The youngest kid Will,

72
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,524
he was already there.

73
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:13,379
# Who can it be knocking at my door? #

74
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,186
# Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more #

75
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:20,851
# Can't you see that it's late at night?#

76
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,645
# I'm very tired, 
and I'm not feeling right #

77
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:28,240
# All I wish is to be alone #

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,040
# Stay away, 
don't you invade my home #

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,994
# Best off if you hang outside #

80
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,622
I put it all together.

81
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:38,147
Will Harrell must have killed her.

82
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,286
Are you trying to get a deal off of that?

83
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:41,466
It's good information.

84
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,065
It's crap. / Valens,

85
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,087
remember our angle.

86
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,734
Okay.

87
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,946
She was 16 years old?

88
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:52,713
Yeah, real pretty.
Track star.

89
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,186
She had a future.

90
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,623
Why didn't you say 
anything back then, Ricky?

91
00:04:56,623 --> 00:05:00,182
I was going to the shop 
that night to steal some stuff.

92
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:03,253
Not gonna explain that. / Mm-hmm.

93
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,276
Okay, I'll check it out.

94
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,466
Hey, it's gonna get me 
out of hot water, right?

95
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:07,818
We'll see how this pans out.

96
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,779
He-Here's the other part.

97
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,289
- Someone else went down for this.
- Yeah?

98
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,938
Yeah. Some mope named Al Clarkson.

99
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,476
He's doing life.

100

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/11/09

110
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,830
Unsolved is upstairs.
The closed ones are down here.

111
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,810
Cold cases...I don't know.

112
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,970
I like being out on the street.

113
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,517
Paige died in a field near the Schuykill River.

114
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,990
So, what, I work a few of these,
then go on the line?

115
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,757
You act like this is 
the B assignment, Scotty.

116
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,144
Ain't it?

117
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,611
Not to me.

118
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,459
I chose it.

119
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,489
Three blows to the head

120
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,718
that would have killed her 
even if she hadn't been shot.

121
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:18,529
Passion crime.
Someone she knew.

122
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,975
Al Clarkson was her boyfriend, 
convicted in '83.

123
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:23,649
Commonwealth must've had a case.

124
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,293
Lots of testimony he had a temper.

125
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,195
That's nothing.

126
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,508
His gold chain was found 
at the scene. / Better.

127
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,341
Tracks matched the tires on his Nova.

128
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,612
Goodrich TA Radial or 
Uniroyal Tiger Paw?

129
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,145
Uniroyal. How'd you know that?

130
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,980
It's a popular tire upgrade 
on a muscle car like that.

131
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,321
You know a lot about cars?

132
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,866
Everything.

133
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,625
So this Will Harrell that saw 
Ricky cleaning blood out of his car...?

134
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,767
What kind of ride he have?

135
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:46,776
Trans AM.

136
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,307
Could have easily had 
those same tires.

137
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,843
So it could have been 
his car at the scene.

138
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,581
All right. This snitch's story  starts to
gets some credibility.

139
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,702
Plus a head injury means 
a lot of blood,

140
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:56,611
but there wasn't much 
found near Paige's body.

141
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,456
So she did most of her 
bleeding somewhere else.

142
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,049
Like inside a car.

143
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:10,201
So why do you like old jobs?

144
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,012
You don't like the action?

145
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:15,205
Don't like bastards 
getting away with murder.

146
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,181
Will Harrell?

147
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,187
You remember a guy 
named Rick Stockvis,

148
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:29,849
used to work here?

149
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,972
There's a name I'd rather forget.

150
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,480
Why's that?

151
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:35,017
Guy was a thief.

152
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,917
He was lifting our tools, 
hocking'em.

153
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,622
We're checking a story he told us

154
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:43,171
about you washing blood out
your Trans AM, June 20, 1981.

155
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,706
That's pretty specific.

156
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,122
It was the same night 
a girl named Paige Pratt died.

157
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,937
- No, that didn't happen.
- Did you know Paige?

158
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,145
No. / Friend of the family, church?

159
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,862
I just said that I didn't know her.

160
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,914
You sold that car pretty soon 
after her death.

161
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:58,075
According to VIN records, 
it was just six days later.

162
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:58,933
I wanted the new ZX.

163
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,551
What kind of tires were 
you sporting, Will?

164
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:02,718
Factory install or upgrade?

165
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:03,629
I don't recall.

166
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,003
Well, that's what records are for.

167
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:06,907
Mind if we sit in your office,
look through your paperwork?

168
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:11,012
Yes, I do. 
I'm very busy.

169
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:15,289
Will got pretty hinky 
near the end there.

170
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,157
Make any connect 
between him and Paige?

171
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,847
No. Went to different high schools.

172
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,482
That age, high school's 
your whole world.

173
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:23,373
Still looking for her parents.
They're not at their old address.

174
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,273
You Valens? / Yeah.

175
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,993
Will Jeffries. Congratulations.

176
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:28,467
Thanks. It's great being here.

177
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,650
Jeffries and Vera are a matching set.

178
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,242
Someone named Roxy 
called for you.

179
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,199
Yeah? Good.

180
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,811
Twice. Says she'll try you back.

181
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,829
Yeah. She don't got a phone.

182
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,025
You guys get a job?

183
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,454
Confession at the scene. 
Total duck.

184
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:47,275
You wanna track 
this old Trans AM for us?

185
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,789
See if it's still on the street somewhere?

186
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,334
Sure thing. Lil, you might 
wanna go see Al Clarkson.

187
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,125
Get his view of the world.

188
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,461
You know, it'd be good to find 
the second owner on it.

189
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,790
Whoever bought it from Harrell.

190
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,732
Thanks. 
We'll do that.

191
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,523
You could learn something
from this guy.

192
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:13,762
I bought that Trans AM in 1981.

193
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,646
Yeah, I got a car habit.

194
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:19,519
Mercedes taste on a Mazda salary.

195
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,364
I hear you.

196
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,867
So, did you break the bank 
on that TA?

197
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,308
Nah, that was a steal.

198
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,427
Dumb kid didn't know what it was worth.

199
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,266
I sold it for twice what I paid.

200
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,745
Why'd he sell it so cheap?

201
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,067
I didn't ask.

202
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:33,153
A good deal falls in your lap, 
you take it.

203
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,928
Do you remember anything 
about the kid you bought it from?

204
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:38,693
Well, just that he kept 
the car up pretty good.

205
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,111
Seemed to love it,

206
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:43,137
but still, he was selling.

207
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,525
Look, my boss is 
giving me the evil eye.

208
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,496
Mind if we finish our coffee?

209
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,055
Nah, live it up.

210
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:56,040
So Will worked at an auto shop.

211
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,632
He never heard 
about Blue Book value?

212
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,782
Motivated seller maybe.

213
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,797
West Detectives was all 
about the volume.

214
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:04,974
Every night it's hoppin'.

215
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:06,315
You're out there running
your whole shift.

216
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,499
That's why I'm saying,

217
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:10,161
I just don't know if cold cases 
is gonna be my thing.

218
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,601
And I just don't know 
if you have a choice, Scotty.

219
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:21,343
What do you want with me?

220
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,660
Looking into your case again, Al.

221
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,169
"Lock him up and throw away
the key." That was my case.

222
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,218
Well, we're looking at it again.

223
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,037
I didn't kill Paige.

224
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:31,942
I got railroaded because I was 21
hanging with a high school girl.

225
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:33,978
Those guys are a little creepy, Al.

226
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,385
I was a late bloomer.

227
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,219
I see Rudy Tanner was your lawyer.

228
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,683
Strip mall hack.

229
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,357
One of them guys in bad clothes,

230
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,983
dropping his folders 
all over the place?

231
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,002
That's him. / I didn't know 
how to find someone good.

232
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,264
How do you explain your gold
chainbeing at the crime scene, Al?

233
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,113
- Paige was wearing it.
- She wear it a lot?

234
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,368
When we were getting along.

235
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,944
A lot of people say you had 
a real temper with her.

236
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:57,276
She ran wild on me.
I loved her, so it hurt.

237
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,802
Jealousy ain't against the law.

238
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,163
How come you weren't 
with her that night?

239
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:02,468
She was supposed to be grounded,
but she must've snuck out.

240
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:03,814
Energetic girl.

241
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:06,398
Yeah, she was.

242
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:09,908
My guess is she must've 
met some guy.

243
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,440
She had someone 
on her mind around that time...

244
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,259
What am I missing, Paige?
You're here to run.

245
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,774
Why you gotta wear 
purple eye shadow?

246
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,506
I can race and look good. / Uh-huh.

247
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,126
Which one is he?

248
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:22,677
- I'm tired of the third degree, Al.
- And I'm tired of being your fool.

249
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,565
Who is he?

250
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,576
Maybe you should just leave.

251
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:30,345
I'll get my own ride home.

252
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,489
So which one was he?

253
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,230
Never found out.

254
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,206
Think it could have been this guy?

255
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,588
Will Harrell?

256
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,563
Nah, I never saw him.

257
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,309
Okay, thanks for your time, Al.

258
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:52,337
Yeah. Go pound sand.

259
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,578
You can just take my car?

260
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:05,865
Don't worry, kid.

261
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:07,540
We'll get it back to you 
when we're done.

262
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,679
There's a dance Friday night.
Will I have it back by then?

263
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,197
We'll do our best.

264
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:16,489
Yeah, 'cause I just bought this.
I've only had it for, like, two weeks.

265
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:18,129
First car, huh?

266
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,813
Friday, right?

267
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,350
Hope he's got insurance.

268
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,191
Oh, he don't.

269
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,805
Upholstery could've been 
shampooed 50 times,

270
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,552
we're still gonna know 
if blood was shed in there.

271
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,250
Figure out a Will and Paige connect?

272
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,578
She was an athlete at Crespi.
He was a loser at Jefferson.

273
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,925
No activities in common.

274
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,037
So maybe Willy's hanging 
around the wawa one night,

275
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,235
looking for a party...

276
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,044
Yeah. He's got the car going for him.

277
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,014
- Paige needs a ride.
- He's a little mole.

278
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:55,423
Doesn't do good with girls.
Makes a play for her.

279
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,048
She brushes him off.

280
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,961
Will breaks her head open.

281
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,969
This is the cool part.

282
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:02,549
Hit the light.

283
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,078
He knew her somehow.

284
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,255
Found your old Trans AM, Will.

285
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:25,165
Blood, blood, and more blood.

286
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,113
Bull.

287
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,260
Wanna see pictures?

288
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:32,949
Okay. Just...

289
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:35,127
Here's what happened.

290
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:38,937
I... hit a dog on the Turnpike.

291
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:39,988
A dog.

292
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:43,084
Yeah, I...I put it in my car.
I had to clean it out after.

293
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,244
That's what Ricky must have seen.

294
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,242
You a special kind of stupid, Will?

295
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,998
I'm not making it up.

296
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:50,754
And the night that girl was murdered,

297
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:52,428
I was at Raiders of the Lost Ark.

298
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,103
You recall that now, too, huh?

299
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:56,951
You guys coming around 
made me think of it.

300
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,092
Who'd you see the movie with?

301
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,844
Bennett Cahill.
My best friend.

302
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,670
And...And his girlfriend Jane.

303
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,541
I have cheer practice till 6:00.

304
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,204
So when can we talk?

305
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,245
Dinner at 6:30.

306
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,427
So I should call you at 6:45?

307
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,249
Hey, guys.

308
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:16,859
Hey.

309
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:19,278
I'm seeing Raiders tomorrow.

310
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,239
Cool.

311
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,541
Yeah. I'm getting in line at noon.

312
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,593
I'll get three tickets,
if you guys wanna go.

313
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:26,888
Yeah, sounds good.

314
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:28,925
Okay, great. Saturday...

315
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,026
Raiders.

316
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,146
I still have the ticket stub to prove it.

317
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,778
You have the stub from 22 years ago?

318
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:36,405
Some good luck.

319
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:38,674
It's my favorite movies.

320
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,763
You keep stuff like that.

321
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,244
Well, you do realize 
that we have the science

322
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:46,823
to tell us the difference between
dog and human blood, right?

323
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:48,849
I have the ticket stub.

324
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,576
You and Bennett still close?

325
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,941
Bennett's really successful.
Always was.

326
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,276
Class president, went to Princeton.

327
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,735
He's a surgeon now.

328
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:59,141
You're friends with a surgeon?

329
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,822
Old friends.

330
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:04,197
Okay, Will, we'll check out that story.

331
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,783
I have the stub.

332
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:13,984
So what happened
to your old partner?

333
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,051
Detailed out to H.I.U.

334
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,038
Gotta weed out the weak ones.

335
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:19,882
He needed all day work 
'cause of his diabates.

336
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:23,010
He wasn't... weak.

337
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,801
Hi. Bennett Cahill.

338
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,247
Detectives Rush and Valens,
Homicide.

339
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:36,745
What's it about?

340
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,943
Guy named Will Harrell.

341
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,212
You went to high school together.

342
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:43,175
I could probably place him.

343
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,977
Right, that guy.

344
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,768
- What'd he do?
- We don't know yet.

345
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,961
Will says you and him 
were best friends.

346
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:56,360
More like acquaintances.

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,034
He says you went to Raiders 
of the Lost Ark

348
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:01,249
with him and your girlfriend, 
June 20, 1981.

349
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,727
I doubt it.

350
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,843
I probably was with Jane, 
but, uh, Will...?

351
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:08,179
Willy kind of an outcast type?

352
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:09,863
You could say.

353
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:13,250
He had this room at his dad's shop.

354
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,755
It was a no-parents zone, you know?

355
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,729
So a lot of us would hang out there,
drink beer, whatever.

356
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,095
How'd he do with the ladies?

357
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,421
Don't recall any big scores.

358
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,388
He ever mention a girl named Paige?

359
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:27,461
No. But we didn't talk a lot.

360
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:28,364
Uh...

361
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,268
After he freaked me out one night,
I stopped going over there.

362
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:34,126
What'd he do?

363
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,633
He showed me a gun.

364
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:39,843
Called it a bitch killer.

365
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:46,066
Yeah. That's when I stopped 
going over there.

366
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,440
Will seem like he could get 
frustrated enough to hurt a girl?

367
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,771
I really don't know.

368
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,805
Uh... I hope not.

369
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:58,114
Will was a B-list kid 
with A-list aspirations.

370
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:00,821
Hottie like Paige would 
have blown him off for sure.

371
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,879
He meets her, gets the snub, 
it's the last straw.

372
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,891
Pulls out his bitch killer.

373
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,484
His what?

374
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,011
Nothing, boss.

375
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:10,877
Did you ever find Paige's parents?

376
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,813
Mm. Moved to Atlanta in '84.

377
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,147
Aren't returning phone calls.

378
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,170
They already got some in jail.
Why relieve the nightmare?

379
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,446
DA's office is gonna hate this.

380
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:22,859
Well, Kite's already called 
a hundred times.

381
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,319
Who't Kite?

382
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:28,324
Assistant D.A. Ivy League jerk.

383
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,353
Criminalistics just called.

384
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:32,951
It was Paige's blood in the Trans AM.

385
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,121
You can't do this.

386
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,310
Sure we can. 
Read the search warrant.

387
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,764
I'm telling you I hit a dog.

388
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,073
Well, that dog had Paige Pratt's DNA.

389
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,166
Look. Look.

390
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,121
Look at the date.
Look at the date.

391
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,798
- June 20, 1981.
- Heads up.

392
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,295
Found the bitch killer.

393
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,451
I've never seen that before in my life.

394
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,376
My money says this is 
the gun killed Paige.

395
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,390
Party's over, Will.

396
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,043
I was with Bennett and 
Jane that night!

397
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,581
Yeah, we talked to Bennett.

398
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,397
He didn't back your story.

399
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,234
What?

400
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:04,596
Your "best friend"
barely remembered you, Willy.

401
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,783
He said you were a nobody in hight school.

402
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,103
A hanger-on who got used 
by the popular kids

403
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,829
'cause you gave them a place to party.

404
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,734
He didn't say that.

405
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:14,135
He said he wouldn't be seen 
at the movies with you.

406
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,391
Or anywhere else.

407
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,317
Well, then...

408
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:30,359
Then screw him.

409
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,364
You wanna know the truth?

410
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,741
For a change, you mean?

411
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,667
We were supposed to go
to the movies that night.

412
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,849
But he asked me to borrow 
my car at first.

413
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,813
Where the hell have you been?

414
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,736
There was a problem.

415
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,597
Is that... is that blood?

416
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,857
I, uh, I hit a dog.

417
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,995
- You and Jane?
- No, it was just me, uh...

418
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:10,137
Uh...

419
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:13,754
I tried to save it. 
I took it to the vet.

420
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,916
It bled all over the seats.

421
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,688
- You should have called me.
- Yeah...

422
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:23,624
Well, upholstery's gonna 
need to be cleaned out.

423
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:24,875
I'll do it.

424
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:26,058
Will...

425
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,462
let's tell people that 
we went to Raiders, okay?

426
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:31,073
I don't want my mom 
knowing about the dog.

427
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,207
No...

428
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:35,962
Sure. / Thanks, pal.

429
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,685
Dumb-ass story, Willy.

430
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:41,739
It's true. / Yeah.

431
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,181
I loaned Bennett my car.

432
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,589
He...He must have killed that girl.

433
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,459
And...and then put the gun in the ceiling.

434
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,703
Then why'd  you cover for him?

435
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:51,445
Me and Bennett had 
a deal not to talk about it.

436
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:52,482
And...

437
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,356
I...I thought we were friends.

438
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,377
Hey, are we gonna do this?

439
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,803
Just a sec.

440
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,400
You owe me a call, Rush.

441
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,772
I was getting to that today.

442
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:16,935
There's a difference between 
cold cases and closed cases.

443
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:17,818
Do you get my meaning?

444
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,547
You agreed to the deal with 
that snitch.

445
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:22,911
No one mentioned his information
was on a case we already won.

446
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,490
Okay, then, we should just ignore
the DNA and ballistics, huh?

447
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,189
Am I supposed to go to my boss
and say,

448
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,150
"Sorry, you screwed the pooch 
on this one.

449
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,348
We're just gonna star over."?

450
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:32,890
And innocent man's 
been sitting in jail

451
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,871
for 22 years because of your boss.

452
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:35,820
Why don't you tell him that?

453
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,320
I don't spring Al Clarkson 
untill you arrest Harrell.

454
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,462
I'm holding him.

455
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:42,928
I want him arrested.

456
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:45,449
I want to give it a day. / No.

457
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,764
Okay, then, well...

458
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,837
Will's locked up.

459
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:57,199
Who's that charmer?

460
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:00,882
ADA Kite.

461
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,814
He's above cops.

462
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:05,277
Ain't above checking you out.

463
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,609
I thought you had your guy, Lil.

464
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,125
I'm gonna check out Will's story.

465
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,033
Go through it all again, 
this time with Bennett in mind.

466
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,691
Don't matter that 
everything points to Will?

467
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,811
Al Clarkson got screwed 
'cause the prosecutors

468
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,496
didn't look at all the angles.

469
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm not doing that to Will.

470
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,347
So, you looking for 
a Bennett-Paige connect?

471
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:28,928
Yeah. / Well...

472
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,342
Here. Bennett was 
the captain of his track team.

473
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:34,052
Paige ran track for her school.

474
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,163
They could have met that way.

475
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,892
And Al thought she was flirting with
someone at a track meet, remember?

476
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,054
Now something's cooking.

477
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,196
Just a month before.

478
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,312
We going back to the doc?

479
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:47,581
No, let's go to the girlfriend
he was supposedly with that night

480
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,084
Jane.

481
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,337
You guys keep reading.

482
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:52,888
Sure.

483
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,170
Then we'll wash your car.

484
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,967
We have some questions 
about Bennett Cahill.

485
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,703
Did something happen to him?

486
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:03,190
Nah. Alive and kicking.

487
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,319
He was your high school 
boyfriend, right?

488
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,244
- All four years.
- Pretty serious?

489
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:12,274
Very. But, uh, then we wentto 
different colleges, lost touch...

490
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,103
Either of you date anyone else 
in high school?

491
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,962
No. No, we were together.

492
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:20,607
So there wasn't a girl named 
Paige Pratt in your lives?

493
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,260
She went to Crespi.

494
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,033
Ran track, like Bennett.

495
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:26,187
I know who you're talking about,

496
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:28,555
because of what happened to her.

497
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,237
But we didn't know her.

498
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:32,197
You and Bennett knew 
all the same people?

499
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,205
Why are you asking about this?

500
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,037
Someone was convicted of that crime.

501
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,233
He's been unconvicted.

502
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:40,815
And what do you want from me?

503
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:44,845
I don't suppose you remember
what you were doing June 20, 1981.

504
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,678
Of course she doesn't.

505
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,785
Actually, I do.

506
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,070
For good reason.

507
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,569
Are you sure you're ready for this?

508
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:58,958
I'm sure.

509
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,147
You know, we don't have to.

510
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,202
I want to.

511
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:05,751
We love each other, and...

512
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,229
if we're gonna take it to the next level...

513
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:13,017
First time, huh?

514
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:15,416
Sweet.

515
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,533
Yeah.

516
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,664
His first time, too?

517
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,848
We were devoted to each other.

518
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:21,979
So that's a yes?

519
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,776
That's a yes.

520
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:28,295
You ain't covering for Bennett
all this time later, are you Jane?

521
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:32,058
Bennett Cahill was an angel.

522
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,914
"Angel"...yeesh.

523
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,803
You wanna write up her interview?

524
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:38,080
Yeah.

525
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,718
While you're at it, 
you gotta redo Clarkson's.

526
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:41,809
What do you mean?

527
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,963
Uh, you wrote it in the third person.
It's gotta be in their words.

528
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,855
Rush!
We got goods.

529
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,452
- Yeah?
- Loot at this.

530
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,273
Three pages of blah, blah, blah,

531
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:56,300
but then, look what this girl 
says to Paige at the end.

532
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,391
"Forget the A, go for the B."

533
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:00,737
Yeah. Could be grades, 
could be Al and Bennett.

534
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,315
Not bad. / Mm.

535
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,271
Probably wrote it that way 
in case Al ever read it.

536
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,837
Who's Heidi?

537
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,163
Tracking her down.

538
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,644
I'll go you one better.

539
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:14,344
Surveillance pictures of 
Al Clarkson before his arrest.

540
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:17,881
These were taken 
at Paige's memorial service.

541
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,292
What's Bennett doing there?

542
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:25,263
I have surgery in ten minutes.
Can we make this brief, please?

543
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,238
Sure.

544
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,864
What were you doing Paige Pratt?

545
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:29,492
I didn't even know her.

546
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:32,191
You just like memorial services?

547
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:41,374
Feel like I'm 18 again.

548
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:43,583
Huh.

549
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:47,458
I guess there's no reason to lie now.

550
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,034
I did know Paige...

551
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,976
for about an hour.

552
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,860
Call me when you get home?

553
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,330
The very moment.

554
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:12,467
# Her hair is Harlow gold, #

555
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:16,629
# Her lips sweet surprise #

556
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:20,350
# Her hands are never cold, #

557
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,742
# She's got Bette Davis eyes #

558
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:23,685
Hi.

559
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,964
# She'll turn the music on you #

560
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:25,807
Hi.

561
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,769
Did you miss your ride?

562
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,794
Yeah.

563
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,390
Can you believe it?

564
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:35,572
How far do you live?

565
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,876
Not that far. 
Six miles.

566
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:41,398
I can pay you for gas.

567
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:45,337
# And she'll tease you, 
she'll unease you #

568
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:49,082
# All the better just to please you #

569
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:52,926
# She's precocious, 
and she knows just #

570
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,010
I've always noticed you.

571
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:59,779
I look for you at all the meets.

572
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,470
Yeah, I've seen you, too.

573
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,432
What did you think?

574
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:10,808
I thought I gotta meet that girl.

575
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,061
It was a stupid...

576
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,292
a stupid thing to do.

577
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,025
I... I had a girlfriend.

578
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:24,805
This was the girl that I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.

579
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,371
Yeah, but she wasn't providing.

580
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:31,263
I dropped Paige at home
never saw her again.

581
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:33,801
The only one who ever 
existed to me was Jane.

582
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,724
But after Paige died, 
you felt guilty.

583
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,132
That's why I went to the service.

584
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,196
Did Jane know about this?

585
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,456
Jane and I had an epic love.

586
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,308
She couldn't know about it.

587
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,224
It would've killed her.

588
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:52,266
You talked to Janie lately?

589
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:57,129
Breaking up was so awful, we, uh...

590
00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:00,293
we knew we could 
never speak again.

591
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,848
Was Paige's best friend,

592
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:05,993
you must've known about her love life.

593
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,268
Paige had a huge crush 
on Bennett.

594
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:13,016
But he was a senior at Jefferson, 
and very taken.

595
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,666
By Jane.

596
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:16,430
Was she a bitch.

597
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,412
Yeah? Why?

598
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:19,855
Well, when she found out about

599
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,861
Paige and Bennett doing it 
that one time...

600
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:24,730
she kept calling Paige up

601
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,164
and saying "You're a damn slut" 
and all this...

602
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,299
How do you know it was Jane?

603
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,941
Well, she was head 
cheerleader at Jefferson

604
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:35,609
I knew her squeaky little voice.

605
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,381
So you didn't tell the cops about this.

606
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,890
It didn't seem important.

607
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,250
Al was such a slime bag, 
we all just thought he did it.

608
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,250
Did Paige ever see Bennett again?

609
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,514
No.

610
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:51,087
Track season was over.

611
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,650
She was still hung up on him, though.

612
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,258
Wrote me all these notes about him...

613
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,063
Mm... You still have any 
of those notes?

614
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:01,702
No. I wish I did.

615
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,505
Is it true that Al didn't kill her?

616
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,346
Looks that way.

617
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:12,024
That's a wasted life, huh?

618
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:21,411
Bennett and Jane supposedly had
this epic love...

619
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,728
huh...till Bennett cheats.

620
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:25,838
He says Janie didn't know,

621
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,255
but she knew enough to call 
Paige to tell her off.

622
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:30,098
So Bennett could've done it 
to shut Paige up

623
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,116
or Jane could've done 
it out of revenge.

624
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,251
And poor Will's sitting in lockup.

625
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,309
Not a good time

626
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,858
Complicated social life.

627
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:40,937
So what's with the origami?

628
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,872
Letters from Paige to her best friend.

629
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:45,366
Full of dirty details about Bennett.

630
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,315
Uh-huh.

631
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,599
Here's another one.

632
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:52,646
A little more loopy with the letters.

633
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,444
How do I get stuck doing this?

634
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,701
I'm doing the fancy folding.

635
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,554
We're in the middle of dinner.

636
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:05,297
We gotta talk about Bennett and Paige.

637
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:06,617
What about them?

638
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:09,223
Come on now, Jane.

639
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:15,414
- It was a one-time thing.
- Is that what he told you?

640
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:18,221
He begged my forgiveness. 
We moved past it.

641
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:21,673
But Bennett wasn't a virgin anymore.

642
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:23,395
That must've hurt.

643
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,735
It was a one-time thing.

644
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,854
Not according to these.

645
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,274
Paige wrote these notes 
to her friend Heidi.

646
00:29:31,274 --> 00:29:35,949
They're all about Bennett
and the nine times she was with him.

647
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:36,955
I, um...

648
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,236
highlighted the good parts.

649
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,411
She was a liar.

650
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:58,827
And a slut, right?

651
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:00,856
Like you told her on the phone?

652
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:02,477
You should go.

653
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:04,161
I'll just leave these for you.

654
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:06,195
Still wanna stick with your story, Jane?

655
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:09,620
That you and Bennett hadyour 
first night, June 20, or...

656
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,605
did something else 
going on that night?

657
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,509
I told you what happened.

658
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:17,822
Well, I'll be meeting with Bennett
first thing tomorrow morning.

659
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:20,672
Hopefully, your stories will match.

660
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,491
How'd it go?

661
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:34,529
We'll see.

662
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,400
It was just Roxy.

663
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,573
That the one from the other morning?

664
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,529
Nah, that's Blair.

665
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:53,827
So which one's your girl?

666
00:30:53,827 --> 00:30:55,384
I don't get a girl.

667
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:57,150
They're, uh, contacts 
on the Hammond case.

668
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,594
I'm still looking for a guy.

669
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:03,861
You know, in West,

670
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,874
we didn't write our interviews 
first person.

671
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:09,628
In Homicide we do.

672
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:10,866
Uh-huh.

673
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:14,686
Homicide's got the best guys, Scotty.

674
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:18,734
You're not gonna 
be the superstar your first week.

675
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,596
There she goes.

676
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,920
The surgeon blowing her off?

677
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:45,973
He's coming.

678
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:53,391
Nice ride.

679
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,669
Wants to show the old girlfriend
how good he did in life.

680
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,167
Be a good time to bring'em in.

681
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:57,188
You know Will Harrell's sittingin jail
right now, don't you, Bennett?

682
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,464
Yeah... mm..

683
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,362
and I feel bad about it.

684
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,836
But you... you really should 
be talking to Jane.

685
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:05,853
Except Jane, didn't borrow 
Will's car that night,

686
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,035
where Paige's blood ended up.

687
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:08,168
I borrowed it,

688
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:10,119
and then let Jane take it out 
with her cheerleader friends.

689
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,372
Gosh!

690
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:15,330
The new stories just keep coming.

691
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:22,144
She came and told me what she did.

692
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:27,120
I loved her, 
so I helped clean up after.

693
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,711
When she found out about Paige
and me, she wanted one thing.

694
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,539
What was that?

695
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,282
To see her dead.

696
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:34,770
Get away.

697
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,484
How could you do that?

698
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,091
It was meaningless.

699
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:42,730
I was stupid. I'm sorry.

700
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,289
I was gonna give myself to you,

701
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,721
and you just threw it away 
on this nobody.

702
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,232
Th...This can't ruin what we have.

703
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:50,557
What we had is gone.

704
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:53,208
I can't be with you now.

705
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,576
Jane.

706
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,540
Who is she?

707
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:07,206
She was over 
at Will's all the time, too.

708
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:09,642
She must've hid the gun there.

709
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,025
She told you she killed her?

710
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,909
It'll be hard for you to understand.

711
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,614
But Jane and I had something 
that most people don't.

712
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:21,148
In our situation, it, 
it didn't seem wrong.

713
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,376
What situation?

714
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:24,659
Love.

715
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:29,613
Our was different than other people's.

716
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,630
You said the guy was an angel.

717
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,351
Now he's a killer?

718
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,532
- This was Bennett's doing.
- That's not what he says, Janie.

719
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:43,705
He says you were so jealous of Paige,
you went out and shot her dead.

720
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:44,696
I shot her?

721
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,921
That's his position.

722
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:52,203
He came to me, crawling...

723
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,738
saying he'd do anything,

724
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:56,225
anything...

725
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,963
to be together again.

726
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,714
Guess what that "anything" was?

727
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:05,087
Please talk to me.

728
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,367
We're through, Bennett.

729
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,456
No. I have to have you back.

730
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,532
What do you want me to do?
Name it. I'll do whatever you say.

731
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:12,930
There's nothing to do.

732
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,092
Yes, there is. I know there is,

733
00:35:15,092 --> 00:35:16,980
and I'll do it.

734
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,656
He got a gun...

735
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:25,364
he took her out to a field...

736
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:28,266
and got her out of our lives.

737
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:31,317
Came and told me about it.

738
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:33,929
And you kept that secret for him.

739
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,429
What else could I do?

740
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:38,328
Head for the hills and call the cops.

741
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,931
I don't think you're hearing me.

742
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,197
He loved me so much,

743
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:47,897
he did murder for me.

744
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:50,122
I've been looking through 
your yearbook, Bennett.

745
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,378
You and Janie are all over it.

746
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:53,680
"Best Couple."

747
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,866
Prom king and queen?

748
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:57,443
Junior and senior prom.

749
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:59,895
Ah, must've been great.

750
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:00,771
Yeah.

751
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,474
Me,

752
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:05,833
I can't keep a girl's attention 
longer than three months.

753
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,577
I've never been lucky in love either.

754
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,005
I wouldn't call it "luck."

755
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:10,990
Fate?

756
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,197
That's closer.

757
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:15,198
Jane and I used to say 
that we were as...

758
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,886
we were as rare 
as Halley's Comet.

759
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,492
That's amazing.

760
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:22,837
Too bad you ruined it with 
that fling with Paige.

761
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:23,789
I didn't ruin it.

762
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,559
No? How do you make up 
for some like that?

763
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,458
We figured out a way.

764
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:31,008
How?

765
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,328
I got no chance at Halley's Comet...
neither does he...

766
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:39,077
so we really need you 
to help us understand.

767
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,135
We made a plan.

768
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,668
- I know what we can do.
- You do?

769
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:48,412
I know how we can be togehter.

770
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:49,697
Tell me.

771
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:53,502
If we kill her, we can erase her,

772
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:56,797
and then you'll be a virgin again.

773
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,130
Yeah?

774
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,306
It's to save us.

775
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,144
You're right.

776
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:07,101
You're right.

777
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,420
You'll have to take my word for it.

778
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,527
It made sense.

779
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:15,355
Bennett told us 
how it went, Janie.

780
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:16,553
How what went?

781
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,364
The murder.

782
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:20,704
'Bout the gun, the barbells.

783
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:21,569
I don't know what you mean.

784
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,693
How you were gonna sink her
in the river after.

785
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:24,661
I don't...

786
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,724
believe you.

787
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,976
'Bout Halley's Comet.

788
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:38,921
He told you about that?

789
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:43,933
And he wants to know
if you wanna do this together.

790
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:51,613
What we thought would save us...

791
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,357
actually ruined us.

792
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,468
After she died, we could 
never get back the purity.

793
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:00,567
So we separated,

794
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:04,013
never talked again.

795
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,896
And the worst thing?

796
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:10,010
We never loved anyone else again,

797
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,553
not the way we loved each other.

798
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:16,239
That's the worst thing, huh?

799
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,405
We belong together.

800
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:23,443
We'll go down together.

801
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,413
Paige?

802
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:27,625
It's Bennett.

803
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,150
I didn't think you'd call.

804
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,124
Yeah.

805
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:32,307
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Uh...

806
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,788
I've been, uh...

807
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:39,730
Well, Jane and I broke up.

808
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,948
I'm sorry.

809
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:45,127
Yeah. And I was wondering
if you wanted to get together.

810
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:47,469
Tonight. I know it's late, but...

811
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:48,863
I can sneak out.

812
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:52,040
Yeah, I'll pick you up in ten minutes?

813
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:03,239
Are you sure you're ready for this?

814
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,800
I'm sure.

815
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:06,494
You know, we don't have to...

816
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:08,864
I want to.

817
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,093
We love each other, and...

818
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:15,329
if we're gonna take it to the next level...

819
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,378
then...

820
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:28,973
Hi.

821
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,576
- Hey.
- Nice car.

822
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:33,943
Where are we going?

823
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,405
A nice, quiet place.

824
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,767
Well, I guess it's time.

825
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:07,293
Do it!

826
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,573
Oh, no!

827
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:21,793
No!

828
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,412
Do it! 
You have to do it!

829
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,358
Do it! 
You have to do it!

830
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,770
Please! Don't...!

831
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,342
Please... don't...

832
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,424
I can't believe it.

"She's Got A Way About Her" 
by Billy Joel

834
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:52,702
# She's got a way about her #

835
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:55,584
# I don't know what it is #

836
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:59,842
# But I know that I can't live without her #

837
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:05,699
# She's got a way of pleasin'#

838
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:08,114
# I don't know why it is #

839
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:15,798
# But there doesn't have to 
be a reason anywhere #

840
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:21,944
# She's got a smile that heals me #

841
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:25,193
# I don't know what it is #

842
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:29,787
# But I have to laugh 
when she reveals me #

843
00:42:29,787 --> 00:42:35,685
# She's got a way of talkin' #

844
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:38,580
# I don't know why it is #

845
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:46,540
# But it lifts me up when 
we are walkin' anywhere #

846
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:52,139
# She comes to me 
when I'm feelin' down #

847
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:55,522
# Inspires me without a sound #

848
00:42:55,522 --> 00:43:03,576
# She touches me and
I get turned around #

849
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:09,678
# She's got a way of showin' #

850
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:12,654
# How I make her feel #

851
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:17,159
# And I find the strength to keep on goin'#

852
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:23,133
# She's got a light around her #

853
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,163
# And everywhere she goes #
