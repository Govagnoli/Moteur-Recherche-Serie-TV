1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,870
The dynamic woman has it all.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,320
She's a career woman,
a with-it mom February 16,1982

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,260
a vital partner for her husband.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,250
If you want to bring your brand into the
future,you want to be worn by today's woman.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,380
today's woman,the dynamic woman,

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,630
needs a perfume that goes from
morning to night and doesn't quit.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,660
Today's woman...

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,860
please excuse me one second. S
tella ?

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,150
sitter's sick again.
I've got to be in court.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,140
Should be right back.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,740
roger,you can't be serious.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,170
Think your secretary can keep an
eye on 'em for a minute or two ?

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,020
You know how fussy the baby
gets with other people.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm in the middle of a presentation here.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,020
And my clients gets 20 years
to life if I don't show up.

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,270
Okay. Who can be quiet the longest ?

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,300
Not her. That's for sure.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,900
Maybe you can help out your little sister.

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,400
-What do you say,buddy ?
-Okay.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,030
Okay,okay,get out of here
before I change my mind.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,700
-Okay.
-Hi.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,300
What would we do without you ?

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,460
Fall utterly to pieces ? Knock 'em dead.

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,480
-You,too.
-Okay. Piece of cake.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,620
Excuse me.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,710
what are you doing ?

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,290
What does it look like,einstein ?

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,890
Sit right there,devon.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,180
This is my son. Say hi,devon.

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,010
-Hi.
-Hi,devon.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,340
I didn't know what else to do.

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,010
make roger screw up his career,
not yours ?

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,220
-working mother
-But always a dedicated professional.

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,330
like the dynamic woman.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,010
-I am...
-she is the dynamic woman.

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,360
Which is why our company is so
suited to create your ad campaign.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,110
We know her hopes and dreams,
her fears and purchasing patterns.

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,360
Today's woman wants it all,
and she'll get it.

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,520
let's show you the numbers we worked up.

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
hey,mom,can I color this ?

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,550
yes.

42
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,930
lil,frannie.

43
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,230
-frannie's got something for us,boss.
-Yeah ? What's that ?

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,470
Infant death. '82.

45
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,200
Iris felice.

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,650
She was six months old.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,990
Sudden infant death syndrome.
You got thoughts otherwise ?

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,790
Well,some of the old-time coroners--

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,120
they used outdated information
to determine sids.

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,800
Which is why the me has frannie and the other
assistants reviewing all the sids cases.

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,670
From 1980 to '85.

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,220
And with iris,I found something.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,860
These photos are from the scene
before they moved the body.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,630
Tricky thing about sids is it forensically
looks like other causes of death.

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,800
Heart stops. Fluid in the lungs.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,580
But that doesn't explain this.

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,120
The baby's hair--it's wet.

58
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,200
Fluid in the lungs,plus wet hair ?

59
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,960
Could have been a drowning ?

60
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,660
Hair could've dried by the time
it got to the coroner'S.

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,360
-He wouldn't have seen it.
-Yeah,in '82 especially.

62
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,720
They weren't as suspicious of
infant death as we are now.

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,590
You work a few of these baby jobs,
you get suspicious.

64
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,620
What looks like sids could be anything but.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,520
You certain about that ?

66
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,180
Well,some people say sids
doesn't really exist.

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,880
Babies don't die for no reason.

68
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,470
-But...
-but you can't say for sure.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,570
Med school taught me we know less
about life and death than we think.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,730
We're gonna turn these parents' lives
upside down again,we got to have a good reason.

71
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,700
Well,if there's a chance a kid's
murder slipped through the cracks,

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,820
maybe that's reason enough.

73
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,960
Iris felice.

74
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,440
Found dead in her crib at 6:30 A. M.
On april 19,1982.

75
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,090
Mother called 911.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,170
-Well,the cops at the scene thought sids.
-Coroner backed it up.

77
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,610
There was no reason to suspect foul play,
no signs of prior abuse.

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,190
Baby was premature,but had a clean
bill of health,otherwise.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,290
We sure the hair wasn't wet from sweat ?
Maybe the weather.

80
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,910
Nah,looked it up.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,070
-A freak snowstorm that night.
-Spring in philly.

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,900
Another reason we're america's
vacation destination.

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,310
there was a baby-sitter with iris and
her brother until 8:00 P. M.  That night.

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,040
The parents checked on the baby when
they got home. Said she was fine.

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,960
Well,it leaves whoever's in
the house after that.

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,570
-Mom,dad. Always comes back to them.
-Oldest story in the book.

87
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,060
Well,they split up in '83,
few months after iris died.

88
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,500
Let's have a talk. Close this job pronto.

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,720
Please have a seat.

90
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,020
We're reinvestigating your daughter's death.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,820
I don't understand.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,190
Well,certain forensics don't add up.

93
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,880
We think iris was drowned.

94
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,970
my god.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,910
-Did anyone have access to your daughter ?
-Just her father and me.

96
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,780
-Anybody have keys to the house ?
-No.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,360
I mean,the nanny and the housekeeper,but
I always dead-bolted the doors at night.

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,590
Why do that ?

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,790
Iris was premature. We thought
we'd lose her from the get-go.

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,750
She pulled through,tough little cookie.

101
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,770
-Anyway,I was very protective of her.
-Must have been rough.

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,250
no one tells you how hard it is
with kids,do they ?

103
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,460
How'd your ex-husband handle the stress ?

104
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,400
Iris was fragile. We had to be so
careful all the time.

105
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,120
His patience ran out pretty quickly.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,390
-you look beautiful.
-I look 80.

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,560
It's a hot 80.

108
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm beat,babe. I'm bone-tired.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
then stop talking.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,970
baby did you hear about that
rapist guy in mount airy ?

111
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,000
yeah,babe,let's talk about that.

112
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm sorry. My timing.

113
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,080
You locked the garage,right ?

114
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,250
-Let's go upstairs.
-Okay.

115
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,500
-but did you ?
-It's locked.

116
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,520
You're beautiful. Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

117
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,190
where are you going ?

118
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Locking these,and then I just
want to check on the baby.

119
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,080
No,no,no. No checking. She's fine.

120
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,320
-I'm just gonna peek.
-but you're not gonna peek.

121
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,430
You're gonna nudge her,you're gonna wake her,
and it's 40 minutes to get her back to bed.

122
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,910
The hospital said we should check on her...

123
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,840
but that was months ago. She's fine now.

124
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,470
-What if they're wrong ?
-Honey,please.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,580
we haven't been together
since I don't know when.

126
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,710
So let's be together.

127
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,690
great.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,000
mommy ! Mommy ! Iris is crying !

129
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,380
-Devon,go back to sleep !
-You don't have to yell at him.

130
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,840
Well,this is what I told you I didn't want.

131
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,240
What,another kid ?

132
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,010
I just wish we could go back
to the way things were.

133
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,200
We can'T. We have iris now.

134
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,930
they said we could have it all:
Family,husband,career.

135
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,880
They just didn't say how.

136
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,980
-When did this incident happen ?
-A few months before iris passed.

137
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,990
Things get any better ?

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,270
A baby's always a challenge,
even to the happiest marriages.

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,710
I kept hoping they would,but...

140
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,530
then iris died,and...what we
had kind of died with her.

141
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
You cut ties with your family pretty
fast after your daughter died.

142
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,150
Every time I looked at my wife,
I saw iris.

143
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,180
-Sure it wasn't guilt you were seein' ?
-Guilt for what ?

144
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,290
It seems like you got over the whole
thing pretty fast is all we're sayin'.

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,260
You didn't want a second child,roger.

146
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
Molly was busy with her company,so I
was the first one hke most nights.

147
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,960
I fed the kids,I bathed them.

148
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,380
Must have been hard on you.

149
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,770
It was. Iris wasn't an easy baby.

150
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,830
She'd wake up seven,eight,
nine times a night.

151
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,480
Co all I wanted was sleep.

152
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,200
maybe you were tired one night,
accidentally drop her in the tub.

153
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,690
Never ends ? The looks,questions.

154
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,080
There's no statute of limitations on murder,roger.

155
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,010
Believe me,when your child stops breathing,

156
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,720
here's no one you blame more than yourself.

157
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,710
where...where are you taking her ?

158
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,990
She needs her mobile. Don't forget to
pack her mobile for the hospital.

159
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,080
hey,buddy,why don't you go to bed ?

160
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,340
You close the door to your room.

161
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,470
I have to get her things packed.

162
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,090
-she's not going to the hospital.
-She's not ?

163
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,210
-We didn't check on her enough,roger.
-Molly,please.

164
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,130
I told you we should have checked on her more.

165
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,610
I remember how cold it was
in her room that night.

166
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,170
Because of the snowstorm.

167
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,050
No. Her window was open.

168
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,590
A window was open in the nursery ?

169
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,660
Molly was a fanatic about locking them
because iris slept on the ground floor.

170
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,590
Did you tell the cops about this ?

171
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,930
Thought it wouldn't help any.
Window doesn't explain sids.

172
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,840
We'll look into it. T
hanks for your time,mr. Felice.

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,370
Iris'd be 24 now.

174
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,620
She had molly's eyes. I bet she'd
be as beautiful as her mother.

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,340
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

176
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,420
So...when my sister died,my parents
put all her things into storage,

177
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,050
stopped talking about her.
Like she never even existed.

178
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,030
So I stole that.

179
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,410
Iris is my daughter's middle name.

180
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,060
That's nice.

181
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,170
Your bedroom was right above
the nursery,wasn't it ?

182
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,490
yeah. Why ?

183
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,700
Did you hear anything that night ?

184
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,020
I don't remember.
That was a long time ago.

185
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,240
Your parents have any trouble with the baby ?

186
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,020
After iris died,my mother
couldn't get out of bed.

187
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,760
My father wouldn't eat.

188
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,780
They wouldn't have brought this upon
themselves if that's what you're thinking.

189
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,950
Dad took off pretty fast after.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,270
Being a father myself,if I couldn't
protect my little girl,I'd run,too.

191
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,940
-Except he still had you.
-Guess he forgot.

192
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,210
Anyone else in the house at this time ?

193
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,790
My parents worked a lot,so...
there was a lot of hired help.

194
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,780
-At least one of them was...
-homicidal ?

195
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,230
The nanny marta. Didn't take
her long to traumatize us.

196
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,060
Marta ! I can't reach the mobile !

197
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,800
Marta ?  !

198
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,200
I want to play with the music mobile.

199
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,200
Are you pretending like you're in church ?

200
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,970
Close the door,devon. Come here.

201
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,440
On your knees.

202
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,660
-We're not allowed to...
-like this.

203
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,680
We're not allowed to put the baby
in the bathtub. Only daddy can.

204
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,450
We're going to make baptism.
You want one ?

205
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,730
But if you die with no baptism,
you go to hell.

206
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,860
-You do ?
-mmm.

207
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,130
We have to save your little sister.
We have to save all the little babies.

208
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,810
-let's make her an angel,yes ?
-Daddy says that's too much water.

209
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,910
it's time to pray.

210
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,040
That gave me nightmares for a while.

211
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,820
-You tell your parents ?
-No.

212
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,870
I was scared of marta,but I
guess I didn't want to lose her.

213
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,460
She was pretty intent on that baptism.

214
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,350
It seemed like it. Why ?

215
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,750
We think your sister may have been drowned.

216
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,490
I don't know if I could do it.

217
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,240
Get myself together again
if I lost veronica.

218
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,070
I don't know if I'd call the
felice family together.

219
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,570
They seemed pretty normal
till their kid died.

220
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,590
Well,you say potato,I say po-tah-to.

221
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,350
Hey,ozzie and harriet,
you done with your squabble ?

222
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,040
-I found something here.
-What ?

223
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,670
-Well,I googled.
-the future is now.

224
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,050
Found marta chavez,the felices'
housekeeper,on a webbete here.

225
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,510
Cb sids support group.

226
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,650
-She lost somody to sids
-Her son...in 1981.

227
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,890
One baby,maybe,
but two dying mysteriously ?

228
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,110
Disturbing coincidence,at best.

229
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,170
At worst,we got our murderer.

230
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,230
every year on her birthday,
I think about iris.

231
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,360
How old she would be.
What kind of things she would like.

232
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,720
The felice family know you
lost a kid of your own ?

233
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,320
No.

234
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,660
You didn't feel like you should tell 'em,
since you'd be around their baby ?

235
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,990
My son died of sids. It was not my fault.

236
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,630
That's what they said about iris.

237
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,090
My son died in his sleep and I don't
know why,and I have to live with that.

238
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,330
I know that being nice is not
a big part of your job...

239
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,220
but you could at least have the facts:
Sids is real.

240
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,880
You were trying to baptize iris in the bathtub.

241
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,930
I was crazy with grief for my son.
I wanted to keep her safe.

242
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,250
We think she was drowned.

243
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,830
Maybe you gave the baptism another shot.
Held her down too long.

244
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,460
I love children. I don't hurt them.

245
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,660
And I was in el salvador the week she died.

246
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,500
-We'll check on that.
-Go ahead.

247
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,710
And while you're at it,
look up this girl:Brie romeo.

248
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,600
-Who's that ?
-She was the nighttime babysitter.

249
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,150
Someone to watch the kids so they could go out.

250
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,610
And... ?

251
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,210
Well,first it seemed like a good idea,
but one night i stopped by the house.

252
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,140
Saw with my own eyes that girl
was not a good idea.

253
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,080
brie,it's me ! I forgot my purse.

254
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,870
brie,get up.

255
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,250
Marta. I fell.

256
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,330
What are you doing ?

257
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,230
nothing.

258
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,050
these are supposed to stay locked
like molly says.

259
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,280
Well,molly wants it like
a frickin' crypt in here.

260
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,100
You can't have your boyfriend here.

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,400
take a chill pill.
He's not my boyfriend. Yet.

262
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,800
my water tastes funny.

263
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,210
what is this green stuff ?

264
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,750
Iris's bottle is green,too.

265
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,180
Okay,back to bed. Now.

266
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,010
I gave him some cough syrup,spaz.

267
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,700
It helps the babies sleep better
so we can have adult time.

268
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,860
I am calling mrs. Felice.

269
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,070
You breathe a word of this,

270
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,870
I'll have my father,
who is a super-lawyer,

271
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,480
call immigration faster than
you can say "daddy's girl.

272
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,300
Got it,bible-thumper ? Now get.

273
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,510
and you never told the felices about this ?

274
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,070
I wanted to.

275
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,010
I thought it'd be worse for the kids

276
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,350
if brie had my ass kicked out
of the country,far from them.

277
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,200
But now,I'm a citizen so she can kiss it.

278
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,580
-Thanks,marta.
-Yeah,sure.

279
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,310
So this babysitter's drugging the kids.

280
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,400
Could have done it again the night the
baby died. Only she gave iris too much.

281
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,070
If the baby od'D...she would sweat.

282
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,950
My mom used to give me whiskey
to make me sleep.

283
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,350
I give it to my kids.
What's the big deal ?

284
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
Bet it didn't hurt you at all.

285
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,890
I didn't even give her cough syrup that night.

286
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,690
And why should we believe you,brie ?

287
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,470
Because,'cause tad broke up with me,okay ?

288
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,620
He wasn't even coming over.
I had no reason to do it.

289
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,480
You know how we can get in touch with tad ?

290
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,280
You guys are,like,out there.

291
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,430
Do you even know what was going on a
t the felice house back then ?

292
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,990
How about you fill us in ?

293
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,630
Molly may have been beautiful and smart
whatever,but she was not there for her man.

294
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,270
That your professional opinion ?

295
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Believe me. The babysitter knows
all your dirty secrets.

296
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,290
The felices had some big ones.

297
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,470
********************8

298
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,040
****************************8

299
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,980
It was a mistake. I was lonely.

300
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,410
You're a liar. You still want it.

301
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,950
-you should go.
-I can't accept that.

302
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,420
I have a family,stella.

303
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,630
Molly's changed.
You know it and I know it.

304
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,940
She's been having a hard time
the last few months. We both have.

305
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,440
All she talks about,all she
cares about are the kids.

306
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,070
Iris was premature. It scared her to death.

307
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,320
She won't even sleep with you
anymore and you're defending her ?

308
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,690
She's my wife.

309
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,510
And I'm not. That's the point.

310
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,730
This is over.

311
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,510
you have to go.

312
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,380
You don't throw me away like a
used tissue. No one does that to me.

313
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,070
hey,stella. I just...

314
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,850
...Got here.

315
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,230
Gorgeous wife. Two kids. But...

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
roger was banging the best friend.

317
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,920
Told you the family wasn't super-perfect.

318
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,310
-When did you see this ?
-A few nights before the baby died.

319
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,040
yeah. That's right.  Ray is calling.

320
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,150
-thanks,brie.
-Yep.

321
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,940
Stella sounds like the kind of
woman that wouldn't take no for an answer.

322
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah,made roger pay for kicking her to the curb.

323
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,270
what,your boyfriend can't leave a message ?

324
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,970
It's not joseph.

325
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,010
ray,I told you not to call...

326
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,990
lot of trouble to get me to see you.

327
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,990
-Hi.
-Hi.

328
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,040
I called you. A lot of times.

329
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,510
I know. I'm sorry.

330
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,640
-I should've picked up. I should've...
-I know....

331
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,780
-Believed you.
-It's all right,lil

332
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
How did it happen ?

333
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,550
Just came at me from behind.
Never saw 'em till the last minute.

334
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,890
Well,give me their names.
I'll bring them in.

335
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,260
-No
-No,seriously,I mean it.

336
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,870
-That's not why I called you.
-Okay.

337
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
Not a lot of people...

338
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,530
...nobody really,I'd want seeing me like this.

339
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,850
You've seen me like this.

340
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,330
remember when you made me a milkshake ?

341
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,170
That was all you could eat.

342
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,480
It was a busted jaw.

343
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,000
You made a mess of my mom's kitchen.

344
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,890
-It was a mess already.
-Yeah.

345
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,160
-Couple of kids ?
-Yeah.

346
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,200
Well,I owe you,ray.

347
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm gonna make this right,ray.

348
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,560
I don't want that.

349
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,260
I just want you here.

350
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,630
I'm here.

351
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,850
Bunch of bull,roger,first time around.

352
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,100
You pretend to be all broken
up about iris. Your marriage.

353
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,780
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-We're talking about stella.

354
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,090
About you banging your wife's
business partner.

355
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,690
And best friend. Class act there.

356
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,750
-It was a mistake.
-That cost your daughter her life.

357
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,120
We were so in love. Molly and I.

358
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,320
With each other and with devon.

359
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,510
-And then everything changed.
-When iris was born.

360
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,700
Molly became so distant.
It was like I lost her.

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,950
I-I just wanted what we had.

362
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,050
Tell yourself whatever you want.

363
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,200
Your daughter's dead 'cause of you.

364
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,680
You ever lose a child ?

365
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,690
What ?

366
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,210
There is nothing you can do to me
at I haven't already done to myself.

367
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,180
We heard a dirty thing about you,stella.

368
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,790
You wouldn't be the first.

369
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,940
Something about you knocking heels
with your best friend's husband ?

370
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,050
Don't mince words,do you ?

371
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,490
Pretty pissed off when roger broke it off.

372
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,520
Chose his family over you.

373
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah,woman scorned. But I got over it.

374
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,800
It was wrong to begin with.

375
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,580
Thing that's eang us is a few
days later,the baby's dead.

376
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,610
Felice family falls apart.

377
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,800
I was devastated,too. Roger and
molly were my best friends.

378
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,870
I know how that sounds.

379
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,740
I was mad at her,okay ?

380
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,710
She bailed out on me.
She was never around.

381
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,120
The company we dreamed having was dying.

382
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,190
So you slept with her husband ?

383
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,480
And that wasn't the only mistake I made.

384
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,960
-What do you mean ?
-I had a chance to stop it.

385
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,330
Stop what ?

386
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,590
Molly tried to tell me about iris.

387
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,400
And I was so caught up in that stupid
dance with roger,I couldn't even see it.

388
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,040
go. The tv spot.

389
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,620
The dynamic woman steps out of
a taxicab. She's wearing a suit.

390
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,870
she's jogging. She's wearing heels...

391
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,490
and ? Come on,molly. You're the genius.
I'm the looks.

392
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,140
Do we have to go over this every time ?

393
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,770
-molly,what's wrong ?
-it's nothing.

394
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,510
I mean...I think roger's
hiding something from me.

395
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,890
-He's just busy with work.
-I'm never there for him.

396
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,940
You know,maybe i pushed him away.

397
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm just--I'm just so tired all the time.
And the kids always need me.

398
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,860
Don't make a mountain out of a
molehill,molly. He loves you.

399
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,790
-Hey,stel,can I tell you something ?
-Sure.

400
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,520
I'M...so alone.

401
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,720
you're not alone,mol. I'm here.

402
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,530
Something's wrong with roger.

403
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,090
At night,he's in the baby's room.

404
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I hear him through the monitor
talking to himself.

405
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,700
What do you mean "talking to himself" ?

406
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,720
Stop that. Don't hurt her.
Don't hurt the baby.

407
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,750
What I gonna do,stel ?

408
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,580
Roger loves iris. You know that.

409
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,650
He'd never lay a hand on her.

410
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,880
-Yeah,I-I know.
-You must be imagining things.

411
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,030
You're right.

412
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:30,790
I haven't had much sleep.
I must have just made it all up.

413
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,590
stop that. You'll hurt her" ?

414
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,760
Sounds like roger was losing it.

415
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,050
I should've believed her,but
I was so into roger I didn't want to.

416
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,690
Molly didn't mention this to us.

417
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,700
She never wanted to see
ugliness in other people,

418
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,300
least of all the father of her children.

419
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,020
-When did this incident happen ?
-The day before.

420
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,610
The day before iris died ?

421
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,310
I know you were having problems.

422
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,390
I don't know what you're talking about...

423
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,590
wandering around the nursery in the
middle of the night,talking to yourself.

424
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,660
Don't hurt her.

425
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,730
How could you know that ?

426
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,250
Your ex-wife...
heard you on the baby monitor.

427
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,930
-Why can't you let this rest ?
-'Cause a little kid died.

428
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,910
And that was bad enough.

429
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,320
Let us be. Please.

430
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,510
I can'T.

431
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,920
It was an accident.

432
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,480
Go on.

433
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,240
If I'd been around more,

434
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,600
spent time with my kids,maybe
none of this would've happened.

435
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,420
What do you mean if you'd have
spent more time with your kids ?

436
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,650
He was just a little boy. He
didn't know what he was doing.

437
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,160
Don't put him in jail,please.

438
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,910
Devon ? What did he do ?

439
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,730
He went to the nursery at night.
He was just worrd about her.

440
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,790
Hly what happened the night she died ?

441
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,130
hey,dev. What did I tell you ?

442
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,480
To leave the baby alone at night.

443
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,990
that's right,pal.

444
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,630
'Cause when you come in here
and poke her,it hurts her.

445
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,990
what if she needs baptism ?

446
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,840
she's okay,buddy.

447
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,300
but...daddy...she's not breathing.

448
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,820
iris ? sweetie ?

449
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
devon,why is she wet ?

450
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,060
Iris ? Iris,wake up.

451
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,760
Iris ? iris,wake up.

452
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,690
Wake up.

453
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,740
come on. Wake up.

454
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,250
Wake up.

455
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,660
Iris. come on,baby. Come on. Wake up.

456
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,920
Wake up,baby.

457
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,750
Daddy,did I hurt the baby ?

458
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,170
No,no,no. No,she'S...

459
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,420
she's fine. She's gonna be just fine.

460
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,570
devon was a high-strung kid.

461
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,760
I should've gotten him help.

462
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,920
He was scared because of what marta said.

463
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,040
-What're you going to do to him ?
-I don't know.

464
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,740
Arrest me.

465
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,910
He's got a life.
You can't take that away from him.

466
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,800
I can't do that,mr. Felice.
You know that.

467
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,560
He didn't mean it.

468
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,300
Did you tell molly what happened that night ?

469
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,380
I lied. And I had devon lie.

470
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,830
I thought it would save us.
But it destroyed us.

471
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,730
Go ahead. I'll be up in a minute.

472
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,750
-We need you to come in with us.
-Why ?

473
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,060
We talked to your father,devon.

474
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,610
What did he tell you ?

475
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,780
Why don't you come with us ?

476
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,040
He told you about me.

477
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,420
That's okay. It's okay. It's good.

478
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,460
'Cause it's out. 'Cause I can't
live like this anymore.

479
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,570
I can't hold my baby.
I've never picked her up,not once.

480
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,690
My hands...

481
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,060
I'm responsible for what happened to iris.

482
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,560
Tell us what happened that night.

483
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,020
I wanted to baptize her,but I...
I must have let her drown.

484
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,890
You don't remember ?

485
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,220
Not really. But I must have,right ?

486
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,830
What do you remember ?

487
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,270
Being in the nursery.
The mobile's playing. It's cold.

488
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,590
But you couldn't reach the mobile.

489
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,500
So who turned it on ?

490
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,410
Someone was in the room before you.

491
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,000
No,I don't remember that.

492
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,300
Some memories are too painful to remember.

493
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,610
Especially for children.

494
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,640
But I remember putting her in the bath.

495
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,000
You just said you didn'T.

496
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,850
-What do you want from me ?
-The truth.

497
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,590
I'm telling you the truth.

498
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,210
Maybe what you think is the truth is
less painful than what really happened.

499
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,040
I didn'T...I didn't give her the bath.

500
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,070
Why not ?

501
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,250
Because my mom was there.

502
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,270
I'm so sorry,baby. I'm so sorry
I can't protect you.

503
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,910
Mommy ?

504
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,750
The world's such a dangerous place
for a baby. And I'm not a good mother.

505
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,110
It's me. I'm what's wrong.

506
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,210
Mommy ?

507
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,250
Give us a kiss good-bye,dev.

508
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,920
Where are you going,mommy ?

509
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,310
Don't cry,okay,sweetheart ?
Be mommy' strong little man.

510
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,780
Okay.

511
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,200
-I love you so much,dev.
-Me,too,mommy.

512
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,240
Good-bye.

513
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,500
I thought I was never gonna see her again.

514
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,760
Because she wanted to die,too.

515
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,280
Thank you,devon.

516
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,670
This is crazy,but the worst part is
that she didn't want me with her.

517
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,480
She wanted to leave me behind.

518
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,440
She was in pain,devon.

519
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,410
She wanted better for you.

520
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,580
I come in here sometimes.

521
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,640
To think about iris,time to time ?

522
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,130
More like every moment of every day.

523
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,370
Do you really ? Think about it,I mean ?

524
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,190
When my mom was 25,
she already had two kids.

525
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,080
No money,tiny,dirty place we called home.

526
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,590
She was on her own ?

527
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,450
You know,one time,i remember she brought
out all this food from the cabinets,

528
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,450
put it out like we were having a party,

529
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,170
then she left us,

530
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,380
locked the doors for...two days.

531
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,150
that's A...that's a terrible
thing to do to a child.

532
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,410
Well,it was better than the alternative.

533
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,360
What she mightave done,
if she hadn't left.

534
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,000
It's hard having kids,
and nobody tells you that.

535
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,650
No,they don't.

536
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,330
Or all the terrible things that
can happen to a baby.

537
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,580
-You know,as a cop,I've seen things...
-please,stop.

538
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,040
you saw them,too,didn't you ?
Those terrible things.

539
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,670
I don't know what you mean.

540
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,980
Locking the windows,the doors.
You tried to shut out the danger.

541
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,310
I was prective because iris was premature.

542
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,760
You imagined all the things that
could happen to iris so often,

543
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,740
you started to believe you
wanted them to happen.

544
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
-That's the sickness.
-No !

545
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,840
That's the sickness.
It's postpartum psychosis.

546
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,930
No.

547
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,550
It must be unbearable,
he fear of yourself,especially.

548
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,430
I don't know what happened to iris.

549
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,110
You have spent the last 24 years
trying to forget,but you know.

550
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,270
The snow. It snowed that night,
remember ?

551
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,810
I thought it was a sign. The snow.

552
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,930
A sign of what ?

553
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,850
It snowed the night that she was born.

554
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,520
And I thought she'd go back
to where she came from.

555
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,760
A better place than with me.

556
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,420
mommy's right here,baby.
Right here with you.

557
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,110
Go to sleep now.

558
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,700
Mommy ! Mommy !

559
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,540
Iris ? Iris ?

560
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,270
My little girl. Iris ?

561
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,710
baby. Iris ?

562
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,530
Baby,come on. I'm sorry.

563
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,060
Iris ? my baby !

564
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,610
Iris ?

565
