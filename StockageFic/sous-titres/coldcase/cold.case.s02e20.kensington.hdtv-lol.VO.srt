00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:03,273
Doing that was harder 
than you'll ever know.

on around here that I need to put an end to.

You all know how the 
non-union factories in the south

141
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,523
are running our mills 
out of business.

142
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,460
I heard you're gonna 
retire some old timers.

143
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,202
You could lay some of us off too.

144
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,516
Not retiring anybody, Butch.

145
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,726
But with the peanut wage 
they're paying in the south,

146
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,421
we're being undersold, 
out-produced.

147
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,375
Mean you're gonna 
cut back our hours?

148
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,784
I'm not saying that either.

149
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,337
Then Mr. Johnstone.

150
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:18,883
I know one thing they're 
not doing down south.

151
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,062
Is making better carpets 
than we are.

152
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,682

153
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:27,237

154
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:29,732

155
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,401
Look, I know you all.

156
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:36,085

weavers, yarn men.

157
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,292
None of you are going anywhere.

158
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,364

I'm staying right here in Kensington.

160
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:45,393

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,853
How does that work?

173
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,261
I wasn't supposed to but I was 
extending credits to almost everyone.

174
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,781
So in the end?

175
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:32,261
I was broke too.

176
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,434
When I was pregnant 
I couldn't sleep at night.

177
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,397
So Joe would drive us 
out to look at the stars.

178
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,893
Sounds like nice times.

179
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,111
So where is your son?

180
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,634
In Iowa.

181
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,007
At school.

182
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,739
He wants to be a writer.

183
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,912
Mary, thinking back...

184
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:58,254
Did you know anyone 
who wanted to hurt Joe?

185
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,437
Everyone loved Joe.

186
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,306
Wanted to be 
around him not hut him.

187
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,940
You did hit some 
pretty hard times, though?

188
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,881
Oh, for sure. 
We couldn't pay our bills.

189
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,966
Lived off macaroni and bologna.

190
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,586
And what about Joe?

191
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,258
When that mill closed?

192
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,898
You see any change in him?

193
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:14,210
Yeah.

194
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,576
But not the one you'd think.

195
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,615
I drove out as soon 
as I heard the news.

196
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,668
Found Joe in a good mood.

197
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,381
Joe, I just heard.

198
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,291
It's okay, it's okay. 
Monty's come to the rescue.

199
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,160
Yep.

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,068
Monty's got this cap company idea and 
he's been yapping about it for years.

201
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,627
Idea's a winner, Hon.

202
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:39,524
Monty says the word, we're all set 
to go on a business together.

203
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,855
All three of you?

204
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:44,081
Monty's got the ideas and 
I got a car we can use.

205
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:47,425
If everything's so rosy, why are 
you looking so spooked, Monty?

206
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:49,433
A lot has to go right.

207
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:53,294
Starting with the hack up fee for 
converting Butchie's car into a taxi.

208
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,347
We're gonna need 
a down payment.

209
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,184
- By tomorrow.
- How much?

210
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,757
Eleven hundred.

211
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:07,488
I told him that you and me got 1,200 dollars 
in savings that we've been wanting to invest.

212
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:09,981
What do you think?

213
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,445
You really think this can work?

214
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:12,535
It'd better work.

215
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,710
Monty's Plan B is to go 
rip off Johnstone's house.

216
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,993
Hon, Monty's done his homework.

217
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,578
He's just afraid to pull the trigger.

218
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:21,580
Yeah, like always.

219
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,723
Well, you have Joe's vote, 
you have mine.

220
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,430
Monty, you decide you 
want to shake on this.

221
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,296
I'm willing.

222
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,585
But in the end that taxi business 
never got off the ground.

223
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:57,625
How come?

224
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,574
Joe told me it was his fault.

225
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:03,478
Said he messed up on the payments...
something about not reading the fine print.

226
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,475
That must've been a big blow.

227
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,465
How did Monty and Butch take it?

228
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,828
Bad.

229
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:11,403
I think they really hated 
him for screwing up.

230
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:12,961
Why do you say that?

231
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,749
The summer my Joe died,

232
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:19,474
everyone we knew walked the streets 
of Kensington behind his casket.

233
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:23,728
Everyone that is, 
except his two best friends.

234
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,695
Lily Rush?

235
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,153
Who are you?

236
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,452
Mark Phillips.

237
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,075
NYPD.

238
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,455
I'm gonna have to come in.

239
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,942
Uh, I don't think so.

240
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,868
It's about your sister Christina.

241
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:54,571
- What about her?
- I'm looking for her.

242
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,947
Why?

243
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,022
'Cause I'm looking for her.

244
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,836
Mind if I come in now?

245
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:05,950
I understand I'm making 
you a little nervous,

246
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,814
But, it will behoove you and 
your sister if you cooperate.

247
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,061
Behoove us, huh?

248
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,023
See,

249
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:17,669
this little guy knows 
there's nothing to be afraid of.

250
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,966
Look, I can't help you.

251
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:29,079
You got a permit for that?

252
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,004
Yeah, same one you got.

253
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,042
I work homocide, Philly PD.

254
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,423
You could've offered that up.

255
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:41,333
Well, you could've asked.

256
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,892
So, 'detective'.

257
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,304
Are you gonna tell me 
where your sister is or what?

258
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,090
You gonna tell me 
what this is about?

259
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,736
No can do.

260
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,502
Me neither.

261
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,520
I know you must've sworn 
an oath to uphold the law.

262
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,314
Same as you.

263
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,110
Right.

264
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,436
But sometimes, with family...

265
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,164
I know what I gotta do.

266
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,795
Those climbing spikes are pretty bad ass.

267
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,492
More like a pain in my ass.

268
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,595
I'm not cut out for this.

269
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,375
Not to mention too old.

270
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,837
So, Monty.

271
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,576
I'm looking back at Joe's murder.

272
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,813
Wasn't robbery?

273
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,353
We got a new angle 
from James Hogan.

274
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,726
Joe's nephew?

275
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,906
Oh yeah, I remember 
that kid from Joe's wedding.

276
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,682
Back when you were on better terms?

277
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,988
- What do you mean?
- You and Joe at the wedding.

278
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,937
Word is you were a no-show 
for his funeral.

279
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:45,819
Yeah, right.

280
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:47,365
You wanna tell me why?

281
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:48,850
Not particularly.

282
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,119
Joe's wife thinks it was over 
a taxi service idea that didn't fly.

283
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,053
That have anything to do with it?

284
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:57,951
Yeah.

285
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,157
Everything.

286
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,985
Hey, Joe.

287
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,639
Here you go, last check.

288
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,510
That means, me too.

289
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,173
Any jobs come in?

290
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,883
And don't start talking about 
any of that training stuff either.

291
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,888
There is one new listing.

292
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:17,968
- What's it for?
- A constable.

293
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:20,553
What the hell's that?

294
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,910
Serving eviction notices?

295
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,357
Oh, thank you.

296
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:29,431
You see me doing that, take a ball 
peen hammer to the back of my head.

297
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,497
Where have you been, huh?

298
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,919
We got a boatload of stuff to do.

299
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,970
I was telling Butch,

300
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,452
if everything goes right we can 
be running fares by top of next week.

301
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,885
What?

302
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,240
I got bad news.

303
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,495
And good.
I guess.

304
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,348
Spill it.

305
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,022
My Uncle Samuel said he would make 
room for me at his shoe repair shop.

306
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:53,095
No way.

307
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,308
No way. 
You're not chickening out.

308
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,886
I already started.

309
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,670
This morning.

310
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,716
Monty, everything's riding on this.

311
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:02,354
It's bone dry out there.

312
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:08,205
- Guys, I got a family to feed.
- We all do.

313
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,533
Joe's gonna lose 
his twelve hundred.

314
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,561
Mary's having the baby 
next month, I gotta have cash!

315
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:18,556
Screw your chicken ass outta here.

316
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,115
I would,

317
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:23,557
I need my check.

318
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,765
I'm gonna come back,

319
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,721
I'm gonna burn this place down!

320
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,796
Butch was the one 
who did all the yelling.

321
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:48,659
But Joe's silence,

322
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,609
that's what said the most.

323
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,519
It was the end of your friendship.

324
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,418
When he died,

325
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,384
I knew he wouldn't have 
wanted me at his funeral.

326
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,295
I had to respect that.

327
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,645
What about you and Butch?

328
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,518
Can't say that, uh-

329
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,123
he was all that forgiving either.

330
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,685
Okay, Monty.
That's all for now.

331
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:14,077
Guess I'm going up now.

332
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,204
Butch is here. The other 
missing friend at Joe's funeral.

333
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,883
Rush, your boyfriend.

334
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,035
Again.

335
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,483
Why don't you go tie that up. 
Nick and I can talk to Butch.

336
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,942
Hello?

337
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,915
It's me.

338
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:43,553
James, there's boundries I have to keep. 
That goes for the letters, and the phone.

339
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:47,327
I just, I forgot to ask you 
something when you were here.

340
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,170
Okay.

341
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,341
Who hurt you?

342
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:54,406
What?

343
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:56,950
You seem different than a year ago.

344
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,925
I'm not.

345
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:01,002
Yeah, you are.

346
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,930
Look, James. 
We can't do this.

347
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,813
So, did you find anything 
about my uncle's murder?

348
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,202
Ah, we're just now 
tracking down his pals.

349
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,917
Monty?

350
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:13,861
Yeah.

351
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,089
You know him?

352
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:18,388
Yeah, when I was fourteen Joe and 
Monty showed me around the mill.

353
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:20,588
I thought it was neat but,

354
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,397
Monty said not to be like him.

355
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:24,624
Said he was born in the mills, 
was going to die in the mills.

356
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:27,974
Said I'd be happier 
if I kept my nose in the books.

357
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,704
Probably should've took his advice.

358
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,981
Alright, James. I have to run.

359
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:39,755
Last year at the train stop?

360
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:44,603
You said you were my girl?

361
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:47,073
I know.

362
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:50,540
Was that just a trick?

363
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:53,131
No.

364
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,977
So what'd you mean by that?

365
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:59,318
That we were friends, James.

366
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:02,040
But that's all.

367
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:09,371
Your hearts good, 
you know that?

368
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:14,394
And if it's not going to be me,

369
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:18,230
I hope you find someone you can talk to.

370
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,634
That's the one.

371
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,444
Sharp looking shirt, Butch.

372
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:38,158
Thanks.
Always loved Italian fabrics.

373
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,774
Just could never afford'em.

374
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:41,103
So, Butch.

375
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:44,801
We hear Monty blew 
your cabbie deal.

376
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,844
He sure did.

377
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:51,327
Which put him on 
the outs with you and Joe.

378
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,608
True.

379
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,403
Monty says 'out of respect'.

380
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,550
That's why he chose not 
to go to Joe's funeral.

381
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,622
I can see that.

382
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,512
So what about you?

383
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,796
Pretty opposite for me.

384
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,068
Meaning you lost respect for Joe?

385
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:09,599
He turned out to be
a bigger fink than Monty!

386
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,589
What he did to my sister!

387
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:16,304
Janie! Hey!

388
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,025
What the hell's goin' on?

389
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,909
Janie!

390
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,816
Janie, what's goin' on?

391
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:30,443
We fell behind on rent.

392
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:31,899
Joe, what are you doin' here?

393
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,407
He's the one's who's evicting us.

394
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,801
What?

395
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:39,734
I know, I'm scum, I'm sorry.

396
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,159
You're sorry?

397
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,566
I took that job.

398
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:45,197
Tell me you're putting 
a joke on me, Joe.

399
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:49,039
Butch, my wife can't buy bread,
soap, noodles.

400
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,841
Neither can my wife.

401
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:54,691
But I'm out there, and 
I am pounding the pavement.

402
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:57,361
Looking for something decent to do.

403
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,705
The baby's doctor bills...

404
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,676
Get your ass out of here, Joe!

405
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:20,107
- Tom, Tom.
- No, Tom!

406
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,093
- Where's my Winchester?
- In the pantry.

407
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:36,092
So Joe was ousting 
your sister and her husband.

408
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:39,653
You can see why I wasn't 
that interested in going to his funeral.

409
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,683
So did your 
brother-in-law get evicted?

410
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:45,838
Out on the street, that night.

411
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:48,166
Man's home is his castle.

412
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,376
Take it from him.

413
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:52,461
You got a pissed off king.

414
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,421
Thirty five years, 
I never had a problem.

415
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,346
And then the mills closed.

416
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:04,968
Then I went in a dumper 
like everyone else.

417
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,603
But not everyone else 
threatened Joe with a Winchester.

418
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:13,454
That, plus two months 
you did at overbook hospital.

419
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,252
Makes us worry you 
did something rash.

420
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,772
I didn't.

421
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,579
- I swear it.
- But you were having moods?

422
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:25,445
One day I'd want to shoot you,

423
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:30,458
the next day I was sobbing in my car listening 
to David Lee Roth singing 'California Girls'.

424
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,062
They give you something for that?

425
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:34,925
Yeah.

426
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,085
Take the meds regular.

427
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,325
Keeps me even keel.

428
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:42,055
So, you ever see Joe again?

429
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:43,482
After the eviction?

430
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:44,618
Sure.

431
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:45,887
Every Wednesday.

432
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:46,919
What was Wednesdays?

433
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,269
We had a regular poker game.

434
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:51,228
You wanna kill Joe but 
you play cards with him?

435
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:54,394
Everyone there, had 
a reason to hate someone else.

436
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,230
Me, Ham, all the guys.

437
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,509
But that was our life.

438
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,200
We were the only people we knew.

439
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:05,929
All that bad blood in one room?

440
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,937
That ever get ugly?

441
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,349
Game took on a whole new tone.

442
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,371
Heard your shoe job
was a bust, Monty.

443
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,735
Store closed. I'm on the street,
same as you guys.

444
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:20,617
Yeah, but not Joe.

445
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,167
He's a constable.

446
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,510
You know I quit that racket.

447
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,843
You in or out?

448
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:26,942
I fold.

449
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,978
Yeah, of course you do.

450
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:31,695
Me and you, Ham.

451
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,576
I see your two dollars,

452
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:41,416
and uh,

453
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:42,980
I raise a hundred.

454
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,740
Hey, this is dime-ante game.

455
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,576
Don't go flashing 
your money around.

456
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:50,857
I ain't flashing. 
I got troubles, too.

457
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,407
And we never made 
a rule about limits.

458
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,978
I've got 30 bucks upstairs 
on my dresser.

459
00:24:56,978 --> 00:25:00,323
- Thirty ain't a hundred.
- how much you guys got?

460
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:02,404
What, you wanna get bankrolled?

461
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,641
Go ahead.

462
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:05,405
We win, we split it three ways.

463
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:08,553
I, I, I got uh- thirty plus Joe's...
we need forty more.

464
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:11,003
This was supposed 
to last till next friday.

465
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,519
Not that it ever does.

466
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,786
You owe a lot of credits at the store.

467
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:15,067
Yeah, I know I do!

468
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,188
Alright? Stop talking about it!

469
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:20,641
What do you say, Butch?

470
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,383
Alright, fine. Forty.

471
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,526
Plus upstairs, makes a hundred.

472
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,305
Call.

473
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,969
Flush.

474
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,060
Jack high.

475
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,180
Full boat.

476
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,131
Sevens and threes.

477
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:47,030
No, No, No way!

478
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,090
Put your hands 
off the money, Ham!

479
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,248
You cheated!

480
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,461
That's a conspiracy!

481
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:52,857
Conspiracy?

482
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:56,072
Yeah! 'Cause I'm the 
only one that's got a job!

483
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,594
I want my money back.

484
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:04,017
No!

485
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:07,098
You're a goner, Joe!

486
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,058
Mark that!

487
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:15,397
Following weekend,

488
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:18,060
Joe was dead.

489
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:21,185
You think that was 
a real threat from Ham?

490
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,249
It was desperate times.

491
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,634
None of us were ourselves.

492
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,213
Hi.

493
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,811
Hi.

494
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,623
So what was so urgent?

495
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:40,171
There's a New York detective 
Phillips, looking for you.

496
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:42,291
Why?

497
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,232
You tell me.

498
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:46,421
I don't know.

499
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:51,076
Chris, I made some calls,
I'm hearing credit card fraud.

500
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,914
- It wasn't me.
- No?

501
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,791
It was my boss.

502
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,376
At the flower shop 
where I worked in SoHo.

503
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:01,573
The owner Greg had a scam.

504
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:04,626
So is Greg the dangerous 
New York guy?

505
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:09,507
Actually I don't wanna know. 
I'm just passing on information.

506
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,795
So what did you tell him?

507
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:14,316
This detective.

508
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:15,551
Nothing.

509
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,387
Lil, what should I do?

510
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,714
Whatever you want.

511
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:24,438
I just don't want any more early 
morning visits from the NYPD, okay?

512
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:32,318
Ham.

513
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,211
You pushed Joe 
into making that bet.

514
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,438
Then whined about wanting 
your money back when you lost.

515
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:39,041
I don't feel bad about that.

516
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,623
He owed me money.

517
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:42,018
They all did.

518
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:44,234
I told you that.
He owed.

519
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,619
Which still bugs you to this day.

520
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,288
- So?
- So?

521
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:52,255
That brings us to you 
having motive, to kill Joe.

522
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,716
You know, maybe 
I should just muzzle myself.

523
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,657
Yeah, do that.
But you're coming with us.

524
00:27:57,657 --> 00:28:00,630
Oh, have a heart!
I'm just breathing the air again.

525
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,283
You'd better give us a reason 
to believe you didn't hunt Joe down.

526
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,022
I can give you a reason.

527
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,537
I just don't wanna.

528
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,651
Why not?

529
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:13,585
Because,

530
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,485
it's embarrassing.

531
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,257
- Patty?
- I want my money back.

532
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:28,332
- What money?
- From poker, Joe cheated!

533
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,000
Joe would never cheat!

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,567
Oh, that's right. Joe the saint 
he'd never do anything wrong.

535
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:38,470
- Pat, let's just go.
- You want our gas shut off tomorrow?

536
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:39,902
You'd better get Joe.

537
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:42,005
'Cause we're not leaving.

538
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,883
What the hell's goin' on, Ham?

539
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:49,141
We need that hundred back.

540
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,921
- A hundred?
- Yes.

541
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:53,733
No, no. That's ours now. 
My baby needs his shots this week.

542
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,204
Jenny's plugging the holes
in her keds with cardboard

543
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:58,328
and Micheal needs his workbooks.

544
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:01,725
You'd better tell your wife here and 
now I didn't cheat anybody, Ham.

545
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:05,977
Did he or didn't he?

546
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:12,485
Ham, answer me.

547
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:17,105
Oh, crap.

548
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,692
Crap.

549
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:24,515
You should've quit the mill when 
Ham told you about the contracts.

550
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,155
Told me what?

551
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:28,479
Well, not in so many words but...

552
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,974
Look, Joe I knew 
Johnstone was selling.

553
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:33,261
In his office I saw the paper work.

554
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,488
When?

555
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:37,716
The day before 
he made his big speech.

556
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:39,783
Saying Johnstone lied that day?

557
00:29:39,783 --> 00:29:42,201
To all of us guys?

558
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,077
Without so much as a flinch.

559
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:51,512
Think it's time for Plan B.

560
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,443
He looked like someone 
had hit him in the gut.

561
00:29:57,443 --> 00:30:00,390
Becuase Johnstone 
had betrayed him?

562
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,571
If Joe had one fault, it's that he trusted 
people when they gave their word.

563
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:09,265
Never crossed his mind 
the boss man would lie.

564
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,015
You know what Plan B was?

565
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:14,614
Nah.

566
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,582
I do.

567
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,827
I got nothing to hide.

568
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:27,866
Then let's talk about Plan B.

569
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,020
I don't know what that is.

570
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,323
Butch, we know about the robbery.

571
00:30:32,323 --> 00:30:36,038
That you and Monty and Joe were 
planning to stick it to Johnstone.

572
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,412
So maybe we talked about a plan.

573
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:41,874
Guys can talk.

574
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,072
We also checked 
police logs from '85.

575
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:46,029
Joe's truck was seen in the area.

576
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,904
Neighbor of Johnstone called it in.

577
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:49,685
Two guys in a cab with him.

578
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,054
Got a feeling one of'em was you.

579
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,114
We get why you're lying.

580
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:57,459
Admitting you did the robbery would 
put you with Joe at the night of the murder.

581
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:01,412
But if that's all you did, 
a robbery 20 years ago.

582
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,425
You don't have much to worry about.

583
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,195
- No?
- No.

584
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:08,476
But you gotta talk, Butch.

585
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:13,464
Maybe we trespassed.

586
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:14,880
Trespassed?

587
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,532
Nothing more.

588
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:20,485
519 college.

589
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,867
This is it.

590
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:25,028
I know there's 
a Hi-Fi Pioneer turntable, receiver,

591
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,915
speakers that gotta be worth a grand.

592
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:28,823
That's two mortgage 
payments right there.

593
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,660
I'll hit the bedroom, 
get whatever jewelry they've got.

594
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,198
You said there was a china cabinet?

595
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:38,124
First room on the left.

596
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:42,016
Mary's never had 
a nice set of dishes.

597
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,440
Oh, man...

598
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,901
- What?
- I don't know about this.

599
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,946
Hey! Don't start pulling 
that crap, chicken man.

600
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,686
It's unlocked.

601
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:57,318
Ok, let's spread out.

602
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:04,111
- Oh, no...
- What?

603
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:08,843
He's gone.

604
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:11,007
Son of a bitch!

605
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,927
- Keep it down!
- Why?

606
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:15,319
What's it matter now?

607
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,865
He's right, Monty.

608
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,935
Who the hell cares? 
There's not a thing here.

609
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:25,234
Which makes me the biggest turkey in town 
because I believed everything he said!

610
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,702
Damn it!

611
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:30,257
Hey!

612
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:32,307
That's gotta be worth something.

613
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,587
- How do we get it down?- We'll pull it.

614
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:39,660
Alright, boost me up.

615
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:02,169
He promised he'd 
stay at Kensington.

616
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,490
Promised to keep the mill open.

617
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,699
Trying to steal a light fixture.

618
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:11,644
It's pitiful.

619
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:18,449
Monty and me went off drinking.

620
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:21,320
That's the last
we ever saw of joe.

621
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,726
And that's your story?

622
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,130
Yeah.

623
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,490
Then Monty will
say the same thing?

624
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,557
To the letter.

625
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:33,815
Monty's wife called.

626
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:37,360
She found a note from 
him on their kitchen table.

627
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,820
Said he was going off to die.

628
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:43,771
Not exactly a road map.

629
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:47,417
Where does a guy 
like Monty go to end it?

630
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,826
Live and die in the mills.

631
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:51,992
What was that?

632
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:56,606
When I was on the phone with 
James that's what Monty said he'd do.

633
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,408
Easy does it there, Monty.

634
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,128
I'm not doing nothing.

635
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:28,836
Show us what you 
got in your hands.

636
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:34,176
Double edge serrated blade?

637
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:36,725
Guess we found our murder weapon.

638
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:38,709
Wanna dry shave, son?

639
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,200
Come on! Stay with us, Monty!

640
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:43,470
I'm with ya.

641
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,961
Just something we 
used to say to each other.

642
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,278
goofing around.

643
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:52,309
Who? You and Joe?

644
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:57,946
What do you say we talk about him?

645
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:02,007
Last thing I wanna do.

646
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:04,257
So let's talk about Butch.

647
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,532
All these years... 
you're still tight.

648
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:11,081
- Not really.
- No?

649
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,257
Why is that?

650
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,910
He's a ghost.

651
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,566
Reminder from my past.

652
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,794
Just like this place is.

653
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,599
Must've fixed this very loom 
say, dozen times.

654
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,816
You were hard working.

655
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,206
I respect that.

656
00:35:32,206 --> 00:35:34,065
I was tedious more than anything.

657
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,867
More so for the guy
who has dreams.

658
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,985
Yeah, everybody says,
have 'em, but, uh,

659
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:43,778
But uh, when they don't pan up,

660
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:46,594
that's a whole other story, right?

661
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:50,690
Pretty sure having 
dreams is my curse.

662
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:54,172
See, I could fix a loom.

663
00:35:54,172 --> 00:35:56,984
Weave as well as weavers.

664
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:00,833
It was a good life.

665
00:36:01,781 --> 00:36:04,914
For all of us.

666
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:17,113
Wish I could've been like Joe.

667
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,001
He was content.

668
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:22,904
- But you weren't.
- No.

669
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:25,432
You know Joe told me 
that was a good thing.

670
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,791
He said dreaming up stuff, 
that was my gift.

671
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:31,456
But you put a dreamer and 
a chicken in a same body and

672
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,593
mister, you've got problems.

673
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:35,399
No, Monty!

674
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,441
Don't take the easy way.

675
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:41,332
No! It's the perfect way!

676
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,757
I have been a bawking chicken
my whole life.

677
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:45,659
Than do it!

678
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,802
I wanna see.

679
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:52,946
No more. 
I wanna witness it.

680
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,179
You wanna watch me kill myself?

681
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,190
No joke, Monty. I wanna see.

682
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,159
That, last step.

683
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,120
Off of the bridge.

684
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:06,145
Knowing you won't be 
in this world anymore.

685
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,423
Why?

686
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,811
'Cause the ones you leave behind.

687
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,748
There's so many questions.

688
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:17,013
If I watch you,

689
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:18,704
maybe I'll be able 
to help to your people.

690
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,055
Well, I don't want you 
to help my family!

691
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,602
That is for me to do.

692
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:24,448
But you gotta choose, Monty.

693
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:26,379
It's up to you.

694
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,903
Hey,

695
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,355
that's the right thing.

696
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,720
Chicken thing you mean?

697
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,615
No.

698
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,156
You're facing up.

699
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:13,924
And now the rest, Monty.

700
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:20,052
Talk about that last night 
with Joe and Butch.

701
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:26,346
It was the one time I wasn't chicken.

702
00:38:27,854 --> 00:38:31,658
ended up being the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

703
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,741
- Where're you going?
- I go pay. I'm up.

704
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:57,389
I got it.

705
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:00,895
My money not 
good enough for you?

706
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:07,943
We both know you don't 
have five dollars to spare.

707
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,693
Oh, you do, huh?

708
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:12,161
Let's not any of us be heroes.

709
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:15,169
We split it three ways.

710
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,175
Show me.

711
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,598
You got money? Let's see it.

712
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:26,047
Up yours, Monty.

713
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:29,129
Forget it. It's my truck, I'm paying.

714
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,228
Yeah, you too, straw boss!

715
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,322
Up yours, too.

716
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:35,116
- Come again?
- Oh, you heard me.

717
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,811
What, you think just because you got 
that job now you walk taller than me?

718
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,001
Johnstone never hired on that job.

719
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,267
The mill closed first.

720
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,375
Yeah, but you knew 
you had it in the bag,

721
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,544
and so while none of us even got
two nickels to put together,

722
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,133
you had that knowledge, right?

723
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,633
No! No, that job was 
still up for grabs.

724
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,511
My ass it was up for grabs!

725
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:56,287
Monty pulled out of that job 
because he knew that it was yours.

726
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:57,759
I never pulled out of no job.

727
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,835
You pulled out of everything!

728
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:01,776
What's it matter!

729
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:04,757
We're fighting over something 
that doesn't even exist!

730
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:06,522
Which means what?

731
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:10,984
Which means that you think 
that having a bunch of big ideas

732
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:14,395
and no guts is 
gonna feed your family?

733
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,258
You better press rewind
right now!

734
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:17,665
What?

735
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:27,053
Monty! Monty, put that thing away!

736
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:29,724
Straw boss is right.

737
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:32,410
Put it down.
You look like a jackass.

738
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,953
I'll cut that lippy 
tongue out of your mouth!

739
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:37,543
Please! Do it, do it! Come on!

740
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:40,118
For once, do 
something great! Do it!

741
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:42,554
Guys, guys. 
We can't blow up!

742
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:45,082
We gotta hang together.

743
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:47,267
Right?

744
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:07,515
