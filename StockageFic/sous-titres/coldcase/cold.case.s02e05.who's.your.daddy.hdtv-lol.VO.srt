You know about Ebay, right?

33
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:00,574
Vaguely.

34
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,873
Cause I was foolin' around 
looking for some textbooks,

35
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,702
when I came across this.

36
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:06,977
It was my mother's bracelet.

37
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:07,933
Okay.

38
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,743
I'm wearing at here.

39
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,425
That was few days before 
my parents were killed.

40
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:16,607
- When was that?
- July, '91.

41
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,567
- I called it in.
- You were there?

42
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,608
In the neighborhood.

43
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,396
And your connection to Kara is?

44
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:22,408
Friend.

45
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:24,015
They were shot in a home invasion.

46
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:26,416
I was too young at the time to know 
what got stollen but now,

47
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,026
I remember this bracelet.

48
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,395
And you think whoever killed 
your parents stole it that night?

49
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,432
Maybe if you find the Ebay dealer 
then you can trace how he got it.

50
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:34,662
It's a good thinking.

51

55
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,136
Nah, I live with my own uncle.

56
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,701
He hangs with me 
at the restaurant.

never talk about'em.

Summer of '91, 
the height of the crack boom.

80
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,279
And home invasions.

81
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,260
Theory at the time was 
robbery gone wrong.

82
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,984
Doer enters, thinks no one will be there, 
panics, and then kills the couple.

Yeah, an architect and a dancer.

89
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:24,965
Says here that he worked in construction 
and she was a seamstress.

90
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,892
Tracked down that Ebay dealer.

91
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:30,001
Says that he bought the 
bracelet off a widow named, ah..

92
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,390
- Wilma Whiting, couple of weeks ago.
- She got a record?

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,275
No, but her son's doing time up 
at Frackville for a burglary in '92.

94
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,327
So, maybe he gave 
her the bracelet?

95
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:41,029
Vera and Jeffries are at Frackville 
on Sherman's job now,

96
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,610
they can pay him a visit.

97
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,345
This Daryl Booker, came in with Kara, 
he wasn't just a 911 caller.

98
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,661
He was also a suspect.

99
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,756
Along with half the crackheads in Kensington.

100
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:53,937
But half the crackheads in Kensington 
aren't maintaining a relationship

101
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,411
- with the victim's daughter.
- What kind of relationship?

102
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:59,268
50-year-old guy hanging 
with a pretty 18-year-old?

103
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,308
What do you think?

104
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:01,668
Good Samaritan.

105
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,216
College advisor?

106
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,595
Ha, I bet a lot it's 
something less high-minded.

110
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,208
So what's the theory?

111
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,600
What do you got me pegged as?

112
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
Kara's pimp?

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,192
The sugar daddy?

114
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,881
Black mambo?

115
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,635
We need you to fill us in on 
some missing pieces, Booker.

116
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,058

117
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:37,791
Well, it turns out that the 
bracelet was solid gold.

the killer must've had some

119

inside information knowing that poor Cambodian 
couple had something worth breaking in for.

120
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,573
Logical.

121
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,627
Did you know the Dhiets? / No.

122
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,492
You were out on that corner 
that night. By their apartment.

Read my statement, 
that's what it says.

124
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,869
We've read up on you Booker, know you've 
served four years for drug posession.

125
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,006
With intend to sell.

126
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:00,901
I came home to Philly from Vietnam,

127
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:03,880

I picked up the habbit myself.

I got clean in prison.

suspected you in '91?

00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,410
If I'd knew, I'd tell you.

181
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,456
Remember his face, though.

182
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:08,412
Fugly. (aka. fucking ugly)

183
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:10,622
You're gonna have 
to do better than that, Dolla bill.

184
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:12,656
Yeah, we checked 
your employment records.

185
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:15,780
You worked exactly 
one legit job in your life.

186
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,349
On a construction crew. 
In '91. With Sen Dhiet.

187
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,433
I don't deny it.

188
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,642
I worked with Sen. Liked it.

189
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:25,938
So you don't deny having the bracelet, 
and you don't deny knowing Sen.

190
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,374
I don't deny the truth.

191
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:30,119
Truth is, that you're looking 
good for a double homocide, Dolla.

192
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,713
And considering you're up 
for parole in two months...

193
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:34,487
Our old boss.

194
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:37,390
The foreman. Brad Atwater.

195
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,258
That's who you 
should be talking to.

196
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:40,191
Why is that?

197
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,610
Sen hated him.

198
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,930
Kinda Atwater 
skimmin' his paycheck.

199
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,960
Skimming, how?

200
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,249
Atwater had Sen 
by the short hairs,

201
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:49,899
Just like all the 
illegeals working for him.

202
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,992
And was Sen doin' 
something about it?

203
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,752
Tryin' to rally the 
troops to protest.

204
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:57,813
Like Moses to the Pharaoh.

205
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,569
Alright, Dolla.

206
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,713
We'll run this down.

207
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,429
Maybe come back.

208
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,951
Bring picture of fugly for you.

209
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,514
We read about the home 
invasion at Sen's place.

210
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,745
I've met them at the site once.
She was really lovely.

211
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:16,921
You happend to remember where 
you were that night, Mr. Atwater?

212
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,430
Remember correctly.

213
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,317
I was fixing potholes 
in the driveway til pretty late.

214
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,457
Ten thirty?

215
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,786
Brad's a big do-it-yourselfer.

216
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,959
Well, regarding 
your construction crew,

217
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,414
we heard some talk about you taking 
some kickbacks from some of your workers.

218
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:35,621
I'll leave you to this.

219
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:37,059
Need help, honey? / No,

220
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,072
I just need to lay down.

221
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,594

- Her pain is unbelievable.

222
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,530
We keep going to specilaists, but...

223
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,500
Don't worry about me.

224
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:50,097
So... the kickbacks.

225
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,961
I don't wanna get into trouble 
over some creative accounting.

226
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,695
We're homocide.
We're not lookin' into that.

227
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,575
I had this thing going, with a pal, 
who worked at the INS.

228
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,792
- He's dead now.
- What kinda thing?

229
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,377
At that time, I had five kids.

230
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:06,481
One on the way.

231
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:08,433
Plus my wife's medical condition,

232
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,972
The thing?

233
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:13,168
We would go on raids, 
bustin' illegals.

234
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:16,092
Gave work visas to one 
who had something to trade.

235
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,106
And sent 'em your way?

236
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,410
And we both get 
a cut of their paychecks.

237
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,529
But Sen and Channary were legals.

238
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,778
They had work permits.

239
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,170
Their permits were legal, 
but they weren't.

Well, it's your lucky day, ruby boy.

00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,269
I got two legit work Visas for you.

259
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,838
These are the Dhiet's Visas?

Are there no other way?

00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:06,539
Legit work Visas don't go on trace.

265
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:08,005
So what's it gonna be?

266
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,508
Life? Or death?

267
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:12,897
They were easy targets.

268
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,821
I was in such a money jam.

269
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,276
This other couple. The real Dhiets?

270
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,983
What happened to them? / Deported.

271
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,639
And did that mean going home,

272
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,874
to poverty? Or worse?

273
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,781
Worse.

274
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,046
So by accepting those visas, Sen...

275
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:31,782
- might've got those people killed?
- Like he pulled the trigger himself.

276
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,719
We tracked down the 
deported Cambodian couple.

277
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,189
It wasn't easy, I'd tell you that.

278
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,065
Congratulations. / So?

279
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,940
Well, according to Human Rights Watch,

280
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,239
the real Sen and 
Channary Dhiet were executed

281
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:51,199
three days after 
arriving back in their country.

282
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,227
So by taking those Visas Kara's 
parents really did get them killed.

283
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,421
Maybe relatives of the dead couple 
showed up in Philly some time later.

284
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,509
Wanna revenge on the 
people posing as their family.

285
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,870
Shot them, they took the bracelet as 
a bonus maybe knowing it was valuable.

286
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,607
'Cause there's a special 
Cambodian ability to appraise jewelry?

287
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,930
Just offering a theory, boss.

288
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:13,005
Let's look for Dhiet's relation 
in and around philly in '91.

289
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,933
Well, Kara lives 
with her aunt and uncle?

290
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,476
Yeah, in Kensington.

291
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:18,135
They must've known 
about the name change.

292
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,382
If her Parent's weren't really Dhiets.

295
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,613
Sen and Channary 
were good people.

296
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,990
Except their name 
weren't Sen and Channary.

297
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,196
Let's talk about you 
telling us their real names.

298
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,511
Kara's father, was my brother.

299
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:41,569
Varin Toan.

300
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:42,586
And his wife?

301
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:44,705
Kanita Yasovarman.

302
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,626
Could you spell that?

303
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,751
So, they came over at '91,

304
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,258
'90.

305
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:54,971
Kanita was a member 
of the royal family.

306
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,605
That's why they had to leave 
Cambodia. / I don't follow.

307
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,862
The regime changed.

308
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:03,396
Very dangerous for the people 
with connection to the royals.

309
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,493
They had to sell 
everything to get here.

310
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,343
And get a new identity.

311
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,731
Now the real Dhiets, 
the one's that were deported,

312
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,423
did you know them? / No.

313
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:13,220
Any of the relatives? Friends?

314
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,572
No. No one.

315
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:19,199
Sen was a good man.

316
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,945
And his wife?

317
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:25,432
- Not such a good woman.
- How so?

318
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,361
She was a fool.

00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,201
I counted.

356
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,883
So what? You want three more?

357
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,561
Four.

358
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:22,577
Make up for the insult.

359
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:27,305
Kara, got a second?

360
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,443
Yeah, sure, course.

361
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,818
You find the bracelet?

362
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,299
Maybe we should talk alone.

363
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,776
Daryl can hear 
anything you gotta say.

364
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,575
So, the bracelet.

365
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:43,983
We found it.

366
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,295
Turns out it's very valuable.

367
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,188
Really?

368
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:53,269
Kara, we found out some things about 
your parents that might not be easy to hear.

369
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,136
Like what?

370
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:57,938
For one thing, they weren't 
going by their real names.

371
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:00,579
They weren't Sen and Channary?

372
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,517
They weren't Dhiets either.

373
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,444
How's this relevant to their murders?

374
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,834
They were here, illegally.

375
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,673
And there may have been danger 
associated with them getting fake visas.

376
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:10,213
I know about immigration.

377
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,496
People screw people over,

378
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:14,448
you're not saying that my parents 
did that to this Dhiet family?

379
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:17,474
It's possible. / No.

380
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,612
No way.

381
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:21,429
My parents were honorable.

382
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,317
There's more.

383
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:24,221
Is this really necessary...

384
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,434
You wanna stay?

385
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:27,219
Stop interfering.

386
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,449
So,

387
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:31,717
what else?

388
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:35,334
Your mother Channary, was royalty.

389
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:39,059
- What?
- She was part of the royal family.

390
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,620
That's why they had to leave Cambodia,

391
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,163
and probably why 
they had that valuable bracelet.

392
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:46,991
Oh, no.

393
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,430
What?

394
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,734
I thought that 
they were just stories.

395
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,093
What were?

396
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,576
Daddy thinks I'm going 
to be beautiful like you,

397
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,784
but I don't think so.

398
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,232
You're a princess,

399
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,727
of course you'll be beautiful.

400
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:03,982
Beauty's on the inside, Kara.

401
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:05,752
In your veins.

402
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,634
Can I take this to show-and-tell?

403
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,636
Oh, no, no.

404
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:11,957
Why not?

405
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,391
It's just a trifle.

406
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:18,157
A part of something, 
bigger and grander.

407
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:19,689
I'll take the whole thing then.

408
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,177
I wish you could,

409
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:24,954
but the whole is... lost.

410
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:27,151
Sold.

411
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,049
I wish you could 
have seen it, though.

412
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,596
All gold and rubies.

413
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,934
Look at me, Kara.

414
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,747
I took it anyway.

415
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,480
- To show-and-tell.
- Your parents never knew?

416
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:54,323
I bragged my whole class about 
a treasure chest full of jewels...

417
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:57,197
gold and rubies.

418
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,267
Who was there?

419
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:03,437
All the kids, the teacher,
the assistant.

420
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:13,549
Did I get my parents killed?

421
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,986
Because of my lies?

422
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,164
That was nice, Detective!

423
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,680
That was just what Kara needs!

424
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,931
More upset in her life.

425
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,846
You're the one who 
brought her into homocide.

426
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:37,244
Looking for the truth.

427
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:39,379
The truth about their murders.

428
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:42,798
Not about hurtful secrets that don't 
do no good airing after all this time.

429
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,754
What were you doing on that 
corner the night they died, Booker?

430
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,441
You were clean like you said.

431
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,060
Not dealing. / Buying?

432
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,671
It's got no relevence 
to what happened to them.

433
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,012
Kara know you were 
hooked on smack? / Nope.

434
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,189
She know you were 
in prison? / No.

435
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,223
Girl needs a father 
figure to look up to.

436
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,253
Not all girls.

437
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,782
See you ain't wearing 
no wedding ring.

438
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,057
Well, you know, I just can't find 
the right ex-con, drug-dealing

439
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,235
smack addict to settle down with.

440
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,433
You got man issues, don't you?

441
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,329
I think you're the 
one with issues, Daryl.

442
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:18,637
You're hiding something.

443
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,552
I'm going to find out what, so back off.

444
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,252
Let me get back to it.

445
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,320
Yes, sir.

446
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,980
New list of people to check out.

447
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,685
Kara told her first grade class, 
her family had a hidden treasure.

448
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,086
Scotty's got something, too.

449
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:42,892
Talked to this old-timer 
at the Buddhist temple in Cambria,

450
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,832
knew the Dhiets back in Cambodia, 
and they got a niece livin' in Philly.

451
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,631
- Get a name?
- Mei Dhiet.

452
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:51,496
And she goes by her 
married name, Tong.

453
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,016
Kara's Aunt.

454
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:56,753
Who looked me in the eye, and said 
she didn't know anyone named Dhiet.

455
00:22:56,753 --> 00:23:01,110
If Mei knew that Kara's parents got 
her relatives killed, then she must have...

456
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,267
Gives a one good motive for murder.

457
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,537
You said you didn't 
know the Dhiets, Mei?

458
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:16,646
- I don't.
- C'mon, Mei!

459
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,637
We know they were 
you're aunt and uncle.

460
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,909
Kara's father made a deal to save 
his family by getting yours deported.

461
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:24,961
Which lead to them be executed, 
and you taking revenge.

462
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,649
No. / No?

463
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,748
You just let that slide, no big deal?

464
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:32,972
Sen had no choice.

465
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,469
He must protect his family.

466
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:36,944
Kara.

467
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:38,715
I don't blame him.

468
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:42,755
Last time we talked Mei, 
seemed you really hated Channary.

469
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,431
I did.

470
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:46,546
But not why you think.

471
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,231
♪ Edie Brickell & New Bohemians의 
'What I Am' ♪

472
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:58,645
Wish my wife would 
bring me lunch like that.

473
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,840
Sen's a lucky man.

474
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,672
You are beautiful.

475
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,744
We must be getting back.

476
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,952
Sen's a bright guy.

477
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:09,117
He's a great architect.

478
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:10,958
You know who I am, right?

479
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,988
Who my friend is, at the INS?

480
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,419
I know who you are.

481
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,316
Cause, Sen's been 
mouthing off lately,

482
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:19,437
complaining about getting 
shortchanged, paycheck wise.

483
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:21,801
He work very hard for you.

484
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,470
Well, how about you make up for... 
Sen's misbehavior.

485
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,431
What do you say about 
a little cultural exchange.

486
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,442
No, thank you.

487
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:29,547
You wanna translate here?

488
00:24:29,547 --> 00:24:31,638
Cause I don't think 
Miss. Saigon understands me.

489
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,368
I am from Cambodia.

490
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:37,288
Saigon is in Vietnam, 
and I understand completely.

491
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,754
Who the hell does 
that bitch think she is?

492
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:44,873
You don't want her.

493
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,080
She... crazy.

494
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,947
She cut your thing off 
when you're not looking.

495
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:51,308
Well, I guess that just 
leaves me and you now.

496
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:57,829
I think Channary, upset Atwater.

497
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,696
Maybe get family deported.

498
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,530
So I paid price for her.

499
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,499
What d'you have to do?

500
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:09,604
That man... Atwater?

501
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,042
Evil.

502
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,869
Evil how?

503
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,496
Make me do things.

504
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,132
Sex things.

505
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:23,334
Like lick his boots.

506
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:31,421
That's why I don't tell police, 
or my husband.

507
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:32,706
I'm sorry, ma'am.

508
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,827
It's too late for sorry.

509
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:41,629
Nothing decent has been written 
about writings, since the poetics.

510
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:43,921
You trust me, Aristotle's the bomb.

511
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:45,451
Robert Richter.

512
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,932
Yes? / You were a teacher's 
assistant at Adams Elementary in 1991?

513
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:51,597
To be continued.

514
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:56,191
Adams Elementary 
was a long time ago.

515
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,910
You had a student 
named Kara Dhiet?

516
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:03,003
Maybe, I can't remember.

517
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:04,504
Well, she remembers you.

518
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,338
She's not the only one.

519
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:07,930
You know this guy?

520
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,795
Dolla Bill Whiting.

521
00:26:09,954 --> 00:26:10,920
Why would I know him?

522
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,293
When you were a part time assistant 
teacher, full time crack head?

523
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:17,958
He ID'ed you as the man who traded 
a gold bracelet for some rock.

524
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,368
I knew this would come 
back to haunt me one day.

525
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:23,536
I just knew it.

526
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:25,711
Yeah, well. Boo.

527
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:27,893
Well, hypothetically there's,

528
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,657
there's this statue of limitation 
on breaking an end to it, right?

529
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:31,701
It's not on murder.

530
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,103
Murd--! 
What the hell do you think I did?

531
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:36,076
Why don't you tell us?

532
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:38,112
The kid, Karen--

533
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:39,468
Kara.

534
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,225
Whatever. The one with 
the fine looking mother?

535
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,569
So you knew Channary?

536
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,674
Yeah. From, from 
parent-teacher conferences.

537
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:46,174
Hottie.

538
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,752
Anyway, the um--,

539
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:52,335
the kid kept jawing on and on 
all the time about all these jewels they had.

540
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,134
And you, 
with crack habbit to support.

541
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,567
Broke into their place.

542
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:58,604
Busted through the kitchen window.
But I didn't find squat!

543
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:00,069
Except for that bracelet.

544
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,014
How about the part when 
the family comes home and you shoot'em?

545
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,811
There was no one home! I swear!

546
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:04,975
We'd better take this guy in.

547
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:06,726
Oh, no! Wait, wait, wait! Listen!

548
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,885
Listen, you wanna good lead?

549
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:10,187

This is good for one-one.

We're listening.

551
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:14,417
There was this guy, 
nobody mess with.

552
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,333
The last stop of the night,

553
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,508
jonesing to get a high on,

554
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,091

You're already livin' on credit.

558
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:50,978
It's a far cry from
the opium dens in saigon.

559
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:53,320
From Phnom-Penh, too.

560
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,240
Now we become ghosts.

562

For a while, anyway.

563
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:17,142
Never expected to see 
a babe like Channary in a crib like that.

564
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,317
You sure it was Daryl 
Booker with Channary?

565
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:21,910
You ever met Booker?

566
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,660
Then you know.

It's tough for a dead 
couple to do house repairs.

572
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:42,409
The search on Atwater is running dry. 
No priors, no registered weapons.

573
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:45,016
- Still checking phone records.
- Well, we know what he did to Mei.

574
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,855
Let's bring this some 
bitch in and sweat him.

575
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,909
Can't. He already lawyered up.

Lil. / What's up?

577
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:54,992
Friend of mine at VA got a hold 
of Booker's classified military records.

578
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,203
Classified?

579
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,768
- Was he special ops or something?
- No, he was a grunt just like me.

580
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:00,253
Except his luck was worse.

581
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,894
He served at Tiger company 
at Quang Nai province.

582
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:03,843
Meaning?

583
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,517
Well, a lot of those guys, including 
Booker were brought up on charges.

584
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:10,736
What did they do? / A legitly 
massacred locals execution style.

585
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,768
Like Channary.

586
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,482
Now, Booker beat the court martial and 
was dishonorably discharged instead,

587
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,999
- for psychiatric reasons.
- He snapped?

588
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,183
A lot of guys snap,
a lot of guys recover, Lil.

589
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:24,259
I don't know where he came out.

590
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,936
Had to drag my ass 
in here, didn't you?

591
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,072
Show me you the man.

592
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,114
I knew you were 
hiding something, Booker.

593
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:37,800
Eye witness saw you smoking 
opium with Channary, who you said...

594
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,828
you didn't know.

595
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,293
So I knew her, big deal.

596
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,202
No big deal, Why lie?

597
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,040
I got a theory about you.

598
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,938
- Why you got it in for me.
- Answer the questions.

599
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,710
Becuase I did for Kara 
what no man ever did for you.

600
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,383
You mean lie to her?

601
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:52,682
Pretend you're 
something you're not?

602
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:55,233
Taking interest in her.

603
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,709
You didn't have no father, did you?

604
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:06,249
I got a theory about you too, Daryl.

605
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:09,722
I think that massacre you did 
in Vietnam got under your skin.

606
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:11,549
You don't know nothing about that.

607
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:15,804
I've seen pictures, 
of Channary. She...

608
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:18,412
- was beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

609
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,220
You tried to get her to 
leave Sen but she wouldn't,

610
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,408
so you snapped, 
killed them both in a rage,

611
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:24,937
then adopted Kara 
cause you felt guilty!

612
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:27,666
No! / You were on that corner that 
night buying for her, weren't you?

613
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:30,622
- Channary was in agony.
- So you helped her?

614
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,580
With opium?

615
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,847
On the outside 
she was in peace, serene.

616
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,457
Inside she was dying.

617
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:41,152
- Answer the question!
- Yes, I was buying for her.

618
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,057
But the fool that 
was selling was late.

619
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,436

- Name and address, he'll tell ya.

622
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,640
So, you've had an alibi all this time.

623
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,895
You think I want Kara knowing 
her mom was an opium fiend?

624
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:03,018
- That she was like me?
- Like you?

625
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:06,224
- How?
- Damaged goods.

626
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,875
You were in love 
with her, weren't you?

627
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,411
First time we met.

628
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:17,268

And?

699
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:55,692
Six calls logged from Atwater's 
house to Sen and Channary's.

700
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:58,920
All within a week before the murder.

701
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,255
That's something.

702
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,028
He shot her.

703
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:23,711
- Both of'em.
- Put that gun down.

704
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:27,575
Boots is how I know you did it.

705
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:30,753
Never could figure out how 
Channary got that dirt on her mouth.

706
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,742
Till I found out you liked 
women lickin' your heels.

707
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,584
Don't do it, Daryl!
Man's not worth it.

708
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,535
I killed plenty of people.
One more won't matter.

709
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,597
No, you know that's not true.

710
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:46,304
You got a ghost rattle under 
around behind your alias like me?

711
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,896
I was there.

712
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,775
Kill anyone?

713
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,483
Yeah.

714
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:54,798
When I was eighteen, Daryl. 
When I didn't think like a man.

715
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:57,546
But you and me, 
we're not eighteen, now.

716
00:35:57,914 --> 00:35:59,916
But Kara is.

717
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,761
And every girl needs 
a father figure like you said.

718
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:07,043
Tell me you can nail this bastard.

719
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:10,545
We've got phone records, 
ties him to Channary before the murders.

720
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,715
That's crap!

721
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:13,735
I never called that woman!

722
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,998
I did.

723
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:16,871
What?

724
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:20,518
I called her, to hear the voice of 
the woman who was driving you crazy.

725
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:21,942
Oh, Lord!

726
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:24,837
- Pharmacy speaking!
- She was the one you couldn't have.

727
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:27,158
You know how many pills 
she's on for this Fibromyalgia?

728
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:29,527
Was he really fixing 
potholes that night, Brenda?

729
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,960
Yes.

730
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,342
- But then he went out. 
- Shut up, Brenda!

731
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:35,116
And when he came back,

732
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,093
he burried something in the driveway.

733
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:39,820
- In one of the potholes.
- The gun.

734
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,920
You think they're gonna believe a wack 
job like you with your made up disease?

735
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:47,240
You got what you need? / Yeah,

736
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,885
we got it.

737
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:55,416
Talk about Channary, Brad.

738
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,718
What happen that night?

739
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:00,127
Woman was uppity.

740
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,246
Acted too good for me.

741
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,723
So you went to 
teach her what's-what.

742
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,456
That morning 
she came to the site.

743
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,944
Brought Sen 
his lunch, as always.

744
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:11,289
I say, hello.

745
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:13,416
She doesn't even 
acknowledge me.

746
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:16,634
So, Sen was just 
a casualty that night, huh?

747
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,283
She was the one!

748
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:30,545
Who is it?

749
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,941
Brad Atwater.

750
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,198
Your Boss.

751
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:40,960
Mr. Atwater, 
what can I do for you?

752
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,757
Ask your wife she knows.

753
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,680
He wants me to be with him.

754
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:49,841
Must be a mistake.

755
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,544
No mistake.

756
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:53,396
Hands and knees.

757
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,716
Hands and knees, or he dies!

758
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,148
You think I'm foolin'?

759
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:08,947
First lick the boots, 
then move on up.

760
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,867
Look what you made me do!

761
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,436
Now, I gotta kill you, too!

762
00:38:52,272 --> 00:38:54,058
Ain't you even gonna beg?

763
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,773
