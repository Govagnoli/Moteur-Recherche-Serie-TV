00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,710
keep it straight.
That's it.That's it,clay.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,590
Attaboy.
Got to keep it straight.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,140
That's it,pedal a little faster.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,430
Straight.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,200
Doing good,clay.
Keep your head up.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,590
Hang on.
Lean forward.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,800
Faster,faster,clay.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,780
You got it.
Don't let go!

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,220
That's it,you got it.
You got it,clay.

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,820
You got it.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,840
- Dad!
- Steer.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,370
Ugh!

15
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,470
whoa.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,140
You had it there for a second.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,230
- are you okay,honey?
- He's okay.

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,660
- Mitch,maybe you should take...
- he's fine.

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,790
You're okay,there,champ.
You just got to walk it off.

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,560
I told you not to let go.

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,060
Trust me,clay,this is the only way to learn.

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,600
- No,I can't do it.
- Sure,you can.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,170
You just got to get back on the horse.

24
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,730
No,I don't,and it's not a horse.

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,990
Come on,I'll be right behind you.

26
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,010
I promise I won't let anything bad happen.

27
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,660
I want the training wheels back on.

28
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,030
hey,

29
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,220
whatever you want,buddy.

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,230
You're the one who said you didn't want to be the last of your
pals riding around with training wheels.

31
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,410
I'll give it another shot,

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,840
but only if you don't let go until I say so.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,550
deal.
Let's go.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,070
Come on.

35
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,900
Okay,pedal faster this time.

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,480
Pedal faster.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
Look straight.
You can do it.

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,890
- Pedal faster.
- Don't let go.

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,180
Little faster.

40
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,480
Come on.
Come on,clay.

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
That's it,that's it.

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
- Steer,clay.
- Dad!

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,370
Steer.

44
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it,dad!

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,500
- oh,gosh.
- Backwards,clay.

46
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,670
Brakes!

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,880
Clay,backwards!

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,400
Clay!

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,910
Slow down!

50
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,500
clay!

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,270
what's up with the fresh job?

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,710
Some joker took a header off a high-rise last night.

53
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,570
They yanked us out of bed for a jumper?

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
The boss is already here.

55
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,530
- That's got to be 20 stories up.
- Guy's a pizza.

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,320
- If he's still in one piece.
- It was nice of him to beat rush hour.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,510
Victim's a harold dixon,55.

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,700
- We got called for a suicide?
- Wasn't a suicide;

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,050
hands are bound.

60
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,650
Plastic ties.

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,490
Bound?
You're saying the guy was pushed?

62
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,880
He was a registered sex offender.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,490
now that's a damn shame.

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,950
Found this note stuffed in his pocket from the doer.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,250
"I'm going to take out a piece of garbage "

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,480
every day till you solve the murder of my son clayton hathaway.

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,460
Looks like we're going to need a few more garbage bags.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,760
Missed the dumpster.

72
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,150
Six-year-old clayton hathaway.

73
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,680
Snatched off his bike back in 1987.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,030
Found two days later raped,strangled,bike was never recovered.

75
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,580
Kid disappeared on the dad's watch.
Mitch hathaway.

76
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,920
Police zeroed in on the father after the body was found at a
construction site he was developing.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,200
Traces of semen matched his father's blood type.

78
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,770
Even the wife checked out on him at the trial.

79
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,850
Guilty till proven innocent.
Jury didn't take long.

80
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,120
- He got life.
- So why'd they let him out?

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,170
After endless appeals,a dna test revealed that

82
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,340
the original evidence was contaminated.

83
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,400
The judge overturned the conviction,ordered a new trial.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,320
Lack of evidence; we had no case to move forward.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,670
- Hathaway was released a month ago.
- You still think he did it.

86
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,760
Doesn't matter what we think,matters what we can prosecute.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,350
What matters to your boss is he's got a pr disaster on the
loose.

88
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,550
If he did it,why's he going around shoving sex offenders off
buildings?

89
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,700
Harold dixon molested half a dozen boys the same age as clayton.

90
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,320
Yeah,he could have just pulled him off the megan's law web site.

91
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,860
If that's his hit list,right now he's spraying buckshot.

92
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,400
Why are we going after this guy again?
He's performing a public service.

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,820
You're joking,right?

94
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,870
Hey,nobody else can figure out what to do with 'em,certainly not
the courts.

95
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,350
They serve their time.
We can't incarcerate them forever.

96
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,710
Fine,then...
cut 'em off.

97
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,570
That'll fix the problem.

98
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,140
Sex offender web site's just an admission by the state that they
can't keep society from harm.

99
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,660
So we just let some crazed vigilante use the registry as a hit
list?

100
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,450
Crazed vigilante,grieving father.
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

101
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,550
Talk to the ex-wife,see what she remembers about the day her son
disappeared.

102
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,970
Scotty,

103
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,020
line two.

104
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,790
Yeah.
Valens.

105
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,810
You going to solve my son's murder,detective?

106
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,540
Hathaway?

107
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,380
I read about your brother's case in the paper.

108
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,170
So what?

109
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,940
- I'm not a monster.
- You killed a man last night.

110
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,860
He had it coming.
You of all people know that.

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,130
- This isn't about me,mitch.
- No,it's about what I lost.

112
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,790
And what I need you to do.

113
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,530
You want to talk to me,come on in and tell me your story.

114
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,310
come on in and tell me your story.

115
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,810
I didn't kill my son,detective.

116
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,840
Now do your job and find who did.

117
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
Has mitch tried s y contact you since he's been released,tara?

118
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,490
No.

119
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,230
But he must have written me over A...

120
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,320
a thousand letters from prison.

121
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,190
After the first on I...

122
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,190
I threw the rest out.

123
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,890
Why?
What'd he say?

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,170
That he didn't do it.

125
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,610
You never showed at the trial.

126
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,710
- You believe he did.
- That's what the courts said.

127
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,980
Look,it was just too painful,I...

128
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,910
I just couldn't handle it.
My world caved in.

129
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,370
You ever seen this man before,tara?

130
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,680
No.

131
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,760
Why?

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
He was a pedophile.

133
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Your ex-husband killed him this morning.

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,760
What?

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,670
Mitch killed someone?

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,760
He promised to do it again unless we solve clay's murder.

137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,250
I don't know what to tell you.

138
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,670
If there's anything you might be able to remember about the day
your...

139
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,950
son was murdered.

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Before he disappeared.

141
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,240
It's what every parent fears most.

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,290
It'S...
it's your worst nightmare.

143
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,150
Only for us,

144
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,000
it was real.

145
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,210
- where's clay?
- What?

146
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,680
clay-- where is he?

147
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,280
He was just here riding around in the driveway.

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,800
- Well,you were supposed to be watching him.
- I was.
Relax.

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,690
He probably just rode around the block with johnny.

150
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,520
Well,he's not supposed to go past the corner.

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,910
Don't worry,I'll go get him.

152
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,990
Clay!

153
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,790
Clay!

154
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,250
Clay!

155
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,440
hey,have you guys seen clay?

156
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,400
- Not since this morning.
- He's not with johnny?

157
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,920
Tara,is something wrong?

158
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,120
Linda,I don't know where he is.

159
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,400
I didn't see him.
I don't understand; he couldn't have gone far.

160
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,720
I'll get the car,go look for him.

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,310
I'll get my keys,mitch.

162
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,950
clay!

163
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
They found him two days later,

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
and there's not

165
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,110
a day that goes by that I don't blame myself.

166
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,980
You said you saw a postman?

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,670
Uh,right.

168
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,260
That's strange.

169
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,940
Clay disappeared on a sunday.

170
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,730
Better start explaining what the hell you were doing on that
street delivering mail on a sunday,ernie.

171
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,140
Sometimes I'd drop off parcels on my off-days

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,590
if the address was on my way home.

173
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,580
Only back then,you didn't have a record for diddling boys yet.

174
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,530
Run whatever test you want.

175
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,530
I never touched that kid.

176
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,980
Wasn't my thing.

177
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,740
Your thing?

178
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,010
My preference was blond-haired boys,ages eight to 12.

179
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,250
Slight build,introverted.

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,930
I was always very specific.

181
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,010
Gee,I guess we're way out of line here.

182
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,430
All in the past.

183
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,940
Years of therapy,I stay off the internet.

184
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,070
- Got mechanisms to help curb the urges.
- Well,that's comforting.

185
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,640
It doesn't matter if you believe me.

186
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,180
I paid my debt to society.

187
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,030
Far as I'm concerned,you'll never pay for what you did to those
kids.

188
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,840
Hey.
I would never kill a child.

189
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,690
I love children.

190
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,630
Guy who killed that boy was an amateur,worried about getting
caught.

191
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,080
An amateur?

192
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,440
If a boy is properly groomed,you don't worry about them telling
anyone.

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,280
They give you...consent.

194
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,080
Consent?

195
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,380
A child can't give an adult consent.

196
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,810
Someday,society will come around to accept it.

197
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,890
- You sick...
- hey,hey,hey...
hey!

198
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,160
If you ask me,you ought to be going after that little bitch.

199
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,740
- What little bitch?
- Hathaways' babysitter.

200
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,720
Wasn't like she was really watching the kid.

201
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
- What was she doing?
- More like who.

202
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,570
Preppy jock boyfriend always over there,sneaking around.

203
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,970
-
- When the hathaways were gone?

204
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,120
Always got to watch out for the young,clean-cut ones.

205
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,370
No,cut it out!
Stop it!

206
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,300
Shh!

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,890
You're going to be okay.
Quit being a baby.

208
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,910
Shh!

209
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,340
Come on,pal,it's not that bad.

210
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,410
You know what?
You like baseball,right?

211
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,930
Who doesn't like baseball?
Yeah?

212
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,960
You know,my dad has season tickets to the phillies,right?

213
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Really?

214
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,230
You think you might like to go sometime,

215
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,250
see the phillie fanatic

216
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,220
dancing on the dugout?

217
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,400
Okay.

218
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,120
Just don't tell trish what happened.

219
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,230
All right?

220
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,920
It'll be our little secret.

221
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,440
Just us guys.

222
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,830
Total amateur hour.

223
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,340
Never ceases to amaze me how many parents put their kids in
play.

224
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,150
- Just offer them up.
- Guess you'd know.

225
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,380
That's why I was surprised when I heard it was the dad.

226
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,220
Unless that's all changed.

227
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,070
Something I should know?

228
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,870
- We'll be in touch.
- P.O.Knows where to find me,

229
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,210
24-7.

230
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,380
Rom hathawaycame back to a pay phone outside market east
station.

231
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,750
Check with septa,see if they can pull a security tape,confirm
it's really hathaway.

232
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,560
So what are we doing to find him?

233
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,050
Where hathaway called from,

234
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,650
the building where he pushed dixon--

235
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,890
see if we can narrow his location.

236
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,860
So you have no idea where he is?

237
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,480
Every cop in the 15th district has an updated photo of him.

238
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,390
What are the red pins?

239
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,320
Registered sex offenders who lived or worked in proximity

240
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,060
to the hathaway residence back in '87.

241
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,880
Depressing,huh?

242
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,850
Names,photos and addresses,all listed on the megan's law web
site.

243
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,100
That's the law.

244
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,580
We need to shut down the site till we find hathaway.

245
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,250
Public access to that site supersedes the risk.

246
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,600
Really?
Public got a right to know that wasn't a suicide this morning?

247
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,060
Yeah,sure.
Trish was my girl back in high school.

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,530
When she used to babysit for the hathaways.

249
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,460
Heard you used to drop in on her quite a bit.

250
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,430
Well,no parents.
Best opportunity to get some play.

251
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,030
Sure.
Then you take them out to the old ballgame,right?

252
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,950
'Cause boys love baseball,right?

253
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,670
Long as they don't tell anybody what happened.

254
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,730
- That's sick.
- No argument there.

255
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,660
No,you...

256
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,440
I have three kids,two boys of my own.

257
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,630
We know about the blood on the underwear,adam.
Clay bawling his eyes out.

258
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,540
No,you've got this all wrong.

259
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,520
I was raiding the liquor cabinet,okay?

260
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,470
I accidentally dropped a glass on the kitchen floor.

261
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,800
Kid comes in from the outside in his bare feet,steps on it,cuts
his foot.

262
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,700
So how'd blood get on his underwear,adam?

263
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,340
I just grabbed something from the laundry basket,

264
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,360
whatever,just to stem the blood flow.
Kid's underwear was on top.

265
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,400
Do you know how dumb that sounds?

266
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,420
- 's the god's honest truth,I'm telling you.
- You going to have to do better than that.

267
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,490
Hey,I wasn't even in town when the kid disappeared.

268
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,700
I didn't even hear about it until I got back.

269
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,380
Just a horror show.

270
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,620
Always haunted me.

271
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,030
Something else you want to share?

272
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,810
I was over at the house one night when trish was sitting.

273
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,870
And I saw something...

274
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,530
kind of disturbing.

275
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,630
Come on!

276
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,440
What?
I heard the garage open.

277
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,600
Hey,guys,we're home.

278
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,790
Hide!Hide!

279
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,920
come on,johnny,we got to hide it!

280
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,960
- Who gave it to you?
- The scarecrow.

281
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,230
No way!

282
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,530
You can't say anything or he won't give me any more cool stuff.

283
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,400
- Your parents are coming!
- Clay!

284
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Don't tell anybody or scarecrow will get mad at me.

285
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
- Clay,you better hide it.
- Swear not to tell?

286
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,790
Swear.

287
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,580
- the scarecrow?
- Like some kind of secret pal.

288
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,020
But who the hell would give that knife to a six-year-old?

289
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,020
But who the hell would give that knife to a six-year-old?

290
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,230
You never mentioned it to Trish?

291
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,700
I was gonna but...

292
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
it took me an hour to get out of there

293
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,520
and then I forgot.

294
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,770
You remember now?

295
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,290
Well,it seemed kind of irrelevant after they busted the dad.

296
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,200
Gose to show you never can tell.

297
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,740
it was long time ago.

298
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,870
Anyhow I was only six-year-old.

299
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,330
Clay was my best friend back then.

300
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,100
It's pretty devastating what happened.

301
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,080
Scarred the whole neighbourhood

302
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,380
My parents became paranoid about my playing outside after that.

303
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,130
John,you remember anyone with the nickname "scarecrow"?

304
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,210
Yes.This older kid...

305
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,140
goth freak, lived next door to us.

306
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,180
Got a real name?

307
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,850
Damon Childress?

308
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,760
Something off with that guy.

309
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,060
he was into all kinds of weird crap we thought he was cool.

310
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,410
like what?

311
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,380
Ninja stars,medieval weapons, nunchucks.

312
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,340
- Butterfly knife?
- right,you name it.

313
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,620
he slept in his basement,parents just let him alone.Had his own
back entrance.

314
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,690
- you saw his bedroom?
- Even though you guys were only six.

315
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,750
Guess he didn't have a lot of friends in his own age.

316
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,300
- Was kind of unstable.
- Emotionally disturbed.

317
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,080
yeah.Just had to be careful not to rile him up.

318
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,140
or what?he even turn on you?clay?

319
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,750
once.came after both of us.

320
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,370
Came after both of us.

321
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,710
He-Man, Master of the Universe!

322
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,930
By the power of Grayskull!

323
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,550
I love the power, power.
Watch this one, Clay.

324
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,510
Watch?

325
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,230
We got to get back, Johnny.

326
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,930
I'm not supposed to go past our street.

327
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,470
- One sec. Just watch.
- Boo!

328
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,460
little punk.

329
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,340
- hey,damon.
- why you been ducking me?

330
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,520
what?

331
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,750
- what do you mean?
- think you can just steal from me.

332
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,320
but...you said i could have that knife.

333
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,380
nothing is free.
you owe me,boy.

334
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,010
you!

335
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,520
went back home and just hid in my room.

336
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,470
never saw him again.

337
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,380
- never told your parents.
- I thought that freak would kill me.

338
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,610
those times damon let you into his basement.

339
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,400
he ever try anything?touch you?

340
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,890
not me.

341
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,740
Scarecrow was more the type to get off on torturing cats.

342
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,450
- think he killed one the same day.
- you saw him do that?

343
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,680
- kill an animal?
- I heard something later that night.

344
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,680
looked out,saw damon in his back yard,burying somenthing.

345
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,160
Damon Childress' family moved out the neiber neighborhood.

346
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,760
couple of months after clay hathaway was killed.

347
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,270
Current owners gave us pemissin to dig up the yard.

348
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,210
looks like they found something.

349
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,340
Clay's bike.

350
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,870
Yeah?

351
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,780
Did you find him yet,detective?

352
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,480
- mitch?
- you know who killed my son?

353
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,050
we are close,we'll find him.
I promise.

354
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,780
- you belive me.
- I believe you,mitch.But...

355
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,900
you are not helping us,dropping bodies.

356
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,720
nobodylifted a damn finger on my son's murder till now.

357
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,550
- This ain't the way to go about it.
- you're right.

358
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,820
These guys should be burned at the stake.

359
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,670
You got our attention,all right?
Nobody else needs to die.

360
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,800
No.I...

361
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,210
I has to do this,for my son

362
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,970
your son's...gone,mitch.

363
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,920
Only 'cause I promised him that I'd be there, and...

364
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,280
and I wasn't.

365
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,120
- I understand how you feel.
- You don't.

366
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,890
I lost everything.

367
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,950
I know.But...

368
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,470
- You have to stop what you are doing...
- too late.

369
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,200
I already took out the trash today.

370
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,630
Anything back on mitch's call?

371
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,350
blocked number,all we got is it was a cell phone.

372
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,300
And a DA's office on crisis control.

373
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,460
Ballbuster alert,6 o'clock.

374
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,050
- Any ID yet on the victim?
- still trying to get prints off him.

375
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,250
Soon as we scrape him off the hood.

376
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,000
Whoa.

377
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,450
what?

378
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,880
come see.

379
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,940
no thanks,pass.

380
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,190
no scotty

381
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,180
got to take a look at this.

382
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,110
It's Grabowski.

383
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,850
the postman?

384
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,110
- Special delivery.
- how could he know who we're talking to?

385
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,260
'cause he is following us.

386
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,660
You interviewed that man,and didn't notify him of possible he
threat his life?

387
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,980
Think I'll sleep okay tonight, thanks.

388
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,090
we have a responsibility to notify anyone who's a possible target.

389
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,960
- Sure, why not offer them all protective custody?
- scotty!

390
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,870
we'll do our best to notify every level three sex offender who
fits the profile.

391
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,600
my boss is suspending public access to the magen law's web site.

392
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,410
have a good day,counselor.

393
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,330
Got any Batman back issues?

394
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,660
depends.

395
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,600
Detective Comic,Dark Knight, Shadow of the Bat?

396
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,470
Got any where, uh,

397
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,710
Batman fights that guy who looks like Ichabod Crane?

398
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,690
Preyed on people's fears?

399
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,750
- you mean scarecrow?
- yeah,that's him.

400
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,840
what you know about that guy...

401
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,720
damon?

402
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,700
- what it this about?
- boy named clay hathaway.

403
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,610
- long time ago.
- yeah.But I'm sure you remember him...

404
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,450
or at least,burying his bike in your back yard.

405
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,760
all right.

406
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,850
I took this kid's bike.

407
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,340
It was stupid.
I was going to sell it,but that's it...

408
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,600
you were assaulted a that six-year-old,
stole his bike and threaten his life.

409
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,500
I had a lot more anger than friends back then.

410
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,970
- but I didn't kill him.
- then why did you bury the bike?

411
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,200
As soon as the kid went missing,I panicked.

412
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,220
- you need to come down,make a statement,Damon.
- Wait!

413
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,210
I don't get the hassle,

414
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,420
didn't the dad do it?Even the mom said so.

415
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,960
- No, she didn't.
- I heard by myself.

416
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,350
She knew way before anyone else.

417
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,190
Don't worry about the caterer, Mitch.
I took care of it.

418
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,800
Right.
Thanks, Cliff.

419
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,200
anything you need,just ask.

420
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,610
I found something*******

421
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,560
What is it?

422
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,410
I just...

423
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,070
I don't ******anymore.

424
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,890
What do you mean, Tara?

425
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,470
I should've seen it,I should have stopped it somehow.

426
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,280
What?

427
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,620
he's not the man I thought he was.

428
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,430
What're you saying,tara?

429
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,300
I saw something,Linda.

430
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,520
What would you do if you found out your husband was a monster?

431
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,450
So,tara saw something that turned her against mitch.

432
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,570
Yup.

433
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,660
- Before the cops or anyone else knew.
- But she never said anything.

434
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,960
- Never testified against her husband.
- Didn't go to his trial,either.

435
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,370
That's when everybody said they knew he did it.

436
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,680
Wife loses faith in the husband,so does the jury.

437
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,570
Am I under arrest?

438
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,990
No.

439
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,560
He's here to protect you.

440
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,290
You already knew,tara.

441
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,510
Before the police suspected it was mitch.

442
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,360
You turned on him because you found out something before the wake.

443
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,740
That your "husband was a monster.

444
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,820
" Does it matter what I believed?

445
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,940
Yes,it does.

446
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,200
I failed,

447
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,550
you know...

448
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,280
I failed to protect my own child.

449
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,190
What made you think it was mitch?

450
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,580
You think you know someone.

451
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,950
Everything you believe to be true.

452
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,680
You have no idea.

453
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,860
What did you see,tara?

454
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,820
I was such a fool.

455
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,820
the caterer's here.

456
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,200
People will be coming soon.

457
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,630
You shouldn't have babied him so much.

458
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,010
Bewhat?

459
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,830
Made him vulnerable,

460
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,530
the kind of kid these guys prey on.

461
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,990
U think this is my fault?asul u' o thaypued.

462
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
You had wanna I always pushed him?

463
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,440
"Let him go,he's fine,he's a boy...

464
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,820
- I was right.
- You were wrong.

465
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,090
You let him go,only he's not fine,mitch.

466
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,980
He's dead.

467
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,750
I need some aspirin.

468
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,940
honey.

469
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm sorry.

470
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,860
I just miss him so much.

471
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,620
Do you really?

472
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,060
What?

473
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,590
Do you really miss him,

474
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,260
I mean?

475
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,960
why are you looking at me like that?

476
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,140
he had photos of johnny burrell?

477
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,620
Thumb in his mouth...
same way clay was found.

478
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,860
- You never came forward with those photos?
- They had enough to convict him.

479
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,270
I was trying to protect my friend.

480
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,360
I never wanted linda to see those,so I destroyed them.

481
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,770
You never told her.

482
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,600
I told her...

483
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,530
to never let her son go near mitch again.

484
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,860
hathaway?

485
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,900
You leave my wife alone.

486
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,810
You twisted,lying sack of crap.
Wasting our time.

487
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,020
What?

488
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,460
- You're no better than the g arbage kill.
- What're you talking about?

489
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,510
I know what you did-- those photos you took of johnny
burrell,sucking his thumb.

490
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,730
What?

491
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,110
Photos?

492
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,180
Your wife found them in the bathroom,mitch.

493
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,190
Remember?

494
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,480
No,no.

495
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,280
You wonder why she turned on you,you psychopath...

496
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,650
There's a lot of things not adding up,john.

497
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,660
Things you never told us.

498
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,300
Anyone.

499
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
We can understand why,

500
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,270
how painful it is to admit.

501
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,490
- Admit what?
- What mitch hathaway did to you.

502
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,130
I don't know what you mean.
He didn't do anything to me.

503
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,200
If you don't deal with this now,eventually,it'll just eat you
alive.

504
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,340
- No.
You got the wrong guy.
- You think you're strong,

505
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,580
it's all in the past.

506
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,290
Then one day you wake up,you just can't get out of bed.

507
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,550
- Or worse,you do the same thing to somebody else.

508
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,580
Even your own kid.
No.
That's not me.

509
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,260
John,we need your help here.

510
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,130
We know what mr.Hathaway liked.

511
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,930
- What he did to you...
- the photos he took of you.

512
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,350
What-what photos?

513
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,080
The ones of you in bed,sleeping with your thumb in your mouth.

514
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,570
Posed just like his son clay after he killed him.

515
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,790
- It's okay,you can tell us.
- No,it's not okay!

516
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,820
All right it never was.
And I don't care what you think.

517
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,040
It wasn't mr.
Hathaway who took the photos.

518
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,120
go to sleep,son.

519
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,940
Night,daddy.

520
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,030
It was your father who took those pictures?

521
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,050
I swear my father never touched me in that way.

522
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,860
Maybe because you were his own son.

523
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,360
You were off-limits.

524
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,340
But clay wasn't so lucky.

525
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,820
yeah?
Rush.

526
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,560
- What?
- I need a marked car to go to 8th and walnut.

527
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,420
- Okay,cliff burrell.
Just send the car over and meet me there.
- Right now?
Where?

528
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,260
What do you mean?
Why not?

529
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,650
- Hang up.
- What?

530
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,510
Hang up.

531
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,960
Hathaway just took cliff burrell up to the roof of the building
where he works.

532
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,630
What?

533
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,630
- Boss said swat is en route.
- That ain't possible.

534
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,010
How the hell could hathaway have known it was burrell?

535
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,920
Scotty?

536
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,650
I told him about the pictures tara found.

537
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,710
I thought it was him.

538
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,770
We got to go.

539
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,790
Go to the edge.
Go to the edge.
Please,please.

540
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,800
Move!

541
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,220
move!

542
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,100
shut up!

543
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,180
shut up!

544
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,970
shut up!

545
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,970
mitch!

546
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,240
Mitch,it's me.

547
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,330
- It's me,detective valens.
- That's fine right there,detective.

548
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,420
I know it wasn't you,mitch.

549
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,370
I'm on your side here.

550
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,660
I gave up believing anybody was on my side a long time ago.

551
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,230
Understood,but listen to me now.

552
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,490
You don't put down that gun and step back,

553
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,060
these guys are going to put a bullet in your brain.

554
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,800
I don't plan on walking off this roof alive.

555
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,900
But I'm taking this piece of garbage with me.

556
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,080
- Please,please!
- Shut up!

557
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,580
I know you want to kill him,mitch.
I understand,I do,but...

558
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,310
you don't want to die this way.

559
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,720
he killed my son.

560
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,750
He planted those photos,he turned my wife against me.

561
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,830
Mitch...

562
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,140
tell him what you did.

563
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,380
I want to know before you die.
Tell him what you did.

564
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,140
Tell him!
Tell him damn it!

565
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,050
Mitch,this won't bring your son back.

566
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,710
Oh,you're going to die,you're going to die.
You're going to die...

567
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,270
Stop!
Mitch!

568
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,750
No!

569
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,150
Stop!

570
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,160
- Stop!
- Easy,mitch!

571
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,130
Tara.

572
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,370
he did this.

573
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,240
To clay.

574
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,830
To us.

575
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,180
I'm sorry,mitch.

576
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

577
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,810
I let you down.

578
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,630
But I lost him.

579
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,410
I looked away.

580
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,060
I never should have looked away.

581
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,980
No,this is not your fault,mitch.

582
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,120
Don't do this,mitch.

583
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,620
Oh,please,

584
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,590
don't do this.

585
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,240
I need you.

586
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,840
Do you know I never stopped loving you?

587
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,380
Me,too.

588
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,790
Me,too.

589
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,100
Cliff,just...

590
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,600
tell the truth.

591
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,580
We know how you watched his son while he slept,took pictures of
him.

592
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,750
I...
I'm so sorry...

593
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,150
but you couldn't touch johnny,'cause he was yours.

594
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,450
I swore I never would.

595
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,890
So you took mine.

596
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,740
You took my boy from me.

597
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,030
I fought it for...

598
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,800
for so long.

599
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,640
The feelings.

600
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,100
And then,I-I...

601
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,640
I couldn't anymore.

602
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,720
I'm so sorry.

603
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,980
Hey,little buddy,what happened?

604
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,610
Damon took my bike.

605
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,260
He pushed me off,and I scraped up my knee.

606
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,800
- Tore it up pretty good,huh?
- It hurts bad.

607
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,130
Well,let me seeee.

608
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,870
Yeah.

609
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,740
Need to clean that up,get you a bandage.

610
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,530
I'll just walk home.

611
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,970
It's okay.

612
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,010
I got a first aid kit in my tool chest.

613
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,020
Something to take the sting out.

614
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,860
I don't know.

615
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,240
Won't hurt a bit,promise.

616
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,910
My dad always tells me just walk it off.

617
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,260
Come on.

618
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
You're bleeding.

619
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,920
You want a soda or something?
Got a fridge full back in the garage.

620
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,250
What kind?

621
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,530
You like grape?

622
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,570
Yeah,sure.

623
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,160
Go on.
Help yourself.
