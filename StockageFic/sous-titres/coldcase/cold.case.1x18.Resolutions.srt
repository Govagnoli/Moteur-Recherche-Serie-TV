2
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,114
We shouldn't even be out.

3
00:00:19,114 --> 00:00:21,887
She's convinced planes are gonna
fall out of the sky at midnight.

4
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,582
I read the paper.

5
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:25,705
Come on, we've got 15 minutes left.

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:29,125
I don't have a resolution.
I'm very happy with my life.

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:33,231
Guys, we'll have exactly one
millennium new years in our lives,

8
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,726
a clean slate.

9
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,295
Okay.

10
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:40,191
To stop talking about my catering
business and actually start it.

11
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,239
Excellent.

12
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:44,561
Jill?

13
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,399
- Get Mel to stop gambling.
- Good luck with that.

14
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,478
Mel?

15
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:51,186
Start a family.

16
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:52,646
Kids and all.

17
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,397
That leaves you, baby.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,048
To make Gary the starting
goalie at Whitman next year.

19
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:00,786
Your resolution is supposed
to be about you.

20
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:02,260
Forget me.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,824
This is the century
my boy becomes a man.

22
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:07,830
To the new century.

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,877
And a brand new start.

24
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:13,166
Here here.

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,223
Ten, nine, eight, seven, 
six, five, four, three...

26
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,644
Happy new year!

27
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,666
Hi, Gil.

28
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,868
This is Lilly rush.
The lady I was telling you about.

29
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,534
Hi, Tami.

30
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:29,784
How are you doing?

31
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,376
Great. Good.

32
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,749
Terrible, actually.

33
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:39,600
Tami's four years sober.
She got her chip tonight.

34
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,922
That doesn't sound terrible to me.

35
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:46,229
It doesn't change what I did.

36
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,553
Which was what?

37
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,683
Four years ago I had hit rock bottom.

38
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:55,522
It was new year's eve, the millennium.

39
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:58,831
You know, party like it's 1999.

40
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:01,043
So you did?

41
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,817
And then that night

42
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,006
I hit someone with my car.

43
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,579
She can't tell you more than that.

44
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:13,873
Tami's what they 
call a blackout drunk.

45
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,705
But I saw on the news the next day,

46
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:20,059
a man named Greg cardiff 
was killed that night.

47
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,212
A hit and run.

48
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:25,188
I never came forward until now.

49
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,812
What makes you think you
did it if you can't remember?

50
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,942
It happened in Bella vista.

51
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,078
Where I was bar 
hopping that night.

52
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:38,396
After about 10:30, 
I'm blank until the next day.

53
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,770
Find any damage to your car?

54
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,338
A dent on the hood.

55
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,994
A broken headlight and blood.

56
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,620
I think I mowed that
poor man down that night

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,291
and then just drove away.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/03/28

69
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,220
Greg cardiff, 39,

70
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,509
first murder of the millennium.

71
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:40,394
Tami's right. This was the only 
unsolved auto-ped the first half of 2000.

72
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:43,251
Hit at the corner of 5th and 
Christian in Bella vista.

73
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,635
Pronounced at midnight.

74
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,254
Happy, frigging new year.

75
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:48,685
Had a wife and a 14 year old son.

76
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:49,841
Any witnesses?

77
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,759
30 neighborhood surveys.
Nobody saw or heard nothing.

78
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,024
Probably all hung over.

79
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,209
Be worth going back, re-interviewing.

80
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,403
Looks like they only talked
to 29 of the 30 neighbors.

81
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:05,315
This last one, Russell brinkley didn't respond
to phone calls or cards left at the door.

82
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:07,357
Maybe out of town?
Holiday travel.

83
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,003
- Not a holiday now.
- Your friend still got her car?

84
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,661
Maybe we can match the damage
to these crime scene photos.

85
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:15,368
Nah, she hid it in a garage for a year,
then junked it in Wilmington.

86
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,887
But she gave us a picture.

87
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:23,506
Let's take it around. Maybe somebody 
will recognize her or the car.

88
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:26,753
Bella vista is a tight neighborhood.
Before we start knocking on doors,

89
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,380
we better tell the widow
we're looking back.

90
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,767
- Anything I can do?
- You did a lot.

91
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,263
Bringing us Tami.

92
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,310
Some AA buddy I am, huh?

93
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,693
Convincing her to come forward,
could land her in prison.

94
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,891
Mom.

95
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,532
It's the cops.

96
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,566
Detectives Rush and Valens.

97
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,691
What's wrong? What happened?

98
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:52,362
Nothing is wrong.
We're here about Greg.

99
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:57,080
What about him? / We may have 
a new direction on the hit and run.

100
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,378
Gary, maybe you should...

101
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,789
I'm okay.

102
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,745
Can we show you a picture?

103
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,710
I'm sorry. I...

104
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,887
The last four years have been...

105
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,633
she cried for the first three.

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,855
Still wear your wedding band, huh?

107
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,284
No, actually, I just got
remarried a few months ago.

108
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,066
Congratulations.

109
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,563
But I'll do whatever I can to help.

110
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,029
Do you recognize her?

111
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:35,542
Maybe from the bar that night?

112
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,591
No, she doesn't look familiar,

113
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,344
but the jeep does.

114
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:43,829
Greg wasn't feeling well that
night so I walked him out.

115
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:46,170
Let me go back 
and get Mel and Jill.

116
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,543
We'll drive you. / I've got to play 
hockey with Gary tomorrow.

117
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,420
Not feeling like this.

118
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,054
I think I feel better.

119
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,547
I just got to walk. Get some air.

120
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,507
I'll go with you.

121
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:58,100
No, I want you to go back in and 
celebrate the millennium with Jill and Mel.

122
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,890
I'll meet you at home.

123
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:05,231
I'll be there by 12:30.

124
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,815
Hey...

125
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,123
See you next century.

126
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,739
If only I had gone with him.

127
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,533
Mom, how could you know?

128
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:25,162
So the jeep was outside the bar
just before midnight?

129
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:28,081
If not that one, one just like it.

130
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,923
What position do you play?

131
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:31,584
Goalie.

132
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,212
He made varsity in ninth grade.

133
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,636
What, is this guy deaf?

134
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:43,911
Same guy who avoided talking
to the cops first time around.

135
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,995
Come on, Brinkley, Open up!

136
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:49,353
- He's in there.
- Philadelphia PD!

137
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,979
We just saw you get the mail!

138
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,702
Answer this door!

139
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:54,276
I'll check around back.

140
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:59,363
I'm not leaving until 
you open this door!

141
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,264
- Hi, there.
- Oh, crap.

142
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,632
Pretty much.

143
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,496
I didn't see anything.

144
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:14,629
This guy saw something, boss.

145
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,483
Something like Tami
running over Greg cardiff?

146
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,522
Whatever it was,
he don't want to tell.

147
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,594
Unresponsive four years back.

148
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,327
Tried to ditch Vera 
and Jeffries today.

149
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,292
Homebody like him, probably
wasn't out new year's eve.

150
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,313
Let me guess where you were.

151
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:29,561
Here.

152
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,271
How'd it go with Greg's widow?

153
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:33,647
She saw a red jeep outside 
the bar that night.

154
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,481
Red jeep, like Tami drove.

155
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,819
I was hoping things
wouldn't point to her.

156
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,864
She's a nice lady.

157
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:42,406
Nice or not, 
no one gets a free murder.

158
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,040
Vera says this guy 
Russell's got demophobia.

159
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,163
Fear of? / Crowds.

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,342
So crowd him.

161
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,470
I told you I mind my own business.

162
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,766
Mind if we join?

163
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,099
More the merrier.

164
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,382
Russell here,

165
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:03,774
he's got a big picture window 
overlooking the street where Greg got hit.

166
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,137
That doesn't mean I saw anything.

167
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,597
Detective Valens.
How are you doing?

168
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,620
Is there a bigger room?

169
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,209
This is the only one open.

170
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,813
Open is not what I'd call it.

171
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,523
It is kind of small, isn't it?

172
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,246
Cozy.

173
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,779
Even if I saw something...

174
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,406
- I wouldn't want to get involved.
- Why not?

175
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,577
It was four years ago.

176
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,034
You wouldn't be able
to make charges stick.

177
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,633
Actually our batting average
is pretty good, Russell.

178
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,387
And I got to live in my neighborhood.

179
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:34,919
So it was a neighbor?

180
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,840
A neighbor you're afraid of?

181
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,045
I didn't say that.

182
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,764
Russell, I'm appealing
to your decency here.

183
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,221
I think you're a decent person.

184
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,396
What did you see that night?

185
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:54,936
Something I wish I hadn't.

186
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,725
You're sure it was 
a brown continental?

187
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,198
Positive.

188
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,794
Everyone in Bella 
vista knew that car.

189
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:38,233
You saw it coming,
you went the other way.

190
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,064
You know the owner?

191
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,363
This jerk named John butler.

192
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,365
- You scared of Butler?
- That make me less of a man?

193
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,630
Tell us about him.

194
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:56,187
He's a rotten guy, mean.

195
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,750
Makes life hell for
everyone who lives there.

196
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,961
He killed Harriet.

197
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,385
Who's Harriet?

198
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,479
My poodle.

199
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,761
Butler sicced his pitbull on her
because she chewed up his newspaper.

200
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,663
She was a puppy.

201
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,951
Are you sure he hit Greg?

202
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,394
Probably on purpose, too.

203
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,341
Oh, this guy's gonna kill me.

204
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,324
We'll protect you, Russell.

205
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,402
I read crime novels.

206
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,365
You can't do nothing.

207
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:31,701
I'm getting out of town.
You guys need me,

208
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,757
I'll be at my mom's in Pittsburgh.

209
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:46,591
So where were 
you January 1, 2000?

210
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:51,406
Uh, at Elisa's grandma's,
scarfing the brunch of the ages.

211
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,014
What do you mean?

212
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,986
She was one of them kooks thought
the world was gonna stop spinning.

213
00:11:55,986 --> 00:12:02,442
Stockpiled hams, potatoes, eggs,
enough to last 40 days and nights.

214
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,170
You been with her a while,
then, huh? Elisa?

215
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:09,071
Kids when we met.

216
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:11,541
You don't believe 
in making it official?

217
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,124
It's complicated.

218
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:18,002
Like you and Kite, right?

219
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,300
I guess.

220
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,387
She do something 
you can't forgive?

221
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:27,593
Nah. She, uh...

222
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,029
She got sick. She...

223
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,978
She went to the 
puzzle house for a while.

224
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:40,400
That bad, huh?

225
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,005
Remember that kid, uh, Barry, 
on the Richardson job,

226
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:46,365
heard the voices in the closet?

227
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,368
Yeah.

228
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,404
Like him.

229
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:55,749
I hear the meds really help...

230
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:58,038
with that.

231
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:00,844
Yeah. She's having 
a good run now.

232
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,719
Thanks

233
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,552
for telling me, Scotty.

234
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,929
This is it.

235
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:23,606
Should've brought your coat.

236
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,900
Yeah. / Want mine?

237
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,332
Wouldn't make you less of a man.

238
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,281
I'd rather freeze now.

239
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:32,078
We're looking for John butler.

240
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:33,738
Thanks.

241
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,122
Are you Butler?

242
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,516
Depends who's asking.

243
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:47,399
- I am.
- I didn't do nothing to no one.

244
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,506
Now, why is that 
so hard to believe?

245
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:51,257
You a cop, too?

246
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:54,481
Got to admire 
a piece with a piece.

247
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:56,978
Maybe when we're done here,
I could buy you a steak.

248
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,445
Vegetarian.

249
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:02,233
John, you remember a guy from the 
neighborhood named Greg cardiff?

250
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,982
Knew him, till someone 
turned him into roadkill.

251
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:09,329
You have a personal 
relationship with Greg?

252
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,025
We didn't travel 
in the same circles.

253
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,829
Because we have a witness
who saw you run him down.

254
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,286
Me?

255
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:17,845
We're just trying to figure
if this was an accident or murder.

256
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,293
Hey, ho. Whoever 
said that is full of it.

257
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:21,588
I didn't hit no one.

258
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,044
Well, you were arrested
for drunk driving in '86.

259
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,559
Then again in '91.

260
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,627
So?

261
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:29,127
Not a big stretch you'd be out
drunk driving new year's eve.

262
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:30,815
Three counts 
of assault and battery,

263
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,647
public nuisance complaints.

264
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:35,980
We even heard you turned your 
pit bull loose on a poor little dog.

265
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,035
That mutt was a yappy little bitch.

266
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:39,763
I did the neighborhood a favor.

267
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,949
Yeah, well, we're gonna do
the neighborhood a favor now.

268
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,599
Bring you in, impound your car.

269
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,831
I don't even have that car no more.

270
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,561
Matter of fact, I didn't have it
that new year's, neither.

271
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,327
- Convenient.
- Happens to be true.

272
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,775
Got stolen that night.

273
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,544
Hey, you got to pay first.

274
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,762
Three bucks a gallon? / Look, there 
might not be any gas tomorrow.

275
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,447
I was here last week.
It was a buck and a quarter.

276
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:19,261
It, it's the owner, okay?

277
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:21,723
He says this Y2K thing's got
people willing to pay big.

278
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,224
- That's price gouging.
- Look, you got to talk to the owner.

279
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,144
Hey, I been filling up here since 
before you could get a woody, kid.

280
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,991
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
It's not up to me.

281
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,315
- I'm sorry.
- Turn the pump on.

282
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,572
Turn that pump on!

283
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,525
Turn your pump on!

284
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,464
You report your car stolen?

285
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:48,227
That night. They found it stripped
in Jersey two days later.

286
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,106
Check for yourself.

287
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:53,420
Will do.

288
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,300
Call me about that steak.

289
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,397
John butler?

290
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:06,362
Everyone knows him and hates him.

291
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,398
Did Greg know him, too?

292
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,531
Unfortunately.

293
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,697
In fact, he saw him that afternoon.

294
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,532
Butler confronted us at the market.

295
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,571
- I was with Greg.
- This is my husband, Mel.

296
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,587
Mel davis. / Hey.

297
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,537
Good friend of Greg's at college.

298
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:25,593
We were all together 
that new year's eve.

299
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:26,828
The three of you?

300
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:30,709
Jill, Mel's ex-wife, was also there.

301
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,466
And you two are married now.

302
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,629
We know. It's weird.

303
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,226
Gary tells us all the time.

304
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:40,223
Mel was really 
good to Gary and me

305
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:42,178
after we lost Greg.

306
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:46,556
And, uh, Jill left me that year
for greener pastures.

307
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:49,287
NaMely, a cardiologist.

308
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:53,146
Four years later, here we are.

309
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,127
Nice for both of you.

310
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:59,116
I told Mel you were asking
about a red jeep.

311
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,410
We got new information now.

312
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,868
Points to Butler.

313
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,420
Butler drove a continental.

314
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,718
Tell us about seeing him that day.

315
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,498
Well, Greg and 
I went on a beer run,

316
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,714
and, uh, Butler was waiting
for us in the parking lot.

317
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,808
So who do you like,
Minnesota or Oregon?

318
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:19,428
Oregon's not even ranked.

319
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:20,673
Gophers are gonna destroy them.

320
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,935
Hey, Cardiff!

321
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,739
You scratched my car.

322
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:27,390
What? / Door of your 
fag-mobile nicked my door.

323
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,935
Are you kidding?

324
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,358
Was I talking to you?

325
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,942
I don't think I even
touched it, John.

326
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,022
Saw it with my own eyes.

327
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:35,413
I'm real sorry if I did.

328
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,695
- That don't cut it.
- Hey, idiot,

329
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,033
look at your car, look at Greg's.

330
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,075
Now, you tell me, who should 
be worried about scratches?

331
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,372
Mel, it's not worth it.

332
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,373
Do you want to talk to me like that?

333
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,180
I'll drop both of you right here!

334
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,330
Whoa. Whoa. John...

335
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,093
I apologize, John.

336
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,797
Won't happen again.

337
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:56,508
Happy new year, okay?

338
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,049
Moron.

339
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,268
So Butler was looking for a fight.

340
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:14,644
Well, I got to admit, 
I egged him on.

341
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:17,732
You think he hit Greg that night
on purpose to get back at him?

342
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:20,403
If he did, we'll find out.

343
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:25,951
Thought you didn't have a beef
with Greg cardiff, John.

344
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:28,491
I didn't. / You had a run-in 
with him the day he died,

345
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,035
bitched him out 
for dinging your car.

346
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:33,247
That was nothing. / Greg and his pal 
called you an idiot a moron,

347
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:34,843
and you don't seem like 
the type just looks away.

348
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:37,517
I told you, my car was stolen
before Cardiff got slammed.

349
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,857
You made that report at 1:00 A.M.,
An hour after Greg was killed.

350
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,597
Plenty of time to ditch 
the car, report it missing.

351
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,801
Kid at the station wouldn't let 
me use the phone to call the cops.

352
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,010
I had to walk there.

353
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,552
- Yeah, we talked to that kid.
- So he'll tell you it was stolen.

354
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,848
He don't want to tell nothing
to help you, John, no one does.

355
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:56,019
But a lot of people are willing
to testify against you.

356
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,129
talk about your poor character.

357
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,114
We have a 80-year-old oak
tree in our front yard.

358
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:05,665
While we were at church,
Butler took a chainsaw to it.

359
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:08,573
That, that thing shed
its leaves onto my lawn.

360
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,282
Butler ran into my 12 year old
daughter on her way to school.

361
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,661
- Called her a whore.
- I said they dress her that way.

362
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,460
Got to remember 
how young boys think.

363
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,498
John asked me out 
three or four times.

364
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,139
I politely declined.

365
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,483
He spray-painted 'whore'
on my front door.

366
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,588
What's your point?

367
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,096
What goes around comes around.

368
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,759
All these neighbors are gonna be
more than happy to help put you away.

369
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,534
You had a beef with Greg.

370
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:33,181
We got an eyewitness puts
your car at the crime scene.

371
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:37,183
And 40 plus character witnesses
to say this guy's got to be guilty.

372
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,048
Look...

373
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,081
I'm not the guy you really want,

374
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,585
but I can help you.

375
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,370
We're listening.

376
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:50,259
My car was stolen.

377
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,168
But I had a guy do it for me.

378
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,844
Hired him, you know...

379
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,453
for the insurance money.

380
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,455
Keep talking.

381
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:00,291
He must've hit Cardiff when he was
going to ditch the car in Jersey.

382
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,839
Name?

383
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,960
Trevor mckai.

384
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,681
Lives over in Bridesburg.

385
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,645
You Trevor?

386
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,689
Yeah.

387
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,570
Homicide.

388
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,285
Want to talk to you about
a hit-and-run a while back.

389
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:30,077
Over in Bella vista.

390
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,533
Happened new year's eve
at the millennium.

391
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,636
Were you over that way?

392
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:38,375
Hmm. Bella vista?

393
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,671
Nah, I was out with friends
here in Bridesburg.

394
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,926
We need the names of those friends.

395
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,021
I don't really know their names.

396
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,544
So...

397
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:49,340
not good friends, then.

398
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,509
You know, I was just
hanging out with people.

399
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:53,698
Partying and whatnot.

400
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:57,285
Somebody's house? At a bar?

401
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,935
This bar, maybe?

402
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,489
Yeah. / Yeah?

403
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,111
Forget it, man.

404
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:15,288
I've been waiting four years
for you guys to show up.

405
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,868
Got something you want
to get off your chest?

406
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,381
I could tell you your rights.

407
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,806
Nah.

408
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,956
I don't need them.

409
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:28,671
It was me that hit that guy.

410
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,406
Driving John butler's stolen car?

411
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,444
No kidding.

412
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:35,430
I had no choice.

413
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:11,339
What the hell?

414
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,740
Oh, god.

415
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:31,984
I hit him.

416
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,259
I'm not denying it.

417
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,216
but the man was already down.

418
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,326
That doesn't make sense, Trevor.

419
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,469
I'm telling you...

420
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,831
that Greg cardiff

421
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,587
wasn't crossing that street.

422
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:52,060
He was lying in it.

423
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:02,071
Guy says Greg was face down
in the street before he ran him over?

424
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,018
- That's his story.
- Do we believe it?

425
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,860
Well, Trevor's got reason to lie,

426
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,699
but the first report did say 
Greg wasn't feeling good.

427
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,232
That's why he went home early.

428
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:10,899
Heart attack? Aneurysm?

429
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,363
How about sloppy drunk?

430
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:13,987
It was new year's eve.

431
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:15,029
Let's ask the wife.

432
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,948
We didn't have this new direction, 
I'd take a hard look at Susan and Mel.

433
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,367
I was thinking the same thing.

434
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:22,174
Anyone got a favor coming 
from the coroner's office?

435
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,726
I ain't going to the morgue.

436
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:25,685
The sMell of that place kills me.

437
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,375
Listen to the kitchen bitch.

438
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:31,420
Being an auto-ped, probably didn't 
do a full tox screen at autopsy, but

439
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,012
maybe they saved
some tissue samples.

440
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,526
Well, I'll give them a call.

441
00:23:35,526 --> 00:23:37,516
Right after you disinfect the phone.

442
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:44,357
Greg wasn't drunk that night.
He was sick.

443
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:46,267
Sick? How?

444
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,454
Well, we didn't know.

445
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:49,750
It was off and on for about a month.

446
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,248
But he felt good that day
until we got to the bar.

447
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,985
What kind of symptoms he have?

448
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:56,950
Headache. Nausea. Why?

449
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,658
It's possible Greg collapsed on 
the street before he got hit by the car.

450
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:04,332
From what? / Did he have 
any kind of chronic condition?

451
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:07,752
No. He was a health nut.
He jogged every day.

452
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:10,170
He played hockey with Gary.

453
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:13,419
you know, 
Gary was sick that day, too.

454
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,319
Same symptoms?

455
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,717
I think so.

456
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:18,155
Where's Gary now?

457
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,639
Yeah, I was sick, too.

458
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:26,149
Headache, nausea, 
same as your dad?

459
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,188
What's that have to do
with him getting hit?

460
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,478
His health that night
might have been a factor.

461
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:33,148
Anything else you remember
about your symptoms?

462
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,240
I think I was seeing things
kind of yellow.

463
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,988
What do you mean?

464
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:42,617
Like...

465
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:45,705
like there was a yellow
filter over everything I saw.

466
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:48,678
So you and your dad share any
of the same foods that day?

467
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,563
Dad ate something that mom cooked.

468
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:52,125
And, uh, I had fast food.

469
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,858
How about chips or pretzels 
watching the game?

470
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,389
No.

471
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:00,885
But there was 
something else we shared.

472
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,219
Hey, there he is.

473
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,473
Good scrimmage?

474
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:05,854
Yeah.

475
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:08,393
Sorry about this morning, Gare.

476
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:09,540
That's all right.

477
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,004
I'm better today. How about tomorrow 
we set up the net in the driveway?

478
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:14,688
Yeah, cool.

479
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:18,087
Because your mom loves when 
we slam pucks against the garage.

480
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:21,044
I do love it very much.

481
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,079
Anyone need anything?

482
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,305
- No thanks, honey.
- No thanks.

483
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:39,297
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Gary, what are doing?

484
00:25:39,297 --> 00:25:41,403
- You know better.
- Sorry.

485
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,843
You got a few years
to go there, kid.

486
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:50,306
Maybe I got sick from 
drinking from the same glass.

487
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:51,665
Maybe.

488
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:54,937
So Mel and your mom were both mad
that you touched that margarita?

489
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:57,189
I didn't see what the big deal was.

490
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,828
It was only a sip.

491
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,413
Father and son drink
the same margarita,

492
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:03,750
both fall sick.

493
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,202
Susan and Mel are both there, both could 
have slipped something into the drink.

494
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,448
And they take big pains
to stop the kid from drinking.

495
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,993
Because dad is the target.

496
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:14,249
Fast forward four years and the 
widow and best friend are married.

497
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:17,002
Maybe they were seeing each other,
decided to get rid of Greg.

498
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:20,337
I want find Mel's ex.
See if she suspected an affair.

499
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,024
Visitor.

500
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,937
At least there's good 
news for someone.

501
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:31,246
Why don't you go talk to Mel,
Scotty, man to man.

502
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,982
Hi, Tami.

503
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,227
Thanks for coming in.

504
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:38,480
You have news?

505
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:40,420
It wasn't you.

506
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,359
Oh, that's great.

507
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:44,546
You're sure?

508
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,959
Someone confessed 
to hitting Greg cardiff that night.

509
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,591
And there's an eyewitness 
to back the story.

510
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:49,749
I confessed.

511
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,792
To what you thought you did.

512
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,251
What about the blood,
the damage to my car?

513
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:57,095
Maybe an animal.
Maybe you did hit someone,

514
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,295
injured them. But

515
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,977
we only have 
homicide records here.

516
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:02,526
Point is,

517
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:05,324
you didn't kill anyone.

518
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:11,025
Did you want it to be you, Tami?

519
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:15,307
I quit drinking because
I thought I hit this guy.

520
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:19,273
That was keeping me in check.

521
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,904
Now I...

522
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,336
Now what?

523
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:25,152
I really want a gin and tonic.

524
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,702
We're thinking food poisoning.

525
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,162
And that he just fell
in front of this car?

526
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:37,163
I've seen stranger things.

527
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:39,899
Oh, crap.

528
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,644
You okay there, Mel?

529
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:47,309
Knocks the wind out of your sails
when you hear something like that.

530
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:49,816
He was my best friend.

531
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,392
Yeah.

532
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,912
How'd he get the food poisoning?

533
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,227
Maybe the margarita 
he was drinking.

534
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,730
Really.

535
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,112
Gary says he took a sip of 
his dad's drink that day,

536
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:03,077
and you kind of swatted
it out of his hand.

537
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,671
I might have.

538
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:05,756
How come?

539
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:07,259
He was only 14.

540
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,665
I mean, he's still not
old enough to drink.

541
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,843
Can I...

542
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:15,121
ask you an aside here?

543
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,162
Sure.

544
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,247
I ain't judging, believe me.

545
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,715
You and Susan...

546
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:24,461
you really take up after Greg's death?

547
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:27,805
Yeah. / Because I know if I'm 
you and I'm looking at her

548
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,633
and she's interested back...

549
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,385
I mean, married or not,
the flesh is weak.

550
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,154
Maybe it makes me a real geek,

551
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,817
but no.

552
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,860
I was faithful.

553
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,403
Well, better man than me.

554
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,915
So, uh, the margaritas...

555
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:48,000
you remember who made them?

556
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:52,867
Rolling rock, huh?

557
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:56,160
- You guys are really living it up.
- Or it reminds us of our college days.

558
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,837
Wouldn't you rather 
have a margarita?

559
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,417
Mel? / Oh, no. 
I don't drink tequila.

560
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,544
Ever since hell night freshman year.

561
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:07,988
Mel did 15 shots in 15 minutes.

562
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:09,268
I still get sick thinking about it.

563
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:11,010
You ended up in 
student health for three days.

564
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,059
My parents almost 
sued the fraternity.

565
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,223
I'm, uh, good with this.

566
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:24,652
So Susan made the margaritas,

567
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:27,206
and the margaritas made Greg sick.

568
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,116
I don't like what 
you're suggesting.

569
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:30,505
Just adding up the facts.

570
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,320
Look, I'll say it again.

571
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,913
There was no love 
triangle before Greg died.

572
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,452
Would your ex-wife 
back that up? / Sure.

573
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:40,435
Jill's the one who 
left me for another man.

574
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,795
Know where we can find Jill? / No.

575
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:44,334
We're out of touch.

576
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,975
Who was the doctor 
she ended up with?

577
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:49,820
Michael... something.

578
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,009
Jill left you for this guy,
and you never got his name?

579
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,303
Look, if your wife tells you
that she's screwing another guy,

580
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:58,398
that's really all you need to know.

581
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:01,478
Anything else is just
salt in the wound.

582
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:07,859
Found Jill davis or at least
her answering machine.

583
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:10,962
Good. because Mel's either a great liar
or didn't have nothing to do with this.

584
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:13,786
Well, someone definitely
wanted Greg cardiff dead.

585
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:14,953
Get something from the coroners?

586
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:17,129
No tissue samples,
but Greg was an organ donor.

587
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:21,511
Transplant unit at Pennsylvania hospital
had some blood samples stored.

588
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,843
- Lethal levels of digoxin.
- What's that?

589
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,213
Medication used to stabilize
an irregular heart beat.

590
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:28,098
And it can be deadly
if you want it to be.

591
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,795
Overdose symptoms
are nausea, headache,

592
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,172
- yellow-tinted vision...
- Gary's symptoms.

593
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:36,951
And fainting. / Maybe why 
Greg dropped in the street.

594
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,720
Guess who's in 
the emergency room.

595
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,221
Who?

596
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:41,685
Mel davis.

597
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,737
Exact same symptoms as Greg.

598
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:54,361
We found digoxin in his system.

599
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:58,240
I don't know what digoxin is.

600
00:30:58,379 --> 00:30:59,704
Prescription drug.

601
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,916
But you use it wrong,

602
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,162
it's just poison.

603
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,878
Well, I've never heard of it.

604
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:09,399
All that cooking and 
catering you do, Susie,

605
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:12,132
be pretty easy to slip a few lethal
drops into dinner every night.

606
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:15,381
- I have to get to the hospital.
- Are you tired of Mel, is that it?

607
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:16,556
What?

608
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:19,468
He was good to you and all,
just like Greg.

609
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:21,478
Maybe you just had your fill of him.

610
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:24,683
- I love Mel.
- You know about black widows?

611
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:26,706
They're beautiful, but deadly.

612
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:29,354
Destroy their mates when
their usefulness is over.

613
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,897
I didn't hurt my husband.

614
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:32,983
You got to be more specific, Susie.
Which husband do you mean?

615
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,448
The one already dead,
or the one in the hospital?

616
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:40,466
If I was unhappy with Mel, 
why wouldn't I just get a divorce?

617
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:42,326
I don't know.

618
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,202
Maybe you just 
don't like confrontation.

619
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,391
Yellow-tinted vision?

620
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:53,087
It's weird, huh?

621
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,049
They're running a million tests.

622
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,264
Where'd you have your last meal?

623
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,062
Home.

624
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:02,930
Something Susan made?

625
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:04,978
So?

626
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:08,290
Mel, there was a drug called
digoxin in Greg's system.

627
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,317
A lethal amount.

628
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:11,651
What is that?

629
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:13,915
A heart medication.

630
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:16,405
I think they're gonna find that
in your system, too.

631
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:19,203
Your partner's already been
down this road with me.

632
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,306
Susan wouldn't harm me.

633
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:24,745
And she never 
would have hurt Greg.

634
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:26,586
She adored him.

635
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:28,632
Maybe she adored you more.

636
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,385
- At least for a while.
- It was always him.

637
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,044
Greg was plan A.

638
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:37,171
- I'm just the one she settled for.
- But the fact remains, Mel,

639
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,390
you have the same 
symptoms as Greg.

640
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,576
You know the name 
of her business?

641
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:44,318
Cardiff catering.
She still uses his name.

642
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,351
That's how loyal she is to him.

643
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,772
Hi, boss.

644
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,863
Jill's there?

645
00:32:54,863 --> 00:32:56,941
Go ahead. I'll be there in ten.

646
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,122
You talking about my Jill?

647
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:01,786
Yeah.

648
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:03,113
We tracked her down.

649
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,823
Want me to give her a message?

650
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,292
No.

651
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,547
No message.

652
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:14,959
Mel always had it bad for Susan.

653
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,314
Even when you 
were married to him?

654
00:33:18,882 --> 00:33:21,445
I didn't like to think so,
but you know in your gut.

655
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,275
It's the reason why we broke up.

656
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:27,223
I thought you left him 
for a cardiologist.

657
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:30,119
Only because I didn't feel like 
waiting around for the affair.

658
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:31,658
Was there an affair? / No.

659
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:33,331
Susan would never leave Greg.

660
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:36,033
Wasn't until after he died 
that Mel saw his opening.

661
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:38,321
Oh, yeah. 
Two days after the funeral,

662
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,920
he wanted me to draw up papers.

663
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,240
Not too subtle. / No.

664
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:46,869
So, Jill, you being 
married to a heart doctor,

665
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:49,172
you probably know what digoxin is.

666
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:51,254
Yeah. I take it.

667
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:54,708
I met my husband because 
of my heart condition.

668
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,408
Hospital confirmed Mel 
was poisoned with digoxin.

669
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:07,554
Just like Greg.

670
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:10,078
Probably no surprise to Susie here.

671
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:16,083
And turns out Mel's ex-wife has been
taking that drug her whole life.

672
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,988
- You think Jill did something?
- Jill's over Mel.

673
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,535
She has a new husband.

674
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:23,703
And she never had 
anything against Greg.

675
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:26,406
But Mel, on the other hand...

676
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:30,328
Mel had real good access
to digoxin over the years.

677
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:32,955
Did Mel and Greg eat 
a lot of meals together?

678
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,793
Go out drinking?

679
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,183
They were best friends.

680
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:40,293
According to Jill, 
Mel had big plans for you

681
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:42,839
soon as Greg got out of the picture.

682
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,760
Who else could
it have been, Susie?

683
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,553
Oh, no.

684
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:51,514
You remember something?

685
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:55,980
I thought he was 
just being a friend.

686
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,606
But even on the day 
of the funeral...

687
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:01,986
Mel was moving in?

688
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:09,617
I saw a guy get a ticket on my way 
to the cemetery and I just...

689
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:13,539
didn't understand.

690
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,776
Understand what?

691
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:18,250
How the world keeps going.

692
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,632
I mean, how do people do mundane 
things, like write up a ticket,

693
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:23,510
when everything is over?

694
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:27,719
Hey.

695
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,970
Baby, I'm sorry.

696
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:37,233
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,152
It's not over.

698
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:42,281
You're gonna be happy again.

699
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:46,041
The three of us are 
all going to stick together.

700
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,664
We're all gonna be happy.

701
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,171
The three of us?

702
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:57,840
When he was still married to Jill.

703
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,846
But why would 
Mel make himself sick?

704
00:36:00,846 --> 00:36:03,777
He never thought Greg's
poisoning would come out.

705
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,719
Knowing it would,

706
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,146
- he got desperate.
- Tried to set you up, Susie.

707
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:20,375
Hospital just called.

708
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,362
Mel davis skipped out.

709
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:31,342
Driver, remove the 
keys from the ignition.

710
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:34,179
Throw the keys out of the window.

711
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:35,956
Now!

712
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:40,225
Tracked him through his cell phone.
He's not responding to orders.

713
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:43,096
So what's he doing? / Fugitives 
don't usually think before they run.

714
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:45,176
My guess is, he's thinking now.

715
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,482
Can I try?

716
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,634
Mel, this is detective Rush.

717
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:53,181
Show us your hands.

718
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:55,889
Please put your hands 
outside the window.

719
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,535
- He got a gun?
- I don't know.

720
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:03,239
We give him much more time,
maybe we'll find out.

721
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,675
Careful.

722
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:34,260
I got the driver's side.

723
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:53,717
He's gone.

724
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,246
I'll call the coroner.

725
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:10,059
Mel wasn't thinking.

726
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,133
He was writing.

727
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:17,096
What's it say?

728
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,310
My millennium resolution
was to have a family,

729
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,944
kids and all.

730
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:27,612
Susan and Gary were that family.

731
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:31,294
But even after Greg was gone,
even though she married me,

732
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,323
I was never more than plan B.

733
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:05,360
Let's have our own toast,

734
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,919
just the guys.

735
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,152
To 2000.

736
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:09,661
The year 2000.

737
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:17,679
What? What is it?

738
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,537
I don't think Jill and 
I are gonna make it.

739
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,792
You serious?

740
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,815
I couldn't say it in front of her,

741
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:28,890
but I'm gonna make 
some changes in 2000.

742
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:32,553
That's my real resolution.

743
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:35,390
Marriage is hard work, Mel.

744
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:38,315
Problem is,

745
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,394
I got the wrong marriage.

746
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:44,350
Well, I'm sorry.

747
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:47,865
Me, too.

748
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:51,863
Bottom's up.

749
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,132
# Jewel의 'Hands' #

750
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:23,681
# If I could tell the world just one thing it would be #

751
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,951
# that we're all okay #

752
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:30,193
# And not to worry
'cause worry is wasteful #

753
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:34,610
# And unless in times like these #

754
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,385
# I won't be made useless #

755
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:42,075
# I won't be idled with dispair #

756
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:45,346
# I will gather myself around my faith #

757
00:40:45,346 --> 00:40:49,584
# for light does the darkness most fear #

758
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:52,724
# My hands are small, I know, #

759
00:40:52,724 --> 00:40:56,421
# but they're not yours they are my own #

760
00:40:56,421 --> 00:41:00,430
# but they're not yours they are my own #

761
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,234
# and I am never broken #

762
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:14,022
# Poverty stole your golden shoes #

763
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:17,987
# but it didn't steel your laughter #

764
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:21,132
# And heartache came to visit me #

765
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:25,333
# but I knew it wasnt ever after #

766
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,679
# We'll fight, not out of spite #

767
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,440
# for someone must 
stand up for what's right #

768
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,259
# cause where there's 
a man who has no voice #

769
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:40,440
# there our's shall go singing #

770
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:43,682
# My hands are small, I know, #

771
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:47,451
# but they're not yours 
they are my own #

772
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:51,608
# but they're not yours  
they are my own #

773
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:55,418
# and I am never broken #

774
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:58,858
# In the end

775
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:03,751
# only kindness matters #

776
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:06,576
# In the end

777
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:12,761
# only kindness matters #

778
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:20,177
# I will get down on my 
knees and I will pray #
