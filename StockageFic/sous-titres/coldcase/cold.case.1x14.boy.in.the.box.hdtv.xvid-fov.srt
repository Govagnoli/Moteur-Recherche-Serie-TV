2
00:00:02,138 --> 00:00:04,201
Don't make me tie 
you up, Red Feather.

3
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,139
Just come quiet and civilized.

4
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,609
We'll scalp you first, White Man.

5
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:29,353
Look.

6
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:32,784
Sister Vivian.

7
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:33,633
Sister Grace.

8
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,815
He's back.

9
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,849
Sheriff's back, men.

10
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:54,572
I'm sorry to hear that.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,644
I'm sorry to hear that.

12
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,133
I know you're working on it.

13
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:03,935
Yeah, I miss you, too.

14
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,061
Boss has something.

15
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,097
Yeah, good.

16
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,590
Oh, I gotta jet, Elisa.

17
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm gonna try to come this week.

18
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,701
Can't promise anything, 
but best effort. Bye.

19
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,190
Someone left this on the 
steps of St. Emilian's Church.

20
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,085
"Unknown boy found in box.

21
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,686
April 6, 1958."

22
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:29,624
Will, take a look at this.

23
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:30,890
Oh, that old job.

24
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:32,885
Boy in the box.

25
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,275
Even I heard of that one.

26
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,503
City's most famous cold job.

27
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,342
I've seen this up in 
the comissioner's office.

28
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:39,690
Still nags the bosses.

29
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,711
They never so much 
as I.D.'d the boy.

30
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,305
Everyone in Philly 
knew about this kid.

31
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:44,418
"The unknown boy."

32
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:45,479
But week after week,

33
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,935
no one reported him missing, 
and no one could name him.

34
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,070
Where's the body end up?

35
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,528
Charity Field... with 
the paupers and prisoners.

36
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,629
- Any tags on those?
- Nah.

37
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:59,776
Think the unknown boy
could be this little cowboy?

38
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:02,328
Lil, there's something on the back.

39
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,267
"His name was Arnold."

"Unknown white male, 1958.

50
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,493
Dumped in Fox Chase."

51
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,398
Better known as the Boy in the Box.

52
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:51,208
400,000 circulars posted 
in Philadelphia and Bucks County.

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,977
Hundreds of leads, 
none of them right.

54
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,644
Kid was found in a Liho 
Punch box, out in a field.

55
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,128
They tried to trace the box in
Schools and restaurants.

56
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:58,863
They got nothing.

57
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,964
We know how he died?

58
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:01,389
Undetermined.

59
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,765
Look at the head wounds.

60
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:04,338
Look at the hair.

61
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:05,332
What's the deal?

62
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:08,336
One detective thought he was 
killed while getting a haircut.

63
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:11,139
Homicidal barber?
That's a cracked theory.

64
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,535
Check this out.

65
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,183
Cops put the body in clothes,
propped him up

66
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:21,608
thinking it would make him 
more recognizable.

67
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,494
- Creepy.
- They didn't think so in '58.

68
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,714
Not that I was on the force then.

69
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:28,967
We weren't thinkin' that, Pops.

70
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:33,094
The college kid who found the box 
turned into a frequent flyer.

71
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:36,408
He came to Homicide 16 times 
about the case.

72
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,355
Got obssessed?

73
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:38,775
Or was guilty about something.

74
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,596
Probably want to set 
up visit number 17.

75
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:43,434
So who do we think 
left the suitcase?

76
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,802
Someone who's been keeping 
a secret a long time.

77
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,348
Let's see if we can 
get prints off it.

78
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,758
We've got the name "Arnold",

79
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,151
and we've got this.

80
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,291
Maybe someone with younger eyes

81
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,898
can read the lettering on that bus?

82
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,180
"Fernwood Home for orphans."

83
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:14,408
Sisters Vivian Dole and Grace Ashley
ran the Fernwood Home in 1958.

84
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,708
They still got orphanages in Philly?

85
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,499
No, we got the outstanding
foster care system instead.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,513
Nuns. / What about them?

87
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:24,610
Tough ladies.

88
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,683
At least the ones who taught me.

89
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:34,035
I'm afraid Sister Grace died recently.

90
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:35,339
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:41,021
She gave 50 years to the Church.
That's a life well-lived.

92
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,360
You and her ran 
the Fernwood Orphanage in 1958?

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,714
From '52 to '70.

94
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,632
We had up to 60 boys and 
girls at any given time.

95
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,508
You must know these boys, then.

96
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,973
They look like Fernwood children.

97
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,807
But I couldn't tell you the names.

98
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,309
How about a boy named Arnold?
Remember him?

99
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,698
Wore a cowboy hat?

100
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,351
It's possible.

101
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,179
I saw so many children 
come and go, I just...

102
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,956
I don't remember them all.

103
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:15,379
Did you hear about the Boy 
in the Box case, back in '58?

104
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,157
I don't think so.

105
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,546
Kid was dumped in Fox Chase?

106
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,406
It was all over the city.

107
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,418
We lead private lives here.

108
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:28,034
We read morning prayers, 
not morning papers.

109
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:32,971
We know the orphanage is gone now

110
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:36,142
but there must be records 
from Fernwood somewhere.

111
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,203
I believe they're all 
in the basement.

112
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,909
But I'm sure you don't want 
to sift through all that.

113
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,282
Actually, we love that kind of thing.

114
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,180
Well, you're welcome to look.

115
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,759
There was one Arnold 
at Fernwood that year,

116
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,895
Arnold Culliver.
Six years old.

117
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,823
So the Boy in the Box has a name.

118
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,923
We have intake and adoption 
records for him.

119
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,004
Who adopted him?

120
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,552
Rubin and Lila Hanson, April 4.

121
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,442
Two days before he was 
found in that field.

122
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,931
He was better off at the orphanage.

123
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,832
Those parents got a lot to explain.

124
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:09,328
We'll track them down.
I want to meet these people.

125
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,109
Arnold came to Fernwood in 
'53 with a sister, Gretchen.

126
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,499
Can we find her?

127
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:18,956
There's a Gretchen Culliver 
listed in, uh, Roxborough.

128
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,627
Working in the city library.

129
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,921
You get the names of those 
other kids at Fernwood?

130
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:25,451
We can figure out who the 
rest of these boys are.

131
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:27,033
Maybe if the sister gives her DNA,

132
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,508
we exhume the boy's body,
make a positive I.D.

133
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:33,099
We're gonna need an ADA's 
help on this one, huh?

134
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,071
You know anyone?

135
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,309
- Want to go talk to Gretchen?
- Sure thing.

136
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:47,787
Arnold Culliver was my brother,
but this isn't him.

137
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:50,591
I know it's hard to look at.

138
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:55,932
Well, that's not my brother.
Arnold had curls; blonde curls.

139
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,258
Is he one of these boys, Gretchen?

140
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,497
Yes, that's him with his 
Science Club friends.

141
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,232
Where'd you get that?

142
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:10,163
Someone left it, 
along with this circular.

143
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,634
Well, that dead boy can't be Arnold.

144
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,809
He was adopted in 1958.

145
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,654
Sister Vivian said there's a family 
coming that wants a little boy.

146
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:22,519
They can't have me.

147
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,558
I wish they wanted a girl, too.

148
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:28,340
- I won't go, Gretch.
- You have to.

149
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,419
Even if we get separated.
You know our plan, right?

150
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,004
Meet at the horses.

151
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:33,821
When?

152
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,401
My 18th birthday.

153
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:38,715
Go to the Bryer Horse Fair, 
meet you at the horses.

154
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:39,961
Don't forget.

155
00:08:39,961 --> 00:08:41,953
I ain't leaving you, Gretch.

156
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,044
But he was gone one morning,

157
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:51,089
adopted late the night before.

158
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,163
I never said good-bye to him.

159
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:59,299
Did, uh, you go looking 
for him at the horse fair?

160
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,711
I did, actually.

161
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,262
He didn't show.

162
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,307
It was a lucky Arnold found a home.

163
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,820
He acted up a lot.

164
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,954
There were two families before this one
who had taken him and brought him back.

165
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,857
Because of his behavior?

166
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,736
And if you got too old,
you didn't get adopted at all.

167
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:17,413
You were stuck at Fernwood.

168
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,160
That what happened to you?

169
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,181
Yeah, I grew up there.

170
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,680
Any idea where Arnold went to live?

171
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,427
Oh, they never told us 
things like that.

172
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:31,155
I always imagined him with a nice 
family on a horse farm somewhere.

173
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,111
So nice, he forgot Fernwood.

174
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:35,693
He was very young when he left.

175
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:36,444
Gretchen,

176
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,271
would you be willing to 
give us a DNA sample

177
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,227
so we can compare it to this boy's?

178
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:44,341
Well, I'd be glad to but I 
know that's not my brother.

179
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,444
I'd offer a refreshment, but 
we don't got much in the house.

180
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,850
No problem.

181
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,484
So, what's it all about?

182
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:00,214
We got your name from 
Gretchen Culliver, Roger.

183
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,173
From the Fernwood Home?

184
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:05,031
Gretchen...

185
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,709
Was she one of the older girls?

186
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,253
Yeah. Her brother Arnold,
he was your age.

187
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,753
Oh, sure.

188
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,973
That's the Science Club gang.

189
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:20,534
- That Arnold was a cut-up.
- Yeah?

190
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,124
Leader of the pack, you know?

191
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:24,996
Drove the Sisters barking mad.

192
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,615
We'll make a posse.

193
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,873
Find that old girl and 
bring her on in.

194
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:34,920
I got the rope.

195
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,475
- Freddy, got your spurs on?
- Got'em, Sheriff.

196
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:43,854
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:45,572
We're going to the woods.

198
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:47,138
Bedtime was an hour ago.

199
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:49,445
We're gonna lasso a cow, 
Sister Vivian.

200
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:53,491
- There are no cows in the woods.
- That's what you think.

201
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:02,559
Yeah, he was kind of the 
holy terror of Fernwood,

202
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,756
so, of course, uh, well,
we all loved him.

203
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,081
Why are you asking about him?

204
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:12,368
We're working a homicide from 1958.

205
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,596
We think the victim 
was probably Arnold.

206
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:17,036
Oh, no.

207
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,135
Could you look at a picture for us?

208
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:27,019
Do you think that might be Arnold?

209
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,948
Arnold had blonde hair... curls.

210
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,098
And if his hair was cut off?

211
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:41,414
I couldn't say yes but... 
I couldn't say no.

212
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,716
I got two boys.
Adopted.

213
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,304
Hey. Anything off that suitcase?

214
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,684
Just that it was bought 
at Wannamaker's in '54.

215
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,969
Only the biggest department 
store in the city.

216
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,152
That was before credit cards,
so no records.

217
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,385
No prints on it either.

218
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,788
We got the okay from the orphan's 
court to exhume the boy.

219
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,097
Is his sister gonna give us a swab?

220
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,817
She's pretty committed to this
boy not being Arnold, boss.

221
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,150
She better get uncommitted.

222
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,398
Blonde curls or not, 
that's the same kid.

223
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,318
Find any of the other 
boys in the photo?

224
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:14,024
Two others are dead besides Arnold.

225
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,880
- One we just talked to.
- Yeah.

226
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,480
Says Arnold was a problem child.

227
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,786
If two different families took him in,

228
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,471
then changed their mind, 
he must have been.

229
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:25,105
So Lila and Rubin bring him home,
he throws a fit right off.

230
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:28,377
Rubin gives him a paddling or 
shakes him too hard, he ends up dead.

231
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:32,162
Well, what else do you do with a dead
kid besides dump him in a field?

232
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:34,033
Maybe there's a reason 
they're hard to trace.

233
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,037
You can't find them?

234
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,664
No record of them anywhere 
in Pennsylvenia.

235
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,452
We're trying the national database now.

236
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,968
Nut job.
12 O'clock.

237
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,629
Must be our rabbit guy.

238
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,455
Good luck.

239
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,536
Detectives Rush and Valens.

240
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:54,744
Walter Rafferty. I was the 
one to find that boy in the box.

241
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,636
Thanks for coming in.

242
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,564
You have something new on the case?

243
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:01,728
Possibly.

244
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:05,939
He was about six years old.

245
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,819
Wrapped in a blue blanket.

246
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,468
It was 12:00 noon on Sunday,

247
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,558
and I followed a 
jackrabbit into the brush

248
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,104
and I came upon a box,

249
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:17,768
a-a-a Liho Punch box,

250
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:19,158
and there was the boy.

251
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,249
Inside.

252
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,502
You didn't recognize him?

253
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,105
No. Absolutely not.

254
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,992
You weren't involved with him dying?

255
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:28,295
Absolutely not.
I took a polygraph test in 1958.

256
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,345
We know you did.

257
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,417
I'll take one right now.

258
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,380
I gave the cops a straight story.

259
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,255
You do any investigating yourself?

260
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:38,068
As a matter of fact, I go back
to the site every year on April 6

261
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:38,949
and I'm not the only one.

262
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,226
There's a woman who 
goes out there, too.

263
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,892
I...I seen her there for years.

264
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,626
Yeah. We've got that down here.

265
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:50,535
She comes with white roses,
wearing a green plaid coat.

266
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:04,174
You ever talk to this woman?

267
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,654
I tried a few times.

268
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:07,809
She didn't want to engage.

269
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:12,588
Why is this whole Boy in the Box 
thing so big in your life, Walter?

270
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,157
I guess you've seen 
lots of dead bodies.

271
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:17,925
Doesn't bother you?

272
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,130
Well, I'm not built that way.

273
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,910
This... this derailed me.

274
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,800
I wish I never saw that rabbit.

275
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,581
I think this Walter guy's 
on the level, boss.

276
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,818
Just gotten messed up 
by finding the body.

277
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:42,660
What do you think of his story
about the lady in the plaid coat?

278
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,891
50-50.

279
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,802
Even if it's true, what's it mean?

280
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,926
She could just be 
an obssessive like him.

281
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:49,297
How long you think this'll take?

282
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,764
One of your girls waiting for you?

283
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,855
What I wouldn't give to take a 
look at Scotty's black book?

284
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:57,164
You know what? Forget it.
I can go tomorrow.

285
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,745
Didn't want to miss the show, huh?

286
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,266
We finally found records
on Rubin and Lila Hanson.

287
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,369
And?

288
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,665
Well, there's a reason 
they were so hard to find.

289
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,987
They died in the 1887.

290
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,928
Arnold's parents don't exist.

291
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:21,899
Rubin and Lila Hanson died
before the trun of the century.

292
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,025
Buried at the cemetery 
at St. Emilian's.

293
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,959
The same church where 
the suitcase turned up.

294
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,048
So the adoption papers are phony.

295
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:31,064
So what happened to Arnold the
night he was supposedly adopted?

296
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,575
Maybe he died in the orphanage.

297
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,262
Someone on the inside covered
it up with adoption records.

298
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:36,397
Here's another layer.

299
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:40,121
Autopsy of our boy positively 
I.D.'d him as Arnold Culliver

300
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,651
from dental records, but, uh...

301
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,193
Arnold's DNA...

302
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,969
doesn't match Gretchen's.

303
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,513
So they're not brother and sister?

304
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,399
Then Arnold's intake papers 
were doctored, too.

305
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,163
So this kid came from 
nowhere and went nowhere.

306
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,297
Who signed these records?

307
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,432
Sister Vivian.

308
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,421
And guess who's not talking now?

309
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,917
Sister Vivian.

310
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,051
In seclusion.

311
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,432
Nun on the run.

312
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,473
Ever staked out a convent?

313
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,092
I'll go anywhere.

314
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,341
- Gretchen's gonna take this hard.
- Yeah.

315
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:13,634
How do we tell her that not only 
did her brother die 46 years ago,

316
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:17,681
but on top of that, he wasn't
actually her brother.

317
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,175
This must be a mistake.

318
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:23,447
No. No, I'm sorry.

319
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,263
Arnold and I came to 
Fernwood together.

320
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:27,070
Our parents were killed 
in a train wreck.

321
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,002
You didn't have the 
same parents, Gretchen.

322
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,306
Sisters Vivian and Grace 
knew about this?

323
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,088
I think they must have.

324
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,104
And they kept it a secret 
from me all this time?

325
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,073
You were young.

326
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:41,457
Maybe they were protecting you.

327
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:44,730
Gretchen, we know now that 
Arnold was never adopted.

328
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,429
There was no family that 
came and took him away.

329
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,054
And right around that time,

330
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:53,567
someone hurt him, 
bad enough it killed him.

331
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:57,901
The best explanation right now
is that he died at Fernwood.

332
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,729
We need your help thinking about
who could have hurt him.

333
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,779
I don't know.

334
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,700
Was anyone ever violent with Arnold?

335
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,760
Freddy Baker.

336
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,988
He's in that picture you have.

337
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,279
He beat Arnold up pretty bad once.

338
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,142
Who else?

339
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,765
Arnold got disciplined a lot.

340
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,194
By who?

341
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,858
Sister Vivian.

342
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,099
Why are you back?

343
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,607
I didn't like that family 
and they didn't like me.

344
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:31,705
They kick you out?

345
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:34,784
I ran. There was no one to play with.

346
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:38,115
Well, Arnold, what do you 
have to say for yourself?

347
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,392
Good to be home.

348
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:43,413
You're pleased with 
yourself, are you?

349
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:44,966
Didn't hurt.

350
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,196
Arnold's coming to my office.

351
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:49,852
Don't, Sister Vivian.

352
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:59,348
I never knew what she did 
to him in her office,

353
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,683
but he came out with 
a lot of bruises.

354
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,129
Would Sister Grace punish him too?

355
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,024
It was always Sister Vivian.

356
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:10,766
You ask Freddy Baker.
He ended up in her office a lot, too.

357
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,464
Fernwood, ahhh.

358
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:20,586
Bad memories?

359
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:22,288
The worst.

360
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:26,125
Sorry to bring it up,
but it's a homicide investigation.

361
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,326
Who died?

362
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,637
Boy named Arnold Culliver.

363
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,171
Arnold?

364
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,128
Crap.

365
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,015
That's one of the few kids I liked.

366
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:35,895
The way I hear it, Fred,

367
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,969
you were kind of a
bully at Fernwood.

368
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,384
Yeah, I'd run around dropping 
guys for looking at me funny.

369
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:43,736
Real nice kid, you know?

370
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,692
You ever drop Arnold?

371
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,160
One time.

372
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,500
But mostly I just left him alone 
'cause he had spirit, you know?

373
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,956
Gave the nuns hell.

374
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,547
He was popular, huh?

375
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,519
With the kids, yeah.

376
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,630
Funny thing about him, 
he loved it at Fernwood.

377
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,394
Everyone else wanted to get out,
he kept coming back.

378
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,381
What are your memories 
of Sister Vivian?

379
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,055
Mean old battle-ax.

380
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:11,241
She's the reason I kept my 
kids out of Catholic school.

381
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:14,502
She ever whale on you 
enough to do damage?

382
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,028
Sure.

383
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,683
She was sadistic.

384
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:22,040
So you think she could have hurt 
Arnold bad enough to kill him?

385
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,063
Are you saying Arnold 
died at Fernwood?

386
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,217
We don't know yet.

387
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:27,396
- I thought he got adopted.
- No.

388
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,348
Sister Vivian was pretty cruel.

389
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,535
But murder?

390
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,173
It might have been accidental.

391
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:42,988
I'll tell you it got pretty bad.

392
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:47,696
I still got scars on my back
from where she took the belt to me.

393
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,593
She used a belt, huh?

394
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,147
With me.

395
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,093
She mixed it up.

396
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,546
Spoons, paddles.

397
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:57,473
Had a lot of tricks in her bag.

398
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,867
I'm sorry as hell that kid died.

399
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,814
Sister Vivian.

400
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,315
You're a hard lady to get to.

401
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:17,086
- I'm in seclusion.
- It'll only take a few minutes.

402
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:18,506
I'm not comfortable with this.

403
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,697
You know, I'm not comfortable
with a few things myself.

404
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:24,150
Like Arnold's phony intake papers
and his phony adoption records.

405
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,328
I don't know anything about that.

406
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:29,112
And the fact that his supposed 
parents died in the 1800s.

407
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:33,782
I'm also uncomfortable with what I'm 
hearing about the corporal punishment

408
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:36,095
you gave out at Fernwood.

409
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:38,667
Raising Children calls for discipline.

410
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,402
Oh, you were extra rough 
with Arnold Culliver.

411
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,652
He had a serious behavior problem.

412
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:46,733
Oh, now you remember him?

413
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,147
Because before, you 
couldn't place him at all.

414
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,060
Yes, I remember Arnold.

415
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:54,204
He was a troubled boy.

416
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:56,810
And you just didn't feel like telling 
me and my partner that before?

417
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,289
We lead private lives here,
and I believe in discretion.

418
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:00,948
I don't like prying eyes.

419
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,408
Because they might 
discover what you did.

420
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,974
I didn't do anything out of 
the ordinary to those children.

421
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:08,206
You left kids with lifelong scars.

422
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:10,906
Maybe it sounds scandalous today,

423
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,084
but it was routine in 1958.

424
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:17,822
Mm. So maybe in a routine 
pummeling of Arnold one night,

425
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:20,585
he fell unconscious
from one of your blows.

426
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,635
Died, in fact.

427
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:24,903
You'd want to be discreet
about that event,

428
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:27,132
so maybe you cut off 
those blonde curls

429
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,921
so no one recognized him, 
put him in a box,

430
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:34,680
and privately took him to a field
and dumped him.

431
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,006
That's a remarkable thing 
to say to a woman of God.

432
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:41,383
Is it true?

433
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:43,754
No.

434
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,147
Why did you fake Arnold's intake
and adoption records?

435
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:48,082
I didn't.

436
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,608
Your signature's on 
both sets of papers.

437
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,303
Sister Grace did the paperwork

438
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:56,333
and I, as the senior sister at Fernwood,
signed the documents.

439
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,579
Was Sister Grace as fond of 
corporal punishment as you are?

440
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,153
- I won't speak ill of the dead.
- Why did she fake the records?

441
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,560
Why did she do any of the 
stupid things that she did?

442
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,170
Sister Grace was a screwup.

443
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,200
She was weak-willed, 
and she was unreliable

444
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,677
and she couldn't 
discipline the children,

445
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,428
and that's why I had to.

446
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,116
What's your name?

447
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,314
He's Arnold.

448
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,564
Do you like swimming, Arnold?

449
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,903
I like horses.

450
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,372
Afraid we don't have any of those,

451
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:31,466
but we do have a membership 
at the Haverford swimming pool.

452
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,980
Does that sound like fun?

453
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,054
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

454
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:52,204
Don't socialize with 
the parents so much.

455
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,452
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,172
Arnold just shoved a woman.

457
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:58,820
I told him, best behavior.

458
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:03,982
We have to control him, Grace.

459
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,225
He'll never get a home if we don't.

460
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,813
Could Grace have hurt Arnold?

461
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:15,129
Grace...

462
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,278
Some stories shouldn't be told.

463
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:27,548
Vivian claimed Grace was 
the one to doctor the records.

464
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:28,918
Is she offering a reason why?

465
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,788
She was mysterious about her.

466
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:33,501
And conveniently, Grace is dead.

467
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,276
How'd it go with Fred the bully?

468
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:36,663
He's a decent guy.

469
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:38,686
Adopted twins from Romania.

470
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:39,917
Did he do in Arnold?

471
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,912
Nah, but he confirmed
Sister Vivian was good and vicious.

472
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:45,724
Found the last kid in the 
photo, it's Paul Evans.

473
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,103
He add anything to the picture?

474
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:48,235
More of the same.

475
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:50,948
Loved Arnold,
terrified of Sister Vivian.

476
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:52,422
One thing struck us, though.

477
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,228
He said he couldn't have kids.

478
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:57,477
Yeah. First guy we found, Roger...

479
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,683
he adopted his kids.

480
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:00,129
Fred adopted, too.

481
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,386
That's what we mean.

482
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:05,830
Three out of the six boys on that photo 
don't or can't have kids.

483
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,989
Maybe orphans are more likely 
to adopt when they grow up.

484
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,271
Three out of six, Lil?

485
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,200
That's a cluster,
not a coincidence.

486
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,510
Gretchen said this is a picture
of the Science Club boys, right?

487
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,221
Right.

488
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:20,712
Maybe we need to find out 
what they did at this club.

489
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,296
Uh, the boys went to 
the Science Club on Fridays,

490
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,305
while the rest of us had music class.

491
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,303
Science Club wasn't at Fernwood?

492
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,589
No, they went someplace else.
So, took that bus.

493
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,326
- By themselves?
- Sister Grace went with them.

494
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:38,618
You know what they did there?

495
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:40,591
No. It was only for boys.

496
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:42,735
And you don't know where it was.

497
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,207
No, but I think that picture you have

498
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:47,104
was taken wherever the club was held.

499
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,109
Was it?

500
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,661
That building's not Fernwood.

501
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,775
Maybe we blow this up?

502
00:24:56,782 --> 00:25:00,312
Science Club was, um, 
just a weekly field trip.

503
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,328
To where?

504
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,612
A hospital-type building.

505
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:07,956
What kind of things did you do there?

506
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,257
It was different every time.

507
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,643
Could you give us a for instance?

508
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:17,172
One time we had a breakfast 
in the afternoon.

509
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:30,836
- Hello, Doctor.
- Sister Grace.

510
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,336
Hello, boys.

511
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,643
Do we have to give 
blood today, Dr. Thayer?

512
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:43,662
No. Today all you have 
to do is eat cornflakes.

513
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,053
We just had lunch!

514
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:46,808
I hope you're hungry.

515
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,785
It was fun.

516
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,194
Nothing scary about it.

517
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:57,466
Do you know Dr. Thayer's first name?

518
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,449
Nah, sorry.

519
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,275
Roger, we have to ask you 
a personal question. / Okay.

520
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,267
Did you adopt kids because 
you couldn't have your own?

521
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,887
Yeah.

522
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:11,694
That was your side,

523
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:13,314
not your wife's.

524
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:15,578
How'd you know that?

525
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:20,203
All three men still alive from 
Science Club confirmed as sterile.

526
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,745
How you gonna blame that on cornflakes?

527
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:22,417
I don't know

528
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,845
and I don't know what it's got to do 
with Arnold's head wounds, either.

529
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:27,189
We gotta find out what else was 
going on in this place, Lil.

530
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,910
Got a partial name on the building.

531
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,307
Uh, H-O-something-I-N-something.

532
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,000
Something... Institute?

533
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,786
Hoover Institute, in Fairmount.

534
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,938
So let's look for anyone
who worked there in '58

535
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:40,507
starting with Dr. Thayer.

536
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,457
Uh...

537
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,570
I got some, Lil.

538
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,953
Okay.

539
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:47,921
You know what, I can go tomorrow.

540
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:50,440
You've been saying that all 
week, Scotty, but you never go.

541
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,546
Yeah.

542
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,094
I'll meet you in 
the morning, Scotty.

543
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,176
First thing?

544
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,294
First thing.

545
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,174
All right, you want me
to auto-track Thayer?

546
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:04,536
Uh, maybe let me, boss.

547
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:07,621
No, I got to learn how to run 
this computer sometime, Lil.

548
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,279
Is it on?

549
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,175
Sorry I'm late.

550
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:29,353
The bus was parked right over there.

551
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,903
We know what was going 
on here in the '50s?

552
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,493
Government research.

553
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:35,828
Dr. Milton Thayer 
was using volunteers

554
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,009
including the boys from Fernwood

555
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:39,762
as test groups.

556
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:42,192
What was Fernwood getting in return?

557
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:45,194
They were paid a fee
for every boy they brought over.

558
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:46,611
I got the contracts.

559
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,184
Sister Vivian set this up?

560
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,476
No.

561
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:51,625
Sister Grace.

562
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:54,432
What kind of tests are we talking?

563
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,512
That's what we got to ask Dr. Thayer.

564
00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:58,774
He's an emeritus researcher here.

565
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:00,939
Yeah, I remember the Fernwood boys.

566
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:04,993
They were subjects in a series 
of radiation tests for us.

567
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:07,523
- Radiation.
- Right.

568
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:10,745
We heard something about cornflakes.

569
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:12,689
That was one of the methods.

570
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,227
How'd that work?

571
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:16,598
The milk was irradiated.

572
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:19,293
You gave radioactive milk 
to six-year-old boys?

573
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,401
Very low levels.

574
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:24,706
We also put it in the toothphaste and 
had them brush their teeth with it.

575
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:26,779
This was government-sponsored?

576
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:29,452
You're what, 30 years old?

577
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:30,169
Yeah.

578
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,382
So you don't remember the Cold War.

579
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:33,333
What about it?

580
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,236
We lived in fear of the bomb.

581
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:37,726
Radiation research was 
considered necessary.

582
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,252
It was even patriotic.

583
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:42,193
Did you know your tests 
left three men sterile?

584
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:45,056
We didn't intend to harm anyone,

585
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,859
but at the time, we were 
working for a cause.

586
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,112
So you don't regret the tests?

587
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:52,455
We worked within the boundaries
of what we knew.

588
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,388
Back in the '50's, we thought 
those tests would do us good.

589
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:58,436
We also performed lobotomies,
which we now think are barbaric,

590
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,445
but at the time, it was considered
cutting-edge medicine.

591
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:02,871
Uh-huh.

592
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:08,102
Can't help the times you live in.

593
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:13,742
So Sister Grace arranged 
the visits to the Institute.

594
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:15,451
Think she knew what she
was doing to these kids?

595
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:17,890
She was a nun, not a doctor.

596
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:19,340
And back in '58,

597
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,276
the culture was, 
doctor could do no wrong.

598
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,406
You didn't question them.

599
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:24,379
You didn't question 
the government, either.

600
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,056
They funded the tests.

601
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,507
Been looking into 
what else was going on

602
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:29,693
at the Hoover Institute in '58.

603
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:31,466
A lot of behavioral research.

604
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:32,542
What's that mean?

605
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:33,882
Trying to straighten out psychotics

606
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:37,883
by way of insulin treatments,
isolation tanks, electroshock.

607
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:39,544
Oh, God.

608
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,325
Tell me they didn't test 
that on the orphans.

609
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,368
That would explain 
Arnold's head wounds.

610
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,960
I auto-tracked an ancient nurse,
used to work in Behavior.

611
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,138
Still in Philly?

612
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:50,789
Sally Thurber, old lady now,

613
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,053
kicking it in a retirement community.

614
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,135
I remember that Boy in the Box case.

615
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,770
I never put it together 
with Fernwood.

616
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,452
No one did.

617
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:03,029
Those boys were darlings.

618
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,179
Did you know any of them?
Maybe they were research subjects?

619
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,838
Oh, not for us. No.

620
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:14,721
I just saw them around the Institute
in their...little gray uniforms.

621
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:18,805
I'd talk to the nun
who brought them sometimes.

622
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,233
Sister Grace?

623
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,395
She'd come down to 
Behavior once in a while.

624
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:25,510
Yeah? Why would she do that?

625
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,144
Well...

626
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:30,053
I suppose everyone's dead now,

627
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:33,307
so I can speak out of school.

628
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:34,684
Please.

629
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:38,373
She'd come visit Clayton...

630
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:41,881
an assistant in our lab,

631
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,117
a medical student,

632
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:47,108
and they were friendly.

633
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:48,939
Friendly how?

634
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:54,407
Well, more friendly than a nun should 
be with a young man, in my opinion.

635
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:58,318
He's a good boy at heart, 
but he acts up.

636
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,608
You look beautiful, Grace. /Shh.

637
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:05,096
- I can't tell you that?
- Clay, he needs a family.

638
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,259
I'm worried he won't get 
one if he doesn't change.

639
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:09,801
He'll outgrow it.

640
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,099
No. It's getting worse.

641
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:14,664
Please help him.

642
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,349
I don't know what you want me to do.

643
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,844
The treatment you give 
the patients here...

644
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,994
- That's not for children.
- Does it work?

645
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:25,540
It's very effective.

646
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,384
Calms them down, right?

647
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:28,685
Right.

648
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:30,821
I know it could help him.

649
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:31,774
Grace...

650
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,052
There's an adoption party tomorrow.

651
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:37,290
Please. For me, Clay?

652
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:43,600
Did you ever see the boy 
they were talking about?

653
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,702
That same night -- I was leaving,

654
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:49,848
I saw Grace again with 
that little boy in tow.

655
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:51,218
Where were they going?

656
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:56,099
I assumed to see Clayton, 
to get that treatment she asked for.

657
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,026
What was that treatment?

658
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,139
ECT.

659
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:00,731
Shock treatment.

660
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:05,218
I remember that night, 
because that's the only time

661
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:08,213
I ever saw Grace out of her habit.

662
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:11,031
I never even knew 
she had blonde hair.

663
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,884
What was she wearing that night?

664
00:32:14,635 --> 00:32:17,123
A plaid coat.

665
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,755
A green plaid coat.

666
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:28,821
Sounds like Sister Grace and Clayton
were some kind of item.

667
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,544
And he knew how to administer ECT,

668
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:32,709
which was supposed to 
control wild behavior.

669
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,571
And she wanted a boy controlled
for an adoption party.

670
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:38,283
There was a party 
at Fernwood on April 5.

671
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:39,963
The day before Arnold was found.

672
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,199
So maybe on April 4,

673
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,792
Grace and Arnold secretely 
come to the Institute.

674
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:46,260
She's wearing lay clothes
so no one recognizes her...

675
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,821
Except for Sally the busybody.

676
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:49,250
She's in a green plaid coat,

677
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,867
just like the woman our Rabbit Guy 
saw in that field over the years.

678
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:53,945
Probably Grace.

679
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,949
And before you give shock treatment,
you cut off the patient's hair.

680
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:59,048
Grace had the same coat, 
all those years?

681
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:00,921
How many coats does a nun have?

682
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,361
Why does she go to such 
lengths for this kid

683
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,110
when she's got 60 kids who need help?

684
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,254
Yeah. Why Arnold?

685
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:09,476
Sally makes it sounds like 
Grace and Clayton had a relationship.

686
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:10,312
Yeah?

687
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:13,427
We still don't know who 
Arnold's parents were.

688
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,651
And why Grace doctored 
those intake records.

689
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:19,338
That's sacrilegious.

690
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,998
Lil, she was a nun.

691
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,522
She was also human.

692
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:30,835
We can talk here.

693
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:34,688
You probably don't want the sisters 
overhearing this conversation.

694
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:36,198
What is it now?

695
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:38,613
We think we know who
Arnold's mother was.

696
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,911
I didn't want to tell 
the story of Grace.

697
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,719
I know you didn't.

698
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,346
But a little boy died, Vivian.

699
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,070
Her little boy.

700
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:12,369
Grace was... not a good nun.

701
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:13,591
No kidding.

702
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:16,625
She was dreamy. Weak.

703
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:19,019
She had good intentions,

704
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:21,495
she just didn't have self-control.

705
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:25,060
Do you know Clayton Waters?

706
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,025
He was Grace's ruin.

707
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,812
She was in love with him?

708
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:31,518
Till the day she died.

709
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:34,889
When she was 18, 
she came to me

710
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,679
and told me she was pregnant.

711
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:39,677
I probably should have 
just told Mother Superior,

712
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:44,037
but instead, I helped her go 
away for a few months.

713
00:34:45,423 --> 00:34:47,297
You and Grace were close?

714
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,587
Like blood sisters.

715
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,031
She promised to leave the baby
at a Pittsburgh orphanage.

716
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:56,569
But she just couldn't,
and so she brought him back to Fernwood.

717
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,847
And slipped him in 
as Gretchen's brother.

718
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:03,589
He became our cross to bear.

719
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:05,697
Misbehaving all the time.

720
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:06,943
Couldn't hold on to a family.

721
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:09,635
And he was getting older, 
less adoptable.

722
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,927
Did he know Grace was his mother?

723
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,329
We never told him...

724
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:29,836
but I think a part of him knew 
that he was home with Grace.

725
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,624
That's why he kept coming back.

726
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:37,083
So what happened to 
Arnold on April 4?

727
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,758
Oh, April 4... well...

728
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:43,520
On April 4, Grace was 
desperate to find him a home.

729
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:45,763
Right.

730
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,538
Before I tell you the rest,

731
00:35:47,538 --> 00:35:49,558
I want you to know that 
everything Grace did,

732
00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:51,582
she did because she loved him.

733
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,497
Vivian. Vivian!

734
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,054
What are you wearing?

735
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:02,623
Arnold's sick.

736
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:09,842
What in the world happened?

737
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:13,477
Clayton treated him.
To help him behave.

738
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,432
You're not supposed to see Clayton.

739
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:20,059
We had to cut his hair off,

740
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:22,892
his beautiful hair...

741
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:25,340
Did Clayton say he'd 
be sick like this?

742
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,197
He said he might feel tired, but...
Vivian, he's got such a fever.

743
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,364
We have to pray for him.

744
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,898
I thought it would help.

745
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:44,153
He'd behave, and then some couple
would want him, and keep him.

746
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:46,226
Say a prayer, Grace.

747
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:53,039
It was supposed to calm him,

748
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,694
to control him.

749
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,687
Grace never dreamt
it would be harmful.

750
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:03,165
Did Arnold make it to 
the adoption party?

751
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:04,960
No.

752
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:08,528
No, his fever got worse.

753
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,887
We're out of punch, Sister Vivian.

754
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:21,166
Mm.. th-there's a new 
box in the kitchen.

755
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,779
Where's Arnold?

756
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,552
He'll be down soon.

757
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:28,824
Go talk to people.

758
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,257
He's going, Vivian.

759
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:52,008
I'll... meet you...

760
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:55,837
Oh, Arnold...

761
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:59,120
I hope you know I loved you.

762
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:05,635
... I'll meet you at the horses.

763
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,088
What are you doing?

764
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:48,897
Clean the room up.

765
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:52,118
- I wanna come.
- Grace!

766
00:38:52,118 --> 00:38:55,224
This is not one of 
your little screwups.

767
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,915
This is very serious.

768
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:27,586
I'm coming, too.

769
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:02,181
# Rick Nelson의 "Sweeter Than You" #

770
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:13,597
# I could never be loved by 
anyone sweeter than you #

771
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:24,659
# And I could never belong to 
anyone sweeter than you #

772
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:30,179
# With you to stand beside me #

773
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:36,016
# I'll never be alone #

774
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:41,447
# And what more could I long for #

775
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:48,241
# than to have you for my own #

776
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:58,654
# My only desire is loving you eternally #

777
00:40:58,654 --> 00:41:09,585
# For no, no other love could 
ever mean so much to me #

778
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:16,783
# So if you say you love me forever #

779
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:21,021
# I'll be true #

780
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:26,564
# And what more could I long for #

781
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:33,254
# than to live my life with you #

782
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:43,973
# I could never be loved by 
anyone sweeter than you #

783
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:54,922
# And I could never belong by 
anyone sweeter than you #

784
