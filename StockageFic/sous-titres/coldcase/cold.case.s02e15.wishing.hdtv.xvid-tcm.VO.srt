00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,970
I want you to know I've always
thought of both of you as my boys.
March 6, 1993

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,270
Sarah.

5
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:18,902
I know you're right.
It's best not to cry.

6
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,686
Colin, are you ready? If we don't 
go seeing movie, we'll be late.

7
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,650
I can't find Mr Wilson.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,370
He can stay here.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,198
But I told him about
the movie.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,647
How the dinosaurs get out
and take over the island.

11
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:36,170
Honey.

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,343
Have you checked 
Wilson's hutch?

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,617
Hey, Mr Wilson.

14
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,080
Thanks, mom.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,774
I wish you could come.

16
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,413
I know, honey.

17
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:54,316
But I should rest.

18
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:56,180
You should rest.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,374
You're tired.

20
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,995
How old is Mr Wilson?

21
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:06,705
- Three, four?
- Can he go to the movie?

22
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,818
Is it rated R?

23
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:14,385
Honey, Mr Wilson's a rabbit,
so he ages in rabbit years.

24
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,428
Different from person years?

25
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:19,447
To you, Mr Wilson's young,

26
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,932
but he's actually lived 
a good long time.

27
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,846
A good long time.

28
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:31,804
Hey, what's wrong?

29
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:35,451
Oh, it's just...

30
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:39,996
Here you are, my big boy,
going out on your own.

31
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:43,008
- I wish you could come.
- No,

32
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:47,563
you should save your
wishes for something big,

33
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:51,201
- something important.
- Because wishes come true.

34
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,182
We need to go, Colin.
It's time.

35
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,850
Good bye.

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,977
You ain't cold?

37
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,950
Nope.

38
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,236
Hey, I got a couple more
hand warmers if you need 'em.

39
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,323
Those chemical things you 
crush up?

40
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:01,889
Nah, I'm good.

41
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,860
So...

42
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:17,691
- someone's leaving these at the grave.
- Yeah, anniversary of his death.

43
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:19,353
Three years running.

44
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,167
Kid died by train?

45
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,370
Filed as an accident,

46
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,516
but those make it look like 
someone's trying to say different.

47
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,541
Why not come in 
to Homicide to say it?

48
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:34,072
There's free coffee,
central heat.

49
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,902
- Lil, I know Chris told you.
- Let's not talk about it.

50
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:44,755
- If I gave you a wrong impression, 
- Scotty, we're at work, so let's just work.

51
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,336
Okay?

52
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,124
Look.

53
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:02,926
Philadelphia Police.

54
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,353
What's your name?

55
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,718
- Nathan Hicks.
- You knew this kid, Colin?

56
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,684
Yeah.
I used to take care of him.

57
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,288
So you know it's the anniversary
of his death?

58
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:15,632
- That's why I'm here.
- Come here every year?

59
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,583
No.

60
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,943
It's first time.

61
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:23,288
Never put anything on the grave?

62
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:27,315
I don't know what you're
talking about.

63
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,383
How about taking a ride
with us, Nathan?

64
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,299
Valens.

77
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:33,201
We saw Jurassic Park.

78
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,038
I lost him in the bathroom.

79
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,537
Any idea why he went
to the tracks?

80
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,082
They were familiar.

81
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:41,346
He'd walk that way
from school.

82
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:43,012
And how long did you
know Colin?

83
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,196
Three years.

84
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,278
I picked him up from
school a few times a week.

85
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:49,542
- Looked at his homework.
- So you were a baby sitter.

86
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,931
Well.

87
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,551
Yeah.

88
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,391
- He needed someone.
- Where were the parents?

89
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,108
Dad was out of the picture,

90
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,457
Sarah worked supermarket check outs 
as many shifts as she could get.

91
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:03,256
And Colin had some kind
of condition?

92
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:05,351
He was limited, needed
extra care.

93
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:07,909
So you and Sarah looked
out for him and then..

94
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,009
- Sarah got sick?
- Breast cancer.

95
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,350
It killed her.

96
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,112
Know who might've done these?

97
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,562
Anyone who disliked Colin?

98
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,438
Wanted to hurt him?

99
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,591
Only the people he knew at school.

100
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,330
And there, it could've been anybody.

101
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,980
Why's that?

102
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,970
Colin was loving, trusting.

103
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,900
Everything kids that age can't be.

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,303
So open season on the slow kid?

105
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,945
Where's Colin?
Have you seen him?

106
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,391
Colin Miller.

107
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,454
Thanks.

108
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,060
Colin?

109
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,612
Colin?
Colin.

110
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,790
What happened?

111
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,664
He said they were fly.

112
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:01,395
- He said he think them fly.
- Who said?

113
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,261
It's her... her birthday.

114
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,751
And he said she would like it.

115
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,313
That it would be magic.

116
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,382
They're all mush.

117
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:16,062
I can't get they're mush
for her birthday.

118
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:19,072
It's totally not as bad
as last time.

119
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,329
I mean, he still got
his underwear.

120
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,844
Josh, what happened?

121
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:26,301
Some kid told Colin that
he can make the Valentine's fly.

122
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,511
And them I guess he just
kind of flew.

123
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,714
- For a second.
- Some kid? Who?

124
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:40,931
Nathan, how is Leah gonna 
know that I love her if they're mush?

125
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,079
Make a wish.

126
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,776
Fountains are the best place 
to make a wish about feelings.

127
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:51,582
Everyone knows that.

128
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,316
I wish..

129
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:09,336
for Leah to know
how much I love her.

130
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:17,116
It worked.

131
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,508
I could feel it working.

132
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,761
What'd I tell you?

133
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,861
That was an average day.

134
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:29,700
There were worse.

135
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,374
Had Sarah tried to put him
in special school?

136
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:33,689
They had no money.

137
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,719
She paid me in 
sandwiches sometimes,

138
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,310
typed up my
college applications.

139
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,166
Would this kid Josh know
who had it in for Colin, at school?

140
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,096
Yeah, he was his friend.

141
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,618
Or the closest thing Colin
had to one.

142
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,868
You guys with the groceries?

143
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,320
No.
And we ain't housekeeping either.

144
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,410
Homicide.
Can we come in?

145
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,313
Yeah..
I don't really have visitors.

146
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:05,825
- Never guessed.
- I try to limit my social interface.

147
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,715
It's about Colin Miller.

148
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,568
Guy died 12 years ago today.

149
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,167
Yeah.

150
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,802
- What do you know about that?
- Train hit him.

151
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,975
Accident, they said.

152
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:18,676
You think something different?

153
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,753
What's this?

154
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:26,560
Just a picture of my old boss.

155
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:29,376
From before your limited
interface thing?

156
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,869
Yeah.

157
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,465
Well, it looks like the
same artist.

158
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,172
Josh, you trying to say something 
about how Colin died?

159
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:37,758
I don't know how he died.

160
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:41,527
Sit down. / Then why did you keep 
leaving these pictures at his grave?

161
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,805
- It's just something for him.
- But today you left one on my car.

162
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:48,087
Maybe I wanted 
a live person to see it.

163
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,752
Is this Colin on the tracks?

164
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,206
No.

165
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,148
That's Colin and me.

166
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:01,336
- The guy on the tracks is Mac.
- Who's that?

167
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,033
Don't.

168
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,214
Don't what?

169
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:11,227
Don't hurt Mr Wilson.

170
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,275
Is that what I'm doing?
Hurting him?

171
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,331
Yes.

172
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:23,492
Hey, you're right.
I can hear him cry.

173
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,463
- No, stop it.
- Hey.

174
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,679
I'll give you your bunny back.

175
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,239
It's easy.

176
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,829
All you have to do is
say please.

177
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,228
Please.

178
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:44,087
Oh, no.

179
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,758
Look what you made me do.

180
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,554
Now, whatever.

181
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,219
Stupid.

182
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,120
Pansie.

183
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,407
Retard.

184
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,984
You stay away from her.

185
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,990
You hear me?

186
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:30,379
That picture's us.

187
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,823
Our revenge on Mac if we'd
been strong enough.

188
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:38,517
So you don't act on these
artistic visions, just draw 'em out.

189
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:40,145
Right.

190
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:42,023
Who did Mac want Colin
to stay away from?

191
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,153
His girlfriend. 
Leah.

192
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,859
This have to do with
the Valentines?

193
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,406
The music room.

194
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,806
He jumped her.

195
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,005
Like.. sexually?

196
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,128
Colin was the nicest guy on Earth,

197
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:01,175
but I guess he's still a guy.

198
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:09,542
Sexual assault charge was
filed against Colin, then dropped.

199
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,969
We know why?

200
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,229
Matter was settled privately.

201
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:16,686
Guy messes with Mac's girlfriend,
Mac's got motive.

202
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:19,530
Colin have any history of 
violent behavior before the assault?

203
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,985
None. / So who did 
he pick it up from? Dad?

204
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,589
He had nothing to do with 
Sarah or her kid.

205
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,185
Could've been native.

206
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,161
The way I hear with those 
special guys.

207
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:31,613
Everything they lose up here,
they get back down here with interest.

208
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:34,552
Try DHS. Colin was special needs,
they'll have a file on him.

209
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,490
- Got the rap sheet on Mac.
- How does it look?

210
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,303
It's misdemeanor buffet.

211
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,819
Vandalism, resisting arrest,
simple assault.

212
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,556
Just my type.

213
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:45,058
Wanna go have a chat?

214
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,103
Leah's up with Jeffries.

215
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,669
Yeah, good.

216
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:58,089
I haven't thought about 
Colin for a long time.

217
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,711
It's detective Rush.

218
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:04,609
We heard there was an 
incident in the music room.

219
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,549
- Right.
- How'd it happen?

220
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,457
It was after school.

221
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:13,340
Colin came in, started
to kiss me, wouldn't stop.

222
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,103
Then my boyfriend Mac walked in.

223
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:18,074
Luckily.

224
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,980
You told the story a lot?

225
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,964
Yeah.

226
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:24,444
You know Mac gave Colin
a beating for that.

227
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,442
Your idea?

228
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,667
His.

229
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:32,827
It's the one thing Mac did
my parents approved of.

230
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:35,137
Your folks didn't like him?

231
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:38,219
My mother collects Emily 
Post books on manners.

232
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:42,111
Mac's big hobby was seeing
how far he could spit.

233
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,428
He was your rebellion.

234
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:47,140
Beauty and the Beast.

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,762
Every girl tries it once.

236
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,363
So Mac pummels Colin
at the tracks.

237
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:55,071
Any other fall out?

238
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:03,418
While Mac went after Colin,
my parents went after his mom.

239
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,368
Colin's father wasn't able
to make it.

240
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:11,529
He's not part of Colin's life.

241
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,778
I could change that with 
a civil suit against both of you

242
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:18,047
for what your son did to Leah.

243
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:21,371
Colin's sorry 
about what happened.

244
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:25,317
So am I. / Not to mention 
the criminal investigation.

245
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:29,431
Dad. / Colin isn't dangerous.
If he misunderstood,...

246
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:33,758
We can't risk 
his misunderstandings.

247
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:37,526
Well, you said you wanted
to discuss options.

248
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:40,329
Why don't we do that?

249
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:43,396
My family's thought it over.

250
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,808
We'd like Colin to leave school.

251
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:53,005
It could be the best thing for him.
Another school with kids more like himself.

252
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,613
Another school..

253
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,765
I don't have the money.

254
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:01,736
Maybe at home, or hospital,
whatever you do with...

255
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:05,094
- We do fine, Colin and me.
- Not if your boy can't keep it in his..

256
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:08,045
We do fine.

257
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:11,910
Ms Miller, 
pull Colin out of the school.

258
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,061
Or we'll go forward.

259
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,572
Civil and criminal.

260
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,227
Colin, honey, we're going.

261
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,415
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:31,032
You can have 
Mr Wilson if you want.

263
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:46,543
He was gone by the next Monday.

264
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:49,633
I never saw him again.

265
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,908
Sounds like you weren't 100% 
behind this meeting.

266
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,706
No,

267
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:58,540
or the beat down.

268
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,177
You don't think Mac hurting 
Colin did any good?

269
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,592
Made Mac feel good.

270
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:11,507
I'm not sure Colin even knew
what he was doing really.

271
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:15,361
But I know Mac did.

272
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,800
Yeah, I remember the retard.

273
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,277
You remember the beating
you gave him at the train tracks?

274
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:28,307
He tried to rape my girlfriend.

275
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,340
He needed a lesson.

276
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,220
A violent lesson.

277
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,163
I figured, a guy like that,

278
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,163
getting physical's the only
way he's gonna learn.

279
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,246
Some deep thought 
you put into that.

280
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,324
Hey, I remember the guy,
what else you wanna know?

281
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:43,266
This little school of yours,
it only had one session?

282
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:46,113
You ever feel the need to take 
Colin back down for a fresher course?

283
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:47,623
Wait, hold up.

284
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,128
You're asking about 
how he died now?

285
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,210
Yeah.
And if you killed him.

286
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,473
Get real, fellas.

287
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,394
You got a temper.
He gave you a reason.

288
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:58,267
What I gave that reject,
he had coming.

289
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,378
But it's what happened after
that's really screwed up.

290
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,963
Who's got the brewskis?

291
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,400
Great.
You guys are geniuses.

292
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,021
Stupid.

293
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,481
Pansie.

294
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,712
Retard.

295
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,268
- It's okay, Josh.
- No, it's not okay.

296
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,308
I make you tired.

297
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:31,080
I know.

298
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,374
- I make my mom tired.
- She ain't tired.

299
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:38,229
I'll have to stay with my dad
while she goes to the hospital

300
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:40,632
and get some rest.

301
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,186
She ain't tired.

302
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,538
She's sick.

303
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,956
She's gonna die.

304
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:52,030
No.

305
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,007
And your dad, 
he ain't gonna save you.

306
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,435
I bet he hates you.

307
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:02,096
I bet he hates because
you are too stupid to live.

308
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,718
Maybe I'll just put you
out of your misery.

309
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,583
Yeah.

310
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,772
It's what I saw.

311
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,810
I thought you were 
Colin's friend, Josh.

312
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,903
I was.

313
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,709
That's why you gave him a follow-up beat 
down after Mac and his pals were done.

314
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,389
- Oh, that?
- Yeah, that.

315
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:34,137
See, this is exactly 
why I keep to myself.

316
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:37,428
- To avoid stuff like this.
- Like what?

317
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:40,679
Like getting fingered for murder
because I happen to be weird.

318
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,148
What's the deal, Josh?

319
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:43,704
You're the second lowest
guy on the food chain,

320
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,741
so to feel powerful you go
and drop the lowest guy?

321
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,580
Makes you feel good for a minute.

322
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,911
I didn't kill Colin.

323
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,086
Nah, you just kicked his ass
and threatened him a little.

324
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:59,009
I know I wasn't great to him,
but I liked him.

325
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:01,146
Really?

326
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,970
Yeah.

327
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,712
He was nice to me.

328
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,633
It doesn't happen a lot.

329
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:14,401
New information from DHS 
about dad.

330
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:17,317
What about him? / He wasn't 
doing too hot financially.

331
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,795
Yeah, putting it mild.

332
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:22,051
Spent most of the early 90's
skating just the side of bankruptcy.

333
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,992
Never paid a cent in child support.

334
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,817
- Nice.
- Yeah, but not surprising.

335
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:29,685
Considering this guy divorced Sarah 
as soon as Colin's condition got found out.

336
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,947
- What's that, boss?
- Sarah's medical history.

337
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:37,093
She got through about a cancer in '89,
but it came back in '92 with a vengeance.

338
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,592
This kid's got all the luck.

339
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:40,797
Mom was dying and 
when she's dead...

340
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,216
The burden of caring for Colin
would fall on dad.

341
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:46,026
- Who didn't want him.
- How much of burden are we talking?

342
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,042
Couple of years with this,

343
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,807
he wouldn't have got out
from under.

344
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,094
So it's lucky for him Colin died.

345
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:54,099
Yeah, real lucky.

346
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,766
And we got a word for that
kind of luck.

347
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,604
Scotty.

348
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:18,434
Hey.

349
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,966
I found another place.

350
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:26,765
Starting tonight.

351
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:28,403
I ain't kicking you out.

352
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:31,735
You've been really nice.

353
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,426
But I'm going.

354
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,909
Today.

355
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:42,018
- I tried talking to Lil.
- That was brave.

356
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,257
She didn't really wanna go into it.

357
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:48,961
- Deep freeze, huh?
- Yeah.

358
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:51,501
I'm familliar.

359
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:55,666
Why do you two don't
get along so bad?

360
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,763
There was a thing with her fiance.

361
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:02,638
She was engaged?

362
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,852
9 years back.

363
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,720
We all loved the guy.

364
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,505
Till one night, she was out
late on patrol.

365
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:14,723
He has a beer too many.

366
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:18,315
I think I'm hearing too much.

367
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:21,345
Yeah. Okay.

368
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,621
I guess I just remind her that time.

369
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:27,960
Him.

370
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:32,427
Hey, Chris..

371
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:34,907
Yeah?

372
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:38,292
You've helped me.

373
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:41,326
In hard times, you know.

374
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,883
I know.

375
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,866
See you later.

376
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,708
- Richard Miller, Colin's father.
- I got 8 minutes for this.

377
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,179
It's about your son's death.

378
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,707
Big reaction.

379
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,294
- Wasn't really my kid.
- Biologically, you mean?

380
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:24,865
Psychologically.

381
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:28,358
Sarah and I, we broke up real
quick after he was born.

382
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:30,300
What was the problem?

383
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,025
Couldn't stand looking at a retard
when he was related to you?

384
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:38,879
Yeah, that was a problem.

385
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,903
All that kid ever 
brought me was trouble.

386
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,730
You can't mean emotional trouble
since you were never around.

387
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,829
So you must be talking money.

388
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,249
We looked into 
your finances, Richard.

389
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,797
Taking on Colin after Sarah
died would've ruined you.

390
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,379
So I killed him.

391
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:56,054
You benefited from his death.
It's something we noticed.

392
00:22:56,054 --> 00:23:01,277
Look, you can be shocked
or disgusted as you want. Fact is ...

393
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:04,352
I didn't care enough
to kill him.

394
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:14,663
And this is Hadrosaurus,
the duckbill dinosaur.

395
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:18,089
- Sarah, this has been nice, but..
- Mom says you're paleontologist.

396
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:19,929
Colin.

397
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,398
She says you go on digs
all over the world.

398
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,051
Trying to explain why you're 
not around.

399
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:27,246
Yeah, you know, I got a shift
starting, so..

400
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:31,494
Richard. I didn't ask 
you here just for cookies.

401
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,093
I need you to take him.
I'm gonna be hospitalized again.

402
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:39,964
You're gonna be okay.
You've kicked this before.

403
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,797
It's not like before.

404
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,182
I had to quit my job,
I've got nothing coming in.

405
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:46,476
If you don't take him,
they'll stick him somewhere.

406
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,037
Somewhere he belongs?

407
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,773
You've never seen those places,
what they do to him there.

408
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:53,956
- You're getting hysterical.
- He's your son.

409
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:56,655
How do you not care about him?

410
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:59,333
Just once, Richard.
Just this once.

411
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,369
Dad. I've got some pictures
of my mom and me.

412
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,333
- You wanna see?
- Colin, listen I'm sorry, but..

413
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,603
But you gotta.

414
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:06,645
Look.

415
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:10,288
This is us last year
at Halloween.

416
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,343
I'm a raisin.

417
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:15,199
And ...

418
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:18,625
this is us at Mother's Day.

419
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,157
- Who's that?
- Nathan.

420
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,599
He's my friend.
He loves me.

421
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,327
And mommy too.

422
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:27,387
Does he know?

423
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,589
You'll be fine, Sarah.

424
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:32,547
Looks to me like you've got
all the help you need.

425
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,079
Later I found out it was three years 
she's been seeing that kid.

426
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,254
- You think it was romantic?
- I don't know how she did it being sick.

427
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,109
But from what I saw,
she had him lined up.

428
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:49,859
And you can tell all that
from a photo.

429
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,565
That plus the next day
this kid comes by my house

430
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:56,112
cusses me off for making her cry.

431
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,138
I got get hit head 
over more than that.

432
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:10,872
Ladise.

433
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:14,319
Hey, am I interrupting the party?

434
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,019
My wife's baby shower.
I'm kind of exhaling.

435
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,586
You got a minute then.

436
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,463
Yeah.

437
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:22,834
We talked to Colin's dad, Richard.

438
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,249
Charmer, right?

439
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:28,968
He said your relationship with 
Sarah was more than professional.

440
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,186
What would you know?

441
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:33,554
So?

442
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:37,498
It wasn't romantic, 
but it was intense.

443
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,618
Maybe a little too intense.

444
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:42,715
- I had such big problems.
- Sarah and Colin.

445
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,296
What was wrong with them,
I couldn't fix.

446
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,227
I was a kid.

447
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:50,116
And it was just a job.

448
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,657
And you were getting out?

449
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:54,731
Finished two years of junior college,
got a scholarship to Middleberry.

450
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,239
- Vermont.
- Even up there I couldn't escape it.

451
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,817
No?
What happened?

452
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:01,110
I went up there for a week
to set up loans, housing.

453
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,501
And a few days, 
and I got a call from her.

454
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,380
- About Colin?
- She'd woken up in the hospital.

455
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,712
Didn't know where he was.
It had been three days.

456
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:10,599
- She asked you to find him.
- So I hauled ass back to Philly.

457
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,930
I won't be able to release
him in your custody without...

458
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,973
- I have it.
- ...the sign-off from a judge.

459
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,651
I have it. Just took me five hours
and about 80 phone calls.

460
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,360
I didn't design the system.

461
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,403
Why's he in a different section?

462
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:27,469
He's high risk.
Record shows a sexaul assault charge.

463
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:35,501
Beautiful.

464
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,985
Colin.

465
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,768
Colin?

466
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:47,778
Colin.

467
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,266
Colin?

468
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,144
Colin.

469
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:52,604
Hey.

470
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,728
Colin.

471
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,973
Nathan.

472
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,763
You came.

473
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,553
Are you all right?

474
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:14,100
I wished,

475
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,960
and you came.

476
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:25,136
That was Colin.

477
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:29,481
Middle of a nightmare,
calls the wish come true.

478
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,020
- You get him out of there?
- Took him home.

479
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,400
Stayed there till Sarah got back
from hospital.

480
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,011
That's a lot for a 19-year-old
to handle.

481
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:41,832
Look, I don't wanna sound heartless,
but it wore on me.

482
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:46,137
- It was...
- More than you signed on for.

483
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:49,214
You said he had that rabbit
with him.

484
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,941
Yeah, Mr Wilson.

485
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,552
You know how he got it?

486
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:54,201
For his birthday.
When he was 15.

487
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,683
No, 'cuz Colin have it
to Leah as an apology for this assault.

488
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,853
Sounds like him. / But if he had it 
at the hospital, he must've gotten it back.

489
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,460
What, from Leah?

490
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,031
Why would she go back?

491
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:06,069
- To see the guy who..
- Attacked her?

492
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,149
Yeah.

493
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,462
It's a good question.

494
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:21,693
You told us Colin gave you
his rabbit when he came to your house.

495
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,144
- Right.
- Know what happened to it?

496
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:27,018
- Probably got thrown away.
- No, actually no.

497
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,007
He got it back.

498
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,527
He got it back from you.

499
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:34,063
I don't know how.

500
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:37,790
Well, we have a 911 call
with your voice on it.

501
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,666
Calling an ambulance
from his apartment.

502
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:44,870
I almost overlooked it, there were so 
many calls made near the end there.

503
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,323
Sarah wasn't doing so well.

504
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:49,449
I know.

505
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:57,413
Let's start again.

506
00:28:57,413 --> 00:29:01,158
What aren't you telling me?

507
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,661
I went to apologize to him.

508
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,440
For what?

509
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,338
The music room.

510
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,715
The assault.

511
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,465
There wasn't one.

512
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:16,801
Nothing happened?

513
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:19,507
Colin was sitting with me
at the piano.

514
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,472
Started talking about his mom.

515
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:27,282
How he loved her.

516
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,959
Just like he loved me.

517
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:33,739
I felt for him.

518
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:37,421
So I let him kiss me.

519
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:40,500
- Then Mac came in.
- Got the wrong idea?

520
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,048
Yes. / But you didn't try to 
give him the right one?

521
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:42,946
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

522
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,957
Because I was stupid.

523
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:48,786
Because I thought 
what'll people say.

524
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,564
Leah's a slut.

525
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:55,853
Leah wants to make it
with the retard.

526
00:29:56,572 --> 00:30:00,752
Mac asked if he attacked me.

527
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:03,874
I went along.

528
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,609
Even when your 
parents got involved?

529
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,238
I thought, maybe Colin should 
leave the school.

530
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,763
Maybe somewhere else.

531
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:14,652
That'll be nice to him.

532
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:18,825
Well.

533
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,418
It didn't work out like that.

534
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:24,656
No.

535
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:28,904
How did you end 
making that 911 call?

536
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,817
It's freezing in here, Colin.

537
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:37,233
Yeah.

538
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:40,473
- How about some light?
- I'm not suppposed to see you.

539
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:47,245
Mr Wilson asked me to come.

540
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:53,091
I like him a lot. But

541
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,771
he really misses you.

542
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,461
I'm sorry for what I did.

543
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:07,708
No, Colin.

544
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,696
I'm sorry.

545
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,652
I lied.

546
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:15,190
You did?

547
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,241
Yes.

548
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:20,011
I said something bad happened,

549
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,924
but it didn't.

550
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:25,541
I told you you could kiss me.

551
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,085
I'm hungry.

552
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:35,402
Have you had lunch?

553
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:39,511
I'm not supposed to open
the fridge or the cupboards.

554
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:42,546
I'm supposed to wait for mom.

555
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:46,279
- Where is she?
- Taking a bath.

556
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:49,874
A long one.

557
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:54,642
How long?

558
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:58,229
She went in 2 days ago.

559
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,378
Where's that guy that takes
care of you?

560
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,813
In Vermont. But I'm not suposed 
to interrupt when she's in the bath.

561
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:09,868
I'm gonna go to Vermont with him.
If mom gets really sick.

562
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,289
Sarah was practically dead.

563
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:24,397
She had been unconscious 
for a day and a half.

564
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:27,020
And Colin got swept away
by Social Services?

565
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,377
They said they'd take him
to the proper place.

566
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:35,121
Colin thought he was gonna
live with Nathan?

567
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,070
I don't know if it was true.

568
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,793
Or just another lie someone told him.

569
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:46,221
It was mistake, Leah.

570
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,480
As far as lies go,

571
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,664
yours isn't the worst.

572
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,293
Okay. Hey, enough with 
the Ice Queen, Lil.

573
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,161
- Just hit me with it, all right.
- I got nothing to say.

574
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,286
What, you wanna drop this thing?
Great, but you ain't dropping.

575
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:20,948
- You're giving me daggers all day long.
- And you don't deserve that?

576
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:22,495
Lil,

577
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:23,886
I'm an adult.

578
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:25,978
I don't need your permisison 
to go out with someone.

579
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:28,045
It's not someone,
It's my sister.

580
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:31,298
So what's that to you?

581
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,736
You lied to my face.

582
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:42,102
You asked in front of everybody.

583
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,775
I'm gonna say with Vera and 
the boss right there?

584
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,195
Yeah, yeah, Chris and me
are stepping out.

585
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:46,390
Okay.
You're right.

586
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,265
- Lying was the right thing.
- I'm gonna see who I want, Lil.

587
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:50,823
Great.
Great, god bless.

588
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:55,757
I can't help whatever happened
9 years ago.

589
00:33:55,954 --> 00:33:58,655
She's trouble.

590
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:01,243
- Well, maybe to me, she's not.
- Fine, Scotty, but

591
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:05,421
horning it out with cocktail waitress 
won't bring back your dead girlfriend.

592
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:09,642
What's going on?

593
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,770
Nothing.

594
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:23,374
Turns out, Nathan was more active in 
seeing to Colin's future than he said.

595
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,170
Yeah, how?

596
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,936
Old records in Vermont show
he applied to be Colin's guardian.

597
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:32,476
Vermont. That's where 
he was going to school.

598
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:36,247
A registrar in Middleberry has
his request for family housing.

599
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,008
So Colin could live with him.

600
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:40,105
Well, he told me it was 
just a job.

601
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:43,645
That Sarah and Colin were getting to
be too much for him.

602
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:47,748
He might have worn it out,
but he was just getting deeper in.

603
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:04,884
I don't understand.
I've told you everything.

604
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,723
You didn't tell us you tried
to get custody of Colin.

605
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,734
- I didn't think it was important.
- Really?

606
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,264
Cuz I think the opposite. I think you tried 
to hide it, cuz you know what it was.

607
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:14,915
You felt trapped.

608
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:18,007
You got stuck with Colin,
your whole life would get ripped away.

609
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,521
Yeah, but how'd he say no
to a dying woman?

610
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:23,412
- That's not how it was.
- She was handing you a life sentence.

611
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,316
You didn't have the guts 
to just turn your back on them.

612
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:29,858
So your only way out was to
get rid of Colin.

613
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:33,073
- Losing him at the movies.
- Losing for good.

614
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,031
I loved Colin.

615
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,596
I wanted to take him.

616
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,740
- But they wouldn't let me.
- Who wouldn't?

617
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,187
The responsible agencies.

618
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,137
We got the call at morning.
I was too young,

619
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:45,837
- lacked the necessary skills.
- To care for a minor?

620
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:48,057
A minor with special needs.

621
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:51,879
Who posed to 
possible sexual threat.

622
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:55,921
If only I had been older.

623
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:59,077
- If he hadn't attacked that girl.
- Nathan, he didn't.

624
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:05,039
Leah let the story get out of hand.

625
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:12,211
- Well, if Sarah had known that.
- It would've been different?

626
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,094
She fought so hard for him.

627
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:17,267
I don't think anyone could've
fought harder.

628
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,825
But she was sick.

629
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:22,115
- And finally had to give up.
- With both of us gone,

630
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,753
the world was gonna eat him alive.

631
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:27,113
And we couldn't to anything
to stop it.

632
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:29,913
But you could do one thing.

633
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:38,412
Did Sarah ask you to take
him to the tracks that night?

634
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:50,677
It was never specific.

635
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:55,872
How'd it go today?

636
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:58,064
It's the end.

637
00:36:58,064 --> 00:37:00,466
With this round?
They're starting something new?

638
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:04,692
No, Nathan.
They gave me a hospice registry.

639
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:07,079
Hospice?

640
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,909
Where they make you comfortable
when there's nothing else to do.

641
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:16,239
So.. that's it?

642
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:19,716
That's it.

643
00:37:20,373 --> 00:37:22,163
Nathan.
You're here.

644
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:24,353
We can go to the movies.

645
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:25,764
What movie?

646
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:28,362
Jurassic Park.

647
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:31,575
You'll have to get your coat.

648
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:37,461
What's gonna happen to him?

649
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,054
I'll handle it.

650
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:41,510
How? They turned 
down your application.

651
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,989
Sarah, I'll handle it.

652
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:51,467
Okay.

653
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:58,119
I want you to know I've always
thought of both of you as my boys.

654
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,926
Sarah.

655
00:38:01,134 --> 00:38:04,567
I know you're right.
It's best not to cry.

656
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,286
Nathan?

657
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,624
I've been thinking.

658
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,722
Maybe if I wished I could
make mommy better.

659
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:18,740
Sounds like a good idea.

660
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,965
And I think I can do it.

661
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,119
Because that wish I made 
in the fountain about Leah..

662
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,721
Yeah?

663
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,450
It came true.

664
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:33,320
And them later, I wished for you
in the hospital and that came true too.

665
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,173
It did.

666
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:41,662
I wished by the phone where people 
make calls so you'd hear me.

667
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,824
That was pretty smart of you.

668
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,302
So maybe I could wish
and make mommy better.

669
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,831
Colin, what she needs 
is to get stronger.

670
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,028
Stronger.

671
00:38:56,907 --> 00:38:59,905
You mean strong like a train.

672
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,207
Yeah.

673
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:06,472
Then this is the perfect place.

674
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:10,757
I'll stand on the tracks

675
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:15,766
and wish real hard.

676
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:21,169
You think that'll work?

677
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,115
Sounds good to me.

678
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:31,059
Okay.

679
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:34,543
