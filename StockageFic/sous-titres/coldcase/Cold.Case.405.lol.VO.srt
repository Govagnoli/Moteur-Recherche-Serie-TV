00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,109
April 23,2003

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,609
Do I miss you ? 

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,649
Only when I breathe. 

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,979
Take-out tuesday,brent...your favorite. 

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,599
Take-out tuesday,my favorite. 

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,979
Ruby,off the phone. 

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,209
I got to go. 

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,959
Ruby,it's almost 6:30. 

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,979
It's not like you didn't see
the boy a couple of hours ago. 

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,699
Yeah.  Me,too. 

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,459
Totally. 

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,739
Doug says hi. 

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,439
Hi,doug. 

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,869
His parents still on the outs ? 

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,879
If that's what you want to call it. 

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,159
We're going to study later,if that's okay ? 

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,639
Study ? 

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,069
Yeah,dad,study.  Over here. 

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,949
'Cause the racket at his house
makes it,like,totally impossible. 

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,759
Somehow I doubt that's the only reason. 

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,009
can I just eat in my room ?  I'm starving. 

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,359
Ruby,you can wait 30 seconds. 

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,009
did you ever think that maybe
sammy likes yellow,brent ? 

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,049
- No. 
- Well,what if he does ? 

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,029
- What if he loves yellow ? 
- Ruby...

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,739
I'm sure sammy hates yellow,

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,149
- just like you do. 
- Three red flakes,

29
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,279
two blue,one green,no yellow. 

30
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,219
That's what sammy likes. 

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,149
That's exactly what
sammy will get,because...

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,889
dinnertime. 

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,019
So this kid,brent harris ? 

34
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,319
Yeah,one of the orderlies told me
about him when I was here on a dhs job. 

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,949
Parents were killed three years ago ? 

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,099
Well,found in their car. 

37
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,629
. 38 caliber rounds to the chest,neck. 

38
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,009
Well,it says here this kid,brent,was
at home when it happened. 

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,079
But you think he knows something ? 

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,589
Well,all I know is,I mention his parents'
murder,and he blurts out this number. 

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,519
What kind of number ? 

42
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,719
It's a long one.  I don't know. 

43
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,359
All right,we're here for a number ? 

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,319
Look,a lot of people with autism have
rotograph memories.  Details matter

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,449
,and I figured since I'm familiar
with this ace detective...

46
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,729
you mean me,right ? 

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,209
Yeah.  I thought it'd be worth a shot. 

48
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,219
I should warn you,though. 
He's,uh... he's not real friendly. 

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,359
I ain't lookin' for a friend. 

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,989
He used to be real high-functioning. 

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,729
- But not anymore ? 
- No,not since his parents died. 

52
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,709
Good luck. 

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,629
Brent ? 

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,459
I'm detective rush,and this
is my partner,detective valens. 

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,179
We want to talk to you about
what happened to your parents. 

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,889
They died three years ago. 

57
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,739
They were murdered. 

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,019
065739. 1. 

59
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,739
What does that number have to do
with your parents' murder,brent ? 

60
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,309
065739. 1. 

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,989
Brent.  Did you hear the question ? 

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,289
Brent,does that number
mei somethicb or what ? 

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,189
It's a wild-goose chase. 

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,489
Yeah. 

65
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,429
Kid doesn't even understand the question. 

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,989
It means something,scotty. 

67
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,779
What ? 

68
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,089
Harrises' car,night of the murder ? 

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,119
Look at the odometer reading. 

70
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,869
The same number the kid's been saying. 

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,899
Down to the exact tenth of a mile. 

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,889
Yeah,but that car was impounded. 
How could he know that ? 

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,809
'Cause he was there. 

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,099
He saw his parents murdered ? 

75
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,499
065739. 1.

79
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,419
steve and lisa harris. 

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,529
Gunned down a block away from their house. 

81
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,459
Theory was a carjacking gone wrong. 

82
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,989
Cold from the start.  No suspects,no nothing. 

83
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,149
According to the daughter's statement, parents
were on their way to the local drive-thru. 

84
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,859
These people had some serious bad luck. 

85
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,309
Six months prior to getting whacked,
their tropical fish store burnt down. 

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,479
Daughter said brent was with her at home
waiting for her parents to come back. 

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,539
Well,now we know he was in the car. 

88
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,199
- So why'd she lie ? 
- Good question. 

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,339
So this brent,can he count
cards,toothpicks,what ? 

90
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,369
All we know is he can't show emotion. 

91
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,169
Got to be rough, being a
parent to a kid like that. 

92
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,089
No hugs,no affection. 

93
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,329
I can't imagine. 

94
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,559
Brent, your sister said
you were home with her. 

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,959
Why would she say that ? 

96
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,879
Did you see your parents murdered,brent ? 

97
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,369
065739. 1. 

98
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,549
Did you see who did it ? 

99
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,389
Do you remember anything
from that night,brent ? 

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,189
Anything at all ? 

101
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,589
look,you were in the car,brent. 

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,419
You saw the odometer number,065739. 1. 

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,699
What did you see before the numbers changed ? 

104
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:31,349
What did you see when the
number was 065739 point zero ? 

105
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,489
065739 point zero. 

106
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,879
Yeah.  What happened ? 

107
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,909
The light turned red. 

108
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,829
"Are you high" ? 

109
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,729
Uh,the killer was wearing those shoes,brent ? 

110
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,599
Is that what you're trying to tell us ? 

111
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,379
He tell you anything else ? 

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,349
Yeah.  Um... killer's shoes. 

113
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,029
"Are you high" was written on them. 

114
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,089
- Are you high.  I went there. 
- Come again. 

115
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,149
Ritter union high school.  That's
what all the kids called it. 

116
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,049
So the doer went to the
same school as brent. 

117
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,609
It's not such a bad idea,
me bringing you down here. 

118
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,929
Serious lead on a double. 

119
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,169
Not too shabby. 

120
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,229
Maybe you should deputize
me like in the old west. 

121
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,259
catch up with you in a second ? 

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,329
So,um... I know it's been
kind of hectic lately. 

123
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,459
What's going on,lil ? 

124
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,399
An old friend's in trouble. 

125
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,259
What kind ? 

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,609
A long story.  It'S...

127
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,999
no.  I mean,what nd of friend. 

128
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,909
He,uh... he asked me to marry him once. 

129
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,709
You never told me that. 

130
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,979
Just a dumb pipe dream. 

131
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,339
Ray's not the settling down type. 

132
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,099
And you are ? 

133
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,189
It doesn't matter. 

134
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,309
I'm here with you. 

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,369
Are you ? 

136
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,179
Foster parents don't let me
out of this pit, but whatever. 

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,339
I visit brent every weekend. 

138
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,049
Barely says a word. 

139
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,589
How'd you guys get him to open up ? 

140
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,989
Asked him about your parents' murders. 

141
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,049
Rattled off a bunch of
numbers at the mention of it. 

142
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,449
Well,I guess that's good, right ? 

143
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,689
I mean,if he can do that,
maybe he'll be ready. 

144
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,949
Ready for what ? 

145
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,709
Living with me. 

146
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,919
I'm turning 18,moving out. 

147
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,479
You know,he's the only family I've got left. 

148
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,969
So,why'd you lie to the cops,ruby ? 
Say brent was at home with you ? 

149
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,779
I didn't lie. 

150
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,139
He was home in his room. 

151
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,859
No possibility you're wrong ? 

152
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,209
I was on the phone. 

153
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,799
I just assumed.  I mean,it
was take-out tuesday. 

154
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,079
Take-out tuesday ? 

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,379
Yeah.  Every tuesday night, my parents would bring
back take-out while I stayed home with brent,

156
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,549
- unless...
- unless what ? 

157
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,449
to people with autism,
routine is everything. 

158
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,129
So ? 

159
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,649
So sometimes,my parents
would bring him along. 

160
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,339
You know,try to get him used to change. 

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,679
So this could've been a practice run ? 

162
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,909
What does this have to do with
what happened to my mom and dad ? 

163
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,599
We think brent was in the car
when the murders took place. 

164
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,529
- No. 
- And he saw the killer's shoes. 

165
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,689
The words "are you high"
were graffitied on 'em. 

166
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,089
The guy who killed my parents
went to my high school ? 

167
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,249
Anyone come to mind ? 

168
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,849
Yeah.  A big tagger. 

169
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,849
Even bigger jerk. 

170
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,889
no touching

171
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,329
oh,crap. 

172
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,019
No,no,no.  No,no. 

173
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,699
- Here we go again. 
- Brent ? 

174
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,559
Ruby to the rescue. 

175
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,519
I thought we was tight, brent,huh ?  Homies. 

176
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,649
I thought we shared our work. 

177
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,189
No-no touching,no touching. 

178
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,209
now,give me the math homework. 

179
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,849
No touching !  No touching ! 

180
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,129
Why you got to be getting all
selfish on me ?  Withhold the love...

181
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,929
leave him alone ! 

182
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,319
Little miss thang, getting all gangsta. 

183
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,019
Look who's talking,moron. 

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,099
Stealing brent's math
homework when you're,like,19. 

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,099
Least I ain't the one
with dumbo in my family. 

186
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,989
No !  You just act like you're
not lily-white from the suburbs. 

187
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,469
- Shut up before I cap you ! 
- Bring it on,dumbo ! 

188
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,599
Hey,you want to mess with my girl ? 

189
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,329
I- I ain't got no beef with you. 

190
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,609
See,you mess with brent, you mess with me. 

191
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,329
That goes for all of you. 

192
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,439
You touch my brother
again, and I will kill you ! 

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,099
Not if I kill you first,skank. 

194
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,899
You say something, punk-ass ? 

195
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,279
No,dawg,I ain't say nothing. 

196
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,369
I didn't think so. 

197
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,459
Know what happened to this jackass ? 

198
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,369
Yeah,he dropped out of school
after my parents were killed. 

199
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,709
So maybe he goes after some payback
on ruby or brent, wearing those shoes. 

200
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,929
But the parents got in the way. 

201
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,739
got to say, not bad for a
white kid from the 'burbs. 

202
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,199
Or for a punk beats up
the special needs kids. 

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,729
I don't even know what that means. 

204
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,309
Ruby harris humiliates you
in front of all your friends. 

205
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,849
And her parents wind up dead. 

206
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,759
Ruby harris...

207
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,639
I do her ? 

208
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,769
brent harris's sister. 

209
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,129
The autistic kid. 

210
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,449
Oh,dumbo ! 

211
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,599
Yeah,dumbo that wouldn't let
you cheat off his math test. 

212
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,609
Why do you think I dropped out of school ? 

213
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,299
When dumbo's lapping you, it's time to go. 

214
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,329
Killer wore shoes,like the
ones you're wearing now,greg. 

215
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,209
That's impossible. 

216
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,249
I mean,these dogs ain't even that old. 

217
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,599
I just made 'em this past year. 

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,039
So maybe you were wearing a prototype. 

219
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,589
Lady,you know how many pairs of
shoes I've customized for people ? 

220
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,039
We're only interested in one pair. 

221
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,859
Said "are you high" on them. 

222
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,909
That narrows it to,like,a hundred. 

223
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,009
So you just let it go,then ? 

224
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,769
Ruby dissing you in front of all your pals ? 

225
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,469
I didn't just let it go.  But I
sure the hell didn't kill nobody. 

226
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,509
What did you do ? 

227
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,339
I got some practice in. 

228
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,189
Wasn't my finest work,but...

229
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,129
Principal's office. 

230
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,419
What the hell happened ? 

231
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,109
Brent,mom and dad are here,all right ? 

232
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,409
We're going to take you home. 

233
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,509
So you can see sammy. 

234
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,059
He misses you. 

235
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,409
Sammy's a fish.  He doesn't miss people. 

236
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,989
Did you do this ? 

237
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,279
Do what ?  I'm here for a
student council meeting,dawg. 

238
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,499
- Mr.  And mrs.  Harris, I am so sorry. 
- Sorry ? 

239
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,719
You promised you'd have
someone looking out for brent. 

240
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,179
- The state mandates it. 
- The state bud

241
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,979
gets one special needs counselor
for the entire ninth grade. 

242
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,369
I can't tell you how sick to
death we are of your excuses. 

243
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,799
If you have a problem with the way
the special needs program is run...

244
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,729
don't you dare tell us to write
another letter or call the school board,

245
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,819
because we've already
done that a dozen times ! 

246
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,079
It's okay.  It's over. 

247
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,479
We are officially withdrawing
brent from your school. 

248
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,319
Well,that is your prerogative. 

249
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,389
You're glad,aren't you ? 

250
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,949
I think brent might be
happier in another school,yes. 

251
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,689
But I know the alternatives are expensive. 

252
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,409
Yeah,they are expensive. 

253
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,639
Too expensive. 

254
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,619
There's no turning back now. 

255
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,649
Come on,brent. 

256
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,299
it's time for plan b

257
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,909
Plan b ? 

258
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,039
Any idea what that could've meant ? 

259
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,279
Hey,I'm the guy who needed to
cheat off the dummy,remember ? 

260
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,569
I been reading up on autism. 

261
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,369
- Yeah ? 
- They can't lie. 

262
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,049
Incapable of it. 

263
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,839
No kidding. 

264
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,529
Same with humor.  They don't get it. 

265
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,529
You say something like,
"guy was high as a kite. "

266
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,379
And they're like,"how could
a guy be high as a kite ? 

267
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,809
He weighs too much. "

268
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,349
Riveting. 

269
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,369
hello,brent. 

270
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,829
Remember me ?  Detective valens. 

271
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,329
9136. 

272
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,279
- That's my badge number. 
- Neat trick. 

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,809
It's all about triggers. 
I say,"detective valens. "

274
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,029
9136. 

275
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,459
And he coughs up.  I get it. 

276
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,859
Listen,kid,I want to ask
you some questions.  Okay ? 

277
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,029
- Hey. 
- vera. 

278
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,149
You remember when your parents pulled
you out of ritter union high school,brent ? 

279
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,529
You were covered in yellow spray paint. 

280
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,249
You don't like yellow, do you,brent ? 

281
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,809
Three red flakes,two
blue, one green,no yellow. 

282
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,009
Not my favorite color,either. 

283
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,859
Well,now that we got that settled. 

284
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,799
As your parents were leaving
the principal's office,

285
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,429
your dad said, "it's time for plan B. "

286
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,449
Save sammy. 

287
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,319
Plan b meant "save sammy" ? 

288
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,659
Plan B.  Save sammy. 

289
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,779
Who the hell is sammy ? 

290
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,419
Plan B. 

291
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,339
Save sammy. 

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,069
So sammy's a fish ? 

293
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,439
Siamese fighting fish.  Betta
splendens.  Indigenous to thailand. 

294
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,609
Males live alone...

295
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,639
who saved sammy,brent ? 

296
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,379
Doug saved sammy. 

297
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,549
Doug,your sister's boyfriend ? 

298
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,959
Doug says hi. 

299
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,339
Is that a yes ? 

300
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,469
You did good,brent.  Real...

301
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,349
good. 

302
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,819
Had a talk with brent,doug. 

303
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,639
Brent's talking ? 

304
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,259
That's great. 

305
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,049
Maybe not so great for you. 

306
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,650
Why's that ? 

307
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,739
He put you at the scene
of his parents' murders. 

308
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,889
No way.  That can't be. 

309
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,729
Says you. 

310
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,119
I was at the batting cages.  I didn't
clock out till 9:00.  You can check. 

311
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,499
We will. 

312
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,179
Besides,i loved that kid.  His
whole family, not just ruby. 

313
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,679
- You still in contact with her ? 
- No. 

314
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,169
After her parents died, she froze me out. 

315
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,579
Why's that ? 

316
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,779
I hung out with the harrises a lot on account
of my family being a total disaster area. 

317
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,519
So you reminded ruby too much of the past ? 

318
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,089
That's what I like to think,anyway. 

319
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,119
Better than the alternative. 

320
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,489
That she stopped loving me ? 

321
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,919
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 

322
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,309
Brent was real specific,doug. 

323
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,569
Said you saved sammy. 

324
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,439
Saved sammy ? 

325
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,499
Said you picked his cup off the floor
of the car the night of the murder. 

326
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,649
Yeah.  I know what he's talking about. 

327
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,299
Oh,yeah ? 

328
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,539
You see,autistics like brent,
they can't keep time straight. 

329
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,759
You made a study ? 

330
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,009
No.  Ruby told me. 

331
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,939
You see,it's like brent can't
keep things in sequence,you know ? 

332
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,519
Like,he talks about yesterday or a year
ago like it happened at the same time. 

333
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,699
What's that got to do with brent
placing you at the crime scene ? 

334
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,909
Everything.  'Cause I did save sammy. 

335
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,219
Just not the night he was talking about. 

336
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,309
No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No,no,no. 

337
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,739
Go back to your room,brent. 

338
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,719
No.  No,no,no.  No,sammy
doesn't like other fish. 

339
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,129
Brent,calm down. 

340
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,919
No,this is sammy's house. 

341
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,139
You're right,brent, this is sammy's house. 

342
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,339
And no one's gonna hurt him. 

343
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,729
He's going to start stimming for sure. 

344
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,909
No... the fish store is their house. 

345
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,299
Brent,remember how we
talked about transitions ? 

346
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,159
Well,this is one of them. 

347
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,859
You're just going to have to get
used to these fish being here. 

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:25,309
No,no,no,no.  No.  No,no,no,no. 

349
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,629
Save sammy !  Save sammy !  Save...

350
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,699
it's okay,brent.  See ?  It's okay, brent,look. 

351
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,879
See,look,i saved sammy.  He's fine. 

352
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,789
doug saved sammy. 

353
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,389
Yeah,he did. 

354
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,699
You know what,brent ? 

355
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,459
I bet sammy would like
to look at the other fish. 

356
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,809
Betta splendens.  Males live alone. 

357
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,549
Just-just look, not go near them. 

358
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,809
Just look,okay ? 

359
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,399
See,brent.  He likes it.  I can tell. 

360
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,809
what were the harrises doing with
all those fish in the basement ? 

361
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,749
I promised i wouldn't say. 

362
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,679
When did this happen,doug ? 

363
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,579
this was before the fire,wasn't it ? 

364
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,159
Yeah. 

365
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,569
They didn't want to kill their own fish. 

366
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,469
So they brought them home. 

367
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,309
That's what plan b was. 

368
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,689
Burning down their own store. 

369
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,840
so they're finally kicking

370
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,000
you out of here,huh ? 

371
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,070
I'm driving the nurses

372
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,500
to distraction. 

373
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,630
Keep coming in

374
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,880
and giving me sponge baths. 

375
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,430
It's nice your guy

376
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,300
let you come visit. 

377
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm here to say good-bye,ray. 

378
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,330
Good-bye,good-bye ? 

379
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,540
Like sayonara ?  Adios ?  Forever ? 

380
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,430
This isn't a joke. 

381
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,320
Who's laughing ? 

382
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,280
Um...

383
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,410
I'm leaving in the morning. 

384
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,670
Back to jersey ? 

385
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,950
Nah. 

386
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,050
I'm thinking maybe california. 

387
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,130
California. 

388
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
Wow. 

389
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,540
Yeah. 

390
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,020
You know this guy,

391
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,160
he's just a rookie. 

392
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,190
We go way back,lil. 

393
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,740
I know. 

394
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,700
So come with me ? 

395
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,360
I got to stop running sometime. 

396
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm ain't running

397
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,600
from anything. 

398
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,400
I meant me. 

399
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,170
Then stay. 

400
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,940
Bye. 

401
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,140
Bye. 

402
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,800
Bye. 

403
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,790
Your brother may not

404
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,150
be able to lie,ruby. 

405
00:22:59,210 --> 00:22:59,780
But you don't seem

406
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,360
to have any problem with it. 

407
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,670
What are you talking about ? 

408
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,260
The fish store. 

409
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,770
Your parents

410
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,950
burning it down. 

411
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,110
My parents were the best,

412
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,670
so don't you dare. 

413
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,290
You got a temper,ruby ? 

414
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,180
When it comes to people

415
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,000
talking trash

416
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,090
about my family,yeah,I do. 

417
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,550
Ever occur to you that arson

418
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,210
might've had something

419
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,010
to do with their murder ? 

420
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,490
My parents did what they had to do. 

421
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,960
They had to burn down their own store ? 

422
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,740
They were desperate. 

423
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,170
Why ? 

424
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,010
Because a couple months

425
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,870
before they yanked

426
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,830
brent out of school,

427
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,290
this jerk offered them

428
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,470
something they couldn't resist. 

429
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,560
What ? 

430
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,340
Hope. 

431
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,180
On the autism spectrum

432
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,220
disorder,mr.  Harvey,

433
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,990
high functioning. 

434
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,290
He knows everything there is

435
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,940
to know about tropical fish. 

436
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,780
And he's excellent at math,

437
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,750
aren't you,brent ? 

438
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,590
I'm in algebra 1a. 

439
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,130
Well,that's terrific. 

440
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
But here at north bend,

441
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,680
our real focus is on emotional

442
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,960
and social development. 

443
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,240
That's great.  That's just

444
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,380
what we're looking for. 

445
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,620
Here's an example

446
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,190
of what I'm talking about. 

447
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,220
That's jason.  When he came

448
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,900
to north bend,

449
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,570
he wouldn't let

450
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,210
anyone near him. 

451
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,380
Now look at him. 

452
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,810
That's amazing. 

453
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,570
Has brent ever hugged you ? 

454
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,620
Or held your hand ? 

455
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,060
Touched your face ? 

456
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,610
No. 

457
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,350
Well,

458
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,670
that's the hope we hold out

459
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,890
for parents here at north bend. 

460
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,620
But there is

461
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,890
one obstacle. 

462
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm afraid we have a

463
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,950
waiting list. 

464
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,610
How long ? 

465
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,880
We're not even taking names. 

466
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,810
There is

467
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,460
an alternative,however. 

468
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,920
It's,uh,an

469
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,650
incentive program. 

470
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,840
One where I see

471
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,470
to it that

472
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,710
brent's name goes to the top

473
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,530
of the waiting list. 

474
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,550
You see to it ? 

475
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,590
Yes. 

476
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,850
For an incentive. 

477
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,630
How much ? 

478
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,420
20 grand.  In cash. 

479
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,560
So your parents

480
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,610
burned their own store

481
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,610
to pay the bribe ? 

482
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,230
Except the insurance company boned us. 

483
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,870
Said the store

484
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,190
had faulty wirG. 

485
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,160
Never paid the claim. 

486
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,760
Your mom and dad

487
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,880
must've been devastated. 

488
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,550
They were. 

489
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,330
They lost everything

490
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,620
trying to pay off that pimp. 

491
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,770
But they were determined,right ? 

492
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,240
Desperate. 

493
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,840
Would've done anything. 

494
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,830
So what if they went

495
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,510
back to him ? 

496
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,230
Turned the tables. 

497
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,650
Used his bribe against him. 

498
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,310
Got to hand it to you,harvey. 

499
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,850
Heck of a scheme. 

500
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,910
Extorting

501
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,730
desperate parents. 

502
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,250
That's offensive. 

503
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,080
You make $42,000 a year

504
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,470
and live in an $800,000

505
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,930
waterfront condo. 

506
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,540
I have dedicated my

507
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,870
life to this school. 

508
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,870
To these kids. 

509
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:41,990
doesn'explain cbe

510
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,030
discrepancy in your finances. 

511
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,610
Do I receive gifts every now

512
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,950
and then from grateful parents ? 

513
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,550
Yes.  Guilty. 

514
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,880
Now what about people who can't afford

515
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,100
to give you gifts ? 

516
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,890
People like the harrises. 

517
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,700
The harrises ? 

518
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,730
Yeah,they came to you,

519
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,550
threatened to expose your

520
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,940
little incentive program. 

521
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,530
Oh,they never

522
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,090
threatened me. 

523
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,120
Sure about that ? 

524
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,850
Yeah,they begged me

525
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,380
to let their kid in. 

526
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,490
And you said no. 

527
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,690
I gave them my best advice. 

528
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,700
Gratis. 

529
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,190
Which was ? 

530
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,510
There's a school in vermont

531
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,250
for kids with autism. 

532
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,590
Doesn't charge tuition. 

533
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,240
Vermont ? 

534
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,550
Yeah.  I even made some

535
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,160
calls for them. 

536
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,560
Made sure their kid could get in. 

537
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,240
And did he ? 

538
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,170
Yes.  They were going

539
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,390
to move there. 

540
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,130
The whole family ? 

541
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,770
I'm all about the kids. 

542
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah,you're a real champ. 

543
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,420
Joseph. 

544
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,920
I found a place for ruby

545
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,250
at a halfway house. 

546
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,860
She can live there

547
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,780
with brent if she wants. 

548
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,350
I've been calling you. 

549
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,170
Went by your apartment

550
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,340
last night,'cause I thought we

551
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,610
were going to talk,but...

552
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,590
you never showed up. 

553
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,650
I was at the hospital. 

554
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,430
With him. 

555
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,280
Saying good-bye. 

556
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
And after...

557
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,720
I walked all night. 

558
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,500
Now I'm here. 

559
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,220
With you. 

560
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,940
Sounds like it was

561
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,780
a tough decision. 

562
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,550
It was. 

563
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,300
It's just that,

564
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,020
ray knows me. 

565
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,770
Everything about me. 

566
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,890
And maybe if you let me in,

567
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,830
I'll leave you,too ? 

568
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,870
Ray never left me. 

569
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,640
No.  He's just never around. 

570
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,910
I mean maybe

571
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,640
that's what you really want. 

572
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,660
No. 

573
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,740
I want to be with you. 

574
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,870
What,for like a week,

575
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,990
a month,then what ? 

576
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,020
Can't we try ? 

577
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,950
I left your keys on the table. 

578
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,740
Don't leave,joseph. 

579
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,460
Please. 

580
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,180
Look,I'm not your

581
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,550
consolation prize. 

582
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,770
I don't want to be alone. 

583
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,590
Maybe you do. 

584
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Why not go to the normal

585
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,860
sibling,ask about vermont ? 

586
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,410
'Cause the sister lies. 

587
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,780
And your boy brent can'T. 

588
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,800
That's right. 

589
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,730
Take off your tie. 

590
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,770
What ? 

591
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,760
Your tie,it's yellow. 

592
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,800
Brent hates yellow. 

593
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,560
Forget it. 

594
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,740
No way. 

595
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,450
Uh,it's detective

596
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,130
valens,brent. 

597
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,320
9136. 

598
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,460
That's right. 

599
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,020
Your parents cared a

600
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,250
lot about you,brent. 

601
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,530
You know that ? 

602
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,170
Mom and dad. 

603
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,400
They cared so much they

604
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,880
were planning on moving

605
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,720
so that you could go

606
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,440
to a better school. 

607
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,570
A school in vermont. 

608
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,450
345652sw38. 

609
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,310
What do those numbers have

610
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,400
to do with vermont,brent ? 

611
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,030
Vermont. 

612
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,040
345652sw38. 

613
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,920
Brent,where did you

614
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,380
see those numbers ? 

615
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
Okay. 

616
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,140
Okay. 

617
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,530
Okay,okay. 

618
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,310
Forget vermont. 

619
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,070
I know what that number is,

620
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,100
at least the last part. 

621
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,240
What ? 

622
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,750
Sw38. 

623
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,480
Smith and wesson . 38. 

624
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,650
So the first part must

625
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,480
be the serial number. 

626
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,040
Kid,you just gave us the gun. 

627
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,690
It's all about triggers,boss. 

628
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,280
Triggers ? 

629
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,840
Yeah. 

630
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,690
Say the right word,

631
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,780
you get the right answer. 

632
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,070
So you're clueing into brent ? 

633
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,320
I don't want to take all the credit. 

634
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,530
I mean,

635
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,040
scotty was there. 

636
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I got it. 

637
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,670
The serial number. 

638
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,800
Who's the gun registered to ? 

639
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,860
Steve harris. 

640
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,080
Brent's dad ? 

641
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,820
Parents were killed

642
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,420
with their own gun. 

643
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,450
Your parents were killed

644
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,760
with their own gun,ruby. 

645
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,230
I don't know what you're talking about. 

646
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,450
A gun you had access to. 

647
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,220
You think I killed

648
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,970
my own parents ? 

649
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,460
You didn't want to move to vermont. 

650
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,980
Vermont. 

651
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,980
Yeah. 

652
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,600
We know about that,ruby. 

653
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,860
Moving away from doug. 

654
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,150
Your amazing boyfriend. 

655
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,660
"Forget vermont,"

656
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,350
your parents said

657
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,260
right before they were shot. 

658
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,680
That's why they were killed. 

659
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,770
None of us wanted to move. 

660
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,800
But they said we had to,

661
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,380
for brent. 

662
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,570
It was always about brent,wasn't it ? 

663
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,950
Your cross to bear. 

664
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,720
I understood. 

665
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,310
You know,I have a sister,ruby. 

666
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,290
A real screw up. 

667
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,020
And no matter how perfect I was,

668
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,230
my mom was all about her. 

669
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,760
It was like I didn't even exist. 

670
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,130
That's not how it was with us. 

671
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
Oh,yeah ? 

672
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,470
You didn't bail brent

673
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,790
out of trouble all the time ? 

674
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,070
You didn't hate them

675
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,780
for ignoring you. 

676
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,750
For a freak ? 

677
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,890
Don't call him that. 

678
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,900
He didn't mean to do it. 

679
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,590
Do what ? 

680
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,250
What did brent do,ruby ? 

681
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,540
That night...

682
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,210
the night

683
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,390
your parents were killed ? 

684
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,770
Brent came home...

685
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,510
and all the roads

686
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,830
we have to walk wind

687
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:24,420
and all the lights

688
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,510
that lead the way are blind there are many things

689
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,060
that I would

690
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,600
like to say to you,

691
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,630
but I don't know how

692
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,540
I said maybe

693
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,390
you're gonna be the one

694
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,600
that saves me

695
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,900
and after all

696
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,660
you're my wonderwall. 

697
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,540
I buried his clothes

698
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,780
and the gun in the backyard. 

699
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,100
Okay,ruby. 

700
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,000
I won't be able to take care

701
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,090
of brent now,will I ? 

702
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,550
No. 

703
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,810
It's me,brent,

704
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,720
detective valens. 

705
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,160
9136. 

706
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,580
That's right. 

707
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,060
We talked to your sister ruby. 

708
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,510
She told us what happened. 

709
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,650
You were in the car

710
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,260
with your parents

711
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,970
when they were murdered. 

712
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,340
065739. 1. 

713
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,040
That's right,brent. 

714
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,710
That was the odometer number. 

715
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,880
Then you saw those shoes. 

716
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,820
Are you high. 

717
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,770
And you didn't want to move

718
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,980
'cause you don't like change. 

719
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,880
That's why your dad said,

720
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,710
"okay,okay,forget vermont. "

721
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,740
345652sw38. 

722
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,780
The serial number

723
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,340
of the gun. 

724
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,490
The gun that you fired. 

725
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,500
The gun you fired,brent ! 

726
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,070
The gun your sister said

727
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,040
you were holding. 

728
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,450
215-555-0196. 

729
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,940
215... ? 

730
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,560
That's a philly

731
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,280
area code,brent. 

732
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,980
That's a phone number. 

733
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,630
What does that number have to do 
with you holding the gun ? 

734
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,870
215-555...

735
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,140
brent,whose phone

736
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,010
number is that ? 

737
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,010
Sammy's house. 

738
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,640
the killer got a call from

739
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,670
someone in your house,brent ? 

740
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,330
Sammy's house. 

741
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,920
Your house. 

742
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,640
My house. 

743
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,670
Brent,

744
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,240
detective valens...

745
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,440
9136. 

746
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,930
...Is proud of you. 

747
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,100
Okay. 

748
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,990
Okay. 

749
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,950
Hey,detectives.  How you doing ? 

750
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,810
Oh,brent's been talking

751
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,920
again,doug. 

752
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,210
That's good,right ? 

753
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,140
Ruby made a phone call

754
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,840
from her house

755
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,670
the night of the murder. 

756
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,200
At 6:20. 

757
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,130
To your cell. 

758
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,080
Don't lie,

759
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,110
'cause we got the phone records. 

760
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,750
Yeah,your point ? 

761
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,070
Brent saw his home number

762
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,010
flash on the killer's phone. 

763
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,310
Your phone. 

764
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,080
Whoa,wait,back up. 

765
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,000
Uh,brent saw ? 

766
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,920
That's right. 

767
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,950
Brent. 

768
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,960
And brent doesn't lie. 

769
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,710
And you might have

770
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,440
clocked out of work

771
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,090
at 9:00,doug,

772
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,280
but nobody remembers you

773
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,010
being around

774
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,440
between 6:00 and 7:00. 

775
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,330
And we know you helped

776
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:50,930
the harrises move

777
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,730
their stuff

778
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,950
out of their store,

779
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,730
the gun they kept there

780
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
included. 

781
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,900
You said you loved

782
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,340
the harrises,doug. 

783
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,440
I did. 

784
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,620
They were like the

785
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,250
family I never had. 

786
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,420
But they were going to move away. 

787
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,170
You were going to lose ruby

788
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,840
and the family

789
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,910
that was better than your own. 

790
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,910
See,you don't get it. 

791
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,270
Get what ? 

792
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,840
That brent's

793
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,880
the lucky one. 

794
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,720
Not being able

795
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,520
to feel anything. 

796
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,080
'Cause you felt too much ? 

797
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,240
Look,I loved ruby more than

798
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,100
anyone's ever loved anybody. 

799
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,410
And you couldn't let a love like

800
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,900
that just disappear on you. 

801
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,390
The thought of her not being

802
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,480
with me,moving away forever...

803
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,000
not a possibility. 

804
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,040
So you had to stop them. 

805
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,020
I didn't want to,I swear. 

806
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,540
But it was like my heart...

807
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:11,190
it was like...

808
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,870
lovesick. 

809
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,890
What...

810
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,700
Oh,what are you doing

811
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,800
out here in the rain ? 

812
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,410
You're soaked. 

813
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,970
Hop in. 

814
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,200
Come on,it's take-out tuesday. 

815
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,080
I know. 

816
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,630
I can't let you do it. 

817
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,720
- Take her away from me. 

818
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,720
- Do what ? 

819
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,350
Ruby ? 

820
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,280
She's my air. 

821
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,330
I cannot breathe without her. 

822
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,110
I will die,I swear. 

823
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,320
What are you doing ? 

824
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,980
- I mean it. 

825
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,980
- You can't take her. 

826
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,170
Okay,okay. 

827
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,750
Forget vermont. 

828
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,400
You say that now,but I know

829
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,880
you will do anything for brent. 

830
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,860
No,no. 

831
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm sorry. 

832
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm so sorry. 

833
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,550
in my place,in my place

834
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,540
were lines

835
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,670
that I couldn't change

836
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,670
I was lost,oh,yeah

837
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,620
I was lost,I was lost

838
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,770
crossed lines

839
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,070
I shouldn't have crossed

840
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,680
I was lost,oh,yeah

841
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,180

842
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,150
how long must you wait

843
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,300
for him

844
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,840
yeah

845
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,880
how long must you pay

846
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,810
for him

847
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,520

848
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,240
how long must you wait

849
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,940
for him

850
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,310
for him

851
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,810
I was scared,I was scared

852
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,910
tired and underprepared

853
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:54,150
but I wait for you

854
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:58,070

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,140
