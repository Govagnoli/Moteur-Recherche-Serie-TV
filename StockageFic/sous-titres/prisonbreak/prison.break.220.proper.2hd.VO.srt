00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,196
I want a presidential pardon for me

3
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:05,713
and my brother.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,106
You tell me what's going on.

5
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,041
I can take care of you.
All I need you to do

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,700
is tell me exactly
what Agent Mahone told you.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,400
I have a job to do,
which I've been made to do.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,667
- Get off the phone.
- Wait!

9
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,292
Stay right where you are.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,200
What if I know
where you can get at $5 million?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,607
Where is it?

12
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,589
I could take you there,
if you didn't have

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,679
to take me back to the States
and turn me back in.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,400
Three tickets, one cabin, one-way.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,510
Nice.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Sir, in just a few minutes

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,000
the president is going to announce
a pardon

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,500
for Burrows and Scofield.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>I regret to inform you,
I am stepping down</i>

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,000
as president of the United States.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,790
There's only one thing we can do.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,203
We gotta disappear.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
Forever.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
It's very heavy.
What have you got in there?

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,300
About 75 pounds
of none of your business, Pedro.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,500
For your troubles.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,600
Go! Go! Go!

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Please. T-Bag! T-Bag, please!

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,937
I need that money!

30
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,399
Andale, you son of a bitch. ¡Andale!

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Please, T-Bag, I'm begging you!

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Please. Please! No!

33
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,799
What time does the ship leave?

34
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:25,819
About ten minutes.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,806
I can't believe we're running again.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
It's different now, man.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
- You think so?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,900
- We brought the bitch down.
- She stepped down, Linc.

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,200
Because of us.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,200
Yet you're still wanted for murder.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
When you came to Fox River...

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,600
Remember what you said?

43
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,542
You said,
"I'm gonna break you out of here."

44
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm alive. You did that.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,290
You want to look for the good
you look there.

46
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,752
Come on, let's just finish
what you started.

47
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>...continuing with our top story.</i>

48
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:05,403
<i>Caroline Reynolds made the announcement
just a short while ago</i>

49
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:08,828
<i>that she's stepping down
as president of the United States.</i>

50
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,500
<i>We'll be bringing you
more information as the...</i>

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
Hey, are you all right?

52
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,805
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

53
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,981
<i>I heard about the president.</i>

54
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:20,035
What does it mean?

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
It means it's time to go.

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,110
Okay... When?

57
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,000
<i>Ten minutes. How far away are you?</i>

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,100
- Five.
- <i>Listen, Sara,</i>

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,700
Linc and I are on the ship.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,041
This is it.

61
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,200
There's no turning back now, so...

62
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,979
I know it's not what you wanted
from your life,

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,702
but in case your interested...

64
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,400
there is room for one more.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,574
Michael Scofield, you asking me
to sail off into the sunset with you?

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Well, it's more of a freighter,
but... yes.

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,800
I'll be there.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
I'll see you soon.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
She's heading West on Leadwell.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,901
All right.

71
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,500
Stay on her, I'll be right there.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,085
What the hell's this?

73
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,400
I tried, boss.

74
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:15,900
You saw how he just took off.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,799
The only thing I'm seeing
is an escaped con,

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
who's begging to be taken Nort-ay.

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay, look, maybe we could call
the cab company

78
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,351
and find out where T-Bag
was dropped off.

79
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,400
Now, you're talking. I saw some phone...

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
What's it going to take for you
to forget you ever found us?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
You sure about that?

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,900
Go ahead, shoot.

84
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,799
But it might not be the best idea
seeing as how I'm the only one

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
who knows where your <i>chiquita</i>'s tied up.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Where is Maricruz?

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,700
If I tell you, I'm as good as dead.

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,400
Of course if you shoot, so is she.

89
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
- You're bluffing me.
- Am I?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,100
Let me tell you in words
you might be more familiar with.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,500
She's in "the Hole,"

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
with enough food and water
to last about three weeks.

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Any longer than that,

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,900
your sweet little plum's
gonna dry up like a raisin.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,080
If anything happens to her,
so help me...

96
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,900
Help you? Way I see it, it's you
who's gotta help me.

97
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,602
'Cause you ain't getting your hands
on that girl

98
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,400
'til I get my hands on that money.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Guess that makes us partners.

100
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,160
Here we go.

101
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,500
She's not here.

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,600
- Yeah.
- <i>Sara,</i>

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
what's the matter?

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
The ship is leaving.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,500
- Michael... - What's wrong?

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,410
<i>Sara?</i>

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,900
I'm already on board.

108
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,754
I'm sorry, I must have just missed you.
Where are you?

109
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,138
We're on deck.

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,410
Great.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm on my way up.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,010
Love you.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
We good?

114
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,500
Clear vehicles platform 9!

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Yeah.

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,000
Son of a bitch!

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

118
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,693
No more games, Sara.
You were on your way to see him.

119
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,719
No, I wasn't.

120
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,403
You were just compelled to flee
the custody of a Federal Agent?

121
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I couldn't find her.

122
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:56,623
We got to go back.

123
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:59,771
- You can't. There's nothing you can do.
- There's always something you can do.

124
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:00,786
Not this time.

125
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,100
Not this time, man.

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,210
It's done.

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,410
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,523
Scofield or prison.

129
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,300
I just wanted a donut, sir.

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,122
Get her a donut.

131
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:16,983
Can we get her a donut?
Get her a donut.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Get her a dozen donuts!

133
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,501
Lock her up!

Where the hell did you go, Michael?

137
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,850
So, where the hell is Mahone?

138
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,859
I don't know, sir.

139
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,449
He's been MIA for the last week or so.

140
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,830
You think he knows
I've been barking up one of his trees?

141
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,950
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

142
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,150
This is Richard Sullins,
director of Internal Affairs at the FBI.

143
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,750
Which means whenever
one of our people does something wrong,

144
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,050
it's my job to make it right.

145
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,450
How right are we talking about?

146
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,550
Well, let's be clear...

147
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,199
You are a convicted felon

148
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,283
who broke out of a state penitentiary.
There's only so much I can do.

149
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,850
Well, there's only so much I can say.

150
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,850
Now, I'm sorry if I seem
a little bit skeptical,

151
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,350
but the last time a federal agent
came up in here offering me a deal,

152
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,150
there was a string attached...

153
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,229
that I was supposed
to put around my neck.

154
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,550
I've been authorized to offer you
a reduced sentence

155
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,050
in exchange for your testimony
against Agent Mahone,

156
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,350
Instead of 18 years,
you'll be looking at 18 months.

157
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,750
18 months?

158
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,250
Hey, you know what?
That man tried to kill me.

159
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,550
So as soon as he finds out
that I'm singing,

160
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,650
I probably won't even last 18 days.

161
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:59,750
He threatened my family.

162
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,350
Now, I need to be out there
protecting them.

163
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,850
So until you can offer me
something like that...

164
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,050
I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

165
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,050
Guard!

166
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,250
Free man.

167
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,350
You <i>and</i> your family.

168
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,350
Witness protection, fresh start.

169
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,650
Clean record?

170
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,150
Spick-and-span.

171
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,850
You put that in writing
and you got yourself a witness.

172
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,960
Sir?

173
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,850
I knocked, but...

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,850
You okay?

175
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,296
What does that look like to you?

176
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,350
There, right there.

177
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,650
It's a triangle.

178
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,850
Yeah, I thought so, too.

179
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,950
How about this? Right there.

180
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,350
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

181
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,750
3.14.

182
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,611
I'm thinking date, area code...

183
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:10,950
314, that's Missouri.

184
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,750
So you think Scofield's there?

185
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,050
I doubt it. How's your Greek alphabet,
Agent Lang?

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,550
I don't know. I guess it's...

187
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,750
What if I told you that triangle
was a delta and that this,

188
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,650
this here was not the symbol pi
but the letter?

189
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,939
I didn't see any of those
in the photos of the tattoos.

190
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,150
They weren't in the tattoos.

191
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,850
We pulled these from his original
sketches off the hard drive.

192
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,750
Scofield numbered all of the steps
of his escape.

193
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,461
He kept everything in order that way,
but it looks like he didn't use numbers,

194
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,986
that he used letters like... This is it.

195
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,250
A sketch of this tattoo.

196
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,250
Allan Schweitzer marked with an alpha,

197
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,793
first letter of the Greek alphabet.

198
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,850
First step of his plan.

199
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,250
Epsilon, fifth letter
of the Greek alphabet.

200
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,387
Fifth step in his plan.

201
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,750
Here's theta,

202
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,150
and kappa...

203
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,551
How about that?

204
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:00,950
Tau? At the border, right?

205
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:02,714
Getting closer to the end.
Are you with me?

206
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,950
So you think...

207
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,250
His omega...

208
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,114
The last letter of the Greek alphabet...

209
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,578
is the last step of his plan.

210
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,760
What is that?

211
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,850
- Christ in a flower?
- A rose.

212
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,049
And these numbers, 6-1-7.

213
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,250
Could be biblical: chapter 6, verse 17.

214
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,350
6-1-7, 6-17.

215
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,450
June 17th.

216
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,250
What's today?

217
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,550
The 15th.

218
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,849
So whatever his last step is...

219
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,250
It's going to happen in two days.

220
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,802
What's he saying?

221
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,150
Nothing. The same as the rest.

222
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,750
Maybe he don't <i>comprende.</i>

223
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,443
What's Spanish for "INS"?

224
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:47,490
Don't be stupid.

225
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,550
We're in Mexico.

226
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:49,749
You're the illegal one here.

227
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,734
Hey, it doesn't mean he ain't got family
up north trying to clean their way

228
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,813
to a green card.
He knows what I'm talking about.

229
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,350
Oh, you are too good to me, Suzi-Q.

230
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:40,950
Just how I like it.

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,450
How did I get so lucky?

232
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,150
Oh, no, Teddy Bear.

233
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,350
I'm the lucky one.

234
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,650
The day I met you...

235
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,950
was the day I was born.

236
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,773
We're out of time.

237
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,291
No, Susan...

238
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,571
We got our whole lives together.

239
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,550
No, I mean, the hour is up.

240
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,450
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

241
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,894
And since we're rolling here,
so let's, you know, get back...

242
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,507
How's it... Was cooking, good looking?

243
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,850
I would really feel better
if you paid me up front.

244
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,550
And I told you up front
that if you did this right,

245
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,350
I would take care of you, so...

246
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,150
You paid me for an hour.

247
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,950
The hour is up.

248
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:36,861
If I you want me to stay,
I need more money.

249
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,410
Great, great, you ruined it.

250
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,460
Thanks.

251
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,483
You know, for a second there,
I was actually like,

252
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,029
"This chick has a brain in her head."

253
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,550
Then, if you did, you wouldn't be
a street whore, right?

254
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,474
You know,

255
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,350
I don't know who this Suzi-Q bitch is,

256
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,750
but no wonder she wants nothing
to do with you.

257
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,950
You didn't just call her a bitch,
did you?

258
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,150
Okay.

259
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,150
I am going to count to three,

260
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,627
and if you don't put your arm down,

261
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,250
I'm going to scream.

262
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,350
One, t...

263
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,550
We made it.

264
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
Not yet.

265
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
First there's someone we need to see.

266
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,550
Okay, who's got what?

267
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:01,393
Christ as a rose
is a pretty common theme

268
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,650
that runs through the Bible.

269
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,795
Martin Luther adopted it
as his coat of arms.

270
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:07,045
And there's the belief
that Christ rose from the dead.

271
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,750
This is Scofield's final step,
a new life.

272
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,505
Could be something there.

273
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,450
You... keep track of this on the board.

274
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,650
- Where's Wheeler?
- Here we go.

275
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,323
The Harmonists:
first settlers of New Harmony, Indiana,

276
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,350
used a golden rose as their symbol
for Christ.

277
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,960
That's a reach.

278
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,049
There's a flower called the
<i>Christmas Rose</i>.

279
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,850
Wasn't <i>Christ Rose</i>
a German code name

280
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,950
for, uh, the counterattack by the Nazis
that led

281
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,350
to the Battle of the Bulge?

282
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,550
Where was that?

283
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,750
Ardennes Forest
on the Belgium-Germany border.

284
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,550
Not a bad place to hide
if they can find it.

285
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,750
You gonna look into that?

286
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,250
- Yeah.
- All right, what else?

287
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,750
Christ actually rose from the dead
on Easter.

288
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Easter Sunday...

289
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,350
Who's got Scofield's file?

290
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:58,950
Um, here we go.

291
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,524
- Christ in a rose.
- Yeah, what about it?

292
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,050
Scofield's mother's name.

293
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,450
Christina Rose Scofield.

294
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,250
But I thought she was dead.

295
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,750
Well, so did I.

296
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,450
So did I.

297
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,150
The very first thing that Scofield did

298
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,350
when they broke out of Fox River
is he picked up

299
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,442
a bunch of supplies that he had
stashed in a grave.

300
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:39,150
I want you to find out
where Scofield's mother's buried.

301
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,360
And what ?

302
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,450
And see if she's buried.

303
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,260
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,350
- What about Panama ?
- What about Panama ?

305
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:47,483
His hard drive

306
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:49,387
was full of information
about Central America,

307
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,450
Panama in particular.

308
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,650
Which he knows you have.

309
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,023
The guy's got all kinds of hubris,

310
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,950
but he's smart enough
to stay out of a country

311
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:56,666
where he knows
you'll be waiting for him.

312
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,602
Unless there's something there
that he needs.

313
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,450
Or someone.

314
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,950
I want a map of Panama,

315
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,950
and find out if Scofield's mom,
Christina Rose,

316
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,050
has any family in Central America,

317
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,350
any property, anything.

318
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,962
The last time I was on a bus like this,
I was heading to Fox River.

319
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,750
This country's amazing.

320
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,350
It's beautiful.

321
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,150
- What's that smell, man ?
- Bananas.

322
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,450
And sugar cane.
That's Panama's biggest exports.

323
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,050
Come on.

324
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,427
you've been talking about Panama
and bumpy bus rides

325
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,641
ever since we broke out,
and now that we're doing it...

326
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,097
She should have been here with us.

327
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,049
We got all the time in the world
for that.

328
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,150
One day,
you and Sara...

329
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:49,850
Can we just get there, please ?

330
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,050
Sure.

331
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,450
Oye! Tipo! Espera!

332
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,850
So far, no hits on any connection

333
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,550
between Scofield's mother and Panama.

334
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,150
But there are 38 listings
of Christina Rose

335
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,050
in various combinations of first name,
middle name and last name.

336
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,550
All right, cross-reference the names
with the numbers 6-1-7

337
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,450
from the tattoo. Maybe it's not a date.

338
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,543
- See if it's an address, P. O. box.
- Got it.

339
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,597
If anybody pops, call the Embassy,
have them send

340
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,640
an officer to pick up the woman
for questioning.

341
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,150
Um, I don't think we can just arrest
a foreign citizen

342
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,968
- without any...
- Patriot Act, Agent Lang.

343
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,757
I could arrest your grandmother
for anything, if I wanted to,

344
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,049
If anybody's helping Scofield,

345
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,024
dead or alive,
I want to know who they are.

346
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,950
That her?

347
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,756
Yeah.

348
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,355
<i>Hola</i>, Mrs. Vasquez.

349
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:56,551
You're late.

350
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,642
It's much later than the date you said.

351
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,184
Well, we ran into
a little bit of trouble.

352
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:02,679
Who is this?

353
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:05,875
It's a business associate.

354
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,536
Christina Rose.

355
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,212
I remember.

356
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:11,828
You will find her here.

357
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,370
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

358
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:14,432
<i>Gracias.</i>

359
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,147
I'll meet you outside.

360
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:22,848
I forgot to ask something.

361
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,018
All right.

362
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,626
Do you have a phone I could use?

363
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,189
I need an international operator,
please.

364
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,004
United States.

365
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:47,374
It's 312-346...

366
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,462
- What the hell are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

367
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:51,474
You can't.

368
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:54,153
We don't even know
if she's alive or dead, Linc.

369
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:56,481
If Sara's in custody,
they got her phone.

370
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,633
You want to get caught?

371
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,010
Three things I hate, Alex.

372
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,887
Traffic, hockey,

373
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:23,404
and calling you with the same question
over and over.

374
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,246
Then don't call me anymore,
but I do believe

375
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,819
the brothers <i>are</i> in Panama.

376
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,781
<i>- Is that so?</i>
- The key to exactly where

377
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,189
is on one of Scofield's tattoos.

378
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:33,468
While I'm thrilled
you've narrowed it down to a country,

379
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,299
that's not why we're talking.

380
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,351
Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive...

381
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:38,961
I'm aware of that, yeah.

382
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,859
... and being released from custody.

383
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,986
That's not possible, they would need
permission from my office.

384
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,640
Good to know you're on top of things.

385
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,656
Find me Agent Wheeler.

386
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,297
He'll see you now.

387
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:17,965
Forgive me for asking, sir, but...

388
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,230
couldn't we be doing this in my office?

389
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:21,720
It'd be much more comfortable.

390
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:26,408
I felt we needed to speak freely.

391
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,611
For the next several hours,
this is what those

392
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:34,169
in the intelligence community refer to
as a "blind spot."

393
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:38,012
Something to do
with the position of the sun, I'm told.

394
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,939
Disrupts long-distance
recording devices.

395
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:46,062
If I may apologize again, sir, for...

396
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,590
the unfortunate outcome
with the President.

397
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:51,210
I know how important she was
to our interests, and I assure you

398
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:53,185
- that moving forward--
- You won't be moving

399
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,149
anywhere until you can explain to me
how this happened.

400
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:00,778
The brothers...

401
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,825
- They're making it--
- Still alive.

402
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,174
Yes. It appears
they were able to flee the country.

403
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:13,188
To where?

404
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,689
Mr. Mahone seems to believe
they're in Panama.

405
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:28,181
Does our Mr. Mahone know
where exactly in Panama they are?

406
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:29,603
Not yet.

407
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,241
Why?

408
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:35,005
How much do you know about Sona,
Mr. Kim?

409
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,194
Only what I've been given clearance on.

410
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:40,415
Perhaps what our situation requires

411
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:42,821
is a change in strategy.

412
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:51,518
How long until the court
approves the warrant for Mahone?

413
00:25:51,537 --> 00:25:52,549
<i>Should be anytime now.</i>

414
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,596
<i>We're just waiting for the indictment
to come down.</i>

415
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:56,313
Okay, I've got a question for you.

416
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,105
What if he's in there?
I can't keep avoiding him.

417
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,613
He reads people.
That's what he does.

418
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,603
And if he finds out
that I'm involved in this,

419
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,465
I'm gonna need some protection from...

420
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,490
Relax. Take a breath.

421
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,265
Mahone can only read
what you write for him.

422
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,396
Can you act normal?

423
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:14,042
<i>That's all you have to do.
The last thing we want is for him</i>

424
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:17,065
<i>to get spooked and take off.
This is all gonna be over soon.</i>

425
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:18,973
All right. Thank you.

426
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,106
No. Thank <i>you</i>.

427
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:31,879
Where you been?

428
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,308
I got to do this.

429
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:46,545
What are you doing, Alex?
I'm not wearing a wire.

430
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:49,080
You're gonna tell me
what's going on here?

431
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,085
In old England...

432
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:53,327
The punishment for a traitorous act

433
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:54,379
was beheading.

434
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,310
Following the execution,

435
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,745
they would hold up the severed head
by the hair.

436
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,814
Not, as we think,
for the crowd to see the head,

437
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:04,251
but for the head
to see the crowd, because...

438
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,584
Consciousness sticks around
for another 8 seconds.

439
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,461
The idea was
that it would give the traitor

440
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,844
one more chance to take a look at--

441
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,170
You don't want to do this, okay?

442
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Just take a moment...

443
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:15,783
If you're gonna stab me in the back,
Agent Wheeler,

444
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,996
be smart enough
to cover up the knife.

445
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,143
You go and visit Franklin

446
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:20,186
three times this week,

447
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,210
called Sullins, what, twice a day?

448
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,570
Didn't you learn anything
working for me?

449
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:27,453
You got to cover your tracks,
unless you...

450
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:33,504
Unless you want to get caught.

451
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:39,124
You wanted me to know it was you.

452
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:44,859
You're a killer, Alex.

453
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:46,259
Is that so?

454
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,312
Soil samples taken from your yard

455
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,773
in connection with the disappearance
of Oscar Shales.

456
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,843
Forensics is prepared to submit a report

457
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:55,152
detailing the irregularities
in the shooting

458
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,424
of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

459
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,202
There's your blatant disregard
for protocol

460
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:00,427
in the death of John Abruzzi--

461
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,703
And the escaped con who says
that I told him to kill himself.

462
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:06,572
You think his testimony
is gonna send you

463
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:08,007
into the promised land.

464
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,286
You can erase me, too.

465
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,369
But it's not gonna erase
the very real fact

466
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,714
that you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison.

467
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,183
You know...

468
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:28,012
You remind me of myself
when I was a young agent.

469
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:29,547
What?

470
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,084
I wish I could take that
as a compliment.

471
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,630
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

472
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,930
Good job.

473
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,820
Don't you let anyone scare you...

474
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,692
into doing the wrong thing.

475
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:51,509
Let me take you in.

476
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,849
Whatever mess you're in,
we can clean it up.

477
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,723
There's only one way to clean this.

478
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,047
One way.

479
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:06,577
Got a visitor.

480
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,026
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know.

481
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:10,934
I was just instructed to bring you down.

482
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,164
Look, I ain't going nowhere

483
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:14,297
until you tell me who it is I'm meeting,
all right?

484
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:18,701
You got to stop it!
Listen to me for a second!

485
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:20,644
All you got to do
is go out there and check.

486
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,591
The guy's kind of tall, okay?

487
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,017
It's the least that you can do.

488
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,550
What?

489
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:32,851
Daddy!

490
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,265
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:35,818
Come here.

492
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,652
Daddy loves you so much.

493
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,251
So.. is it real?

494
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,233
He says you're gonna go free,

495
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:58,803
that we don't have to run anymore.

496
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,350
I mean, what happened?
What changed?

497
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:03,652
Don't you worry about it.

498
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:06,238
You just know
that your man handles things.

499
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,312
Ain't that right?

500
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,830
That's right.

501
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,962
I don't believe it, but okay.

502
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,272
Benjamin,
if I could just have a quick word.

503
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:25,057
Why don't you go down the hall
for just a quick second.

504
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:26,547
Okay? I'll be right there.

505
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:33,830
Here it is.

506
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,828
New address,

507
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:36,840
new identities.

508
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,707
The prosecutor will get in touch
with you

509
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:41,256
to go over your testimony,
so you just make sure you show up

510
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,265
where he says and when he says.

511
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,542
Yeah, okay.

512
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:47,431
But I'm a free man, right?

513
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:49,156
Free man.

514
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:53,865
Wait a minute.

515
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:56,053
What about Mahone?

516
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,607
I don't wanna live in fear

517
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,837
for the rest of my life, see?

518
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,411
You let me worry about Mahone.

519
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:02,531
You just worry
about staying out of trouble.

520
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:05,323
You ain't gonna have a problem
with that, trust me.

521
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,795
Don't screw it up.

522
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:30,487
How much further?

523
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:31,711
Not far.

524
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,845
For what it's worth,

525
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,994
no one forced Sara to do what she did.

526
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,902
Whatever gets you through the night.

527
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,267
The hell does that mean?

528
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:44,014
- I didn't ask you to use her.
- It's not that simple.

529
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:45,751
Whatever gets you
through the night, buddy.

530
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:47,414
You know what amazes me, Linc?

531
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:50,605
Nothing ever registers with you.

532
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:51,654
Ever.

533
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,941
Just rolls right off your back,
doesn't it?

534
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:56,931
We ruined Sara's life
and it's like you don't even care.

535
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,612
- That what you think?
- We're here,

536
00:31:58,613 --> 00:31:59,898
and Sara's back there in prison.

537
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:01,911
- Does it seem fair to you?
- None of it's fair.

538
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:03,621
Just don't make this about
boy loses girl.

539
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,795
Who should it be about, Linc?

540
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:06,981
Westmoreland? Tweener?

541
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,846
- LJ? LJ's mom?
- Let me stop you right there.

542
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,772
Remember the name of the guard
that was murdered

543
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:12,697
- because of the riot I started?
- Shut up.

544
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,577
Do you even remember his name?
- Shut up.

545
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:16,451
I bet you remember
Veronica's name, don't you?

546
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,288
You mention her name again,
I swear to God...

547
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:19,327
What about T-Bag?

548
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,136
Linc, he's out there, now,
because of us!

549
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,584
You and me!

550
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,349
Every life he takes,

551
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:30,646
that's blood on our hands.

552
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:32,878
And for what?

553
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,813
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

554
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,573
They were gonna kill you, Linc!

555
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:42,517
Well, maybe you should've let them!

556
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:44,800
Take that back.

557
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:14,002
As bad as I feel about Sara,

558
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,484
she had a choice.

559
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:17,957
Veronica didn't.

560
00:33:22,182 --> 00:33:24,254
I listened to her die, Michael.

561
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:25,835
I listened to her die, and there was...

562
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,684
there was nothing I could do.

563
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:29,397
Nothing.

564
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,724
We've lost so much, man.

565
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:41,371
We can't afford to lose each other.

566
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,484
We just can't.

567
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,838
You going somewhere, Alex?

568
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,797
I don't know. Am I?

569
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,116
Come on.

570
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,380
You know
I don't like
to get my hands dirty.

571
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:28,979
It's surprising the things a man will do

572
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,749
when properly motivated.

573
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,731
Wasn't it you who told me that?

574
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,248
You know, I would kill you right now
if I thought

575
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:40,049
it would give me an ounce of peace.

576
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,729
And what would give you peace?

577
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,786
I've been able to hold it together

578
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:49,624
through all this...

579
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,032
because there was a light
at the end of the tunnel.

580
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:54,683
Life...

581
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,377
at the end of the tunnel,

582
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,347
for me, for my family.

583
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:00,558
And now what?

584
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,195
Do you see my son?

585
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,243
Do you see my wife?

586
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,450
What have I got?

587
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:07,907
What have you given me?

588
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,099
What if I was to tell you

589
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,290
that there was something
that could turn that light...

590
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:16,513
back on?

591
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,336
What would you say?

592
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:19,793
I'd say it's the same offer you made

593
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:21,949
when you dragged me into this,
you little bastard.

594
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,544
And look where it's got me now.

595
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,313
They're gonna drag me before the public.

596
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,128
They've gonna prosecute me like...

597
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,648
like some kind of murderer.

598
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,368
There's... There's evidence.

599
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,887
Really hard, tangible evidence,
that you can't take away.

600
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,199
You're right...

601
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:39,254
but I can help you get away.

602
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:40,710
And at this point,

603
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,737
I don't think
you've got any other options.

604
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,413
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell was apprehended
in Mexico.

605
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,780
Oh, let me guess. You want him dead.

606
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:56,830
There's been a...

607
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,867
change in strategy.

608
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:01,268
We're gonna need him alive.

609
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,450
I'm talking about a very real

610
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,185
finish line here, Alex.

611
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,313
You've come so far.

612
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:11,097
How much further would I have to go?

613
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,226
Well, you're lucky.

614
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,864
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

615
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:24,148
I'm trying to remember
the last time our lives

616
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,854
made any kind of sense.

617
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:30,990
Before Mom died.

618
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,959
When it was just the three of us.

619
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,199
Well, there she is.

620
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,291
Hello, Lang.

621
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:50,090
What's going on?
I mean, there's all kinds

622
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,101
of suits over here
going through your office.

623
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,559
I'll explain later.

624
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,334
All right.

625
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,225
- Did you get the fax?
- No. Why?

626
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:00,681
What do you got?

627
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:03,312
<i>Some information on Christina Rose
you might find interesting.</i>

628
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,912
Looks like she was commissioned
about four months before

629
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:07,415
Scofield robbed that bank

630
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,663
by a builder in Panama
named Amparo Vasquez.

631
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,115
Son of a bitch.

632
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,621
She's beautiful.

633
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:26,957
Yeah, she's not the real thing, but...

634
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,483
So where to, man?

635
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,196
- So, is it really over?
- Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's really over.

636
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:56,414
What is it, baby?

637
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,884
Oh, nothing.

638
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:06,595
Let's go home.

639
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:21,290
Okay, so we checked the train station

640
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,071
in Malinalco,
the bus depot in Puebla,

641
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,831
and just about every hotel there is.

642
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,456
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, Sancho.

643
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,834
<i>Uno momento.</i>

644
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:35,195
It's for you.

645
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,448
That was the guy
from the tourism bureau.

646
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,981
- He found him.
- Where?

647
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:51,819
An E. Stammel just boarded a plane
to Panama City.

648
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:54,211
What the hell's he doing in Panama?

649
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:19,832
You speak English?

650
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:23,574
Say... "Good morning, Teddy."

651
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:26,251
Good morning, Teddy.

652
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,927
So then, actually, no,
you don't speak English.

653
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,338
<i>Hablan ingles</i> around here?

654
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:42,726
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

655
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,478
Good morning, Teddy.

656
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,374
Say, "Good morning, Teddy Bear."

657
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:51,382
Good morning, Teddy Bear.

658
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,701
Do you like wigs?

659
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,403
For the right money, I like anything.

660
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:36,543
There's nothing.

661
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:38,630
Nothing online about Sara's arrest.

662
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:40,215
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

663
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,758
What about the message board?
The Goldfinch thing?

664
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:45,668
Just something from C-Note and...

665
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:48,748
There is a message from Sucre.

666
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,355
Still running, huh?

667
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,491
What?

668
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:01,465
Sucre says T-Bag's here, in Panama.

669
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:03,314
How the hell does he know?

670
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:04,834
I don't know. It says,

671
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:06,097
"The Bag's still has the bag.

672
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,568
"He's in Panama City
at the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

673
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:11,106
"If you're there and want to help
put that bird back in a cage,

674
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:12,792
"let me know. Sucre."

675
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:15,567
What the hell is that son of a bitch
doing in Panama?

676
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:17,269
- We gotta go after him.
- Just let it be!

677
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,295
We don't need the money.

678
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,150
It's not about the money, Linc.

679
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:21,805
Whatever good we do from here on out,

680
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,966
it doesn't matter
as long as T-Bag's out there.

681
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:25,672
- We made it.
- Too much has gone wrong.

682
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:26,673
If we could just...

683
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,573
If we could just make this right.

684
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,891
Panama City, is only an hour away.

685
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,436
And now we know where he's staying.

686
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:36,003
So call the police.

687
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:37,562
There's a reason I chose Panama.

688
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,347
There's no extradition laws.

689
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:41,067
They're not gonna touch him.

690
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,531
So what are you gonna do?

691
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,130
I'll figure something out.

692
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,678
Figure it out? You don't take a piss

693
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:48,321
without a plan, man. Come on.

694
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:50,096
Look at me! I never think things through

695
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:51,441
and look where it got me.

696
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,825
- Yeah, Panama and a boat-load of booze.
- You got me that.

697
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,257
I got me a death sentence.

698
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:56,449
Look, let's just...

699
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,544
get out to sea, think things through,

700
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,598
when the time's right, we make it right.

701
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:27,932
<i>Trans Panamanian Airlines,</i>

702
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,113
<i>Flight 271 to Panama,</i>

703
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:32,507
<i>now boarding all First Class passengers.</i>

704
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:35,484
<i>Again, we are now boarding
for Panama City.</i>

705
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:37,242
See you soon.

706
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:43,041
