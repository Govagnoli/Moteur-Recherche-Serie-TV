<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:04,052
Let me get this straight.
The brothers come back to a city

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,435
that's 15 miles from the prison
they escaped from. Why ?

4
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:07,851
Because the president
is in Chicago

5
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:09,738
to make a speech,
and they're up to something,

6
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,895
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

7
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,007
So we blackmail her.

8
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:14,258
In exchange for what?

9
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,474
A presidential pardon.

10
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,412
Are we gonna keep crying about money

11
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:20,017
you've already got coming to you?

12
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,321
Or do you want to make some more?

13
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,266
- I'm listening.
- Ever been to Mexico?

14
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:25,762
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

15
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,779
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darlin'.

16
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,796
<i>Tia, ella es Maricruz.</i>

17
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,320
I'll check this bag for you, sir.

18
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,938
That's coming with me. Give it back.

19
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,794
Sir, I know that bag
is way over the weight limit.

20
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:41,838
Your bag will be safe.

21
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,382
They're watching you. But from where?

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,992
There.

23
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:48,847
President Reynolds ruined your life;
she ruined my life.

24
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,152
You want to take that bitch down?

25
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,351
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

26
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,303
Have either of these men checked in?

27
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:57,359
Yeah. Room 1006.

28
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,302
Today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

29
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,999
It's gonna be from me.
I need you to use it. Okay?

30
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:22,774
Open on four!

31
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:32,629
I need a hand in here!

32
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,189
- I need a medic in B-4!
- Let me die.

33
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:46,195
Let me die.

I think you'd better go.

You sure?

44
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:32,542
Thank you for your help,
but, there's nothing more

45
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:34,971
- you can do for us.
- It doesn't feel right, just leaving.

46
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,805
I don't think you want any part of this.
Thank you.

47
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,342
- It's ten minutes away, right?
- At least.

48
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,486
Listen, if this doesn't work,

49
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,157
we're gonna need a way out. For good.

50
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,913
Well, that's on you.

51
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,422
What about Derek?

52
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:00,379
Derek Sweeney?

53
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,077
- You think he'll be up for this?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:05,177
All right.

This is your neck of the woods.

56
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,048
You want to meet at the park?

57
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,593
How's Third and Racine?

58
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,090
Third and Racine?

3:15, the corner.

60
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,601
I'll be there.

61
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,274
If anything happens...

62
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:23,509
I love you both.

When were they here,
5 minutes, 10 minutes?

67
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:23,407
- They were never here.
- I know they were here.

68
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:24,574
Where did they go?

69
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:28,920
- I don't know.
- No, you do know.

70
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:32,359
He decided it was for the best,
and I couldn't take this anymore.

71
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:34,273
It's over just like that?

72
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:36,265
- Yeah.
- It's over like the time

73
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,492
you flew to New Mexico
on dead woman's ID to meet him?

74
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,248
Or it's over
like the time that you met up

75
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,547
and got back together
at the train station in Evansville?

76
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,168
Or maybe like the day, today,

77
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,329
when you checked into this hotel here
2 h ago?

78
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,114
- Which one is it like ?
- I don't care you believe me.

79
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,932
- I'm telling you the truth.
- He's not going to call you?

80
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,159
Don't lie to me.

81
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,805
You don't want to do that.

82
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,095
Can you tell me what the sign
means over there?

83
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,398
I'm just wondering.

<i>No hablo granjero.</i>

85
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:42,995

86
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,867
Listen to me, man, it needs to be today.

87
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,530
My family is in trouble, all right?

88
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,032
There's man out there
who's trying to hurt my family.

89
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,544
Your family is fine.
There's nobody after your family.

90
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:53,744
No, look at me, man.

91
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,735
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

92
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,811
I know the rules.

93
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,981
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

94
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,387
Please, just let me use that phone.

95
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:22,406
- Agent Lang.
- <i>I need to speak to Mahone, please.</i>

96
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:24,701
Can I have him return?

97
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,924
Listen, this is Benjamin Miles Franklin,

98
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,797
and I need to speak
to Mahone right away.

99
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,412
- It's Franklin for Mahone.
- I'll take it.

100
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,568
Mr. Franklin? This is agent Wheeler.

101
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,408
<i>- I don't believe we've met before.</i>
- I need to speak to Mahone.

102
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,142
Something I can help you with?

103
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,086
Listen...

104
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,969
I want to leave a message for him.

105
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,389
<i>You tell him...</i>

106
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:58,093
You tell him that I'll do
what he wants me to do, okay?

107
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,997
I just need a little bit more time.
I'll do it.

108
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:02,814
Just don't hurt them.

109
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,836
<i>You hear me?</i>

110
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,712
Don't hurt them.

111
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,262
What's up?

112
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Excuse me.

113
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,421
- What the hell are you doing here, man?
- Keep your voice down. Keep it down.

114
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:58,434
How you been?

115
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,685
- You all right?
- It's good to see you, man.

116
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,745
You, too, brother.

117
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,561
If some of the guys knew you were here,
they might not be too cool.

118
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,282
Well, I ain't hanging around;
I need a favor.

119
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,829
- You owe me.
-I do.

120
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:10,926
You know I do.

121
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:12,873
Look, it's just...

122
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:16,262
Look, it's just your situation
right now.

123
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:18,018
I mean, I just had a kid, a baby boy,

124
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,493
and I promised Marie...

125
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:20,999
I didn't come here to cause trouble.

126
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,593
I'm short on friends.
I need you to hook me up.

127
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,695
I know you can do it
without the green up front.

128
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,589
I'm serious about this, man.

129
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:29,952
Here. I need it.

130
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,408
I'll give it a shot.

131
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:43,587
- By when?
- ASAP.

132
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,770
- Tomorrow? The next day?
- Now.

133
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,567
Now.

134
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,263
All right, Linc.

135
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:58,855
Come with me.

136
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,846
Who saw him go down?

137
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,809
- Any press?
- We got him down pretty quick,

138
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,865
but you never know.

139
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:05,217
Some may have gotten a shot.

140
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,218
Check around.

141
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,714
Confiscate cameras if you need to.

142
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,352
Put out a statement
before rumors get started.

143
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,306
And get everyone out of here.

144
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,334
Now.

145
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,182
We're waiting for the response
from Counter...

146
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:24,861
You and I both know that this situation
requires us to abandon protocol.

147
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,526
I don't know what you need to tell them,
but I need your men to leave.

148
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,532
Now.

149
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,190
Yes, sir.

150
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:44,074
Where's your brother?

151
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,326
- I need to see the president.
- Really?

152
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,854
And you think that's a possibility?

153
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,944
She'll want to hear what I have to say.

154
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,278
Oh, I highly doubt that.

155
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,528
The only person you get to talk to...

156
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,310
...is me.

157
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:08,157
And the only way you're going
to live through the next hour

158
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,929
is if you tell me
where to find your brother.

159
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,631
Okay.

160
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,446
He's in a safe place.

161
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:18,489
Be more specific.

162
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,259
Specifically...

163
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:24,703
a place you will never find him.

164
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:38,599
I had the honor...

165
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,124
to attend Mountfort military academy.

166
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,278
whose mission it is

167
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,912
to ensure the greatness of this country
and his future leadership,

168
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:55,434
encouraging patriotism,

169
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,606
building a strong moral foundations

170
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,449
and providing the service of men

171
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,975
committed to the values of honor,

172
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:04,625
freedom and country.

173
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,357
But...

174
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,439
first and foremost,

175
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:11,107
they taught you this.

176
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,271
How do you say "cherries" again?

177
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,529
<i>Cereza.</i>

178
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,585
Looks like you have to get more <i>cerezas.</i>

179
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,330
I've just got you 100 <i>pistachios,</i>

180
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,743
with the right amount of salt, too.

181
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:41,992
Well, it's the combination.

182
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:42,998
I need both.

183
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,759
Why I am I a sucker for you, huh?

184
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:06,870
What? What's she saying?

185
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:07,944
That looks like T-Bag.

186
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,532
He said he was trying to steal luggage
from the airport,

187
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:21,636
He's got $5 million. Why would he...?

188
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,337
Unless he doesn't have it.

189
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,439
Unless he lost it there.

190
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:36,192
- Stop it, Fernando. - What?

191
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,424
Do you really believe
that that money is at the airport?

192
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:42,062
Forget it.

193
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,349
Look at what we have together.

194
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,105
Do you really want to risk that?

195
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,655
We have everything that we need.

196
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,415
- Except your <i>cerezas.</i>
- Right.

197
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,222
I'll be right back.

198
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,559
I'll be right back.

199
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,588
You got to know it's not real hard
for me to recognize a junkie.

200
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,808
I'm...

201
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,818
I'm saying

202
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,299
you don't look so good.

203
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,667
I'm fine.

204
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,793
Yeah.

205
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,453
You mind me asking what you're taking?

206
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:09,837
Here. You want one?

207
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,201
- No, that's okay.
- Here.

208
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:14,649
Save it for later.

209
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:20,404
Varatril.

210
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,731
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core
tranquilizer, man.

211
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,656
You take these every day?

212
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,575
20 milligrams.

213
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,361
You must feel like you're walking
underwater.

214
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,622
I do.

215
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,073
It's very quiet, down here.

216
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,678
That's why you started, right?
Peace and quiet.

217
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,236
That's not why you do it anymore,
though, is it?

218
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,513
Now it's the headaches, right?

219
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,287
And you probably don't sleep.

220
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,910
And you know you're gonna
destroy yourself, right?

221
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,108
I haven't ruled that out
as a possibility.

222
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,408
I hope we hear from your boyfriend.

223
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,827
There's one difference between me
and Agent Mahone.

224
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,496
He doesn't know the value
of a bird in the hand,

225
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:21,592
he just keeps beating and beating
around that bush.

226
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:24,156
But if you don't give up Burrows,
I don't care.

227
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:29,815
One down, one to go.

228
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,345
I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

229
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,005
Alone.

230
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,665
Madam President...

231
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,166
could I...

232
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:13,127
have a word?

233
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,704
It wouldn't be prudent

234
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,234
- for me to leave you alone...
- My men...

235
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:22,139
are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.

236
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,637
Your rights

237
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,958
aren't my first concern.

238
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,570
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

239
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:30,674
Step outside,

240
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,982
and close the door behind you.

241
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,655
The things you do for your brother.

242
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:02,860
It's impressive.

243
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,627
I could say the same for you.

244
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:09,726
But I won't.

245
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:12,563
Bear in mind,
your opinion means little to me.

246
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,050
This tape.

247
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:17,598
You have it with you?

248
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,540
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

249
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:30,756
You don't make arrangements
for me, Mr. Scofield.

250
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,659
I have people for that.

251
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:37,047
I'm not exactly sure
what is on this tape,

252
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:40,868
but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

253
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:44,132
It's a recorded conversation
between you and your brother.

254
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:46,159
Well, out of millions of conversations

255
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,736
that I had with my brother
during his lifetime...

256
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:50,067
I'll narrow it down for you.

257
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,805
It was recorded sometime...

258
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,511
after his death.

259
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:58,512
And this...

260
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,486
particular conversation...

261
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,588
you might want to keep in the family.

262
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:11,371
And where is it?

263
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:15,263
20 different copies
in 20 different locations.

264
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,907
I can call my brother right now.

265
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,001
He can play it for you.

266
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:21,412
Not on the phone.

267
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,493
Have him bring it here.

268
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:26,182
These are the terms.

269
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:29,795
You can hear it over the phone,

270
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:32,981
or you can hear it on the news.

271
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:36,175
It's up to you.

272
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:42,634
You know, it's why I started.

273
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:44,868
Started what?

274
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:46,927
Using.

275
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,136
Same reason as you.

276
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:50,745
Why, because you had to stay up
all night during residency?

277
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:56,028
Because the bass player dumped you
in front of the whole sorority?

278
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,152
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

279
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:00,889
I've seen people die, too.

280
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,239
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

281
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:06,831
You need help.

282
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,295
Not what I'm looking for.

283
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:18,323
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend
calls back real soon.

284
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,969
Where the hell is everybody?

285
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,336
<i>Mami!</i>

286
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:07,641
Lookie here, good old Sucre.

287
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:08,696
What did you do to them?

288
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:09,896
Where are they? Maricruz!

289
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,186
Keep your cap on.

290
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,775
They're out picking apples
for the Snuffleupagus.

291
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,393
- If you ever...
- Calm down!

292
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,572
They're going to walk back in here
any minute...

293
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,604
which means trouble.

294
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:23,547
Now, unless you want to see me try out

295
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,895
the new T-20Z on your
<i> bella muchacha</i>, Mari-poon.

296
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,192
I think you'd better come with me.

297
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:47,244
I understand you have something for me.

298
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:53,534
You still there?

299
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,785
<i>I'm here.</i>

300
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:56,749
It's good to finally talk to you.

301
00:25:58,254 --> 00:26:00,938
Wish I had the chance
one of those 242 nights

302
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,539
<i>I spent on death row.</i>

303
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,612
Please, just play the tape.

304
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,347
<i>It's awful, I know.</i>

305
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,064
<i>But the choice was clear.</i>

306
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:22,071
<i>You need to be far away
from all of this.</i>

307
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:23,135
<i>I am.</i>

308
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:24,677
I'm the Isle of Terrence,

309
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:25,764
far off to sea.

310
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:27,682
<i>Look, I'm still here for you.</i>

311
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:31,566
<i>Now, listen to me.
Don't dwell on the negative.</i>

312
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:34,002
Some people deserve to dwell, Caroline.

313
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:36,878
You know I'm only a phone call away.

314
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:39,855
And 3,000 miles.

315
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:45,336
Do you know

316
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,153
<i>how cold it is here?</i>

317
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,432
<i>We talked about this, Terrence.</i>

318
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:52,862
<i>You knew that you would be
lonely, but it's only temporary.</i>

319
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,365
<i>His appeals process has started already.</i>

320
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:57,936
<i>This is gonna fly by
quicker than your 20s.</i>

321
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,805
<i>And soon the world
will forget all about him</i>

322
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,187
<i>and they'll forget about you, too.</i>

323
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,209
I promise.

324
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,426
But...

325
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,576
it's killing me

326
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:11,403
not being able to see you,

327
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,294
sweet Caroline.

328
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:14,883
I want to see you, too.

329
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:16,547
<i>But that can't happen right now.</i>

330
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,752
This house is so big.

331
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,466
I just think of you...

332
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,665
lying in bed...

333
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,352
I know. Me, too.

334
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,964
Your warmth... your touch.

335
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:38,815
Was it quick

336
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,018
when he killed himself?

337
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,930
It was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

338
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:48,084
They shot him in the back.

339
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,917
He died in my arms.

340
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,434
I just want to know what happened.

341
00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:58,157
Your brother apologized.

342
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:01,647
He said he was sorry,

343
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:04,803
and then he blew his brains out
all over the wall.

344
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,218
It was quick.

345
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:10,700
And it was his decision.

346
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,411
And now it's time for you to make yours.

347
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,489
You know, I can't do it.

348
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,794
I can't do that.

349
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:27,545
Yes, you can.

350
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,143
There's nothing to be afraid of.

351
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,898
You don't get it, do you?

352
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,161
You can't stop this guy.

353
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,014
Not without your cooperation, I can't,

354
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,303
but if you talk to me,

355
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,366
if you tell me what's going on,

356
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,978
I can take care of you, okay?

357
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,112
You've got to trust me, Mr. Franklin.

358
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,114
I can help you.

359
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:52,696
C- Note, right?

360
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,400
Yeah. Whatever, man.

361
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,711
All I need you to do

362
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:05,428
is tell me exactly what
Agent Mahone told you.

363
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,546
If you give me Mahone,

364
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,063
I'll give you your life back.

365
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,402
God's been smiling down on me,
I can tell you that.

366
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,547
First, I caught up to
Haywire up in Algoma.

367
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,481
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator

368
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:20,878
before they could put him away,
but I still get the reward.

369
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,224
Wait, wait. He's dead?

370
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,952
Yep, like a gnat on a Peterbilt.

371
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,693
Hope you don't take
the same route, Sucre.

372
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,393
Oh, hell no, I got plenty reasons
to live.

373
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:29,505
I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

374
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,851
And maybe, if you play nice,

375
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,599
I'll throw your Maricruz a couple bills

376
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:34,091
after I turn you in.

377
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,597
How much are you getting for this?

378
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:36,609
A hundred grand.

379
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,385
I bet you never thought your
ass'd be worth all that.

380
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,871
Wait, wait.

381
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:45,691
What if I know where you
can get five million dollars?

382
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:49,836
You hear me?

383
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:52,587
Where is it?

384
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,170
I could take you there,

385
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:56,752
if you didn't have to take me
back to the States

386
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,822
and turn me back in.

387
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:00,601
Where is it?

388
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:05,007
T- Bag's in town.

389
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:09,064
I made my commitment a long time ago.

390
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:14,467
I agreed to put my country
ahead of myself,

391
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,504
like a mother does for a child.

392
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,076
And I thought

393
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:25,456
that what I was doing was noble
and that I would be rewarded.

394
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,923
You were wrong.

395
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,332
Don't you see that
I'm a pawn in this, too?

396
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,945
The power that has taken over
this country is like a cancer,

397
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:37,972
and it will stop at nothing.

398
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,278
It is out of my control.

399
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,314
So is this.

400
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,724
Tell me what you want from me.

401
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:48,267
Uncuff me.

402
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:50,422
I don't have the keys.

403
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:52,827
You'll get them.
Second, I want you to arrange

404
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,590
for me to walk away, alone.

405
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,001
No surveillance.

406
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,086
Okay.

407
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:01,233
And finally,

408
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,190
I want a presidential pardon for me

409
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,056
and my brother,

410
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,140
fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

411
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:13,134
And I want it today.

412
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:22,882
I can't just hand out pardons

413
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,222
to anyone I choose.

414
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,091
There is a process, rules.

415
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,363
This is no exception.

416
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:31,592
A document will be delivered
for your approval just like any pardon.

417
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,610
You'll sign it

418
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:34,807
and then file it
with the attorney general

419
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,919
who'll submit
to the presidential record.

420
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,271
Fine. I will sign
whatever you need me to sign.

421
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:42,675
That's very kind,
but we both know that's not enough.

422
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:45,532
What do you want from me?

423
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,755
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

424
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:51,189
What, you want me to drive you
to the airport?

425
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:54,690
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used
to be, especially with paperwork.

426
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,485
It's so easy to lose.

427
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,425
Now, I want you to go out there
in front of everyone and announce

428
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:03,587
our full pardon on live TV.

429
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,340
You're insane.

430
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,971
That is not the way things are done!

431
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:11,816
This is not a vacuum,
people will ask questions.

432
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:12,825
Pardon!

433
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:13,843
On stage!

434
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:14,847
Now!

435
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,564
And how do I know

436
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:24,457
that you won't release the tape
an hour later?

437
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,050
You don't.

438
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,270
You'll just have to take my word for it.

439
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:33,516
Well, I need more than that.

440
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:34,916
Well, you're not going to get it.

441
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,441
It's time.

442
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:45,795
Make your choice.

443
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:57,812
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee
and bring him here to be released.

444
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,377
What...

445
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:01,674
are you doing?

446
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:06,526
I am going to make an announcement
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother

447
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:08,829
and he will walk away unharmed.

448
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:10,714
Are you out of your mind?

449
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:15,180
He has brought
some indisputable evidence to light.

450
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:16,401
We could end this all.

451
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,356
Right now.

452
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,206
And you're gonna let them walk?

453
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,474
I am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

454
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,464
I am making the calls now.
You have no authority.

455
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:32,490
My men will see to it

456
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:34,528
that Mr. Scofield walks away

457
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,645
without the interference of you

458
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,507
and your pit bulls.

459
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,427
- You alone?
- Yeah.

460
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:18,445
How'd you do?

461
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,712
Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

462
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:21,895
Nice.

463
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:23,549
I owe you.

464
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:24,727
No, we're even.

465
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:26,841
- These are for you.
- Nice.

466
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:28,713
And this.

467
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:32,832
- What's this?
- Eddie,

468
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,473
when you broke out,
bet me a hundred bucks

469
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,863
you'd be caught in a week.

470
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,610
I said, "No way. Not the Linc I know."

471
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:40,632
Figured I'd split it with you.

472
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:44,741
So this is it ?

473
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,963
Yeah.

474
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:49,542
Good luck.

475
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,062
- You take care.
- You, too. All right.

476
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,350
You be safe.

477
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:22,275
Your neck of the woods.

478
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,832
Yeah, how's Third and Racine?

479
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:24,862
I'll be there.

480
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,090
I don't want to do this, I really don't.

481
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,022
What are you,
what are you talking about?

482
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:40,005
You can't say
that I didn't give you a choice

483
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,398
but you, you know,
you never take the easy way, you...

484
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,973
And I noticed that about you, you...

485
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:49,632
I should never expect it to be
any different, but I have a job to do,

486
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,819
a job that I'm being made to do.

487
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,542
Pick it up, Sara.

488
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:59,134
Sara, pick it up.

489
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,105
Pick up the phone!

490
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,255
Wait, wait!

491
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,010
Don't move.

492
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,520
Just...

493
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:09,272
Don't move.

494
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:12,767
I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

495
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,470
Stay right where you are, please.

496
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,242
You don't really want to do this.

497
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,250
You don't know the first thing
about what I want.

498
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Get my message?

499
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,276
<i>Yeah.</i>

500
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,034
- I got her.
- She's on her way out.

501
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:51,788
<i>Follow her;
she'll take you right to Scofield.</i>

502
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:13,980
Sir...

503
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:16,129
we need to talk.

504
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:20,384
In just a few minutes,

505
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,391
the president

506
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:23,461
is going to announce a pardon

507
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,173
for Burrows and Scofield.

508
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,767
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

509
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:31,006
She's always been willing to play ball,

510
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,968
but I think
we need to take some sort of action.

511
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:35,649
Sir...

512
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:39,966
I hate to disturb you,

513
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,356
but I'm not sure you realize the gravity

514
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,301
of what she's about to do.

515
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:05,904
Michael.

516
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:06,954
Sara, it worked.

517
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,216
The pardon?

518
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,382
She's announcing it any minute.

519
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,022
Oh, my God.

520
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,952
Oh, my God. Michael, that's amazing.

521
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:21,822
<i>Just get here, Okay ?</i>

522
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:24,718
I'm on...

523
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:27,005
Highland.

524
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:29,150
It's a warehouse.
It runs right down to the water.

525
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,379
Yeah, I'm on my way.

526
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:11,775
We did it.

527
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:13,882
Yeah?

528
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,370
What happened to your face, man?

529
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,392
If you want to take the ride...

530
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:23,802
you got to buy the ticket.

531
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:27,352
Yeah, right.
Well, Derek hooked us up with a cabin

532
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:28,473
on one of those freighters.

533
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,558
South America via the Great Lakes.

534
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,439
We're not gonna need that, but,

535
00:39:33,277 --> 00:39:35,574
this is appreciated.

536
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,308
One more time, bro.

537
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:39,435
We did it?

538
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,670
It's done.

539
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:42,729
We're done.

540
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,133
I...

541
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,559
I wish I could have seen
the look on her face.

542
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,125
No, you don't.

543
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,686
Oh, yeah, I do.

544
00:39:58,902 --> 00:39:59,902
Unbelievable.

545
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:01,727
She's going to do it.

546
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:04,412
Unbelievable.

547
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,723
<i>The president is now taking the stage
here at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.</i>

548
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:12,524
<i>The two-hour delay in her appearance</i>

549
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,983
<i>due to an investigation characterized</i>

550
00:40:14,984 --> 00:40:18,338
<i>by Press Secretary Ryan Berg
as "an overzealous fan..."</i>

551
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:27,520
You are not going to do this.

552
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:28,689
I'm afraid I am.

553
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,804
There are some developments
you need to be aware of.

554
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,101
I have made my decision.

555
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:35,122
And I would appreciate you
not second-guessing me.

556
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,129
I don't think you understand.

557
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,114
We know your secrets, too.

558
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:43,123
And we can reveal them just as easily.

559
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,340
You need to ask yourself
who you fear more,

560
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:46,341
Michael Scofield?

561
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:48,430
Or us?

562
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:50,153
You got 30 seconds.

563
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:51,951
I won't keep you.

564
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:54,481
The world is waiting.

565
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:55,821
Ten seconds.

566
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:57,183
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

567
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:58,753
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

568
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:01,315
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

569
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,829
<i>six, five,</i>

570
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:06,629
<i>four, three,</i>

571
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,011
<i>two, one.</i>

572
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:13,967
Thank you for waiting so patiently
all afternoon.

573
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:18,900
If it were not for the support
of this great state,

574
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:21,196
my home state of Illinois...

575
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:27,899
<i>... I would not be here today.</i>

576
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:30,359
<i>Which is why I have chosen</i>

577
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,545
today to make
this very important announcement.

578
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,285
A situation

579
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,333
<i>has recently come to light,</i>

580
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,515
<i>and I feel that I must take action.</i>

581
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:47,080
<i>It is my job as president
of this great country,</i>

582
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:52,648
<i>to make rational decisions
when I am given facts.</i>

583
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:57,813
Decisions that are best not for me,
but for the people.

584
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,599
And so,

585
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:04,457
after much consideration,

586
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:08,074
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

587
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,971
that I have been diagnosed

588
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:14,133
with a highly malignant form of cancer.

589
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,633
<i>And because of that reason,</i>

590
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:23,250
<i>I am no longer fit</i>

591
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:26,058
to serve as your commander in chief.

592
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:30,065
In the best interest of this country,

593
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,288
effective immediately,

594
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,376
I am stepping down as president

595
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:38,483
of the United States.

596
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:47,476
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

597
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:50,390
She can't pardon anyone.

598
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:53,219
We got nothing.

599
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,418
There's only one thing we can do.

600
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,337
We got to disappear...

601
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,396
forever.
