<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,670
I'm breaking out,

3
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:05,302
and you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

4
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:06,428
I'm sorry, Henry.

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:08,783
This message is for Maricruz.

6
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:13,583
I'll be there in the airport
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,241
Sucre, down the road,

8
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,549
if you're in trouble, post a note
on the message board.

9
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:18,682
What's it called?

10
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:20,741
Europeangoldfinch.net

11
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,231
That's a bird, right?

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,475
Go pack your things.

13
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,153
We're moving

14
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:27,730
We will be a family

15
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,261
if it kills us.

16
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:32,215
<i>Pull this off
and you're halfway home.</i>

17
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,014
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

18
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,619
Stay away from my family!

19
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,155
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

20
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:42,713
I don't feel good.

21
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:43,885
Oh, sweetie...

22
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,056
Michael, I want for this to be over.

23
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:47,110
That makes two of us.

24
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:49,794
It's just a question of knowing
at what your father gave you.

25
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:50,795
It's just a key

26
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,375
It's locked in a box
inside that cigar club.

27
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:57,799
I'm not a wanted fugitive.
Give me the key. I'll do it.

28
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,320
You want to take a walk?

29
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,445
Miss Tancredi?

30
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:33,719
I need to have a word with you.

31
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:43,672
Miss Tancredi?

32
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:44,878
Of course.

33
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:59,449
It's time to go.

34
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,945
They're going out the back.

35
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:14,120
Come on, come on.

36
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:32,036
Pediatrics, please.

37
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,303
<i>Cameron.</i>

38
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,404
Hi, Dad

39
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,606
How are you doing, big guy?

40
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,136
<i>Good. I'm eating my lunch.</i>

41
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,207
How is it?

42
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:43,671
Pretty disgusting.

43
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,769
Maybe your mom can bring you
some dinner from home.

44
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,124
Did you see the doctor today?

45
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,473
<i>Yeah. He said I can go home this week</i>

46
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,987
<i>as long as I stay out of the street.</i>

47
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,970
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

48
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,513
Are you mad at me?

49
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,437
Listen to me.

50
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,935
No one is mad at you.

51
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,540
And this wasn't your fault.

52
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,805
I'm the one who should have been
looking out for you.

53
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,158
You weren't even there.

54
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,555
But I should have been.

55
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:19,245
Aw, man.
Hey, buddy, listen. I got to go,

56
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,846
but I'll call you back later, okay?

57
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,023
Okay. Bye.

58
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,321
I love you.

59
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,159
What have we got on Franklin?

60
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:34,904
Nothing new since this morning.

61
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,942
Another witness from the Minnesota
diner robbery gave a positive I. D.

62
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,705
Good. 'Cause I just landed
in Minneapolis 15 minutes ago.

63
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,133
- Anything else?
<i>- Yeah. The girl. Dede.</i>

64
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:46,189
Apparently, she's been ill,
some chronic condition.

65
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:48,680
Fax Franklin's mug shot
to every hospital

66
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,911
in southeastern Minnesota.

67
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,091
Already done. With any luck,

68
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,720
she'll get sick enough to need one,
then he'll show his face.

69
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,429
You don't have kids, do you, Lang?

70
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,591
Nope.

71
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,569
Call me when you have something else.

72
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,702
I'll take that.

73
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,717
- We didn't get it.
- What?

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,481
And we need to get back in there soon.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,372
Once the Company finds out
Sara was in there,

76
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:19,126
it won't be long
before they start wondering why.

77
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,606
Find a spot close to the club
and sit tight.

78
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,764
We're going to take the car.

79
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,175
- We'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Where you going?

80
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,368
Turns out that maybe there's one member
of that club who can help us.

81
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:29,496
Who?

82
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,094
Pope?

83
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:34,849
Just a minute.

84
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,011
Henry.

85
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:43,865
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,170
Aside from jumping bail
and evading the authorities?

87
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,853
There's something that you need to hear,

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,750
but, first,
I need to know if you'll listen.

89
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,027
I can assure you, Sara,
we've got nothing to discuss.

90
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,429
Sir, please. I need five minutes.

91
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,347
After that, if you want us to,
we'll leave.

92
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:56,505
Who's "us"?

Transcript : swsub.com

94
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,419
I don't want any trouble.

95
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,348
Good. Because that's not why we're here.

96
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,392
What the hell are you thinking about,

97
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,566
waltzing in here?
You're a wanted criminal!

98
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,386
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated my career-- my entire life--

99
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,614
to keeping people like you behind bars.

100
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,963
You're talking about guilty people.

101
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,257
My brother is innocent.

102
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:54,229
And we may have the evidence
to prove it.

103
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,576
I want you out of here.

104
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,672
It's in a lockbox
at the Corona del Oro club,

105
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,022
and you're a member.

106
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,295
- Out!
- Henry, please listen.

107
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,867
Sara, I'm tempted to say
you should have known better.

108
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:07,723
But after what you did...

109
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,492
My father was looking into
the Burrows case when he was murdered.

110
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,048
This key is the only thing
I could recover from his body.

111
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,435
Where are we going?

112
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,337
They're hungry.

113
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,876
We've been driving all day.

114
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:41,789
Chick-O-Stick.

115
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,018
They need real food.

116
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,340
Soon enough, pumpkin.

117
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,596
Alackaday.

118
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:08,510
Miscreants. Defilers.

119
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,400
Defacers.

120
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,534
Despoilers.

121
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,116
What is this?

122
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:25,871
My home.

123
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,040
Por favor, please, please.

124
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,620
All right, sweetie,
why don't you sit over here, okay?

125
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:26,713
All right.

126
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,676
I'm going to go over there
and I'm going to talk to the lady.

127
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,315
All right? You need anything?

128
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,033
You sure?

129
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:35,035
Okay.

130
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:40,797
Yes?

131
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,249
My daughter, Dede, she's really sick.

132
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,954
She's had this kidney thing since

133
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,052
she was real young.

134
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,700
- On the left side.
- Where is she?

135
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,301
She's sitting right there.

136
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:50,611
Have you been here before?

137
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,960
No. I'm from out of town.

138
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,600
Can I see your insurance card?

139
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,106
No, no.

140
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,431
I don't have any insurance.

141
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,982
After I left the army,
they discontinued my...

142
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,218
Are you a resident of Hennepin County?

143
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,263
Like I said, we're from out of town.

144
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,443
You have a driver's license?

145
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:11,177
Look, I don't have a driver's license,

146
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,550
an insurance card,
or anything like that,

147
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:14,989
but I do know the law!

148
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,987
You have to see my little girl.

149
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,761
Let me go get my supervisor.

150
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,802
Good.

151
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:27,575
I don't give a rat's ass
about you or your brother.

152
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,262
I trusted you,

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,182
I took you under my wing,
I treated you like my own son.

154
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,252
I believed you!

155
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,044
Day after day, you lied to me.

156
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,750
What kind of a man does that?

157
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,386
A desperate one.

158
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,053
Yeah. Well...

159
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,566
you two made a big mistake
coming here today.

160
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,111
You give me no choice.

161
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,787
I'm going to notify the authorities
right now.

162
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:53,774
I'm sorry...

163
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,752
But I can't let you do that.

164
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,688
I don't want to hurt you, Henry.

165
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,309
Said by the man with the gun.

166
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,848
If it's the only way
I can convince you, so be it.

167
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,124
Well, you're not going to convince me
by doing that.

168
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,687
I'm not the man you think I am.

169
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:15,024
Well, I have a pretty good idea
who you are, Michael.

170
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,045
If that's true,

171
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,497
then you already know
I never wanted to be in Fox River.

172
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,341
I never wanted to meet you, Henry.

173
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:22,179
I certainly didn't want
to ruin your life.

174
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,243
Yeah. Well, you've done
a pretty damn good job.

175
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:27,028
You're not saying anything to him
I haven't said myself.

176
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:30,560
I've looked into this. What he's saying
to you is absolutely true.

177
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:32,341
I just want my brother's life back.

178
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,915
I want people to know the truth.

179
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,444
I'd give anything for that.

180
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,546
I'd lay down my life.

181
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,723
Well, that's easy for you to say,
standing on that side of the gun.

182
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:46,696
What if I'm standing on this side?

183
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,343
There are places
that can better serve your needs.

184
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:55,881
Look, I know my rights, okay?

185
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,830
This isn't a primary care facility.

186
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:00,213
We provide necessary care
in life-threatening situations.

187
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,236
I know what this is.

188
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:04,038
4Are you going to wait until she's dead
before you give her some help?

189
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,511
- Is that what you're saying?!
- I won't argue with you, sir.

190
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,914
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

191
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:10,060
A what?

192
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,864
What did you just say to me?

193
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,914
I can't believe you people.

194
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:23,786
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

195
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,441
We'll go somewhere else.

196
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,507
Where are we going?

197
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,901
We got to find another doctor, sweetie.

198
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,352
Oh, my God.

199
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:39,832
Let's go.

200
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,936
Move!

201
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,127
Come on, baby.

202
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:08,469
Move out of the way!

203
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:12,309
FBI! Stop!

204
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,520
Stop!

205
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:20,209
All right.

206
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:24,169
Just one second, baby.
You got to get down, okay?

207
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:27,108
- No, sweetie, you gotta get down.
- You gotta let him go, honey.

208
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,890
- Get down.
- Honey, you got to let him go.

209
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,123
Come on, you gotta let go.

210
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,463
Man, she's not letting go.

211
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,540
Don't let her pay for your mistakes.

212
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,427
You hear me?

213
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,358
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

214
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,542
But you won't.

215
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:01,747
You spent too much time around prisons
to throw your life away like that.

216
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:03,597
What the hell are you trying to pull?

217
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,799
It's simple-- that's the key

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,505
to an innocent man's freedom.

219
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,512
Come on, Henry.

220
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,932
We both know
there's something going on here.

221
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,352
Too many people have died.

222
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,880
Look me in the eye,
tell me you don't believe

223
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:16,033
there's a cover-up going on right now.

224
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:18,622
I've got no moral obligations here,
Michael.

225
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,312
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

226
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,773
Then take a ten-minute drive with me,
and we'll find out.

227
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:27,860
That's all I ask.

228
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,761
Henry, you've looked into this before.
You've thought about it.

229
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,083
I have.

230
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,907
And I've come to one conclusion:

231
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,192
this has nothing to do with me.

232
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:43,227
But I am a man of the law and right now,
I've got a convicted felon

233
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,698
standing inside my house.

234
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:48,188
Well, maybe there's something
I can offer you

235
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:49,638
to make you change your mind.

236
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,092
What do you intend to do with us?

237
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,958
<i>You grease monkey.</i>

238
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:33,095
<i>You don't deserve minimum wage.</i>

239
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,370
The hell I don't, work in graveyard.

240
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,760
There ain't no man deserve more pennies

241
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,777
on a dollar per hour
than they got IQ points

242
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:42,417
in their head. I ain't stupid.

243
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,306
Seems equal stupid as the rest of you.

244
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:49,718
Seems to run in the genes.

245
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:52,397
Teddy.

246
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,297
Tensymonyms.

247
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:56,164
Pick a word.

248
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,605
Pick a word.

249
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,021
Destroy.

250
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:05,960
Ten synonyms for "destroy."

251
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,016
for "destroy.3

252
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,133
Annul.

253
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,143
Mutilate.

254
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Liquidate.

255
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:24,999
Abrogate.

256
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,103
Quell.

257
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,503
Ravage.

258
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,006
Expunge.

259
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Demolish.

260
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,608
Extirpate.

261
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:32,965
Extinguish.

262
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,792
You see that?!

263
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,637
Stupid, my pail, my boy's
gonna be president.

264
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,670
How come you ain't studying?

265
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,255
'Cause I'm tired.

266
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,526
'Cause I feel like a circus freak.

267
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,739
Well...

268
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:21,746
Now...

269
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,827
It's in your own best interest.

270
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,534
Don't you understand that?

271
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,459
Now, you're going to be
president someday.

272
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,236
You mark my words.

273
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,780
Theodore, do you hear me?

274
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,224
What are you going to do with us?

275
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:20,473
We're gonna put down some roots.

276
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,115
You wanted me dead, Paul.

277
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,497
Just following orders.

278
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,051
Sent me to the chair
for something I didn't do,

279
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,590
all for your president.

280
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,400
You were willing to do that.

281
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:36,347
Just... following... orders.

282
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,831
Steadman said you loved her.

283
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,331
He was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

284
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,307
You don't love someone
that loves power more than life.

285
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:45,590
Bitter, huh?

286
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,184
Am I?

287
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:51,097
No offense, but you're not capable

288
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,098
of understanding the relationship.

289
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,115
Okay, any way you look at it,

290
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:03,859
there is no light
at the end of this tunnel.

291
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,264
One way or another,
you and I, we die.

292
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:08,379
Your brother, too.

293
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,117
Which is a shame given
all he's done for you.

294
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,484
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

295
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,249
Think she's better off for it?

296
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,338
We'll make it.

297
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,345
What is that, faith?

298
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,463
Yeah, that's faith.

299
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:22,428
All I see is a black hole.

300
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:23,934
And sooner or later,

301
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,262
they are going to suck each one
of us into it.

302
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,248
But when they come for me,

303
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:33,132
I'm going to take as many
of them with me as I can.

304
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,386
She must have really broken your heart,
Paul.

305
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,356
<i>President Reynolds attended
a Chicago fundraiser last night<i/>

306
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:46,062
<i>as part of her two-day stop
in the Windy City.</i>

307
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,957
<i>Reynolds' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest</i>

308
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,712
<i>with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit</i>

309
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,948
<i>and Flint, Michigan later in the week.</i>

310
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,776
<i>At a Democratic fundraiser...</i>

311
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,522
Mr. Kim,
Sarah Tancredi surfaced
in Chicago.

312
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,834
She was spotted at the Corona
de Oro Club about an hour ago.

313
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:02,991
Corona de Oro Club?

314
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,179
It's a cigar club.

315
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,591
Her father was a member.

316
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,968
He kept a private humidor there.

317
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:15,105
Get me a jet to Chicago.

318
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:01,797
Tell me you're not still thinking
he's going to show.

319
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,665
He's let you down so many times.
You know that.

320
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,579
Probably, maybe it's the baby in me

321
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,726
that's telling me that
this time it's going to be different.

322
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,610
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but he's not going to show.

323
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:20,615
Bubble's not burst.

324
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,720
I got three words for you.

325
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:25,721
Yeah?

326
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:27,324
We gotta run.

327
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,742
Good seeing you, Theresa!

328
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:35,640
Andale!

329
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,311
- I'm so glad you came.
- You're crazy.

330
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,010
How did they know?

331
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,159
You're certain...

332
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,020
about what's in the box?

333
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,770
No, but it's all we've got.

334
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:25,764
Thank you, Henry.

335
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:42,167
You sure about this?

336
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,965
Either way, you still owe me dinner.

337
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:50,729
Is that so?

338
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:52,876
Yeah.

339
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:55,429
First week in Fox River,
you promised me, if you ever

340
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,590
got out of there,
you'd take me to dinner.

341
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:59,747
Well, maybe, after we wrap this up,
we can stop off

342
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:02,805
and get you a burrito on the way back
to Pope's house.

343
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:04,204
I don't know what you're used to,

344
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,732
but anything short of a filet mignon

345
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,191
is not going to cut it with me.

346
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,062
It's a date.

347
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:21,242
Give me the phone.

348
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:31,403
<i>How did you pull that off?</i>

349
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:32,488
I'll tell you later.

350
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:33,905
<i>- Is he in yet?</i>
-Yep.

351
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,205
<i>This shouldn't take more
than a couple of minutes.</i>

352
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,110
<i>Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.</i>

353
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,738
- This way.
- Thank you.

354
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,291
Mr. Pope.

355
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,286
Hey, Warren. How's it going?

356
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:53,077
Did you hear what happened this morning?
Sara Tancredi came in.

357
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:54,621
Yeah. So I heard.

358
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,100
Next time, don't let her get away.

359
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,959
Thanks.

360
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:59,875
Excuse me, do you mind
if I borrow your computer for a moment?

361
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:00,876
No problem.

362
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,078
Thanks.

363
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:15,814
Pitch in, chitlins!

364
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,255
We can't do this.

365
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:18,775
We can't live here.

366
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,864
No, of course not like this.

367
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:23,169
We gonna clean. We are cleaning!

368
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,268
We gonna rebuild!

369
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,034
You can't do this to them.

370
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,035
Look at them.

371
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,164
Y'all mind coming along here
for a minute.

372
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:40,303
Come on. I think we're past me
waving that gun around,

373
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:41,304
don't you think?

374
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:43,859
Come on.

375
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,424
What are you doing?

376
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:47,972
Nothing is gonna happen to them.

377
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,669
Susan. Susie Q.

378
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,128
Do you think I'd bring you here

379
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,129
to so sacred a place to me as this

380
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,278
if I meant you ill?

381
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,399
Look at me!

382
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:02,771
I am not the animal
you think you see before you.

383
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:08,375
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

384
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,833
Don't you understand?

385
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,005
I don't.

386
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:17,856
What I'm trying to say is that...

387
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,874
I am the sin of my father.

388
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:26,552
Why are you telling me this?

389
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,346
Because I love you.

390
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:32,752
Because I want you to understand me.

391
00:27:33,462 --> 00:27:35,970
I am the last in the line of Bagwells.

392
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,191
The tail end of a corrupted breed.

393
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:44,481
The earth, thank God,
shall see no more of our generations.

394
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,264
I cannot procreate, Susan.

395
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,333
And yet, there's something in that

396
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:04,804
that gives me great hope.

397
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:08,086
No more Bagwells shall roam this planet.

398
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:10,487
Not with that vile blood in their veins.

399
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,620
All I want to do is end the bloodline,
extirpate it,

400
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,849
and start another, a fresh.

401
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,253
A new family.

402
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,358
Teddy.

403
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,464
Those children are my salvation,

404
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:26,049
my chance to make this world
a better place.

405
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:31,651
I will be good, Susan.

406
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:33,773
I will love them.

407
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,022
I will love you.

408
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,379
I will take communion, be baptized

409
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,706
under a truer light.

410
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:42,283
All I ask

411
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,402
is that you love me back.

412
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,039
Just a little.

413
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,133
Or learn to do so in time.

414
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,145
Can you do that, Susan?

415
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,859
I can't.

416
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:07,713
I can't.

417
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,696
Teddy, I'm sorry.

419
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,101
I can do it. I can love you!

420
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,294
Where are we?

421
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,521
At the doctor's office, sweetie.

422
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:24,601
Hello, I have an emergency in here.

423
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,256
Hey, you the doctor?

424
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:49,273
- Need to wait your turn.
- No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

425
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:51,428
I need you to look at my daughter, okay?

426
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:53,017
She's not feeling too good.

427
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:55,233
Please.

428
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,302
Sweetie, hold on, so I can...

429
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:05,843
All right, look,
this is all the money I got, okay?

430
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,144
That's $400.

431
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,595
Please look at my daughter.

432
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,508
What's the matter with her?

433
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,604
She has a kidney disease. PKD.

434
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,632
Normally, we have it under control,

435
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,395
but I don't like what I'm seeing
right now.

436
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:25,807
Her stomach hurts, okay?

437
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:27,631
And she's always hot.

438
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,565
- How's her appetite?
- It's gone.

439
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,186
She's always tired,
ain't that right, baby?

440
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,256
All right.

441
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:35,662
Hop up here.

442
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,115
Thank you.

443
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,813
He just wants to take
a good look at you, okay?

444
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,769
May need to run a few tests.

445
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,711
Just do what you have to do, man.

446
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:51,984
I'm gonna be right here, okay, baby?

447
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:01,020
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- What's going on now?

448
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:02,443
Still in there.

449
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:04,407
This is taking too long.

450
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:06,814
Wait, wait, wait.

451
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
Here he comes.

452
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:15,876
What's happening?

453
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:16,901
We got company.

454
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,481
Hello, Henry.

455
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,448
I didn't know you were a cigar man.

456
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,625
Who are you?

457
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,329
Uh, a friend.

458
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:33,577
A colleague, in fact.

459
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,236
We're both in law enforcement.

460
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,237
I'm not anymore.

461
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,288
That's right. You're...

462
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:40,958
...retired.

463
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,311
- Know the guy?
- Yeah.

464
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,111
Looks like
the lifestyle's treating you well.

465
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:53,086
Socializing over Cubans and cognac?

466
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,244
But that's not what you were doing,
is it?

467
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:01,035
Henry.

468
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,640
You don't mind if ask you
to empty your pockets?

469
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:06,721
As a matter of fact, I do.

470
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:09,250
I'm not going to play
any games with you.

471
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,621
We both know why
you came here today.

472
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:17,184
I suggest you get out
of my way, young man.

473
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,259
I can't do that.

474
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,830
Unless you'd like to cause
serious trouble

475
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:30,270
for yourself and your family,

476
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:34,009
I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

477
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:37,944
Now.

478
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,329
Get in!

479
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:17,654
Let's go!

480
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,573
It's okay. Easy, easy, it's okay.

481
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:05,516
Ma'am, are you all right?

482
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:08,558
I don't understand.

483
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:09,942
We got a call.

484
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,317
Someone said there's a
hostage situation here.

485
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:15,986
No one knew we were here.

486
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,007
Are you okay?

487
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:40,457
Okay.

488
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:42,783
Hey, so what's going on?

489
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:46,706
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

490
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,790
She ever had hemodialysis?

491
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,548
No, hemo... No.

492
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:54,088
No, this has never really gone that far.

493
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:59,797
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

494
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:01,663
We're not set up for it.

495
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,317
And neither is she.

496
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:07,034
But there is a county
dialysis clinic a few blocks away.

497
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:10,683
But we're gonna have to place
a catheter in her neck

498
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,073
so she can be examined.

499
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,700
Hold on, sweetie,
this is gonna be a little cold.

500
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:18,485
It's okay, baby.

501
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,104
Wait, wait.

502
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:29,407
What is that?

503
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:32,418
It's a trocar.
It's used for placing the catheter.

504
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:33,901
Lie down, honey.

505
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:41,997
Do we really have to go this far?

506
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:43,425
Look.

507
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:47,538
I'm doing the best I can here,
but you got to understand something.

508
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,908
Your daughter is sick.

509
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,551
Now, this may look like a
desperate measure because it is.

510
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,732
This is gonna hurt a little bit,
sweetie.

511
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Stop!

512
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:04,757
Come on, baby.

513
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:07,504
Come with me.

514
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,855
I can't do this.

515
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:30,269
What's going on?

516
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,858
I made a deal with Pope.

517
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,023
You made a deal with Pope?

518
00:37:39,243 --> 00:37:40,301
What kind of deal?

519
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:44,000
If he came with us and
if we got what we needed,

520
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:46,838
I said I'd turn myself in.

521
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:48,156
What?

522
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:50,394
We don't even know
what this thing is!

523
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,163
It could be nothing, Michael.

524
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,742
You know about this?

525
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,593
Not until it came out of his mouth.

526
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:57,746
It's the only thing I could think of.

527
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,726
You two can still finish this.

528
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,681
You'll just have to do it without me.

529
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:04,279
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael.

530
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,170
There's no coming back from this!

531
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:10,638
Hold on.

532
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,898
What's the holdup?

533
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,327
Your brother's right.

534
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,488
I wouldn't count on the courts
to show you any leniency in this.

535
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:22,240
That doesn't matter.
I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

536
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:23,472
You already did.

537
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:27,172
I listened to this.

538
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,030
You have something here.

539
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,762
There's gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

540
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:35,952
- Listen, Henry...
- I'd go now if I were you.

541
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,352
And don't consider this forgiveness.

542
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,139
In fact, I'm about ten seconds
away from changing my mind.

543
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:45,046
Thank you.

544
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:02,729
Okay...

545
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,247
Here, listen...

546
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:11,900
Let's tuck you in, all right?

547
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:18,451
Come on. Let's go.

548
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,064
Let's just...

549
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,442
Let's just sit for a bit longer, okay?

550
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:36,391
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

551
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:58,142
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

552
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,756
I love you so much.

553
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:03,264
I'm so sorry.

554
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,138
I'm so sorry, baby.

555
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,228
Got a call for you.

556
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:32,022
I'll call back. I just heard
from some clinic up north.

557
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,528
They had contact with Franklin
half an hour ago.

558
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,067
I think you want to take this.

559
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:38,983
Put it through.

560
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:44,217
Is this the man in charge?

561
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,285
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

562
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:46,942
My name...

563
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:48,776
is Benjamin

564
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,551
Miles...

565
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:52,210
...Franklin.

566
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,512
And I want to turn myself in.

567
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:58,516
<i>But I got one condition.</i>

568
00:40:58,966 --> 00:40:59,970
<i>My wife...</i>

569
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,417
She goes free.

570
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,190
My little daughter,
she needs her mother.

571
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,581
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

572
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:14,218
And what if I got something you need?

573
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,911
Your wife was released an hour ago.

574
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,262
She'll be here soon.

575
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:00,641
You promise me that she will be okay.

576
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:08,936
Just hold up your end of the deal.

577
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:13,006
I will.

578
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:18,392
I'll get you Scofield.

579
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,719
Here we go.

580
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:48,904
You think it's a conversation?

581
00:42:50,383 --> 00:42:52,044
One they don't want us to hear.

582
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,443
You ready?

583
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:56,842
Let's do it.
