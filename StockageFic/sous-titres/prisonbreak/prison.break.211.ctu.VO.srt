00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:01,513
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:06,269
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:07,348
You can't kill.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,139
I will get you.

5
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:10,218
This is...

6
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:12,953
in case you run into trouble

7
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:14,109
down the road.

8
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,598
Lincoln, he really wants to see you
and your brother.

9
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:18,750
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

10
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,604
Let's go.

11
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:22,374
Michael never met your grandfather.

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:23,658
Dad.

13
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,670
- I got Burrows.
- Take care of them.

14
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,895
I think there's a part of me
that enjoys this.

15
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,462
It feels to me like chasing a high.

16
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,639
And I should know better

17
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:33,966
by now.

18
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:40,465
Hi, Sara.

19
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,276
Hey, what is this?

20
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:45,844
It's for my... blood pressure.

21
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:48,110
Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man.

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,955
No deals.

23
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,186
You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

24
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:53,824
Ain't that the most beautiful thing
you ever seen?

25
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,127
This is the Tribune police.

26
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:26,194
This is the Tribune police.

27
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:27,870
Make yourself known.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,988
Hey, you're in luck.

29
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,094
Had a case in back.

30
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,240
Excellent.

31
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,108
Fishing reel oil.

32
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,159
And you want the whole case?

33
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,127
Whole case.

34
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,052
And the GPS?

35
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,810
And the GPS.

36
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:05,910
Must do quite a bit of fishing.

37
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:07,765
Yeah, a lot of fishing...

38
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,575
not a whole lot of catching.

39
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:12,696
$96.23.

40
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,425
I'm just going to take the reel oil.

41
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,073
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,114
You have to pay for that.

43
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,900
Just take it. Please, don't hurt me.

44
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:51,695
Please.

45
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:08,000
<i>You have to pay for that.</i>

46
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,236
The vault. Open it.

47
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:12,604
<i>One for the team.</i>

48
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:18,860
<i>I wasn't going for me,</i>

49
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:20,887
<i>I was going for my daughter.</i>

50
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:23,160
Give Anna her papa's love.

51
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:27,839
I'm going cut your throat out.

52
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,597
<i>I loved you, Michael.</i>

53
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,063
You just used me.

54
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,122
Cops found your girlfriend

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,900
fish-belly white, gargling her own puke.

56
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,577
And what do you care?
As long as she left the door open.

57
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,880
I feel very fortunate to have met you.

58
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,072
I'm sorry, Henry.

59
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:11,813
It's about corporate interests
taking over the government...

60
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,451
buying elections,

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,115
fighting wars...

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,840
People dying so they can turn a profit.

63
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,045
We're trying to stop it.

64
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,075
What are you, a bunch of spies?

65
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,476
Just a handful of senators, congressmen,

66
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:28,153
people like me that once worked
for the company.

67
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:29,654
People willing to expose

68
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:31,348
the President for what she is...

69
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:33,617
A shill working for these corporations.

70
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,946
We bring her down, we bring them down.

71
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:37,961
What's it got to do with me?

72
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,947
Because the way we're going
to bring her down

73
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,048
is also what we're going to use
to set you free.

74
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,549
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

75
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,321
An NSA analyst

76
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:47,933
sympathetic to our cause

77
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,852
finally worked his way up

78
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,651
and got clearance
into the Echelon program.

79
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,628
E- mails, cell phone calls

80
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:56,742
all across this country,

81
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,009
if it's transmitted,
it goes through Echelon.

82
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,916
It's catalogued, interpreted,

83
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,149
and then stored for Homeland Security.

84
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:04,787
Nothing is missed by them.

85
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,334
Nothing.

86
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:08,745
Including, by accident,

87
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,191
for a few months after 9-11...

88
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,119
the White House.

89
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,237
The analyst got his hands
on a phone conversation

90
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:20,110
the president had
with Terrence Steadman...

91
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,409
two weeks after
you supposedly killed him.

92
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:29,058
Now, the analyst tried to get
this information out of the building...

93
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,193
but it turns out,
someone else was snooping, too.

94
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,032
Someone else wanted answers

95
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:41,816
about the president.

96
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,853
Aldo and Lincoln want to be left alone.

97
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,067
Sure, I understand.

98
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:56,173
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,

99
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:57,946
the analyst is missing,

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,562
and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

101
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,762
The tape is still out there.

102
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:10,435
And judging by how hard
they're going after Sara Tancredi,

103
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,538
I'm pretty sure they think she has it.

104
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:15,012
And I think they're right.

105
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,874
She's the key to this whole thing,
Lincoln.

107
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,081
I would imagine

108
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,434
that you're feeling
slightly betrayed right now.

109
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,458
I understand.

110
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:54,368
As you can see,

111
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,449
hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

112
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,935
There is one thing about me

113
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,194
that should mean
a great deal to you right now.

114
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,638
That is I am reasonable.

115
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,044
If you tell me what you know,

116
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,508
you get to go.

117
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:11,852
Then maybe

118
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,239
when this is all behind us,

119
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,481
we get to grab a piece of pie
for old times' sake.

120
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,031
I don't know where Michael is.

121
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,300
This is not about Michael,
this is about your father.

122
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:32,348
He left washington with something
that didn't belong to him.

123
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:33,716
We need it back.

124
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:34,872
And you killed him for it.

125
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,371
I didn't, no,

126
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,154
for what that's worth.

127
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,273
But I hope that his death

128
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:43,045
properly illustrates the magnitude

129
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,171
of the situation
that we're in right now.

130
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,312
So, where is it?

131
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

132
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,099
Where is it?

133
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:57,356
I don't know what you're talking about.

134
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,474
Where is it?

135
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

136
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,307
Sara, there's a next step
involved in this,

137
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,900
and you don't want to experience that.

138
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:15,340
I swear to God I don't know
what you're talking about.

139
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,093
My father didn't give me anything.

140
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,498
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,363
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

142
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,639
How long has it been
since your last confession?

143
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,989
This is my first time.

144
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,824
In a long time.

145
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,976
Are you aware of the nature
of your sins?

146
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,001
The nature?

147
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:02,547
I'm not really sure.

148
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,111
Deep down inside your heart, you know.

149
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:09,854
Righteousness, maybe.

150
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,661
Believing the ends justify the means.

151
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:15,823
What are those ends?

152
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:18,914
Saving someone's life.

153
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,080
And the means?

154
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,746
I've broken just about
every law you can name.

155
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,174
But it's not just what I've done.

156
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:31,961
It's what others have done...

157
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,585
because I let them.

158
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,141
Because I was doing
what I thought was right.

159
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,220
I should have known better this time.

160
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,377
This time?

161
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,566
When I was a kid...

162
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,664
I watched a man bleed out and die.

163
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,338
And I was glad...

164
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:00,845
because he deserved it.

165
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,937
Life is only for God
to give and take, my son.

166
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:07,060
Suddenly, there is this dark space
inside of me.

167
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,507
And I knew it was wrong.

168
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:14,328
But here I am.

169
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,160
There is a way to stop this.

170
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,477
Surrender your will to God.

171
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,120
If I surrender now,

172
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,905
I lose everything that I love.

173
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:28,539
But do you lose your soul
in the process?

174
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,287
Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

175
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,815
You okay?

176
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,500
This is never gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming after us.

177
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,797
Lincoln, don't.

178
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,616
Is it done?

179
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,431
You are.

180
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,042
Lincoln Burrows.

181
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,338
Your man's dead.

182
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,619
Just like anyone else you send
to take out my son.

183
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,383
We want you.

184
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,372
This isn't about L. J.

185
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,703
There's a very simple way
for all of this to end.

186
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,250
I'll tell you how it's going to end.

187
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,773
Me staring in your dead eye
with my hand around your throat.

188
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,010
You don't even know who I am.

189
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,301
How much further?

190
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,397
Right here is good.

191
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:00,306
Alright, you got it.

192
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,850
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

193
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,020
Agent Mahone.

194
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,484
Bill Kim.

195
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,190
I'm here to pick you up.

196
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:25,231
I called Kellerman.

197
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,196
He's busy right now.

198
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,836
Does anyone else know you're here?

199
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:32,823
Good.

200
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,173
Can you open the gate?

201
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,470
And I need a new vehicle.

202
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,504
There's something you should know
about me.

203
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,477
I don't like being out in the field.

204
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,710
I only do so when there's been
a screwup.

205
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,180
I'm out in the field, Alex.

206
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:50,715
Then why don't you open the gate?

207
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:51,929
You can hurry back to D. C.

208
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,680
before your shoes get dirty.

209
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:58,536
We have a lead as to where Burrows
will be meeting up with his brother.

210
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,157
It's a place he referred to
as "Bolshoi Booze."

211
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:02,582
Does that mean anything to you?

212
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:05,049
Yeah, it's one of a hundred tattoos
on Scofield's body.

213
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,472
What does it mean?

214
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,724
I don't know yet.

215
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:10,448
You'll need to figure it out
within the next couple of hours.

216
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,143
If Scofield and Burrows
cross the border,

217
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,953
they'll be out of your jurisdiction,

218
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,604
and you'll be of no further value
to us.

219
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,520
Open the gate.

220
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:21,772
So you can do what?

221
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:24,073
I want to hear it.

222
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:26,792
Straight from the mouth of the guy
who's supposed to be our closer.

223
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,987
I'll get Scofield and Burrows...

224
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:31,211
and all of the rest of them.

225
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:34,639
And then me and you and Kellerman,

226
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,572
we're going to part ways.

227
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,427
I just hope you're properly motivated.

228
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:53,690
'Cause as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

229
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,565
And then you can go back
to Colorado and visit your son.

230
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:01,914
Cameron.

231
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,242
He's five, right?

232
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:08,053
Don't you ever mention his name again.

233
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:11,088
There he is.

234
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:15,033
That's what I wanted to hear.

235
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:21,956
You cracking, Alex.

236
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,780
A lot of people are relying on you.

237
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:34,565
Jane will take care of it.
You can trust her.

238
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,696
I know this is hard,
but it will work out.

239
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:39,832
You have my word.

240
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,017
Thank you.

241
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,130
Be careful.

242
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:55,232
Listen...

243
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:58,622
I know.

244
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:03,001
Jane's gonna look after you.

245
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,020
I don't even know her.

246
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:08,420
She's all right.
She's been working for dad for a while.

247
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,151
I'll see you soon, I promise.

248
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,425
Isn't that the same thing
your dad told you?

249
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,131
Yeah, but I mean it.

250
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,108
What now?

251
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,622
Hey, it's me.

252
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:01,140
Just call me when you get this, okay?
It's important.

253
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:36,876
They're numbers.

254
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,157
Is that my payment?

255
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:36,784
Medical nitroglycerine?

256
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:38,075
As promised.

257
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:49,570
You have no idea how hard it is
to get this kind of grade.

258
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:52,421
Even with my contacts.

259
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:54,348
It's time for your end of the deal.

260
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,197
Where's that plane gonna be?

261
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,412
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

262
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:02,650
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

263
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,885
Since it's going to be a while,

264
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,927
you might want to stay out of the sun.

265
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,555
Is there a problem?

266
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:21,415
They're my cousins.

267
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,380
Now, after your father

268
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:37,662
accessed this information, he made

269
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:40,532
three calls

270
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,130
from his cell phone, all to you.

271
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,435
What did he tell you?

272
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,789
Just that he was coming back to Chicago.

273
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,204
Good. You're being honest. Good.

274
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,323
Now, there's a half an hour

275
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,929
between when your father landed
and when he got home

276
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:55,278
that is unaccounted for.

277
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:58,298
I know you stopped by his office.
Did you see him there?

278
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:01,718
The last time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

279
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,606
Did your father have anyone
give you anything?

280
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,678
Do you think that I'm just
withholding information

281
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:07,283
because I like hanging out with you?

282
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,397
If I knew something,
I would tell you. I don't.

283
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,608
I don't know anything about any of this.

284
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:12,706
Really?

285
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:16,220
Then why did you give your father
the file on Lincoln Burrows?

286
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:19,135
Why did you open the door for Scofield
and help him escape?

287
00:23:19,154 --> 00:23:21,037
Why did Scofield send you
those coded notes?

288
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:23,965
Why did you come to New Mexico
to meet him?

289
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,057
Don't try to float
a babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

290
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:32,154
It's really going to piss me off, so...

291
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:33,599
come on.

292
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:55,381
You're okay.

293
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:06,088
Look, Sara.

294
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,241
We're going to have to come
to an understanding.

295
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,465
You know that, right?

296
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,637
<i>Yeah, you were right;
they are coordinates.</i>

297
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:24,037
Plug them into your GPS.

298
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:26,338
They'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.

299
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,298
It's in the middle of nowhere,
basically.

300
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:29,858
Thanks.

301
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:32,438
<i>Yeah, no problem. Sir,
who are you meeting?</i>

302
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:35,617
What the hell is he doing?

303
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,871
He's keeping us out of the loop,
that's what he's doing.

304
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:44,122
I'm constantly running
from the law with a bad heart...

305
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:47,192
Mexico, where I'm from
has got a lot of great things, but...

306
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,509
health care ain't one of them.

307
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,271
You all right?

308
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:53,426
You look a little nervous.

309
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,102
I don't do this every day.

310
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,024
I just want to get the information
on that plane and, uh...

311
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:00,431
move on.

312
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:01,573
Is that it?

313
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:02,652
That's it.

314
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,513
'Cause I know who you are.

315
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:08,030
You don't have to worry...

316
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:09,439
we can't go within 100 feet

317
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,595
of a federal marshal
to collect the reward,

318
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:14,620
'cause we got U. S. and mexican warrants
on our heads.

319
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,278
But this plane to Panama...

320
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:19,362
Sit down.

321
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:29,382
This is all for your brother?

322
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,998
I got four brothers, two in prison.

323
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,218
Accept a call? Yes.

324
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:38,867
But break them out?

325
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,119
<i>Loco.</i>

326
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:43,216
My brother gave me a baseball mitt
for my 14th birthday.

327
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:45,296
I owed him.

328
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,308
You're a better man than I am.

329
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,888
Time will tell.

330
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,930
Shouldn't they have called by now...
about the plane?

331
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:04,155
You know, I...

332
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:05,638
I have a question.

333
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:10,705
I thought that these
came in glass vials,

334
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:13,652
not plastic.

335
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:17,530
I thought so, too, but the guy

336
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,473
I bought it from
said he packed it in plastic

337
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,393
for transportation over long distances
to prevent a fire

338
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,609
or an explosion.

339
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,011
Really?

340
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,939
I never heard of that.

341
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,284
What's going on?

342
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:42,531
We're going to do
a little quality control test.

343
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,072
It's the best available.

344
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,690
We got time.

345
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:20,904
For the last time,

346
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:22,656
some black male, early 20s,

347
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:25,300
jumped me from behind.
I didn't get a good look at his face.

348
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,897
The assailant attacked you from behind?

349
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,091
That's what I just said.

350
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,473
Yet he managed
to make contact square on your forehead.

351
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:33,006
- That's right.
- With what? A boomerang?

352
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,858
Why don't you tell me what happened?

353
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:38,018
Look, I'm a retired correctional officer
out of Illinois.

354
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,577
How about showing
some professional courtesy, honey?

355
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:52,713
<i>This is Roy Geary. Leave a message.</i>

356
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,967
You thieving son of a bitch.

357
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:57,928
You better get down on your knees
and pray to god that I don't find you,

358
00:27:58,063 --> 00:27:59,955
because, if I do, mark my words,

359
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:02,215
I'm going to gut you bow to stern.

360
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,613
<i>President Reynolds
was in Tallahassee, Florida,</i>

361
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,045
<i>early this morning, attending</i>

362
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:11,691
<i>a $5,000-a-plate breakfast fund-raiser</i>

363
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,425
<i>for senator Martin Kleinhenz,</i>

364
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:14,898
<i>who's running for reelection.</i>

365
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,180
<i>Later this afternoon,</i>

366
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:17,871
<i>her press conference was derailed</i>

367
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,805
<i>when a reporter asked her to comment</i>

368
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:21,918
<i>on Lincoln Burrows' escape from custody.</i>

369
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,671
<i>She declined.</i>

370
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,723
<i>It's become clear
in her first month in office</i>

371
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:28,901
<i>that she cannot separate herself
from this manhunt.</i>

372
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,977
<i>And as long as it continues...</i>

373
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,775
<i>pundits say that questions
about Burrows will contin...</i>

374
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:39,999
Ladies.

375
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:42,098
Let's get this party started.

376
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,602
The last 30 years,

377
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,623
I've hated you.

378
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,068
You walked out on me.

379
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,315
You haven't even seen Michael.

380
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,839
I've seen him before.

381
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:57,756
Not in the papers, dad.

382
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:02,926
Been trying to work out
what kind of man abandons his family.

383
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,129
Now I'm doing the same damn thing.

384
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:10,915
You'll see him again.

385
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:12,668
I'll make sure of it.

386
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:17,764
How much further?

387
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:19,247
About three hours.

388
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:28,146
It's gonna be a few minutes.

389
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:29,605
My brother should be here soon.

390
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:32,130
Maybe I should go outside
and make sure he can see me.

391
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,668
That's a good idea.
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

392
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:35,958
<i>Ernesto, por favor.</i>

393
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,358
<i>Bueno, te veo.</i>

394
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,771
Was that the call?

395
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,562
Yes, it was.

396
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:04,912
About the plane?

397
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:06,588
<i>Como se llamas?</i>

398
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,821
<i>Agua con azucar.</i>

399
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:12,356
Sugar water.

400
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,129
You just made a big mistake, blanquito.

401
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,626
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

402
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:17,743
I'm not a chemist.

403
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,178
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

404
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,625
We both got screwed.

405
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,226
But only one of us is gonna pay for it.

406
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,776
Look, I just want to get out of here,

407
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:28,531
and you want your payment.
My brother's gonna be here soon.

408
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:30,534
We'll work something out.

409
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:31,747
Just name your price.

410
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:33,528
I already named my price.

411
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,129
You didn't come through.

412
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,420
When's your brother getting here?

413
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,329
You were planning on turning us
in the whole time, weren't you?

414
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,041
When's he supposed to meet you here?!

415
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,139
<i>Sueltalo.</i>

416
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:55,247
Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.

417
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:56,634
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

418
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:58,526
<i>- Suelta la pistola.
- Ey, no estoy jugando.</i>

419
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,726
<i>Sueltala, cabron!</i>

420
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,479
<i>Quieto!</i>

421
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,965
- Where is it?
- My father didn't give me anything.

422
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:24,722
Who you risking your life for?

423
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,921
Lincoln Burrows.

424
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,176
Street thug.

425
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,310
And why is that your concern?

426
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:37,006
I mean, is there somewhere
in the hippocratic oath where it says,

427
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:38,682
"I pledge to risk my life

428
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:40,401
for those who don't care about mine"?

429
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,403
'Cause they don't care about yours.

430
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,807
Burrows and Michael Scofield

431
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:46,404
just used you.

432
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:49,633
Are you that surprised
that there are people in the world

433
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,168
who will stand up to people like you?

434
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,229
Are you that far gone?

435
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:54,963
That's cute.

436
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,895
Sad,

437
00:31:58,491 --> 00:31:59,492
but cute.

438
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,759
A Cleveland what?

439
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:18,776
Don't worry, I'll talk you through it.

440
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,458
And we got a glass coffee table
right here.

441
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:25,269
Hell no.

442
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,870
I'll do it for a thousand.

443
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:28,199
$500.

444
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,375
$1,000.

445
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,547
$750.

446
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,321
All right.

447
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,031
What the hell?

448
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:01,211
Leave.

449
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:06,864
You know,

450
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,049
it's amazing what you can pick up
at an army-navy store.

451
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,433
All that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

452
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,980
And if you ask me,
he took the whole thing way too far.

453
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:19,365
Listen,

454
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:22,089
why don't I just give you
half the money, and we call it a day?

455
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,437
All right, 60-40.

456
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,838
Come on, T, we can deal.

457
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,594
Where's the plane going to land?

458
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,963
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

459
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:42,969
What are we going to do?

460
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,353
I don't know.

461
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,680
We're not going to get
across the border on the ground.

462
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,151
Without that plane, we're screwed.

463
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:51,562
He's losing too much blood.
He'll never make it like this.

464
00:33:51,582 --> 00:33:53,661
He should have thought
before he tried to kill us.

465
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,041
We got to take him to a hospital,
or else he'll die.

466
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,025
Please.

467
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:02,049
The plane, and we'll let you go.

468
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:03,821
<i>Dicelo.</i>

469
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:05,457
<i>Dicelo todo.</i>

470
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:07,615
<i>Dicelo ahora!</i>

471
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,065
Finley road...

472
00:34:16,914 --> 00:34:18,031
off of highway 8,

473
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:20,665
- there's an airstrip there.
- There, okay?

474
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,621
- Now let us go.
- Let's go.

475
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:24,406
Michael, let's go.

476
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,293
Please.

477
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,661
Michael, let's go.

478
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,982
Don't do this, please don't do this.

479
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:33,478
Let's go.

480
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:36,412
If we were bleeding he would have
not lifted a finger, you know that.

481
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,529
He was gonna kill us both.

482
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,230
- Let's go.
- No, that's not true.

483
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,471
Michael,
we're going to get to that plane...

484
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:43,668
Let's go now, please.

485
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,209
Please don't do this, okay?!

486
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:46,249
<i>Callate!</i>

487
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,507
Don't listen to him!

488
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,689
I care about you.

489
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:59,329
This is not what I wanted, Sara.

490
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,639
<i>What's going on with Sara?</i>

491
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,469
<i>Has she told you anything?</i>

492
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:20,510
Don't go anywhere.

493
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,102
Not yet.

494
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,320
<i>I trust you've been... persuasive.</i>

495
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:26,073
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

496
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:27,614
Then kill her.

497
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,070
Well, she knows something.

498
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,556
You disobey me, you are done.

499
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:38,235
Do you understand me?

500
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:41,340
<i>Put her in the ground, Paul.</i>

501
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:31,932
Let's go.

502
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:33,615
Hold still.

503
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:36,932
We're doing it wrong.
Let's get out of here.

504
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,056
He's gonna call the cops,
or go get his buddies...

505
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,260
he's not going to make it.

506
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,937
We'll call them when we get safe.

507
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,517
Let's go, Michael, let's go!

508
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:45,846
Thank you.

509
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,661
You got to get him
to a hospital right away.

510
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:05,466
Wait. Wait.

511
00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:09,068
Hey, man... forget Finley road.

512
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,966
The plane is going to stop
at the seven mile marker

513
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:15,324
on route 4 at sunset.

514
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,633
It's going to stop for five minutes.

515
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:20,137
Then it's going to go to Oaxaca, Mexico.

516
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:21,430
If you miss it,

517
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,944
you're out of luck.

518
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:35,233
He bled out on the way over.

519
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,428
Any id?

520
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,666
Yeah, Roy Geary,

521
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:39,804
just an out-of-stater.

522
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,274
You know him?

523
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:52,626
He's a friend of mine.

524
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,200
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah.

525
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,185
You mind answering a few more questions?

526
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:11,558
<i>It's Pam.</i>

527
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,580
What's going on?

528
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:17,811
I just wanted to say hey.

529
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:21,931
Well... are you all right?
You said it was important.

530
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,876
I know things
got kind of ugly toward the...

531
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:30,579
you know, the end.

532
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:33,288
I got ugly.

533
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:35,506
<i>But I want you to know that,</i>

534
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,164
that there were circumstances
that, uh...

535
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:41,849
it was better that you and Cameron

536
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:44,538
that you were not with me.

537
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,752
Why are you telling me this now?

538
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,648
If I had to do it all over again...

539
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:52,723
I'd do it different.

540
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:57,290
We'd still be a family.

541
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,848
<i>I'd give anything for that.</i>

542
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,219
I just wanted you to know.

543
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,570
What's going on?

544
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:08,689
<i>Nothing.</i>

545
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:11,023
I just wanted to call
to say that I was, uh...

546
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:15,240
that I'm sorry

547
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,404
<i>about everything.</i>

548
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:19,331
Where are you right now?

549
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:21,766
<i>I can come get you.</i>

550
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:23,448
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

551
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:24,700
No, I'm serious.

552
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:25,858
Where are you?

553
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,072
One more thing.

554
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:30,160
If you hear anything in the media...

555
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:31,430
<i>What?</i>

556
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,443
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

557
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,171
I love you.

558
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,940
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?

559
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,146
Well...

560
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:32,457
I'm glad I told you about this place.

561
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:34,540
I'm glad I figured out
how to work a GPS.

562
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,824
Could you make it
a little more difficult next time?

563
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:37,844
I owe you one.

564
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,168
No, we're even.

565
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:40,594
But we got to leave.

566
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:45,714
Hey, buddy.

567
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,736
How are you doing?

568
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,389
- Where's LJ?
- Safe.

569
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,877
- The money?
- I'll tell you later; we got to go.

570
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:53,167
I brought someone.

571
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,896
Dad?

572
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:11,908
We've met before.

573
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:39,289
This is happening right now, okay?

574
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,138
Don't make me do this.

575
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:42,825
Don't make me do this.

576
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,056
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

577
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,539
You wouldn't? Really?

578
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,289
Are you that stupid?

579
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:50,850
Are you that stupid?!

580
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,995
Because now you're going to die!

581
00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:54,750
You're going to die,

582
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:57,928
and all you had to do
is tell me what your father gave you.

583
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,721
I know my options.

584
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,794
I can not tell you and die,
or I can tell you and still die.

585
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:06,913
No. Wrong.

586
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,758
Come on, smarten up!

587
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:11,761
For once in your life.

588
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:13,941
Please.

589
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,977
Go to hell.

590
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:31,714
Drowning is horrific...

591
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,044
don't get me wrong...

592
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,548
but once you give in
and let the water come into your lungs,

593
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:38,408
there's a certain euphoria... I hear.

594
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:39,707
I guess as a junkie,

595
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,494
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

596
00:42:45,888 --> 00:42:47,366
You did this to yourself.
