00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,452
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:03,603
It will work out.

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:05,388
You have my word. Be careful.

4
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,287
Jane's gonna look after you.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,950
I have a sister,
I haven't talked to in 15 years.

6
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,848
You think she's better off for it?

7
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,924
- Bruce?
- I know we said not to use this number,

8
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:17,706
but I just needed to know you were okay.

9
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:18,707
It was you.

10
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:20,806
<i>What are you talking about, Sara?</i>

11
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,647
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

12
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:27,767
We gotta run.

13
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,091
I want to turn myself in.

14
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:32,094
<i>But I got one condition.</i>

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,031
Your wife was released an hour ago.

16
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,208
She'll be here soon.

17
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
Just hold up your end of the deal.

18
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,675
I'll get you Scofield.

19
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,659
An NSA analyst sympathetic to our cause

20
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,304
got his hands on a phone
conversation the president had

21
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:48,372
with Terrence Steadman two weeks after
after you supposedly killed him.

22
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,411
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,

23
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,280
the analyst is missing,

24
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,529
and the White House
Echelon tapes have been deleted

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,647
from the mainframe.

26
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,386
There's a tape,
gives us everything we need.

27
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:00,504
Linc will be set free if we find it.

28
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,152
You have something here.

29
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:04,929
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

30
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,705
You think it's a conversation?

31
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,669
One they don't want us to hear.

32
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:12,953
You ready?

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,329
Let's do it.

34
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,848
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:52,756
Patoshik...

36
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,655
dead.

37
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:58,144
Franklin, incarcerated
and assisting with the capture

38
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:59,530
of Scofield and Burrows.

39
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,316
What exactly is the protocol with that?

40
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:02,317
I'll handle that.

41
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,819
We're at the halfway mark, people.

42
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,766
Burrows, Scofield...

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,644
Bagwell, Sucre...
they're still out there.

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,922
- Now, I heard a report came in from...
- Mexico.

45
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,641
Fernando Sucre was almost apprehended
at the airport in Ixtapa.

46
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:26,435
Excuse me.

47
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,240
My office, please.

48
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,140
What the hell are you doing here?

49
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:36,611
I came for my damn money.

50
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,921
- Your what?
- The Patoshik reward money.

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,461
See, how a reward works is, someone gets

52
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,073
rewarded the money,
and since I'm the one

53
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:48,137
who bloodhounded Haywire,
the money gets rewarded to me.

54
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,640
You come to my office...

55
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:52,579
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

56
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:53,878
We had a deal.

57
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,635
The deal was
that you stay under the radar.

58
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:57,400
Is this under the radar, Brad?

59
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:59,233
No, this is an office
full of federal agents,

60
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,108
who now have all seen your face.

61
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,082
Yeah, I don't care what they see.

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,389
Hell, if you don't pay up,

63
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,101
I'll go out there and drop trou.

64
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:25,395
Patoshik died,
you stupid son of a bitch.

65
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,585
There's paperwork involved.

66
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,435
Of course you're going to get the money.

67
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,439
But you're gonna have to be patient.

68
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,208
And if you ever...

69
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,256
come in my office again,

70
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,860
you'll not only never see the cash,

71
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:41,937
you'll never see another sunrise.

72
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,621
Now, are we gonna keep
crying about money

73
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,430
you've already got coming to you?

74
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,111
Or do you want to make some more?

75
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,047
I'm listening.

76
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,331
Ever been to Mexico?

77
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,314
We give this thing to the press,
the government's gonna discredit it,

78
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:12,372
just like they did
with the tape we made.

79
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:16,926
So what do we do with it?

80
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:19,476
Dad said there're still people
in the administration

81
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:20,556
that he was working with.

82
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,076
If we give the tape to them,

83
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:25,582
they'll finally have the smoking gun
they need to bring Mrs. Reynolds down.

84
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,842
But they'll release the tape... not us.

85
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,567
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

86
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,449
We're gonna give the only thing that can

87
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,239
exonerate me to someone
who works for the government?

88
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,672
The same government that set me up?!

89
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,986
We'll have to find someone we can trust,

90
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,064
someone honest.

91
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:44,965
Jane Phillips.

92
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,269
She'll know someone that can help us.

93
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,564
She worked with Dad; she's watching LJ.

94
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:50,964
I trust her, Michael.

95
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,804
She'll do it; she'll find someone.

96
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,365
Well, I hope you're right.

97
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,543
Because this is our last shot.

98
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,370
This'll do you right.

99
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,175
She's a Remington 700.

100
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,419
She a clean shot?

101
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,209
Like a good woman, she does not stray.

102
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,886
Varmint, stainless steel fluted barrel,

103
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,475
heavyweight caliber,
175-grain hollow point.

104
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,193
I'll take the case, too.

105
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:24,194
She's a throw-in.

106
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,908
Serial numbers have been cleaned.

107
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,262
Chamber's been scraped
to throw off ballistics,

108
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:36,295
just in case you're not, you know,
shooting at tin cans.

109
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,200
No, I'm hunting bigger game than that.

Transcript : swsub.com

111
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,266
Radio silence.

112
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:24,147
Look, I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

113
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,399
Well, it seems not that often,

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,797
considering you've posted
three messages.

115
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:30,298
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

116
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,299
To get Scofield.

117
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,111
What? What are we doing here?

118
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,756
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see

119
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,105
who's sending him the messages.

120
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,262
Well, you know what, he's gonna see
whatever little rent-a-Fed cops

121
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,941
that you guys have set up,
whatever place

122
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,074
you'll set up to meet him.

123
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,329
Now, you and I both know
how smart this kid is, right?

124
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,145
Smarter than you,
considering you're the one

125
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,216
- who's wearing bright orange.
- Oh, yeah?

126
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,576
Yeah.

127
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:52,944
Fish is not gonna peek
his little white ass

128
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,148
out from any rock that he's hiding
unless he sees a familiar face.

129
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,090
A famili... And that's your face, right?

130
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:59,191
Yeah! Don't pretend

131
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,591
- You said Sucre...
- like you don't need me!

132
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,446
You heard him telling Sucre
about a Web site!

133
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:04,776
Don't act like you don't need me!

134
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:05,817
You overheard something?

135
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:08,074
- Look, he's a Boy Scout, he...
- I don't see...

136
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,156
He helps, okay?!

137
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:11,712
If you have a little bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

138
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,746
I'm the only one helping
your family right now.

139
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,267
- I help my family, okay?
- So do I.

140
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,868
I'm the one who released Kacee,

141
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,056
who got Dede medical care,

142
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,421
who allows you to visit them,

143
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,657
and I'm the one that can take it away.

144
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,182
Well, you know what, it looks like
we both need each other, doesn't it?

145
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,528
- Do we?
- So I am gonna hold up

146
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,764
my end of the bargain, and guess what?

147
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:30,546
You hold up yours.

148
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:33,574
Now, get off my back.

149
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,544
You can get what you want.

150
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,015
Just give me what I want.

151
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:41,257
Give me Scofield.

152
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:49,463
Hey, buddy.

153
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:50,614
Dad?

154
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:52,414
Yeah, it's me.

155
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,736
How you holding up?

156
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,345
Okay. How about you?

157
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,132
<i>Good.</i>

158
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,603
I...

159
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,028
I miss you.

160
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,616
Yeah, me, too.

161
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,484
I didn't know you had Jane's number.

162
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:09,125
Yeah, well, uh, we exchanged numbers
when you guys split.

163
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:10,885
You never called.

164
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,432
No. Yeah...

165
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,588
I'm sorry, it's been...
It's been dangerous.

166
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:17,339
You know? A little dangerous.

167
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
It's okay.

168
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,741
<i>LJ...</i>

169
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,926
Listen, I know I've said this before,

170
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,319
but I think we've found something

171
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,257
that's finally gonna put this stuff
behind us.

172
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,991
When it's good, when it's safe,

173
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,590
I'm going to come and get you.

174
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:30,951
You, me, your uncle...

175
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:32,058
Dad.

176
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,361
Yeah?

177
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,936
I want you to end this
more than anything,

178
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:39,011
but... I'm in school again.

179
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:43,414
Under a fake name,
but it's still school, you know?

180
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,276
I mean, it's not the same,
but it's the closest thing

181
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,277
to a home I've had in a long time.

182
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:50,378
<i>I... I guess...</i>

183
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,663
<i>I guess I'm just saying that...</i>

184
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:54,858
For now,

185
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:56,495
for... For a while...

186
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,032
I just want to stay in one place,

187
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:02,288
<i>have something normal.</i>

188
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:06,865
I get it.

189
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,105
I...

190
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,340
I need to speak with Jane.

191
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:15,463
I love you, Dad.

192
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,258
I love you, too, son.

193
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:28,689
Mr. Webster.

194
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,319
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,808
Ah, it's no problem, Doc.

196
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,349
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate

197
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,408
you seeing me on such short notice.

198
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,467
That's what I'm here for.

199
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,053
Good.

200
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,852
'Cause I got a few things
I need to get off my chest.

201
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,070
See you, Jane.

202
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,708
Cooper Green?

203
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,362
Former deputy attorney general.

204
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:05,122
Splits his time between DC,
Chicago and New York.

205
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,619
Jane says he's been an ally of Dad's
forever.

206
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,208
We find him, we got a shot.

207
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:15,588
How is LJ?

208
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,268
He's doing all right.

209
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,090
Cooper Green's office.

210
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,949
I'm sorry, Mr. Green isn't available
at this time.

211
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,205
<i>Please, this is very important.</i>

212
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,013
Just tell him I have some information

213
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:34,265
regarding the sons of Aldo Burrows.

214
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:35,759
Aldo Burrows?

215
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,114
He and Mr. Green used to work together.

216
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:40,715
Please hold. I'll try to reach him.

217
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,645
She's tracking him down.

218
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:51,955
<i>this is Michael Scofield.</i>

219
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,357
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

220
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,049
Of course. I knew your father.

221
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,428
And I know what happened to him.

222
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,317
I'm sorry. He was a good man
trying to do good things.

223
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:00,318
Well, so are we.

224
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:02,276
We have something.

225
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,870
The tape.

226
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,052
<i>You've heard of it.</i>

227
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,300
Well, I know a lot of people
have been looking for it.

228
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:08,694
What's on the tape?

229
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,077
<i>If you want to find out,</i>

230
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:11,981
there's a bronze statue of a mammoth

231
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,437
at the southwest corner of Ebert Park.
I need you there in an hour.

232
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,544
Do you have a blue suit?

233
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,532
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Wear it, and a red tie.

234
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,232
That way, we'll know who you are.

235
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,515
Ready?

236
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,619
Yeah.

237
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:32,929
Good luck.

238
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,700
This will work.

239
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:47,057
You think?

240
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:28,778
Hello, Sara.

241
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,039
I figured you'd show up eventually.

242
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,019
You look good, Bruce.

243
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,805
You've done well for yourself
at my father's expense.

244
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,857
I had nothing to do with your father.

245
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,387
- Your father was murdered.
- By you.

246
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,269
And then you tried to have me killed.
Don't...

247
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:46,876
How can you say that?

248
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,593
My line was tapped, and they heard you
tell me that you were at that pay phone.

249
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,915
Sara, I've known your family
my entire life.

250
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,682
Which makes your betrayal disgusting.

251
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,282
FYI, I've been tortured already.
It didn't work.

252
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,374
I shouldn't have to defend myself
to you, Sara.

253
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,559
If you can't trust me,

254
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,614
then all I can do is just wish you luck.

255
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,163
Go.

256
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:29,172
Look,

257
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,594
before you get started,

258
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,168
I'm gonna save you some time
here, <i>jefe.</i>

259
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,692
I played rat for you once,
and that was it.

260
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:36,928
I got protection now.

261
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:40,345
I let the top bangers in here
cherry pick the laundry,

262
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:43,025
clean sheets, new shorts...
and for that,

263
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,056
I'm untouchable.

264
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,794
So threaten all you want, <i>homes.</i>

265
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,493
Yo, man, what are you going to do?

266
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:00,299
You don't look like
you play too much tennis, Manche.

267
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,267
This is probably more your speed.

268
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,005
Entertainment center.

269
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:06,929
Wide-screen plasma.

270
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,920
Pinball.

271
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,356
Pool table.

272
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:13,266
Yo, man, what the hell is this?

273
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,271
Your future.

274
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:18,289
At Kankakee Minimum Security
Correctional Center,

275
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:21,318
where the only thing
softer that the pillows are the guards.

276
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,695
I didn't come here to threaten.

277
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,778
I mean, why whip the mule
when he'll work

278
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,484
even harder for a sugar cube?

279
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,991
The same connections that got this fox
out of the river so quick.

280
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,944
Well, I can use them for you, too.

281
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,599
All I need to know

282
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:41,106
is where down in Mexico
your cousin Sucre is headed.

283
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,603
Look, <i>mami</i>, look!

284
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,072
I told you. Llamas!

285
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,921
I think those are alpacas.

286
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,038
That's what I said, a pack-a llamas.

287
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,811
What I'm trying to tell you, Doc,

288
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:55,493
is I just feel like I've been

289
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,583
a penny on the train tracks
my entire life.

290
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,767
And that 'ole Union Pacific
just keeps on coming, every day,

291
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,127
back and forth, just running me down,
running me over,

292
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:07,590
but I will not...

293
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:10,716
flatten... I will not flatten.

294
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,635
You know the nice thing
about pennies, Mr. Webster?

295
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:15,047
They have dates on them.

296
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,966
And you can pick the date.

297
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Your own date.

298
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,695
Today's date.

299
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,773
You can get a fresh start.

300
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,658
You can be a brand-new shiny penny.

301
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,823
You know, I got to be
honest with you, Doc; I had no...

302
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,389
intention of whatsoever

303
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:35,101
talking to you once
I got inside your office today.

304
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:38,346
But I have to admit, I find therapy...

305
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,298
Well, it's therapeutic.

306
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,836
I don't follow.

307
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:49,031
If you didn't plan on talking today,
why did you come in?

308
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,330
Well, I saw the ad on the back
of the bus stop today.

309
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,455
And...

310
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,848
though it wasn't exactly
like looking in the mirror,

311
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,153
you can't deny
that there's a certain...

312
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:12,713
...commonality

313
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,534
in our visages.

314
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,900
I guess we do look a little bit alike...

315
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,282
But I don't understand.

316
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,021
What the hell you think you're doing?

317
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:05,457
Hello.

318
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,064
- <i>Mr. Green?</i>
- Yes.

319
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:09,506
This is Lincoln Burrows.

320
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:11,443
Do exactly what I say.

321
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,253
<i>Your suit jacket.</i>

322
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,336
Toss it in the trash behind you.

323
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,619
Excuse me?

324
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,210
Do it.

325
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:34,827
All right. I just threw
my $2,000 Zegna suit jacket

326
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:35,889
in the garbage.

327
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,046
<i>Good.</i>

328
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,908
There's a phone
on the other side of the park.

329
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,379
Be there in four minutes.

330
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:42,402
Four...

331
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,921
Make it quick.
This cell is running out of juice.

332
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,370
You were right.

333
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:09,490
He's been tailed.

334
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:10,491
Yeah.

335
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:12,441
<i>On it.</i>

336
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,087
- Yeah?
<i>- I'm looking for</i>

337
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,744
<i>a guy in a suit.</i>

338
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,272
Lots of guys with suits.

339
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,865
It's me.

340
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:28,413
See the fountain?

341
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:32,979
How could I not?

342
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,431
Get in.

343
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,277
They want to drown the mics in case

344
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:07,278
we bugged him.

345
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,289
Hey, mister.

346
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:16,887
This is for you.

347
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:18,354
I'm not interested.

348
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:20,576
I'm not selling it.
Some dude gave me

349
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:23,509
20 bucks to give it
to the first wet guy I see.

350
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
Here.

351
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:29,854
<i>See the building across from you?</i>

352
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,910
Yeah.

353
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,168
<i>Go inside.</i>

354
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,464
Look, this is getting ridiculous.

355
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,906
I've done everything you've asked.
If you want to meet me...

356
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:38,272
We've been burned way too many times,
Mr. Green.

357
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:40,777
We need to make sure
that this thing goes down right.

358
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:43,248
Go inside,
and keep the phone to your ear.

359
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,012
- Where are we?
<i>- He's gone inside<i/>

360
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,801
<i>the Beck Museum
but we've got men out back.<i>

361
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,213
He's not going anywhere.

362
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:07,615
Yeah?

363
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:08,659
<i>Get to Ebert Park.</i>

364
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,525
<i>I have men on Scofield and Burrows.</i>

365
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,270
Ebert Park?

366
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:15,530
Scofield set a meet with
a target we're surveilling.

367
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,682
What the hell is Scofield doing
in Chicago?

368
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:20,918
You're asking why the deer
walked into your crosshairs?

369
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:23,022
Just take the shot, Mahone.

370
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:24,921
I'm on it. I'm on it.

371
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:26,293
And Alex.

372
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,497
Using Franklin to help me find Scofield.

373
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,612
Yeah.

374
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,918
We don't need him for that anymore.

375
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,795
What I do need
is a death with no questions.

376
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,690
Hey, look, it's nothing yet,
man,

377
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,605
but I'm sure
he'll hit me real soon, okay?

378
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,796
You know,
if I were in your situation...

379
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:07,639
...everything you've done,
every decision you've made...

380
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:10,556
I'd have done the same thing.

381
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,736
You're a good man, good father.

382
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,849
There's, uh...been a change of plans.

383
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,445
It looks like I'm not gonna need
your help after all.

384
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,773
So you found Scofield.

385
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,930
My colleagues are getting pretty close,
yeah.

386
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,619
- So...
-So I guess you can set me free, then.

387
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:42,709
Of course not.

388
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,324
You and me, we had a deal, right?

389
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,325
Right.

390
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,553
I get your wife released,

391
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,453
take care of your daughter's health,

392
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,412
you get me Scofield.

393
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:07,147
But you, you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

394
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,506
I know, I know.
I just want you to know...

395
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,815
...that, uh, I'm going to keep
my promise to you and ...

396
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,295
and I'm going to help your family.

397
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:21,176
But I'm gonna need your help, too

398
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:24,706
and this is something that you're not
gonna want to do and I don't want

399
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,074
you to do this, but I need you
to do this and if you don't,

400
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,437
I will have Kacee arrested again,

401
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,490
and I will have
Dede's medical care stopped,

402
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,041
and I will hate myself,
and it will make me sick,

403
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,277
but I swear to God...

404
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:40,107
I will ruin their lives. Don't make me.

405
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,018
What the hell are you saying to me?

406
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,478
Today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

407
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,917
Its gonna be from me.
I need you to use it. Okay?

408
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,035
Okay. What's in it?

409
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,825
Yo. What the hell is in it, man?

410
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,943
Just use it, or you'll wish you had.

411
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,325
What's in the package?

412
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,062
What the hell is in the package, man?

413
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:15,203
Okay. I'm in the lobby.

414
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:17,969
Take the stairs to your left.

415
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:23,104
When you get to the top,
cross the catwalk.

416
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:31,695
Okay, I'm across.

417
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:35,138
Go down the hall,
down the stairs to the basement.

418
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,022
Go through the white door.

419
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:51,972
The one on the left.

420
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:57,752
Sara, I wish you had come to me first.

421
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,576
Cooper Green and I go way back.

422
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:02,460
If anyone can help Michael
and Lincoln, it's him.

423
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,525
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:04,530
Is Mr. Green in?

425
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:05,840
Is he expecting you?

426
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:07,373
Bruce.

427
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,714
Oh, good, you're back.

428
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,175
I'm here to help you.

429
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,293
Help me? With what?

430
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,353
Scofield and Burrows.
Where are they now?

431
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:15,378
This is absurd.

432
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,084
This tunnel goes underground.

433
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:19,967
You're already under another building.

434
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,235
See the second door on your right?

435
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:24,044
Yeah.

436
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,051
Congratulations.

437
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,086
You made it.

438
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,054
I'm sorry. Sara Tancredi.
I trust you've met

439
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:36,362
with Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows today?

440
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:38,539
Well, I'm sure I'd remember if I did.

441
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:43,834
If you're Cooper Green,
who's with Michael right now?

442
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,711
I'm Michael Scofield.

443
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,709
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

444
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:55,856
Do you... uh,
do you have the tape?

445
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,048
It's right here.

446
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,867
<i>Lincoln, it's Sara.
Listen to me.</i>

447
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,820
The man that Michael's with right now
is not Cooper Green, do you hear me?

448
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,938
The man that Michael's with
right now is not Cooper Green.

449
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:27,299
We should hurry.

450
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,734
You're in Chicago... it won't be long

451
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,009
before the Company knows you're in town.

452
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:33,230
Where are we going?

453
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:35,519
Well, we're going
to make sure that that tape

454
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,931
goes in the right hands.

455
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:38,418
Whose?

456
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:40,826
A friend.

457
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,655
What kind of friend?

458
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,170
He's a federal judge.

459
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,780
Is that good enough for you?

460
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,410
This tape is my brother's life.

461
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,839
And mine.

462
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:56,161
And consequently...

463
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,454
I need a name.

464
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,068
Judge Scott Warren,

465
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:05,609
a lifetime appointee
who was put on the bench

466
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:06,730
by President Mills.

467
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,517
He has no job to lose,
no loyalty to Reynolds.

468
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:13,219
He wants to see her gone, just like us.

469
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,021
Well, let's go.

470
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:17,624
I left my car
over by the statue.

471
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,213
You were tailed, Mr. Green.

472
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:21,980
The judge comes to us.

473
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:24,547
I'll set up the meeting.

474
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,733
Do you see my clothes?

475
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:28,852
Your brother made certain

476
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:31,403
that anybody who was tailing me
is long gone,

477
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:33,580
and on top of that, I'm an asthmatic.

478
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:35,809
My inhaler is in my jacket pocket,

479
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,962
which Lincoln made me throw away.

480
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:41,277
I'm okay now,
but in about ten minutes,

481
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,656
I'm gonna have a hard time breathing.

482
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:45,936
I've got a spare in my glove box,

483
00:27:45,937 --> 00:27:46,995
so could we please

484
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:49,456
just get back to my car?

485
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:00,259
My car is just a few blocks away.

486
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:03,376
Albuterol, Cortizaid or Prednizone?

487
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:04,480
What?

488
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:05,916
My mother was an asthmatic.

489
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,082
What do you use in your inhaler?

490
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,834
What the hell difference does it make?

491
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:12,776
Just answer the question, please.

492
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,390
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

493
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,345
How many times
I got to prove myself to you?

494
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,346
Just one.

495
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:25,450
Fine. Uh... Cortizaid.

496
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:30,216
I'm sorry.

497
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,217
It's just, uh...

498
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:36,147
if you knew what, uh,
if you knew what we've been through

499
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:37,823
I understand.

500
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:39,680
Can we now just, please

501
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,098
- go to my car?
- Yeah.

502
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,558
One-way ticket to Bangkok,
s'il vous plait.

503
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,772
Oh, I'm sorry.

504
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:03,919
We don't have anything until tomorrow.

505
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,625
Unless you don't mind
taking a few connections

506
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:10,127
through Chicago,
and there's one more international stop.

507
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,927
Whatever leaves first.

508
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,045
I. D, please.

509
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:19,756
Okay, Mister... Stammel?

510
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,973
Oh, it's, uh, it's Doctor Stammel,

511
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:24,121
- and thank you.
- All right,

512
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:25,530
it'll be just a few minutes.

513
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,356
I'll check this bag for you, sir.

514
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,053
Oh, no, that's coming with me.
Give it back.

515
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,661
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carry-on.

516
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:36,214
What difference does a few extra pounds

517
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,583
make on a three-ton aircraft,

518
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:39,113
whether that's up above or underneath?

519
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,528
It's an FAA violation.

520
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:43,679
Sir, your bag will be safe.

521
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,752
<i>Today will be a tough day for travelers
in the Windy City as all streets</i>

522
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:04,320
<i>in a six-block radius

00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,753
<i>This'll be one

526
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:15,765
<i>for the president

527
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:17,394
Theo, I know you're new,

528
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,358
but we use both sides of legal pads
in this office, okay?

529
00:30:20,524 --> 00:30:22,065
Before we recycle, we reduce.

530
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,141
The Comanche used the entire buffalo.

531
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:25,758
So can we.

532
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,667
Actually, a majority of tribes
would farm land

533
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:30,168
till it was stripped of its utility,

534
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,061
then they'd just... move on.

535
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,409
The Indian as conservationist

536
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:36,365
is a myth created
by white liberal guilt.

537
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,130
Paul.

538
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:40,669
Hi, Kristine.

539
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:43,623
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you
at Dad's funeral.

540
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,735
That man died
long before his heart stopped.

541
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:47,441
That funeral was a formality.

542
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:49,690
- That's really not fair.
- It's true.

543
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:52,404
So... you want to know how Mom is?

544
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:54,831
Just 'cause someone spits you
out of their crotch

545
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,398
doesn't make them your mother.

546
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,798
That woman is insane.

547
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,546
Do you remember?
Have you suppressed it all?

548
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:02,631
I know, Paul. I was there every day...

549
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,753
- unlike you.
- I was there for 18 years.

550
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:05,936
Then you just left.

551
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:07,902
I was ten, Paul.

552
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:10,584
You were all I had in the world, and...

553
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,024
you just left me there.

554
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,079
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,385
If I could have taken you with me,
I would have,

556
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,562
and I've thought about you every day.

557
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,548
I'm not the brother you remember.

558
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:37,564
I've changed...

559
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,418
in a...

560
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,479
really bad way.

561
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:48,506
To the point where I don't know
what good or bad is anymore

562
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:51,243
and I am going to do something...

563
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,047
I have to do something...

564
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:57,869
that a lot of people are going to think
is horrible.

565
00:31:57,985 --> 00:32:00,585
And you just remember...

566
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:03,562
the brother you grew up with.

567
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,035
You just remember him.

568
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:12,871
You're my sister, Kristine,
and I love you.

569
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,569
I was out cold.
I don't know where they went.

570
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:24,998
And it was their idea for you

571
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:27,428
to meet them here
in the middle of Chicago?

572
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:34,519
Oh, man.

573
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:45,412
You brought me in too late.
They're gone.

574
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:48,393
Then find them.

575
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:51,096
Let me get this straight.
The brothers come back to a city

576
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:53,258
that's 15 miles from the prison
they escaped from.

577
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,611
Why would they do that?

578
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:56,460
Maybe it's because the president
is in Chicago

579
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,386
to make a speech,
and they're up to something,

580
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,258
which is why we need to find them.

581
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,964
And of all people,
they want to meet with somebody

582
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,889
from the attorney general's office?

583
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,274
Your point?

584
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,158
Burrows is innocent.

585
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:11,559
You're good, Alex.

586
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:12,898
As advertised.

587
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:15,974
No one's truly innocent.

588
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,258
<i>You of all people should know that.</i>

589
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,519
It must have been the receptionist.

590
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,047
She's the only one I spoke to.

591
00:33:41,196 --> 00:33:43,019
Michael Scofield. Cooper Green.

592
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,213
We got to get as much of that in
as possible before the baby gets here.

593
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,254
Why?

594
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:47,113
Because,
once the baby's growing in there,

595
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,770
doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

596
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,643
- What?
- I just felt the baby move.

597
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,590
That's impossible.
It's a little too early...

598
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:02,002
I know what I just felt.

599
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:06,247
Well, the doctor did say
that he can become active

600
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:07,718
after certain activities.

601
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,294
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, like a flutter.

602
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,137
Flutter my ass! He's strong!

603
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,723
He's going to be the captain
of the National Soccer Team.

604
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:22,391
You hear that, Junior?

605
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:25,318
As soon as you're born,
I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

606
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,975
No, he's going to have books.

607
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:31,138
Fine. Books about soccer.

608
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:36,600
See, baby.

609
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,566
I told you everything was going
to work out.

610
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,286
We're out in the middle of nowhere,

611
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,024
baby's doing great.

612
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:47,136
Everything's going to be perfect.

613
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,528
<i>Well, it looks like we've got
nothing but smooth skies ahead,</i>

614
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:53,723
<i>so we should be arriving</i>

615
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:55,669
- <i>in Mexico right on time.</i>
- Excuse me.

616
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,199
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

617
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:00,030
As a way to keep ticket prices low,

618
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:03,183
we have removed the in-flight meal
from our service package.

619
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:05,242
What's left on the
service package?

620
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,277
Pretzels and bags
of Krispity Krunch.

621
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:09,792
Pretzels.

622
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,518
Just a few minutes.

623
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,173
Freshen me up
when you get a chance, darlin'.

624
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,422
Right away, Dr. Stammel.

625
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,493
Dede's doing real good.

626
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,371
She's responding
to the meds,

627
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,337
eating.

628
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:36,349
She's going to be okay.

629
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:42,751
Because of you.

630
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:46,481
She's going to be okay
because of you.

631
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:50,448
I need to know...

632
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,105
...that you forgive me.

633
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,588
I know that. Of course I forgive you.

634
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,427
You know when Dede
was like four,

635
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:04,786
she wanted to watch this video.

636
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:08,940
And I kept telling her you know,
"After the game, after the game, okay?"

637
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,239
She kept asking
and kept asking,

638
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,328
and I lost my patience
and I snapped at her.

639
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:14,906
I snapped at her real bad.

640
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,811
She went over into the corner, and...

641
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:22,792
I didn't even go over
and say anything.

642
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:26,225
Why are you getting yourself upset
over something that happened

643
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:28,735
years ago, baby? Dede loves you.

644
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,294
I want you to do something for me.

645
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,251
I want you to tell her

646
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,066
that I'm sorry.

647
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm so sorry.

648
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:38,726
And that my baby girls means
everything to me...

649
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:42,038
I want you to tell her
that she means everything to me, okay?

650
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,866
You tell her that every day.

651
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,671
- Time.
- No matter what...

652
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:48,732
Tell her. Tell her, okay?

653
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,338
No matter what, you promise that, okay?

654
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,560
Please, please, you got to tell her.

655
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:55,855
- You have to tell her...
- Okay, okay.

656
00:37:57,081 --> 00:37:58,503
You really have to go.

657
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,816
<i>All spectators
must remain behind
the barricades at all times.</i>

658
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:28,126
<i>The President will
be arriving shortly.</i>

659
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:33,958
Got a Boom Charlie half block south.

660
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,672
- Team leader wants you there right now.
- What's the M. O.?

661
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,437
He's got an IED strapped to...

662
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,450
He asked you to come
to this fountain specifically?

663
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:48,565
Yeah.

664
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,314
Let me take a look
at that park map.

665
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:59,703
Why not the fountain on
the east side of the park?

666
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,155
Because this one's closer
to the pay phone he called me on.

667
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,995
No, because this one's closer to them.

668
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,957
They tell you to meet them
at the statue.

669
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:08,176
Then the fountain.

670
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,979
Then they send you to the building
across the park.

671
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:13,429
Why?

672
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:17,479
'Cause they want to keep
you in their sights.

673
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,185
Because they're watching you.

674
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,041
But from where?

675
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,851
Statue, fountain, building...

676
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:28,303
There.

677
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:34,304
You know what you have?

678
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,555
I think we have a pretty good idea.

679
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:37,953
What you doing?

680
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,854
Getting all unique data
from the memory key

681
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,174
so we can identify this key
from any other,

682
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:44,994
label it, start a proper record
of a chain of custody

683
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,055
to present to the judges
I trust.

684
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:55,253
What's wrong?

685
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:58,427
It's the date stamp on the memory key.

686
00:39:58,809 --> 00:39:59,926
It's the copy date.

687
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:01,761
I'm sorry, what's that?

688
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:03,663
It's the date the damn thing was copied,

689
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:06,670
not the date that the conversation
was originally recorded.

690
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:08,088
So what?

691
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,728
I mean, you heard what was on the tape.

692
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,903
Without a time stamp of exactly

693
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,330
when this conversation took place,

694
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:17,536
we can't prove
that this is Terrence Steadman talking

695
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,424
after you supposedly killed him.

696
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,374
This could have happened
a year before
his funeral.

697
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,547
No, it can't be authenticated,
so it can't be

698
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,301
admitted to any court as evidence.

699
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:31,171
People died because of this.
My family died.

700
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:32,861
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,571
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

702
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,455
Have either of these men checked in?

703
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:52,894
- No, not that I've seen.
- What about this woman?

704
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:55,606
Yeah.

705
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,410
Room 1006.

706
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:06,765
It's not over.

707
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:09,415
- We're this close.
- You already said it's done.

708
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:12,734
Actually, I said it couldn't help
exonerate you in a court of law.

709
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:16,768
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

710
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:18,338
How?

711
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:20,842
Well, we all heard the conversation.

712
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,345
There's more to this tape
than potential proof

713
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:24,698
of Lincoln's innocence.

714
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:27,574
There is proof
of Caroline Reynold's guilt.

715
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,952
Guilt about something
that she does not want

716
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:31,766
anyone to know anything about.

717
00:41:32,353 --> 00:41:33,858
So we blackmail her.

718
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:37,909
I'm an officer of the court.

719
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:39,245
I didn't say that.

720
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,088
Blackmail in exchange for what?

721
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,713
A presidential pardon.

722
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:47,494
The woman that set me up...

723
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,651
is going to set me free.

724
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:54,102
I think she'll sign it
with her own hand.

725
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:59,175
<i>Ace Team, Beta Team,
this is Leader One.</i>

726
00:42:04,382 --> 00:42:07,992
<i>The Squaw will reach Home Base
in T minus two minutes.</i>

727
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:31,321
I love you.

728
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:35,838
