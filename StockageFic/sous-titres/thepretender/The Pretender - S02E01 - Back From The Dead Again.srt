1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,200
Previous scene on The Pretender

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:04,301
Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:05,202
I'm your brother.

4
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,203
Jarod, go and find our parents.

5
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:09,004
Kyle..

6
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:11,504
You and The FBI killed my brother.

7
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:13,205
What've I ever done to you?

8
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:16,006
You exist.

9
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:19,507
Someone tried to kill Raines,

10
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:22,208
But the bullet distracked on the oxygen tank.

11
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:26,009
They can't tell which gun it's fired from.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,110
No, No, Noooooooooooooo!

13
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,411
Well, my father didn't just vanish

14
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,012
I am not his secretary

15
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,913
You're supposed to know where he is.

16
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,714
I hate attitude.

17
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,115
Problem at The Centre?

18
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:06,016
Well, my father's been at his desk

19
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,917
in The Tower at 7 am for the last thirty-five years.

20
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,818
Two weeks in a row he's been a no show.

21
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,019
That's weird.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,920
There's a great deal of peculiar activity in The Tower of late

23
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,621
and now it's trickling down to us.

24
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:17,622
Tell me about it.

25
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,923
They've even jacked up the prices in all of the vending machines.

26
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:22,024
A bag of Funyans sets me back a buck now.

27
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,125
Well it's true.

28
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:28,826
Let's face it.

29
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:31,827
The place has been different ever since

30
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:34,728
Go ahead Broots, say it.

31
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,529
Ever since Raines was shot.

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,430
Well don't look at me.

33
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,631
I'm no marksman.

34
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,032
Hey, I didn't even want to take a gun, remember?

35
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,433
Well, if I'd shot sterno head

36
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:48,435
he would be snoring through dirt now

37
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:51,035
instead of filling bed-pans in The Centre's burn unit.

38
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:51,236
Excuse me.

39
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,737
I have met thousands of men

40
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:58,938
from all walks of life who've sought retreat here

41
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:03,639
but I've never met anyone like Brother Jarod.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,340
He spent all of his time in his cell.

43
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,341
Barely ate.

44
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,442
Never slept.

45
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,743
But given the severity of his nightmares

46
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,844
I suppose it is understandable.

47
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,545
He had such sadness in his soul.

48
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,246
Not exactly Home and Garden.

49
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,247
Dia De Los Muertos.

50
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:36,548
The Day of the Dead.

51
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,949
A Mexican Festival

52
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,550
similar to your Halloween

53
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:45,851
in which cemeteries are prepared to welcome back the departed.

54
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,352
These morbid images may explain

55
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:50,353
Jarod's long silence.

56
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:53,554
Indication of some sort of preoccupation with death?

57
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,255
Speaking of death.

58
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,356
Look at this.

59
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:57,357
A hand carved coffin.

60
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,058
Jarod made it himself.

61
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,159
It was always with him.

62
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,460
The same type of notebook that his brother Kyle used.

63
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,761
Jarod's grieving.

64
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,862
Searching for closure in the loss of his brother.

65
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,163
Then, ah, who's this coffin for?

66
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,264
What's it mean, Freud?

67
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,065
Someone's going to die.

68
00:03:45,966 --> 00:04:00,066
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

69
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,867
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

70
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:07,868
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 1
Back From The Dead Again

71
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,666
Who wants to touch?

72
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:44,367
You're sick!

73
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:45,868
Ah don't be spooked Chloe.

74
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,069
We're going to be dissecting them all year.

75
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,270
Joel, you shouldn't touch the cadaver until the prof get's here.

76
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:54,771
Fernando, I have been waiting all year to get into this class.

77
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,672
Besides I don't think this one's gonna mind.

78
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,973
Think again.

79
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:06,374
Who the hell are you?

80
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,375
Jarod Howard, your new professor.

81
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,376
Oh that's oh that's not funny, man.

82
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,077
And mocking the dead is?

83
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,078
I want each of you to understand

84
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,779
that there's only one unforgivable sin in my class.

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,880
I will not under any circumstances

86
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,081
tolerate any disrespect for these cadavers.

87
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,582
Underneath each of these plastic sheets

88
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:27,283
lies a human being.

89
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:30,184
Many of these bodies they come to us unknown and unclaimed

90
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:34,185
which means that they died alone and afraid.

91
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,986
No friends.

92
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,787
No homes.

93
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,188
Forgotten by their families

94
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,489
and thrown away by society.

95
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,490
Therefore they will not be disrespected in this classroom.

96
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:48,391
Take those words to heart.

97
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:49,892
Halloween's coming up

98
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:52,093
and if I hear of a student

99
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,894
taking a head or an arm to a party

100
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:58,895
I will personally expel them from the program.

101
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,096
Dr Fein.

102
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:02,397
Will there be enough cadavers for each group this term?

103
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,298
Who's being sick now?

104
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,299
Well if there aren't enough,

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,700
there are several pre-dissected bodies from last semester that will be available.

106
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,301
I plan on being a surgeon.

107
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,302
I need to get a feel for what I'm going to do.

108
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,703
I can't learn if it's just pick and point.

109
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:17,004
As a matter of fact there are more cadavers being delivered after class.

110
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:20,305
So I will need a couple of volunteers?

111
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,306
I believe that these two

112
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,107
will be just fine.

113
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,608
Finally. Thank God you're back Daddy.

114
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:37,809
Good news!

115
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,310
We found Jarod's last lair.

116
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:42,011
Yeck! I'll have it analysed.

117
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,712
But only God knows what he's up to this time.

118
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:47,713
Who the hell are you?

119
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,014
Nein. Nein.

120
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,015
Warum bist zu.

121
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,416
Ich grosse die vohne der griese.

122
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,717
Wiedersehen.

123
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,218
You must be Miss Parker.

124
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,819
You look just like your mother.

125
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,920
Where's my father?

126
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:08,021
He's away as I understand it.

127
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:12,622
-Mr Lyle, your 10:30 is here.
-Send her in.

128
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:19,423
And, what, Mr Lyle, are you doing in my father's office?

129
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,924
Oh, I'm just filling in.

130
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,225
Bridget. Good morning.

131
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:28,526
Have you met Miss Parker? Bridget is the new cleaner.

132
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,227
The new cleaner?

133
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:32,328
I've had the dearama analysed.

134
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,329
A preliminary report on my findings.

135
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,430
How did she get a report on Jarod's last lair

136
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,331
when Sydney and I just returned?

137
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:40,132
To be honest,

138
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,133
Bridget actually beat you there.

139
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,634
Only by a couple of days.

140
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:47,635
Ha! Okay.

141
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,036
What am I, in the twilight zone?

142
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:50,837
We thought it would be a good idea

143
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:54,638
to have Bridget provide assistance in the capture of Jarod.

144
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,439
I don't need assistance.

145
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,740
And who exactly, is we?

146
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,341
I am.

147
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,642
The powers are tired of the way things have been run;

148
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,943
tired of the inefficiency,

149
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:11,644
angry that Jarod is still out there.

150
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:15,545
I don't understand why it's so hard to capture one man.

151
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:16,846
Jarod's not just a man.

152
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:17,947
He's a pretender.

153
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:20,948
A human chameleon.

154
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,749
A genius who can literally become anyone he wants to be.

155
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,250
And he almost found his family, Miss Parker.

156
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,351
-Imagine the ramifications.
-I know.

157
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,352
But we have made progress.

158
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,353
Yes, we.

159
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:39,554
Is this Sydney, an impediment?

160
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,555
Or should he be removed?

161
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,656
Sydney raised Jarod.

162
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:50,057
There is an emotional umbilical between them.

163
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,058
Sever it and you'll never see Jarod again.

164
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,159
The Centre is tired of Jarod's actions.

165
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,660
If he's really as smart as you say he is,

166
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:02,261
and you're really as smart as I hear you are,

167
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,762
I'd think you'd welcome any help you can get

168
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,763
since that'd be the wise thing to do.

169
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,264
We're going to be late.

170
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:16,665
If you hear from your father, let me know.

171
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,666
Well Jarod.

172
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,667
Your CV is quite impressive.

173
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:23,868
Undergrad from Vanderbilt,

174
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,869
Masters in anatomy from Duke,

175
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,570
graduated with distinction from University of London.

176
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,771
Great accomplishments for a young man.

177
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,972
Well, I'm a quick study.

178
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,973
I must admit that I'm a little surprised

179
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,674
that you'd be willing to teach gross anatomy to first year med students.

180
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,475
Well actually, I'm here to work with you.

181
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:45,476
I've been following your progress as a research fellow.

182
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:46,977
I understand you've made some great strides

183
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,478
with the cardiac resuscitation drug.

184
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,179
My guess, from your history,

185
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,580
it's a blend between class four setacholines

186
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:54,581
and some sort of generic digitalis.

187
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,182
It's supposed to be a secret.

188
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,483
A pharmaceutical research race with the Brits.

189
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,384
You can't keep that sort of thing quiet.

190
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:01,585
You're a smart man Jarod.

191
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:04,086
You should have been an MD instead of a PHD.

192
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,387
Either way they still call me Doctor.

193
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,288
Dr Howard, Dr Fein, Dr Howard!

194
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,389
Yo oh!

195
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,090
See what I mean?

196
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:14,691
Joel, Fernando.

197
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,392
Take the cadavers to the cold room

198
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:18,293
and give them a local and formaldehyde wrap.

199
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:19,094
I've already done it.

200
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,395
Joel works part time at the mortuary.

201
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:21,496
Sheldon Fein.

202
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,497
Jarod Howard, faculty.

203
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:24,798
Fein and Fein?

204
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,899
Sheldon and I are brothers.

205
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,000
Christopher became a doctor trying to put the family business out of business.

206
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,001
Fernando. There's Detective Keys.

207
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,802
Maybe you should go talk to her.

208
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,203
Maybe she's found something.

209
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,004
I need to get out of here.

210
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,505
Joel, The vouchers for the cadavers are on my desk.

211
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,506
Get them for ah Sheldon will you?

212
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:51,507
-Oh, sure.
-Just send them over.

213
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,608
Fernando seems sad.

214
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,609
Yeah, he should.

215
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,810
His brother disappeared last Halloween.

216
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,811
I'll take this body to the lab.

217
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,812
MEDICAL STUDENT ENRIQUE RAMOS VANISHES

218
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:34,213
MAN SEARCHES FOR LOST BROTHER

219
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,812
Who the hell is Mr Lyle?

220
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,513
All I know is that he is barking a lot of orders

221
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,514
and all the smart people seem to be following them.

222
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,215
Maybe he's part of the Triumvirate.

223
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,216
The Triumvirate?

224
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,317
What the hell would they be doing here?

225
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:54,818
Assuming power?

226
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:58,719
Their appearance would certainly explain your father's disappearance.

227
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Not to mention the price of Funyans.

228
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,421
Why would they make my father disappear?

229
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,422
Because someone shot Raines.

230
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:09,023
Hmm! And they're not going to stop

231
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,624
until they find out who did it.

232
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,625
Well, I'm not going to stop

233
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:15,026
until I find out who Mr Lyle is.

234
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,927
Yo. Don't tell me you're moving into this dump.

235
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:23,928
They say it's haunted.

236
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:27,029
The house?

237
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,430
No. The fence.

238
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,031
This house is a prime Halloween target.

239
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:36,732
I'm talking eggings, toilet paper, smashed pumpkins.

240
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:37,933
Tell you what.

241
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,334
For fifty bucks I'll make sure nobody trashes it.

242
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,735
I've heard about this Halloween,

243
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:46,736
a ritual where people bring body parts to celebrations?

244
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,737
Ain't been invited to one of those.

245
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:51,838
Around here it's mostly teens

246
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,639
raising hell or kids doing trick or treat things.

247
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,440
Trick or Treat?

248
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:58,441
What are you?

249
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,042
From Bosnia?

250
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:01,843
Trick or treat.

251
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:03,344
Where kids dressed up like goons,

252
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:05,245
come knock on people's doors and people give them candy.

253
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,246
Oh.

254
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:08,847
Why?

255
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,248
Because they know you're coming

256
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,549
and if they don't you might trash their house.

257
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,550
So it's extortion.

258
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,651
Now you're catching on, Bosnia boy.

259
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:20,252
Remember fifty bucks is money well spent.

260
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,353
My name's Bruno.

261
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,654
You need enforcement around here

262
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,555
I'm your man.

263
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:25,856
I'll remember.

264
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,857
Now take your rib spreader.

265
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,058
Crack open the sternum allowing access to the heart.

266
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,059
Oh man!

267
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,460
It is amazing to think that

268
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:39,261
once pumped blood through this body.

269
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:41,062
Now in order to remove the cadaver's heart,

270
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:44,063
carefully dissect through the pericardial sack.

271
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,064
Now remove the attachments of the aorta

272
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,465
and the pulmonary veins and arteries.

273
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,566
There shouldn't be much fluid.

274
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:53,967
Excuse me.

275
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:56,968
Ha ha.

276
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,969
-I'll go make sure he doesn't get it on his shoes!
-Hmm.

277
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,571
The Ancient Greeks believed that

278
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,971
the brain was the home of the consciousness.

279
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:12,672
And the heart was the home of the soul.

280
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,073
That's an interesting crucifix.

281
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,074
I spent some time in Cuernavaca.

282
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,475
The artisans there they make one very similar.

283
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,876
They made this one.

284
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:25,077
My grandmother's from Cuernavaca.

285
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,678
She raised us after my parents were killed.

286
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,679
She gave my brother Enrique and me identical ones

287
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,180
before we came here to go to school,

288
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,781
for good luck.

289
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,882
I heard about your brother's disappearance.

290
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:38,283
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,884
They say in some cultures

292
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:44,985
that the bond between brothers

293
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:48,386
can be so strong that they can feel each other's pain.

294
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:50,787
Can you feel his?

295
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:52,788
You have a brother?

296
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,689
Yes.

297
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,890
Do you feel his pain?

298
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,291
Every day.

299
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,692
I feel my brother in my heart

300
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,293
but he can't feel me any more.

301
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,294
Enrique's luck ran out.

302
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:18,595
I just hope that when his heart stopped

303
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,296
he didn't feel any pain.

304
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:46,697
Where AM I?

305
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,298
Where am I?

306
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,499
Where am I?

307
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Where am I?

308
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:06,701
Sydney.

309
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,802
Jarod! It's been so long.

310
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,803
Part of my life is missing.

311
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,904
You sound troubled.

312
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:15,905
Exhausted.

313
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,206
I can't sleep.

314
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,407
This could be your processing of your emotions

315
00:16:21,408 --> 00:16:23,508
regarding the loss of family.

316
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,809
Your brother?

317
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,510
No I understand that pain.

318
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,211
This is different.

319
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,612
Every time I close my eyes

320
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:39,813
I go somewhere somewhere terrible.

321
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:47,414
I get to the same point in this living nightmare but I

322
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:53,415
I can't finish it I . I can't go on.

323
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:58,116
Perhaps your subconscious doesn't want to face what lies ahead.

324
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,117
Let me help you.

325
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,118
Tell me where you are.

326
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,719
You tell me where I was.

327
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,520
Where you were?

328
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,021
My entire life is on these DSAs.

329
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:11,122
From the moment you people stole me to the moment I escaped.

330
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,823
Every breath I took,

331
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,024
every sim I did,

332
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,125
every morsel of food I ate.

333
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:22,326
Except for the last three weeks in October the year before I escaped.

334
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:23,327
There must be a mistake.

335
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,428
There is no mistake.

336
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,429
Three weeks of my life is missing.

337
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,030
Now I don't know how I know,

338
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,531
but it has something to do with my fear

339
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:36,632
and my nightmare.

340
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,533
I need to know what happened.

341
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,434
I need to know what you did to me.

342
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:48,835
I need to know.

343
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:13,836
Can I help you?

344
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,437
Just getting my bearings.

345
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,138
Well keep them out of my office.

346
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,139
Right!

347
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,840
Okay. I've checked the summer house,

348
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,541
the estate in Scotland and in Bimamy

349
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,442
and no one knows where your father is.

350
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,143
Larron.

351
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:29,144
Yes Miss Parker?

352
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:33,445
If she's ever in my office again I'll kill you.

353
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,846
Yes Miss Parker.

354
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,847
What's he doing out of his hole?

355
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,248
We found something we thought .

356
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:53,849
Outside.

357
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,850
I don't want to talk in there.

358
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,651
I searched through my old records.

359
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:01,652
I was in Europe during the missing time that Jarod was talking about.

360
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,153
The precise dates.

361
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,154
So?

362
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:08,255
It was a pointless symposium but I was ordered to attend by Mr. Raines.

363
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:09,856
I tell you that all the weirdness around here

364
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,157
is courtesy of Mr. Skin Grafts himself.

365
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,358
Mr Lyle shows up.

366
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,759
Your father disappears.

367
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,860
It's too coincidental to be just a coincidence.

368
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:23,861
Syd, how is it that half the time you bumble around without a clue

369
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,862
and the other half you're a sage that knows everything?

370
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:27,863
What's that about?

371
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:31,864
Survival

372
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:35,365
Oh. Ah. I'm going to go back to my hole.

373
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,566
First you're going to help me

374
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,667
find out exactly who Mr Lyle is.

375
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:42,568
And how do you expect me to do that?

376
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:45,669
Who knows all the dirty secrets around here?

377
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,670
Mr Raines.

378
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:48,071
Score one for Captain Kangaroo.

379
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,472
While Raines is in the Infirmary

380
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:51,973
you hack into his archives

381
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:54,474
and search for any references to Mr Lyle.

382
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:55,475
Are you crazy?

383
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,276
And while you're rifling through his archives

384
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,877
find out what Raines was doing here while I was in Europe.

385
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:02,778
Oh God!

386
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,779
Oh come on!

387
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,280
Where are your study partners?

388
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,281
Joel is trying to hold down lunch.

389
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,982
And, ah, Chloe went to get some.

390
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,483
A Day of the Dead Cadaver.

391
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,684
I guess you did spend some time in Cuernavaca.

392
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,485
Yes. A little hobby I picked up when I was there.

393
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:30,486
Were you teaching?

394
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:31,787
No, I was a monk.

395
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:34,388
But I did learn a lot about the Day of the Dead,

396
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,789
and about respecting and remembering those who came before.

397
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,790
Every year when we were little

398
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:42,791
our grandmother would take us to the our parents' graves,

399
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:46,292
We would clean and decorate them with the cadavers that we would make.

400
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,693
She would tell us stories about them

401
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:49,694
and connect us to our roots.

402
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,395
Do you do that at the graves of your relatives?

403
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,396
No. I don't know where they are.

404
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,797
I want to find Enrique

405
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:00,298
so that I can bury him properly.

406
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,999
You seem sure that he's not alive.

407
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,900
The night he ah disappeared

408
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,401
he decided to skip the Halloween party

409
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:10,702
and help me study for my pre-med exam.

410
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,303
He never made it home.

411
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,304
Part of me died last Halloween.

412
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,605
It was the part that was connected to my brother.

413
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:25,606
Some brothers don't have that connection.

414
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:34,407
Nice place, if you're trying to raise the dead.

415
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,708
I didn't hear you knock.

416
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:40,109
It's funny!

417
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,410
Neither did I.

418
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:51,211
You know, most adults aren't into Halloween quite this much.

419
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:51,912
It's research.

420
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:55,113
Hey! I downloaded all the back issues of the newspapers like you asked.

421
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,814
Now where's MY paper? .

422
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,115
I know that it's none of my business

423
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:10,816
but ...

424
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,717
why did you want only the obituaries

425
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:13,817
for the last few years?

426
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:15,518
You're right.

427
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,919
It's none of your business.

428
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,120
Here's some trick or treat candy.

429
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,321
I'm particularly fond of the black and orange kind.

430
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:23,422
Very tasty!

431
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:24,423
The black and orange kind?

432
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,024
You are from Bosnia.

433
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,025
And I'm way too old for trick or treat.

434
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:33,826
What do you do on Halloween?

435
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:37,827
Well, my favourite thing is dried dog poop and some newspaper,

436
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:39,528
throw it on some old fart's porch,

437
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,829
set it on fire and run.

438
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,430
Why?

439
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,931
Because they come out and stamp on it.

440
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,732
Well, doesn't that mess his shoes?

441
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:53,133
Oh. Oh!

442
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,134
That's good.

443
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,135
Good evening.

444
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm glad I caught you at work.

445
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,137
I missed you in class today.

446
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,538
I'm a little worried about your study.

447
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:13,139
I'm not sure you're going to make it.

448
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,840
Nah! Don't worry Professor Howard.

449
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:16,241
I'm not going to let them down.

450
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,242
It's not about you.

451
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:19,243
It's about Fernando.

452
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,844
His brother couldn't handle it.

453
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,245
I'm not sure that he can.

454
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:24,846
I knew Enrique and I know Fernando.

455
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:25,947
He's a rock.

456
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,648
So it's true.

457
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,049
Enrique couldn't take the pressure.

458
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,250
I saw him crack up myself.

459
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,451
I was helping Enrique recruit homeless men

460
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:35,952
for one of Dr Fein's research projects.

461
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:39,053
We had to search for this particular fellow called Broad Street Bill.

462
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:42,354
But when I came in around 11 o'clock for the night shift

463
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,355
Enrique started acting really strange.

464
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,356
He called Dr Fein.

465
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,757
And after work, he went home?

466
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,758
He went out to do a burial first.

467
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,859
At eleven o'clock at night?

468
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
We do late burials here all the time.

469
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,161
Saves money or something.

470
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,062
Well Marissa.

471
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,363
If you're dead in my lab,

472
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:02,564
who's buried in your grave?

473
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,565
Oh my God!

474
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,966
Enrique!

475
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,767
They buried you alive.

476
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,868
You had the nightmare again?

477
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,469
So what was it?

478
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,470
Some kind of narcotics experiment?

479
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:25,871
Nerve gas test?

480
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:29,472
Or just the MRI from hell?

481
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:31,673
Whatever it was, Jarod,

482
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,374
it was done without my knowledge.

483
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:37,375
I'd been sent to Europe during the missing time.

484
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,576
I'm doing everything I can to get you answers.

485
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:47,477
Do you ever think about death Sydney?

486
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,478
Not a day goes by

487
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,979
where I don't wonder if it could be my last.

488
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,180
Are you ill?

489
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,881
I work at The Centre.

490
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,082
There are unsettling changes here.

491
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,683
Then walk away.

492
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:03,584
My work here isn't finished.

493
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:06,785
Until you are out of jeopardy.

494
00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:08,386
You and

495
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,287
Jacob.

496
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,588
We can't forget our brothers Sydney.

497
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:21,489
In life or in death.

498
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,890
Oh. Ah. Ha ha ha.

499
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:59,891
You were so quiet I I

500
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,692
You must get a lot of that around here.

501
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,593
Oh yeah. Funny!

502
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:07,894
I was waiting for you.

503
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:11,795
Your brother asked me to give you these vouchers for the cadavers.

504
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:13,396
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

505
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:17,097
While I was waiting Detective Keys came by looking for you.

506
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,398
-Detective Keys?
-Hm Hmm.

507
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,099
You know the one.

508
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,300
She's helping Fernando find his brother, Enrique.

509
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:26,901
Oh, she asked me to give you this.

510
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:31,702
It's an exhumation order for a woman named Hall.

511
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,603
Marissa Hall.

512
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:38,604
It's very interesting Detective Keys came by my lab today

513
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:41,005
and she was fingerprinting cadavers.

514
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:44,906
There was this pre-dissected cadaver from last year on my slab

515
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:49,207
and I'll be damned if it isn't the very same Marissa Hall.

516
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,208
Who are you?

517
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,009
Someone who wants to know

518
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,310
how many more of your customers

519
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,211
Detective Keys is going to find in my lab

520
00:28:55,712 --> 00:28:56,412
and someone who wants to know

521
00:28:56,413 --> 00:29:00,213
why Enrique Ramos was buried alive in the grave that he dug.

522
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,814
Oh no.

523
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:02,815
Yes.

524
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:03,916
Oh no.

525
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,517
I dug him up myself.

526
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:08,418
And unless you want to dig your own grave any deeper

527
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:11,219
I suggest that you tell me what he was doing there.

528
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,020
Last Halloween my brother brought in the body of a homeless man

529
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,521
and told me to cremate it.

530
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,222
Enrique was working later that night

531
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,223
and when he saw the body he got really upset

532
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:22,724
ah He called my brother

533
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,225
and the next thing I know

534
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:25,826
my brother shows up looking for him

535
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:32,327
and I told him Enrique was digging the plot for the Hall woman.

536
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:35,028
I just assumed that he paid him to leave town.

537
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:36,729
He wasn't quite that lucky.

538
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,830
Can you believe they've raised the price of snack food.

539
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:06,331
Oh .. no.

540
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:07,232
No bother.

541
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,733
It's my job to clean up around here anyway.

542
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:15,234
Names Bridget.

543
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,735
Cat got your tongue luv?

544
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:20,136
Oh no.

545
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:21,937
It's just that I I thought I

546
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:24,938
I was the only one who ate those things around here.

547
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,439
You've got company now, Mr Broots.

548
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,340
Ha Ha! Thank You

549
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:37,841
By the way

550
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,842
Mr Raines isn't in his office today.

551
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,843
I really shouldn't be doing this.

552
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:49,144
Dr Fein doesn't let anybody into this lab.

553
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,945
He gets real paranoid someone's going to poach his data.

554
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:52,946
Even when I brought him test subjects

555
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:55,047
they could only come in one at a time.

556
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,348
Like the homeless man you were telling me about?

557
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:00,449
Broad Street Bill? Yeah. Yeah.

558
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:02,951
In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.

559
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,052
And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?

560
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:05,753
No I haven't.

561
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:07,654
And you never will.

562
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:09,455
No one will.

563
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,456
Raines had nothing on Mr Lyle in his archives.

564
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,457
It's like he doesn't exist.

565
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,858
Then why are you wetting your pants?

566
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:19,959
Why?

567
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,960
Because of that Bridget.

568
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,861
Rumour is she's an assassin.

569
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:26,262
I know she saw me coming out of Raine's office.

570
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,763
And she called me mister.

571
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:31,864
What do you think she means by that?

572
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,065
Let's forget Princess Night

573
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,366
and start the damned disk.

574
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:41,267
This disk is from Raines' private archives.

575
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,968
My God, it's Jarod.

576
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,669
It's from the time you were in Europe

577
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,270
See Nothing special.

578
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:53,671
Nothing at all.

579
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:54,572
Let's go.

580
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,173
What's in there?

581
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:57,874
I don't know.

582
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,475
He never let me go further than here.

583
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,576
We really shouldn't be doing this.

584
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,777
What the hell is that?

585
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,179
Who's that with Mr Raines?

586
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,480
Cardio Benzine. What?

587
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:56,481
It's used to slow a patient's heart rate.

588
00:32:57,682 --> 00:33:02,782
In large enough doses, to stop it.

589
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:15,583
Show me the gauges Broots.

590
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,684
My God!

591
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:21,485
Below freezing.

592
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,786
There! Stop it.

593
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:28,187
Okay.

594
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,788
Who Who is that?

595
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:31,789
Mr Lyle.

596
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,390
This freak gets around more than Ed McMahon.

597
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:36,791
Who is this guy?

598
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,592
I don't know.

599
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:41,593
And that's what scares me.

600
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:54,594
Adrenal cortozene.

601
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:58,595
Dr Fine's experimental blood pressure drug?

602
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:01,096
Experimental, yes.

603
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:03,297
Blood pressure, no.

604
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,698
He was using it to revive heart response.

605
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,699
What did he need

606
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,600
what did he need these for?

607
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,001
For when it didn't work.

608
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,202
Jarod's flat-lined.

609
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,703
They were killing him.

610
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,604
That's what they did to me.

611
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:04,705
Do you think Dr Fein was trying to kill his subjects?

612
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,506
He killed them all.

613
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,307
For a minute or two anyway.

614
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,008
And then he'd revive them.

615
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,509
Broad Street Bill?

616
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,710
The one who didn't come back.

617
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:41,311
Trick or Treat?

618
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:42,212
Who wants Pez?

619
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:57,613
Trick or Treat?

620
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:58,914
There you go.

621
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,815
Dr Fein?

622
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:10,016
It's Jarod.

623
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,017
I'm sorry to disturb you

624
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:13,918
but Sheldon was looking for you.

625
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,019
Something about an exhumation order.

626
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,020
Exhumation?

627
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,221
Did he say who?

628
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,122
Some woman named Hall.

629
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,223
You want me to go down there?

630
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,524
A mix up with the cadavers,

631
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:26,525
well that could be very bad for the school.

632
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:27,826
No. No.

633
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:29,527
Ah, I'll handle it.

634
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:30,828
Whatever you say boss.

635
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,029
Trick or treat?

636
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,330
You scared the hell out of me.

637
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:22,331
Well it is after all what this holiday is all about,

638
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:24,032
isn't it?

639
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,633
Oh you're too late.

640
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,134
He's gone.

641
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:30,535
Who's gone?

642
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:32,036
Enrique.

643
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,437
You know.

644
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:35,338
The other man you killed.

645
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,939
What kind of sick prank are you trying to play?

646
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,340
It isn't a prank.

647
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,541
It's a life lesson.

648
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,542
You know, in some cultures

649
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,343
they believe that the spirit of a man killed in anger

650
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:50,144
returns to exact revenge on its perpetrators.

651
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:52,245
Spooky huh?

652
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:53,246
I'm getting out of here.

653
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,447
Oh no, you can't leave Dr Fein.

654
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:56,048
This is the Day of the Dead.

655
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,549
And you sir are the special guest.

656
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,050
Let me out of here Jarod.

657
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,251
This isn't funny.

658
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:05,952
Oh I know.

659
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:08,353
It would be awful to be buried alive

660
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,054
especially with that on your shoe.

661
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:15,955
Owww. Jarod.

662
00:38:17,656 --> 00:38:19,856
Sh sh shs sh sh.

663
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:22,357
There's no reason to wake the dead.

664
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:26,058
You're going to be joining them soon enough.

665
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:27,759
Jarod please.

666
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,060
Did Enrique discover that you had killed

667
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,261
one of the research subjects that he had recruited for you?

668
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:34,362
You're crazy.

669
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,363
Ah ah ahhhh.

670
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:36,864
That's not a very nice thing to say

671
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:40,465
to a man with a shovel, is it?

672
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,066
Let me out.

673
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,667
Let me out of here, Jarod, please.

674
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,868
You took an innocent, homeless man

675
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,669
and you turned him into your guinea pig.

676
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,670
Someone to test your heart drug on.

677
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,771
Someone that you didn't think would be missed if it didn't work.

678
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,872
Well it didn't work, did it?

679
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,373
Someone did miss him.

680
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:58,674
Enrique.

681
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:02,775
So you buried him alive to save your research.

682
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:04,676
Didn't you? Didn't you?

683
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:06,277
Didn't you? Didn't you?

684
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:08,778
Yes! Yes! Now, let me out of here.

685
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,679
Screaming isn't going to help you conserve your oxygen.

686
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,780
And believe me you're going to need all that you can get.

687
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:19,481
-No. No. NO! Jarod.
-Happy Halloween.

688
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:24,282
No Jarod. No Jarod.

689
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:42,983
Wait fifteen minutes, then call Detective Keys.

690
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,584
Does he have enough air in there?

691
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:46,585
More than enough.

692
00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:48,586
But he doesn't need to know that.

693
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,187
You know Bosnia boy,

694
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:55,588
this is the best Halloween I've ever had.

695
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:09,889
Whoa. A C-.

696
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,890
Will you stop. I didn't get a C-.

697
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:12,791
Oh yes you did. C-.

698
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,492
-I did not. You got a C- is what I think.
-Very bad.

699
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:18,493
Oh you, my friend!

700
00:40:57,494 --> 00:41:00,694
You were expecting Florence Nightingale?

701
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,795
What do you want?

702
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,496
Answers.

703
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,897
The kind that only you can give me.

704
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:12,798
The skin grafts are healing nicely.

705
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:17,999
Hmm

706
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,600
let's not have another blow up shall we?

707
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:33,901
Nobody's going to hear us.

708
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:36,902
Nobody can see us.

709
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:41,503
And nobody's going to come to save you.

710
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:50,104
It's just you and me.

711
00:41:54,005 --> 00:42:02,005
Now I want to know where my father is?

712
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:11,906
Where is my father?

713
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:14,507
I don't know.

714
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,608
Is he dead?

715
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:25,409
I don't know.

716
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:36,810
Who is Mr Lyle?

717
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:40,311
Who is he?

718
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:56,912
He's the boogeyman.

719
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:08,413
They stopped my heart. Why?

720
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:09,714
I don't know.

721
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,915
Why does Mr Raines do anything he does?

722
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:15,216
He wasn't alone.

723
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:17,117
The other man.

724
00:43:17,518 --> 00:43:18,918
Mr Lyle.

725
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:22,119
He's here at The Centre now.

726
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,520
I won't let this go.

727
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,621
I promise you that.

728
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:29,922
Well, neither will I.

729
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:32,723
Will you be alright?

730
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:33,924
I'll survive.

731
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:37,225
Even if it is the Day of the Dead.

732
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,926
Halloween.

733
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:41,227
Which I happen to be late for.

734
00:43:41,528 --> 00:43:42,728
Trick or treating you know.

735
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:44,029
Dressed as what?

736
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,530
The scariest creature I can think of.

737
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:01,531
Trick or Treat?
