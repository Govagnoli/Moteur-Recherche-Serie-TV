00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,613
Distinguished Flying Cross.

2
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:36,213
Air force, right?

3
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:40,580
I believe it was my father's.

4
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,342
His name up here?

5
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:46,134
I don't know what war he served in. Never knew him.

6
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:49,216
All these names¡­

7
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,778
I wonder how many never had the chance to know their sons and daughters?

8
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:55,902
Too many.

9
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:01,176
Well, at least you know your old man had too been a hero in Vietnam.

10
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:05,181
cherish him, and his memory.

11
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,334
Excuse me, did you know my father?

12
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:12,416
There her again!

13
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:15,174
You have seen Mark Clements, Bravo company?

14
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:16,578
Do you know her?

15
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,458
Oh, she has been coming here for ten years

16
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,218
trying to get her father's name on the wall.

17
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,778
... in seventy-one or seventy-two?

18
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:27,100
- Army rangers?
- I'm sorry. I ...

19
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:30,303
Well, if her father died in the war, shouldn't his name be on the wall?

20
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:34,336
Only heroes that will be here.

21
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:37,442
Madam, you have been warned about doing this.

22
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:38,843
I'm sorry you'll have to come with us.

23
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,444
Oh, O... Ok, Wait! Please!

24
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,618
See, this is not even fair. My father's name belongs up there.

25
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,251
It belongs on the wall.

26
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:47,421
- I'm sorry.
- Ok.

27
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:11,722
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

28
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:14,923
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:21,924
THE PRETENDER

DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

32
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,102
Tonight on ''Battle Zone''

33
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:03,934
a tragic story of a treason and a betrayal in Vietnam,

34
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,135
reported by Jordan Brock.

35
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:08,019
Toe Popper, a clock will turn

36
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,100
by pressure-activated land mines.

37
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,817
You step on one, you will hear a CLICK.

38
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:16,542
You step off, and it's the last sound you'll ever hear.

39
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,500
Army intelligent's just reeling from the discovery

40
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,218
that Private First Class Mark Clements

41
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,619
was selling classified information to the Viet Cong.

42
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:27,334
It was on this butt, on top one of these mines,

43
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,695
that Private Clements dark ... treason came to an end.

44
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,781
With discovery of top secret documents on his body,

45
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:38,702
Clements' platoon leader, Lieutenant Prentiss McLaren was a witness.

46
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,779
Mark Clements was like a brother.

47
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,974
I would lay down my life for him.

48
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:45,582
Then you find out he's a traitor.

49
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:47,854
What makes the man cross that line? I don't know.

50
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,422
He let everyone down.

51
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,223
Come here!

52
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,852
This is one of the local kid ... as a unit mascot.

53
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:58,452
He lives on the base. He saw the all.

54
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,899
Mark meet with Viet Cong.

55
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,100
I hear CLICK.

56
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,772
I hear explosion.

57
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:10,817
Mark was my friend.

58
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,139
I watch Mark dying.

59
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:14,936
This is Jordan Brock reporting.

60
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:19,420
Keep your eyes open, people! Anybody see them?

61
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:20,892
It's up there somewhere.

62
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,172
Keep moving!

63
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,073
Keep moving!

64
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:26,458
I had moved in this tree line!

65
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:32,136
Padia? Tree line.

66
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,572
I've got him.

67
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,138
Where are you?

68
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:45,839
Damn.

69
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:53,020
Where the hell are you?

70
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,296
I believe you dropped this, sir.

71
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,977
How did I drop and where did you learn the camouflage so well?

72
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,823
I had a lot of practice in ... , sir.

73
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:15,493
Fantastic!

74
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:18,457
watch the whole thing on the ... Those helmet cameras,

75
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:22,373
- What do you call them?
- Tactical Aniscopic Cameras. TACs.

76
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:25,177
What they are going to do for you which CNN did for Desert Storm.

77
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,419
Give us all the taste what it's like to be Rambo.

78
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,818
- Ram who?
- Cute!

79
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:31,776
And if the multiple TACs can document in a real incursion,

80
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:35,441
Capitole here will be bent over backwards to find you missions get in the clearing.

81
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,419
That's the idea.

82
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,158
I need some comparative analyses and figures for Congressman Stanfield

83
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,296
who've got to borrow in the property of the R&D funds

84
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,297
Well done!

85
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,739
You are a ... whistle.

86
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,181
Lieutenant Jarod Patton.

87
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,772
Master Sergent Rob Hancock, Staff Sergeant Elizabeth Padia.

88
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:56,135
Watch out for her. She looks nice. But she bites like a pit-ball.

89
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,819
And lieutenant, welcome to operation ''Dust-off''.

90
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:03,835
A joint mission with the Colombian military to infiltrate and destroy narcotics processing factories.

91
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:08,737
... cover the major shipping of coke ... on a ... factory in Cartagena

92
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,741
- owned by ...
- Esteban Largo.

93
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,475
You are all on alert so wear you pagers 24-7.

94
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:17,772
- Dad?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,771
- Am I supposed to be here?
- Oh, sure.

96
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,736
We are going to have great fun.

97
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:24,478
Look, here.

98
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,056
Come on, you sit down.

99
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:27,357
Right here.

100
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:32,661
You have Barbie. That's fun, huh?

101
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:36,318
You can color. So all you have to do is just sit here

102
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:39,819
and be really really quiet until it's time to go home.

103
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,543
And then, we'll have great fun.

104
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,144
Broots.

105
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:46,937
Ah. Or not.

106
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,982
Did I miss the memo on daycare?

107
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:59,532
The sitter has got the German Measles. Debbie's godmother is on a particular treat. I had no other choice.

108
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,256
It's called the Yellow Pages.

109
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:02,976
in for baby-sitter.

110
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:06,301
I would never leave my daughter alone to someone that I don't know.

111
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:07,858
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,418
but she's staying here with me.

113
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:15,378
That's ok with you.

114
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:21,382
Just make sure that miss murphy stays out of my way.

115
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:30,783
Broots.

116
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,293
Ah, Mr. Raines.

117
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,494
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,374
I love Miami.

119
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,675
Ok.

120
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:45,138
Right away.

121
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,734
Jarod has penetrated the data base of the Miami office.

122
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:55,641
Mr. Raines wants me to go down there and do a immediate mainframe inventory.

123
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,842
Sydney.

124
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:03,418
Could you help me out with Debbie?

125
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,972
Sorry, Broots. But I am supervising three sets of twins

126
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,782
...

127
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,141
Do not even think of about it.

128
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:25,093
Oh, come on. It is a day, maybe two days tops.

129
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,499
I don't do mummy.

130
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:34,416
No, I know Miss Parker. It might help you process on resolving child issues.

131
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,338
Never end with you dessert!

132
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:52,532
You owe me big.

133
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:55,093
I ... I owe you huge!

134
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,055
Thank you. Thank you.

135
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,097
Jell-O?

136
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,941
- And it is a dessert?
- Like you ... a lot in school, remember!

137
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:06,179
Actually my food was brought to me.

138
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:08,216
You did feed yourself, didn't you?

139
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:10,422
For the most part.

140
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:17,451
Oh, if the gelatine is soft, the pineapple chunks into the bottom.

141
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,379
But if it is too hard, they'll just lie there on top.

142
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:26,822
My guess will be have to wait for the proper viscosity to actually add the chunk.

143
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,962
- Is that the captain?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,140
That's him battled in Vietnam. His glory days.

145
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:56,442
You know what I miss the most about that war?

146
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,817
My hair.

147
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,811
Bravo Company.

148
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:02,538
(Who Nhon.)

149
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:04,775
Do you still keep in touch with the men?

150
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,896
One that still alive: Barney Stanfield.

151
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,216
Congressman Stanfield.

152
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,620
I used to bark a little ground around and now he's in charge of my appropriations!

153
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:18,819
If you don't mind, I took it deliberately writing down the comparative analysis report of the TAC systems

154
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,333
that Congressman Stanfield may have requested.

155
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:25,157
I compared four Japanese manufacturers with two Minnesota based companies.

156
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:26,892
Conclusions?

157
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,902
Buy American.

158
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,175
Padia! Bring this up to Capital ...

159
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,418
If you don't mind, captain?

160
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,577
I would like to take this to the Congressman myself.

161
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:40,299
I've never been that close to the real seed of power.

162
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,813
Just so we understant each other.

163
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:51,600
These are the house rules. No running, no playing.

164
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,238
No feet on the furniture.

165
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:58,678
And no noise, which includes both crying and whining.

166
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:02,800
Be invisible, we will get along just fine.

167
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,182
Your clothes is so pretty.

168
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,572
And no touching my stuff, especially my clothes.

169
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:14,578
What?

170
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:16,740
Hold on, Sydney.

171
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,861
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

172
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,896
I told you to stay out of my things and I mean it.

173
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:50,535
Congressman Stanfield, I have the technical report from captain McClaren.

174
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,752
- How is this veteran?
- Still bald sir!

175
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,420
I like this guy.

176
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:58,121
I am...

177
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:01,477
Congressman Leon Beckwith, eleven district Louisiana.

178
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,552
You chaired the Vietnam memorial walls up committed that Congressman Stanfield sits on.

179
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:08,463
- You are registered to vote or some?
- No, Sir.

180
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:11,656
But I did help manipulated in Nixon lands line in 1972.

181
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,358
I really like you guy.

182
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,697
- Nice meeting you.
- You as well, sir.

183
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,833
May I help you to appreciate a good cigar?

184
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:24,334
Yes, sir!

185
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,532
- Santiago Caribe.
- Private reserve.

186
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:34,012
You got to know somebody to get to hold one of these.

187
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,978
Sir, Denise Clements is here again. Shall I call security?

188
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,680
Ah, no, no, no. Ah, send her in.

189
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:43,520
Is there a problem?

190
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,212
A tragedy!

191
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:49,539
And it won't go away, I'm afraid. Please, stay.

192
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:53,232
Sorry to show up without an appointment.

193
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,351
I have two daughters of myself, Denise.

194
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:58,236
I only hope that they love me half as much as you do your father.

195
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,377
Please sit down.

196
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:07,877
Congressman, I talked to a Corporal Ethington from a hundred and eighty-fifth who knew a man named Duke.

197
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:11,301
As you know, My father wrote a letter about a GI named Duke,

198
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,593
who was helping him to catch the traitor, not act this one.

199
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,594
So if it is the same Duke, I believehe he can help me clean my father's name.

200
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:22,255
Miss Clements, we've talked about this letter many times.

201
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:26,542
But it's circumstantial evidence regardless of what this Duke person has to say.

202
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,796
If you can bring him into the next-stop committee meeting,

203
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,197
I'll see to what you heard.

204
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:37,238
Thank you.

205
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,722
Her father served with you in Bravo Company?

206
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:45,823
Yes.

207
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:51,214
Mark Clements was the last man you would find who turned out to be a traitor.

208
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,556
She just won't let go what she wants to believe.

209
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:24,954
Someone once said that old soldiers never die.

210
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,520
They simply fade away.

211
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:33,635
But I don't think that the same can be said about the memory.

212
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:36,340
I think it grows stronger.

213
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,282
Who are you?

214
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,316
Someone who doesn't believe that your father was a traitor.

215
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,332
My name is Jarod.

216
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,581
This must be very difficult for you.

217
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:57,294
It's all that I've ever known.

218
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:00,778
Wasn't until after I buried my mother,

219
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,014
that I realised,

220
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,916
how important it was to get his name up there.

221
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:13,382
If I give up, there's just got the saying he's guilty, and I know he wasn't.

222
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,412
This is the last letter my father wrote home,

223
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:18,931
back in seventy-two.

224
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,197
' ' Duke found out one of our guys' selling secrets to Charlie.

225
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:26,675
If I find out who, God help him.''

226
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:33,298
So you think the real traitor discovered that your father was on to him,

227
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:34,602
framed him.

228
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,342
No one believes me.

229
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:41,781
I believe you.

230
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:54,779
I want you to tell me what's wrong with each of these pictures.

231
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:01,252
The chimney is missing there. The door is upside down there.

232
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:07,279
The bench is missing at post there. And, the address numbers are inverted there.

233
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,042
Look closely, Jarod.

234
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,133
The sun shadow of the wood stack,

235
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,614
It's mis-directed at all and I missed it.

236
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,594
Most people would, Jarod,

237
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,600
Their eyes can only see the obvious.

238
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:25,453
But to maximize your gift, your eyes must see everything.

239
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:34,177
Mark was my friend.

240
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,255
I watch Mark dying.

241
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,356
Mark dying.

242
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:43,357
I watch Mark dying.

243
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:49,542
Le Xuan Duc, Duke.

244
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:51,517
Hello, Duke.

245
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,383
Broots, what do you mean it's going to take longer than you thought?

246
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:04,338
Well, I'm trying...

247
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,514
Do you mind?

248
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:08,457
- How's Debbie?
- She's fine.

249
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:10,734
See, it's me that you should be worried about.

250
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,297
I'll be back as soon as I can.

251
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,602
Mama, show me how to break my hair.

252
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:48,856
Did you get it?

253
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:56,839
We will open it after school, okay?

254
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,795
You have very pretty hair.

255
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:02,614
- Would you break mine like that?

256
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,115
I have things to do.

257
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,117
How did you get to be so mean?

258
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,134
I was born that way.

259
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,653
No, you weren't.

260
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,397
You wanna be rich? Of course you do!

261
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,013
And I am here to show you how to get rich quick.

262
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,678
With my new video, see this, how to get rich quick!

263
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:51,199
My name Lenny Duke.

264
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
I come to your country in tiny boat.

265
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,397
and now I own big boat!

266
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,772
American dream, number one!

267
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:02,294
End, cut it! Perfect, Lenny.

268
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:03,717
Let's lunch!

269
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:10,602
You know, I've got a table reserved over the woodbeach club. If you get to join me?

270
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:12,502
I don't think so.

271
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:19,777
Excuse me.

272
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:23,357
Mr. Duke? I am a really big fan of your work.

273
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,958
Um, 89.95 plus what brings you here. they'll put you on the road to the American Dream.

274
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,536
What a dream it is!

275
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:33,621
A young Vietnamese boy emigrating to American with nothing and building this empire.

276
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:37,531
Hey, as a matter of fact, you remind me this little boy I saw on this old news report.

277
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,039
About this GI and Vietnam.

278
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,678
who died as the legend traitor.

279
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:44,477
What was his name?

280
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:48,378
Oh, yes. Mark Clements?

281
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:52,475
I don't know what you're talking about.

282
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,455
Return to base.

283
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:01,835
Oh, sorry to bother you.

284
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:04,075
Have a nice day.

285
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:13,496
Operation '' Dust-Off''. You are two hours from your Colombian target. Good luck.

286
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,738
They have no idea we are in here.

287
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:32,339
Well, they are about to find out.

288
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:50,756
''Dust Off Tac''

289
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:08,516
Esteban Largo had to be furious of your handy work. Well done, Lieutenant.

290
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,575
I am proud to be involved, sir.

291
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,342
Hope again you can appreciate the fine cigars?

292
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:14,375
It is Santiago Caribe.

293
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,476
Yes, sir.

294
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:17,297
Thank you, sir.

295
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:20,172
About to show me on TV.

296
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:32,778
He's never giving me one of these special cigars, and I like cigars.

297
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:36,215
- What are you doing?
- Do you notice anything?

298
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:39,092
C-4 has a hell over kick!

299
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,581
There wasn't enough debris.

300
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,342
There was nothing inside that factory.

301
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:47,896
There's drums , burned powder,

302
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,016
lab equipment.

303
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,017
Yes.

304
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:54,063
But enough to process a hundred tons of coke paste?

305
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:55,859
What are you saying?

306
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,580
That's somebody tipped off Esteban Largo that we are coming.

307
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,454
He moves everything out,

308
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:05,416
and leaves just enough evidence behind,

309
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,336
so we think we make a big hit.

310
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:08,533
Who would do that?

311
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:18,718
With the destruction of this cocaine factory, another battle has been won in the war agaisnt drugs.

312
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,800
This is Captain McClaren, master man of the operation ''Dust-off''.

313
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,494
Santiago Caribe.

314
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,656
Private reserve.

315
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:37,981
You have to know somebody who gets the hold of these.

316
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:49,482
''Search For: Santiago Caribe Cigars''

317
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,683

00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,087
Wow.

322
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,183
I guess he really do know somebody.

323
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:18,218
Alright, let's move this along. Next!

324
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:21,934
Private First Class Mark S. Clements.

325
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,862
As you've said, ... you have new line to share on this matter?

326
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,063
Yes, I do.

327
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:31,442
A corporal in the one hundred and eighty-fifth division ...

328
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:35,213
Sorry, Miss. You said?

329
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:39,017
It's about Duke, the man refers to my father's letter ...

330
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:42,056
This Duke, is he here to testify?

331
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,217
I wasn't able to find him, sir.

332
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:46,318
But my father was not a traitor.

333
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:49,181
If you would please listen?

334
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:53,235
Miss Clements, have you had the new line to share on this matter?

335
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:57,613
No, sir. But as I was saying if you can just give me a little bit more time ...

336
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,299
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,652
But you haven't let me explain!

338
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:02,300
Pushing!

339
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:03,942
Why won't you people listen to me?

340
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,540
Miss Clements. I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

341
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:11,213
but to be perfectly blunt,

342
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,936
your father's name will never go up on that wall.

343
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:17,462
Now, please. We have other matters to address.

344
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:07,702
You are giving up?

345
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,698
I am facing the facts.

346
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:18,453
Maybe I cannot find Duke because there is no Duke.

347
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:23,412
And maybe there isn't I cannot find any evidence on my father's defence.

348
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:26,815
because it doesn't exist..

349
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:34,483
And maybe it doesn't exist because my father was ...

350
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:41,739
When I was little,

351
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,256
I was taken from my family.

352
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,734
I do not know who they are.

353
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:51,840
Who my father is.

354
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:56,561
All I have is this.

355
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:59,473
It's the only connection that I have to him.

356
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:05,496
But I will never give up searching for him,

357
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:07,455
for my family.

358
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:11,339
Do not give up on your family.

359
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:17,698
I do not have the strength

360
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,379
to do this alone any more.

361
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,619
You are not alone.

362
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:43,380
I have been awake for over 90 hours.

363
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,298
Yeah, in the same room with you, that is a record.

364
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:51,019
Sydney, you got to help me out with this kid take off my hands.

365
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,658
Have a sim or something, I don't care.

366
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:57,979
- She's only a child.
- She doesn't listen!

367
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,378
She's always in my things.

368
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,972
I can't even take a step without a nipping at my heel.

369
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:03,981
She's like a chihuahua!

370
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:06,943
She says about her finding of your mother's gift.

371
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,702
Broots called.

372
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:12,941
He feels very concerned about his daughter's wellbeing.

373
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:17,102
Well,it's time he started showing a little concern about mine.

374
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:20,856
She do like in annoying me.

375
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:24,059
Debbie is not trying to annoy you,

376
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,380
she's trying to be like you.

377
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:32,315
She unconsciously senses that you both share a similarity of maternal abandonment.

378
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:37,059
Are you incapable of having a normal conversation?

379
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:40,733
It is her adaptive coping mechanism.

380
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:43,457
She senses how you came through it.

381
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:47,738
And it gives her hope that she too some day might come through it.

382
00:27:48,023 --> 00:27:51,333
which is why you need to let this relationship flourish.

383
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:56,836
You know it would be really nice if once you can take my side on something.

384
00:27:57,223 --> 00:28:01,213
It's not about sides, Parker. It's about the best interest of the child.

385
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:04,637
By projecting your anger on little Debbie,

386
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:08,838
you've displaced the anger with yourself as a little girl.

387
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:13,134
And why am I so angry about Dr. Spock?

388
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:15,818
It's that you feel responsible for your mother's death.

389
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:27,862
Leave me alone! Mum.

390
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,663
''Barney Stanfield Account Records''

391
00:30:03,664 --> 00:30:08,264
''Prentiss McLaren Account Records''

392
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,461
Oh, remember, this is only infomercials

393
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:30,461
You want to be rich, you want big house, fast car?

394
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:32,222
Beautiful girls?

395
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:33,932
Of course you do!

396
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:36,415
I watch Mark dying.

397
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,979
Mark was my friend.

398
00:30:39,263 --> 00:30:40,662
- My ...
- What the hell is going on?

399
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:47,263
I watch my friend dying. Mark was my friend. I watch ... my friend dying.

400
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,333
- Technical difficulties.
- Who the hell are you?

401
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:53,373
Someone who wants to know the truth.

402
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:59,614
Why did you corroborated the story?

403
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,781
- Did McClaren threaten to kill you or your family?
- you don't know what you're talking about.

404
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:06,294
I know ... Stanfield tipping off the drug lord about the raids and exchange for cash.

405
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,221
I figure if they are doing it now, they were doing it back then.

406
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:12,058
- You don't know what you asking me to do.
- I understand why you lied for him.

407
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:14,896
You were just a little boy.

408
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:18,175
McClaren offers you freedom from the ... of the war.

409
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:20,454
You back his story on national TV,

410
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,699
and he puts you and your family on a boat to the states.

411
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,892
It was ... a plane.

412
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:30,393
What?

413
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:33,213
McClaren helped my family escaped on a plane.

414
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:36,063
and I only said it's a boat on commercial for dramatic fact.

415
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:38,532
The war ended for you.

416
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:43,095
Help me end it for Denise Clements.

417
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:55,934
I was cleaning McClaren's tent.

418
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,498
and I saw some documents marked classified.

419
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,138
I knew something wasn't right so I told Mark.

420
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:06,195
He said he had to catch McClaren at the act of passing the documents to the enemy before he could accuse him for treason.

421
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:10,852
So that night, we followed McClaren into a clearing.

422
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:14,215
- It's north of the camp ...
- But it was a set-up.

423
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,659
McClaren knew that Clements was on to him

424
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:19,899
and wanted him to follow.

425
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,416
Because he had put land mines up there.

426
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:31,455
Clements hear the CLICK when he step on the Toe Popper?

427
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,342
Yes, I hear the CLICK.

428
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,696
But it wasn't mark step on the mine.

429
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:40,540
You?

430
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:46,420
Mark transferred his weight on the pressure fuse so I could move off.

431
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:51,332
- He took your place on the mine.
- That's when McClaren stepped out of the jungle.

432
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:55,133
He knew that Clements would never step off that mine.

433
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:59,298
So he shot him.

434
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:04,413
But he didn't die right away.

435
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:07,491
McClaren watched him bleeding to death.

436
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:10,741
And planted the classified documents on him,

437
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,334
made Clements like a traitor.

438
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:17,418
I can still hear the CLICK.

439
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:19,621
I feel the heat of the explosion.

440
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,453
You think the war is over?

441
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,615
It will never be over for me.

442
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:44,052
Excuse me, sir.

443
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:48,132

445
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,932
Is everything alright, sir?

446
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:07,033
Ah.

447
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:16,942
Is everything alright, sir?

448
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:17,643
Ah.

449
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,053
Yeah, everything's fine.

450
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:36,253
I'm sorry. I can come back later.

451
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:37,901
No, come in.

452
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,622
Are you sure?

453
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:43,978
Sit here.

454
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,772
Just do something with your hair, ok?

455
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,652
I am sorry that I got angry before.

456
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:08,453
It's just ...

457
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:13,574
That present was giving to me by my mother and ...

458
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:18,459
no one has touched but me for a very very long time.

459
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:22,538
Why haven't you opened it?

460
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,701
I am not sure.

461
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:31,941
I wanted to do it about a thousand times.

462
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:33,975
But ...

463
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:36,773
it was so perfect ...

464
00:35:37,423 --> 00:35:41,496
The paper that she used and the way she tied the ribbon,

465
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,818
it's very much of my mother.

466
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:49,813
Your mummy died, didn't she?

467
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,114
Yes.

468
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:55,663
The day she gave me that present.

469
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,017
I would not have opened it either.

470
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:02,178
Why?

471
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,295
Because if you did,

472
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:09,019
there will never be anything else for your mummy to give you.

473
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:42,621
I think it's time.

474
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:13,422
My mother loved this book.

475
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:19,221
She wanted to read it with me.

476
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:23,101
Little women.

477
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:26,015
What's it about?

478
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,699
A little girl named of Jo.

479
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,621
Is she happy?

480
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,179

Barney, where the hell are you?

Oh.

496
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,041
That's not a good sound.

497
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,057
Jarod, Oh, thank God! Am I glad to see you.

498
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:16,578
You don't look so good, captain?

499
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,093
I am standing on a land mine!

500
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,781
I'd better go and get someone who can disarm it.

501
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:23,982
How long can you stand there?

502
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:25,716
As long as it takes.

503
00:39:26,217 --> 00:39:27,517
Well, I guess anyone could

504
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:30,396
if they knew what would happen after they step off it.

505
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:35,217
That must have been why you had shot Mark Clements after one that he was standing on.

506
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,294
And that's why I'm going to have to shoot you.

507
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,203
What the hell is going on here?

508
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,421
What really happened in Qi Nhon, captain?

509
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,295
If I were you, I would talk to me.

510
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:50,933
Or the next bullet might not be a blink.

511
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,418
Army in tower suspected a traitor on here.

512
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,581
So you killed Clements and then you framed him.

513
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:59,616
And tell head men you and Stanfield, you are in the clear.

514
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:01,222
We did what we had to do.

515
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:05,715
You'd got a business to run, selling secrets to the highest bidder.

516
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:08,180
Tell me something, captain.

517
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:12,039
Is greed so addictive that you can kill an innocent man?

518
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,857
You couldn't just kill him.

519
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:15,656
You had to destroy him.

520
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,413
You stripped him of his honor.

521
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,656
And you left his little girl another war to fight.

522
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,581
It's your word against mine.

523
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:27,333
Nobody doubted me before, you really think anybody is going to doubt me now?

524
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,632
Thanks to this helmet camera,

525
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:34,179
it is not just my words. It's yours too.

526
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:36,798
Game up. Lieutenant, you disarm this mine, now!

527
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:39,855
I am your commanding officer!

528
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:44,316
Not technically. You see, I am not really in the army.

529
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,781
But if it makes you feel any better,

530
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:50,215
I won't shoot you in the leg like you shot Clements.

531
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:51,572
I will aim ...

532
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:54,013
higher.

533
00:40:54,614 --> 00:40:55,214
No.

534
00:40:58,815 --> 00:40:59,415
No.

535
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:08,182
Do not wet your pants, sir.

536
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:11,057
It's jell-o. It's a dessert.

537
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,218
Yummy.

538
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,719
Hello.

539
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:39,700
What happened to you?

540
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,201
Well.

541
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:43,539
We went shopping.

542
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,039
Do you have a problem with that?

543
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:50,698
Honey?

544
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:55,417
Where did you get all these stuff? Moving Miss Parker, her business.

545
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,091
She is a good kid.

546
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:10,214
Always take care of her.

547
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:12,432
Or I will hunt you down and kill you?

548
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:14,033
Understand?

549
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,982
I ... I think so.

550
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:38,103
You read it all. Promise?

551
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:43,942
I promise.

552
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:02,896
Come on, kiddo.

553
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:02,414
''Collateral Damage''
