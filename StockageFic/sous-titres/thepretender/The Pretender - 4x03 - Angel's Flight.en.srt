1
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,110
I would like a double-dip vanilla
with granola sprinkles, please.

2
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,323
- Truck ain't open.
- Uh, I have cash money.

3
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,386
It's 7:30 in the freakin' morning.

4
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,454
Why don't you try the Waffle House?

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,298
Considering the iron,
calcium and lactose in the ice cream...

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,237
the carbohydrate value of the cone
and the fiber content of the granola...

7
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,572
one could, in reality, receive more nutritious
ingredients in one Tasty Surprise...

8
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,010
than in an entire
bacon and egg breakfast.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,449
- Are you some kind of nut?
- No. I just like ice cream.

10
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,816
Yeah.

11
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,118
- Taxi!
- [Man] I don't understand.

12
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,028
The police looked through my
daughter's room once already.

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,898
- What did you say your name was?
- Waxman. Detective Jarod Waxman.

14
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,165
The other officer said a teenager
missing less than 48 hours...

15
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,832
wasn't gonna be 
a high priority case.

16
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,307
We reconsidered the situation.

17
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,640
Was there anything
out ofordinary going on...

18
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,306
in your daughter's life
before she disappeared?

19
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,576
Something bothering her?

20
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,483
[Man] My wife passed away
three years ago.

21
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,647
- Cancer.
- I'm sorry.

22
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,056
And it's been hard for me,
but not like it's been for Jesse.

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,061
She just barely turned 15.

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,689
She was at an age where a girl
really needs her mother.

25
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,495
And I guess I just didn't have
the answers that she needed.

26
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,763
Maybe she went away with a friend,
someone from school?

27
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,169
Jesse's shy. She doesn't have
much of a social life.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,767
I don't know. It's like she
just vanished into thin air.

29
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,902
She seemed to have
a special interest in angels.

30
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,345
Yeah. When her mother passed away...

31
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,577
Jesse started collecting them,
reading books about them.

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,949
That one's her favorite.

33
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,554
- Have you seen this before?
- No, never.

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,598
"Gates of Hell."

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,395
That's Jesse's handwriting.
You've got to help me.

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,629
My daughter's life
is in your hands, Detective.

37
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,677
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

38
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,145
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

39
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,479
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

40
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,952
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,457
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,719
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

43
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,557
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

44
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,620
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,599
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift..

46
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,638
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

47
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,001
A man with no face?

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,799
It reminds me of a young man
I recently hired...

49
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,363
to help restore
a broken-down old wax museum.

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:06,469
- Mr. Kleinman, I didn't even 
hear you come in.
- [Chuckling]

51
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,741
Oh, a gift for a friend?

52
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,079
More like... a message.

53
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,210
Ah. I brought you a snack.

54
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,847
- Ooh, I hope it's ice cream.
- Better. A delicacy.

55
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,982
Alcatraz oysters.

56
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,425
These little beauties you can
find only in San Francisco Bay.

57
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,588
Go ahead. Eat.

58
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,656
Enjoy. Yeah.

59
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:37,075
- Eh?
- Mmm.

60
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,236
- They're very good.

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,444
You know what?
This just might do the trick.

63
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,252
You are a very strange
young man, Jarod.

64
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,351
Not half as strange as the people
I'm sending this to.

65
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,023
Jarod, are you sure you wouldn't
want to stay upstairs?

66
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,532
Actually, I spend a lot of time alone.

67
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,569
It's sort of nice to have the company.

68
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:08,096
-Ah.
-Mr. Kleinman, have you ever
seen anything like this before?

69
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,939
[Gasps]
My God!

70
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,750
Where did you get this?

71
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,049
A man I know is searching
for his daughter.

72
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,750
- You have seen it.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,656
- I have seen it.
- You're a Holocaust survivor.

74
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,894
Members of the S.S.
wore similar symbols...

75
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,901
on their uniforms.

76
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,494
- Devils. Demons.
- This man-

77
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,938
He's worried
for his daughter's safety.

78
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,067
Oh, he should be.

79
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,011
He should be scared
to death.

Didn't your mother ever tell you
it's rude to stare?

84
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,590
I hardly knew my mother.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,561
- See something you like?
- I'm confused.

86
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,232
- Doesn't all that... hurt?
- That's the idea, slick.

87

You're screwin' with my head, right?

89
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,846
Actually, I'm looking for someone.
A young man. A magician.

90

Throw a rock, baby cakes.

91
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,784
Yeah, I've seen Hawk
handing these out to a select few.

92
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,792
He's holding court in the back room.

93
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,794
- You can't miss him.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,798
And when you're finished playing games
with the bird man, come back.

95
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:51,235
- I'll show you a real magic show.

98
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,644
Most people can't comprehend
the very world they inhabit.

99
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,710
They exist,
but they don't experience.

100
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,983
They look, but they never see.

101
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,150
I believe that they're portals-

102
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,992
windows to the body,
the mind and the spirit.

103
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,932
Given the perfect exchange of energies,
these windows can be opened.

104
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,097
Pass beyond.
I look at you.

105
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,766
I look into you...

106
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,781
and I see tremendous sorrow,
emptiness.

107
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,356
I want you to think about
what was taken from you.

108
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,683
I magine in your mind's eye
the cause of your suffering.

- I- I don't-
- Shh. Trust me.

of your pain. Can you see it?

Yes.

00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:17,655
I offer you this gift...
with all my love.

- Who is Clare?

in a car accident when we were two.
[Sobbing]

119
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,809
But how could you know that?

120
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,323
Simple.
Your heart told me.

121
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,888

What's Angel's Flight?

123
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:10,102
It was a dream the great Houdini
had repeatedly throughout his life.

124
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,077
Or nightmares, some believe.

125
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,774
Houdini felt, given the power of angels,
he could break free...

126
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,751
from the boundaries ofEarth
and soarin the heavens like a god.

127
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,984
But, unfortunately, he wasn't.

128
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,753
And when he died,
his dream died with him.

129
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,591
Hawk says the Angel's Flight
is attainable.

130
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,396
Close enough to touch.

131
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,736

at midnight for a reading session.

Don't even talk to me

You're not gonna be happy.
It's not good news.

00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,874

Oh, yeah,

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,154
Jerry, the guy with the glass eye
who works down in Transportation-

159
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
well, he told me
that Mr. Lyle is expecting...

00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,493
some Centre hotshot
from the West Coast.

give you a name?
- Not that I can remember.

Hmm. That makes him about as
worthless as this shirt then, doesn't it?

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,996
- Gee, you think?
- Maybe he's talkin' about Lyle.

169
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,829
Uh-uh.
Cigars and champagne?

170
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,232
Maybe.

171
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,737
What are you up to now, Jarod?

172
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,226
What are you up to now, Jarod?

173
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,580
[DoorKnob Rattling]

174
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,213
[Hawk] Welcome, my friends,
to the midnight session.

175
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,722
Let us begin.

176
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:13,963
Please stand.

177
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:32,585
Common, I know.
Read the date on this coin.

178
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:40,058
- 1994.
- 1994.

179
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:43,262
That has special meaning
for you, doesn't it?

180
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:46,602
- Yes.
- Why?

181
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,433
Because that's the year
my mother died.

182
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,914
Turn the coin over.

183
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,587
Oh!

184
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,020
She-She used to call me her Puppy.

185
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:11,258
Yes. She's with you.

186
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,823
[Sobbing]

187
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,138
[Whispering]
She'll always be with you.

188
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,275
Thank you.

189
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:24,504
[Applause]

190
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,686
I see you found your way.

191
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:38,055
- I wasn't sure which way to go.
- Obviously not that way.

192
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,357
Tight security.
Protecting magic secrets.

193
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:45,694
Hawk likes to keep
his personal life... personal.

194
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,993
I suggest you join the others.

195
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:51,196
The reading's already started.

196
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:54,502
- Can I ask you something?
- If I said no, would you walk away?

197
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:56,566
Probably not.

198
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,540
- Look familiar?
- Where did you get that?

199
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:09,022
I like to keep
my personal life... personal.

200
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,057
You don't want to miss the session.

201
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,593
Of course not.

202
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,735
- [Hawk] Your name?
- Uh, Scott.

203
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:26,068
Stand up, Scott.
It's all right. I won't bite.

204
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,234
[People Chuckling]

205
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,736
You can put that down.

206
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,488
- You're new here.
- Yes.

207
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:47,289
- You're nervous.
- [Chuckles] A little bit.

208
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:51,093
- You're also bleeding.
- Bleeding?

209
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,796
Inside.

210
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:03,399
You were betrayed.

211
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:07,546
Hurt by someone you trusted,
someone you loved.

212
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,578
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

213
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,747
It's all right.
It's all right.

214
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:19,088
- We love you.
- [People, Softly] We love you.

215
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,627
[Gasps]

216
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:24,129
You couldn't believe it
when it started.

217
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:27,224
You wanted to scream,
but you were afraid.

218
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:31,237
- Confused.
- Please don't.

219
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:34,934
[Hawk] You were so young,
vulnerable.

220
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:39,104
It was like a nightmare the way
he came at you. So much anger.

221
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,113
I can't do this.

222
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:43,240
You thought if you closed your eyes, 
it would stop.

223
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,308
But it didn't stop, did it, Scott?

224
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,319
It got more violent and angry.

225
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,480
No. No.

226
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:52,423
[Hawk]
You were afraid to tellanyone.

227
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:56,759
Afraid to say the name,
terrified that no one would believe you.

228
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,799
I was afraid.
[Sobbing]

229
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:04,031
You were only a boy,
and he was so powerful, so terrifying.

230
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,368
[Scott]
I wanted him to stop hitting me.

231
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,671
I wanted to say his name.

232
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,973
I know you did.
And now you can.

233
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:14,206
Now you can say it
for the entire world to hear.

234
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,216
- I can't.
- Say it.

235
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:19,980
- I can't.
- Say it, Scott!

236
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:22,044
Say it and end
the nightmare forever!

237
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:25,614
I can't!
[Sobbing Continues]

238
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,718
I can't.

239
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:32,562
It's all right.
I'll say it for you.

240
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:36,069
- [People Gasping]
- It was your father.

241
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:38,604
It was your father
who beat you, Scott.

242
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:48,245
I never wanted it to happen.

243
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:51,807
I know you didn't, Scott.
I know you didn't.

244
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,752
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

245
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,813
It's okay, Scott.

246
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:03,228
You should try that on me.

247
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,657
- Maybe I will.
- You think you helped him?

248
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:11,761
Everyone has secrets,
demons they keep hidden.

249
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,672
And sometimes,
if you don't stop them...

250
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,232
they eat you alive
a piece at a time.

251
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,303
What about you,Jarod?

252
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,746
What kind of demons
are you hiding inside?

253
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:32,253
That's all for tonight.
Mr. Kessler will collect your offerings.

254
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,461
- Another rush delivery from Jarod?
- Yeah, number three.

255
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:45,869
Great. Now your boy's yankin'
my crank on an hourly basis.

256
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:49,875
Jarod never plays these games
without substantial motivation.

257
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,934
It's a head made of Sterno.

258
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:58,016
- What is it this time?
- Wow!

259
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:01,577
Another giant leap
into the Twilight Zone.

260
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,621
You were saying something
about motivation?

261
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,819
Substance, Parker.

262
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:12,127
And there's another note.
"See no evil."

263
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:15,066
In the box with the ears,
the note was, "Hear no evil."

264
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,865
Anything else on the identity
of Lyle's mystery arrival?

265
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,031
Nothing on the grapevine.

266
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:26,677
Well, at least we have
Mr. Potato Head.

267
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,409
Cool.

268
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:12,825
[Beeps]

269
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:32,607
I finally found you, Jessica.

270
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,980
Kill the son of a bitch.

271
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,660
I was excited to get your call,
even if it was a bit cryptic.

272
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,598
- Found something out about Jessica?
- I'm still working on the case.

273
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:05,195
Mr. Bracken, you told me
that your wife...

274
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,206
passed away from an illness.

275
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:12,837
- That's right.
- That's not what really happened, is it?

276
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:17,077
I wanna help you find your daughter,
but we're running out oftime.

277
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,210
If I'm going to help you,
you have to tell me the truth.

278
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,123
Okay.

279
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:31,522
Sarah was... vibrant.

280
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:35,967
Shewas so full of life.
Then she got sick.

281
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:39,972
All that life just
slowly drained out ofher.

282
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,635
She tried to take the treatment,
but... it was too late.

283
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,907
I don't know why
she went out on that roof.

284
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,474
I don't know... what she
was thinking when she jumped.

285
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,845
The police found her body
in the alley the next morning.

286
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:01,690
She was still clutching
her angel pendant in her hand.

287
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:05,827
And that's how Jesse
became obsessed with angels.

288
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:09,926
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I should have told you the truth.

289
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:14,565
I just, uh, didn't think
that it-

290
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:20,079
Find my little girl, Detective, please.
She's all I have left.

291
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,083
[Broots]
Speak no evil.

292
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:34,687
- Anybody recognize him?
- He kinda looks like Gilligan.

293
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,888
- Gilligan?
- Yeah.

294
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:41,457
You know, the Skipper and the Professor
and Mary Ann and-and Ginger.

295
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,003
You grew up in a trailer park,
didn'tyou?

296
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,301
No, I did not.
It was a mobile home.

297
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:50,468
It's obvious Jarod is trying to keep us
busy chasing Mr. No Name's identity...

298
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,842
while he skips along
free as he pleases.

299
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:55,882
- The question is, why all the effort?
- What about the notes?

300
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:59,942
- Jokes without punch lines.
- Maybe a warning.

301
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:06,956
- What is that?
- It looks like a-a water stain.

302
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,018
[Sniffs]
Ew!

303
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:14,328
- Smells like low tide.
- [Sniffs] Wow! They all smell the same.

304
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,859
Maybe Jarod's just
dropping breadcrumbs.

305
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:20,498
- Have these cards analyzed.
- Okay.

306
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,711
Who are you, pal?

307
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:45,624
"A History of Fallen Angels."

308
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:53,267
Fallen... angels.

309
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,604
Hawk says the Angel's Flight
is attainable.

310
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:57,870
Close enough to touch.

311
00:26:57,944 --> 00:27:01,471
[Echoing]

312
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:05,143
I don't know why she went out
on that roof. I don't know...

313
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:08,381
what she was thinking
when she jumped.

314
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:26,254
[Squeaking]

315
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,067
Jessica.

316
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:07,298
- [Gun Cocks]
- I hoped you were smarter.

317
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:11,572
Why couldn't you just walk away
and let this thing finish?

318
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:14,340
The same reason that you couldn't sit
at that table with Hawk...

319
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,473
and talk about Angel's Flight.

320
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:19,416
He did this, didn't he?
What happened?

321
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,612
Jesse Bracken
didn't have enough to offer?

322
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,591
Or she found the computer files
that Hawk keeps on the others?

323
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,684
The wealthy, disenfranchised,
young people...

324
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:31,230
that were recruited
off the streets by you.

325
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:35,324
That's the game, isn't it?
Dazzle them with magic...

326
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,495
and then take them
for every penny you can.

327
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,232
I told Hawk that we
should just cut and run...

328
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,070
but it was never only
about the money for him.

329
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:47,170
Angel's Flight was just
the last act of the play.

330
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:54,013
I swear, sometimes,
the guy really thinks he's gonna fly.

331
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:59,024
- What happened to her?
- Hawk flipped out a couple of days ago...

332
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:01,754
and Jesse overheard us
talkin' about the scam.

333
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:04,830
I just thought he was
gonna talk to her.

334
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:08,421
- I never thought he'd kill her.
- He didn't.

335
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,596
- What?
- She's still alive.

336
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:24,910
- Give me the gun and help me 
get her out of here.
- No. Hawk-

337
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:27,781
If you let her die, there is no magic
in the world that's going to save you.

338
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:31,220
- Now give me the gun.
- All she wanted...

339
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:35,589
was somebody to care about her,
somebody to watch over her.

340
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:42,800
Somebody did.
Now give me the gun.

341
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:19,293
# [Man Singing]

342
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:31,579
# [Continues]

343
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:24,659
Miss Parker, not only has Jarod topped off
Mr. Potato Head with a nice hairpiece...

344
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,536
I just found out that the stains
on the cards were made by oysters.

345
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:30,836
- [Sydney] Oysters?
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,900
What are you saying?
Jarod was a sloppy eater?

347
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,708
The residue was left
by a very specific shellfish...

348
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,771
found only in the San Francisco Bay.

349
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:40,943
I think Jarod wanted us to find him.

350
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,112
San Francisco is a big city.

351
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:45,247
Well, I started thinking
about the head Jarod left...

352
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:47,450
so I scraped some of the wax,
and I had it analyzed.

353
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:52,428
It is used almost exclusively
for the construction of human replication.

354
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:55,193
- Wax museum.
- [Broots] Touche, Syd.

355
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,201
So I called the Frisco area
and found one defunct wax museum.

356
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:02,763
And when I called,
this is what I got.

357
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:07,107
[Jarod] Hello, Sydney, Broots,
and as always, Miss Parker.

358
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:09,544
I assume since you're listening
to this recording...

359
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,548
you figured out my current location.

360
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,743
I realize things got
a little fishy along the way...

361
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,945
but you realize timing
is everything...

362
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:18,285
in the "run for your life"
business.

363
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:21,223
I won't keep you
longer than necessary.

364
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,260
I realize you have
a plane to catch.

365
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:26,388
I just ask two things:
First, bring along the wax head.

366
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,762
I think you'll find it enlightening.

367
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,496
And second, don't forget to buckle
your seat belts. Happy landings.

368
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,165
- Good work, Broots.
- Thanks, Sydney.

369
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,607
Let's not polish each other's
doorknobs quite yet.

370
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:41,338
- Get the jet fired up. 
We're going to California.
- Yes, ma'am.

371
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:44,576
- Broots?
- Yes, ma'am?

372
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,608
- Don't wear that shirt. 
It makes me nauseous.
- Yes, ma'am.

373
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:52,885
It does.

374
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,886
[Boat Horn Blaring]

375
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,660
- I have told you. He is gone.
- Sweep it.

376
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:10,299
- Yes, Miss Parker.
- Was that a gun? Who are you people?

377
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,344
You were saying that Jarod
helped you to remodel the museum.

378
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:17,643
[Mr. Kleinman] An artist he is,
sent here by the angels.

379
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:23,210
- So I see.
- [Mr. Kleinman] He redesigned
the movie star exhibit...

380
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:26,121
the presidential study
and my rose robe.

381
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,888
And he even added a new display.

382
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:34,955
-Jarod calls it... Centre of Shame.
- Show me.

383
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:40,393
I have no idea what
it is supposed to mean...

384
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:42,702
but something tells me you will.

385
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,910
Hey, it's us!
[Chuckling]

386
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:53,177
Incredibly life like.

387
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:56,448
[Miss Parker]
It just gets weirder and weirder.

388
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:15,067
[Broots]
Uh-oh. This can't be good.

389
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,541
[Echoing Laughter]

390
00:35:21,613 --> 00:35:25,447
- I'll be damned!
- [Broots] We just witnessed 
our own execution.

391
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:28,918
- Let's get out of here.
- [Laughter Continues]

392
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,155
[Hawk]
Welcome to the Angel's Flight.

393
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,597
As I look at you all tonight...

394
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:46,433
I'm filled with divine energy.

395
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:50,372
The belief in the possibility
of the impossible.

396
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:54,241
That faith is what separates
the leaders from the followers...

397
00:35:54,312 --> 00:36:00,080
the enlightened from the blind,
the gods... from the mortals.

398
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:08,483
With your strength and spirit,
all things are possible.

399
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,604
[Jarod]
Looking for your safety line, Hawk?

400
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:31,011
- Jarod.
- You seem surprised to see me.

401
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:33,846
I saw the shirt.
Kessler shot you.

402
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:37,649
Ah-ah-ah.
The first rule of Magic:

403
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,849
Never believe what you see.

404
00:36:41,926 --> 00:36:44,087
Hawk, what's going on?

405
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:49,429
It seems our friend Hawk here isn't
exactly the magic man he pretends to be.

406
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,867
You want to tell them?
Or should I?

407
00:36:56,608 --> 00:37:01,102
- Go to hell.
- You first.

408
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,051
- What's that?
- It's you. And you. And you.

409
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:12,055
It's all of you.
Go ahead. Take a look.

410
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:14,387
Hawk had a personal file
on each and every one of you.

411
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:18,190
He knew who you were,
who you are, where you're from...

412
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:21,858
how much you had to...offer.

413
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:25,198
He knew your deepest fears,
your darkest secrets.

414
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,204
He knew you better
than you knew yourselves.

415
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:31,902
And in return for his amazing insights,
you gave him whatever you had of value.

416
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:35,810
And why not?
He saw into your souls, right?

417
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:41,512
- Why?
- Money.

418
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:45,389
Unfortunately, not all of you
were so easily led.

419
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,516
That's why you killed Jesse Bracken.

420
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:53,530
She stumbled onto your computer room,
discovered your little scam.

421
00:37:53,598 --> 00:37:56,192
And that's it.
She had to go.

422
00:37:56,267 --> 00:38:00,431
So you dragged her up here
and you threw her off the roof.

423
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:05,101
- You can't prove anything.
- Can't I?

424
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,403
Next time you toss someone
off a building...

425
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,746
you'd better make damn sure
you clean up after yourself.

426
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,351
So, you still think...

427
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:22,916
that you're worthy to fly
with the angels, Hawk?

428
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:26,896
Or is this just a pathetic curtain call
ofa half-baked magic show?

429
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:35,569
What are you waiting for?
Divine intervention?

430
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,081
[Hawk]
My final gift to you.

431
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:05,826
Son of a bitch!
You killed him!

432
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:08,201
[Jarod] Ah-ah-ah.
Remember what I told you?

433
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:11,833
The first rule of magic:
Never believe what you see.

434
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,325
I hate to say it,
but Jarod has me stumped this time.

435
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:34,991
There must be something
that we're not seeing.

436
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:45,137
[Broots] Eyes, nose, ears, mouth.
It all seems to be there.

437
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:48,975
See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

438
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:51,844
I don't know what it means,
but it gives me a bad feeling.

439
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,188
- Good. You're all still here.
- Where else?

440
00:39:58,256 --> 00:40:01,248
As you may or may not know,
the Triumvirate has decided...

441
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,988
to become more hands-on
in the pursuit ofJarod.

442
00:40:05,062 --> 00:40:07,895
And in an effort to protect
the integrity oftheir pursuit...

443
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:10,627
an element has been added
to act as a safeguard...

444
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,465
or a safety net, if you will.

445
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:15,631
Why don't you just say it?
A new player.

446
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:19,802
You can think of him as
a one-man Internal Affairs Division.

447
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,537
Mr. Cox.

448
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:30,220
- Cox?
- It's with an "X."

449
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:36,193
[Chuckles] I hope we get to know 
each other better in the coming days.

450
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,219
- No doubt.
- I hate to be rude...

451
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:43,597
but we really have to leave if we're
gonna make that next appointment.

452
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,775
That answers that.

453
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:05,914
Brings us to a bigger question.
Who is Mr. Cox?

454
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:10,352
Jarod already answered that.

455
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,392
He's the Grim Reaper.

456
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,613
- Hi.
- Hey, Detective Waxman.
I was hoping we'd see you again.

457
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,182
I was on my way out of town, and I thought
I would stop by and say good-bye.

458
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:46,162
- You look good.
- The doctor said it's a miracle 
she wasn't killed.

459
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,496
My dad says that you saved my life.
I don't know how to thank you.

460
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,832
Seeing you sitting there smiling
is thanks enough.

461
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:56,738
They said the man that did this confessed
to running the scam all over the country.

462
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:59,503
It's good to know he won't be
hurting anybody else's children.

463
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:03,638
Detective, I know it's not the same
as saving your life...

464
00:42:03,714 --> 00:42:06,444
but I thought maybe
you'd like to have this.

465
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:09,247
It helped keep me safe.
I hope it'll do the same for you.

466
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:12,988
I'll keep it close.
Thank you.

467
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:17,250
- Bye.
- Bye.
