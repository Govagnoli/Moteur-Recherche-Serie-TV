00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,810
- Do what?
- Whatever it is you're gonna try and kill me for.

166
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,014
I'm not trying to kill you.
I'm here to help you.

167
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,182
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

168
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,024
Little time. For what?

169
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:54,589
- You just have to trust me.
- Sydney told me not- not to trust anyone.

170
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>You might wanna reconsider that.</i>

171
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,207
Oh!

172
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,039
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

173
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,551
- Are you all right?
- No.

174
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,494
I'm not all right.
I'm as far from all right as I'm ever gonna be.

175
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,929
I've seen people murdered.
They've taken my daughter.

176
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,900
They've broken into my house. They're
tryin' to kill me, and I'm sitting here with you.

177
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,171
No, no, I'm not all right.
I wanna know what the hell's going on.

178
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,738
It's about the data intercepts
you were sent to investigate at the annex.

179
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:11,570
How is it that you know so much
about what's going on at the Centre?

180
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,577
A former Centre operative...

181
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:16,273
has been working with a coconspirator
inside the Centre.

182
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:19,111
<i>In order to conceal their identities</i>
<i>and their activities...</i>

183
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,742
he murdered everyone at the annex.

184
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,685
And now, he's after you.

185
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,986
But I don't know anything, do I?

186
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:30,687
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is that he thinks you do.

187
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:36,166
I don't give a damn about me.
I am only concerned about my daughter.

188
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:41,929
<i>She's safe. I picked her up from school</i>
<i>and took her to my house.</i>

189
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:44,975
And Sam's keeping her
out of harm's way for now.

190
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,341
<i>The Cleaners reported in</i>
<i>from the annex.</i>

191
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,279
- They found a mess, but few answers.
- What about Broots?

192
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,681
The decon team's still looking for him.
They confiscated his home computer.

193
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,515
<i>It's being cross-analyzed to see</i>
<i>if we can pin him down as the leak.</i>

194
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,547
Broots isn't the leak.
But he could find out who is.

195
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,321
That's not how it works.
Broots lives or dies on his own...

196
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:06,659
<i>until and if</i>
<i>this matter's resolved.</i>

197
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:10,167
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Lyle</i>
<i>does not share your sense ofloyalty.</i>

198
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,966
<i>Centre reality check.</i>
<i>Broots is expendable.</i>

199
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,131
I'm not sure a monkey
couldn't do what he does.

200
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:24,508
I can't believe you weren't
spawned under some rock...

201
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:28,245
<i>instead ofbeing born of the same</i>
<i>flesh and blood I came from.</i>

202
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,549
<i>As much as I hate to admit it...</i>

203
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,591
Broots is more of a brother
to me than you'll ever be.

204
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:37,059
I won't throw him out
like a piece of garbage.

205
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:40,291
Hark.
Do I hear violins playing?

206
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,333
Lyle, reality check.

207
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,301
I intend to get to the bottom
of the Centre's problem...

208
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,362
without sacrificing Broots
in the process.

209
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,447
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

210
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:01,076
I've seen a lot of your old hideouts,
but I never thought I'd be here with you.

211
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,552
Neither did I.
You hungry?

212
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,920
[Chuckles]

213
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,257
My daughter loves these.

214
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,856
They have 11 essential
vitamins and minerals.

215
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,235
Listen, Jarod, I can't stay here.

216
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,567
<i>I've gotta find Debbie.</i>
<i>Miss Parker took her.</i>

217
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:23,766
In fact, it was Miss Parker who sent me
to the Data Annex in the first place.

218
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:28,244
Miss Parker is many things, but
she would never do that, especially to you.

219
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,979
She doesn't have it
in her heart...

220
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,985
- or her eyes.
- <i>I know what you mean.</i>

221
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,715
The guy that shot up the annex-
who shot at my house-

222
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,917
<i>now he had it in his eyes.</i>

223
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,620
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>Jarod, this is Damon.</i>

224
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,187
The Tower has asked him to work with you
on some special projects.

225
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,598
Jarod. I've heard a lot about you.

226
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:53,398
<i>[Kenny's Voice]</i>
<i>Jarod, help! Help! It hurts, Jarod!</i>

227
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,341
You know him?

228
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,570
Yes, I know him.

229
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:03,910
<i>For the past several months...</i>

230
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,915
I've been intercepting
communications...

231
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,952
between a man named Damon
and his source at the Centre.

232
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,116
<i>The source has been transferring sims</i>
<i>that I performed to the Data Annex.</i>

233
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:16,126
But the Data Annex
is only for storage...

234
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,128
of routine,
unclassified information.

235
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,687
That's exactly why he had them
transferred there.

236
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,063
The lack of security allowed Damon...

237
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,602
<i>to break in as needed</i>
<i>and download the sims.</i>

238
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,162
But my new software found a trail
leading right back to them.

239
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,936
You were at the wrong place
at the wrong time, Mr. Broots.

240
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,172
- <i>Damon was just covering his tracks.</i>
- Damn.

241
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:38,340
He's already used three of my sims.

242
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:44,078
Now he's stolen a fourth.
I don't know what it is.

243
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,124
But I do know that he plans
on using it tomorrow at 5:00.

244
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:49,489
But what's so important
about four old sims...

245
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,551
that would cause him
to kill all those people?

246
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:56,058
Our clients were impressed
with your recommendations...

247
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,568
to improve the safety
of their aircraft.

248
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,900
There's one other thing, Sydney.

249
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:04,169
I know it's unlikely,
but if the plane were to encounter...

250
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:08,178
a focused burst of electromagnetic energy
in the ultrahigh frequency range...

251
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,043
the pilot would lose control.

252
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:14,448
<i>Jarod, I'll be sure to alert</i>
<i>our client about your concerns.</i>

253
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,921
You have nothing to worry about.

254
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,980
<i>I hope so, Sydney.</i>

255
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,597
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

256
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:33,160
And... the subway?
And the consulate?

257
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,762
Damon took your work
and used it to kill?

258
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,537
I need your help, Broots.
I have to get back into the annex.

259
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,875
<i>I have to find out</i>
<i>what that fourth sim is.</i>

260
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:47,213
We've gotta stop Damon...
before there's another headline.

261
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,717
<i>Okay, I'll help.</i>
<i>But before we go in...</i>

262
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,728
I have to find out
what's happening to Debbie.

263
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,730
But the Centre, they won't let me in.

264
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,699
- Well, they can't keep me out.
- <i>[Phone Beeping]</i>

265
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,373
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>

266
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,705
- <i>Sydney, it's Broots.</i>
- <i>Broots, where are you?</i>

267
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,769
- I gotta know where Debbie is.
- Miss Parker took Debbie to her house.

268
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,407
- She's guarded around the clock.
- Oh, thank God.

269
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:22,078
And, Sydney, please thank
Miss Parker for me, would you?

270
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,882
Mmm.

271
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,981
There's, uh, someone here
l-I think you'd like to speak to.

272
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,391
- Sydney, Damon is back.
- Damon?

273
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,157
- Are you sure?
- I've seen him.

274
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,961
He tried to kill Broots after
he murdered everyone at the annex.

275
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,797
Now he's working with
someone inside the Centre.

276
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,997
They're using my old sims
to orchestrate attacks.

277
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,006
I know when he's planning
to hit next...

278
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,736
but I don't know how,
and I don't know where.

279
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,677
Let me see what I can find out.
But please be careful.

280
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:52,580
- Remember what Damon is capable of.
- Oh, I remember.

281
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,675
I remember everything.

282
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,210
There.
That's all there is to it.

283
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,814
Now you try, Kenny.

284
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,690
Oh, Jarod, I'll never
be able to do this.

285
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,696
Sure you can.
We'll keep on practicing.

286
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,755
Put this point there.

287
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,961
<i>Now press down the fold.</i>
<i>Very good.</i>

288
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:16,404
- <i>[Kenny]Jarod, help me! Jarod!</i>
- <i>[Jarod] No!</i>

289
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,742
<i>[Damon]</i>
<i>I knowJarod.</i>

290
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:25,042
I know how his mind works.
He'll come to me.

291
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:29,678
[Man] We can't take the slightest chance
on them discovering our activity.

292
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,745
I'll take care of it.

293
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,172
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Whoa.</i>

294
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,037
That's what I call a cleanup.

295
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,539
This is the computer Damon was at.

296
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:59,140
We have 10 minutes max
before they detect us.

297
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:05,018
- Do you think you can find out
what he was accessing?
- Well, I designed the system.

298
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,252
Um, that's a- that's a maybe.

299
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,226
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

300
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:13,195
They can send a man to the moon, but neither
of you can open up Broots's system...

301
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:15,198
to backtrack who the leak is
in this place?

302
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,429
- We're searching.
- Search faster.

303
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:26,000
- And where the hell have you been?
- I've been... occupied.

304
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,011
You look frustrated.

305
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,674
Well, your monkeys seem to have
a bit of trouble peeling this banana.

306
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,774
We're all just trying to find
the answers, Miss Parker.

307
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:40,516
My Sweepers have also been unable
to locate Broots's daughter.

308
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,525
Have any idea
where she might be?

309
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:45,585
- Do I look like a babysitter?
- <i>[Man] Uh, Miss Parker?</i>

310
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:48,393
<i>Someone's accessing the computer</i>
<i>at the Data Annex now.</i>

311

Who?

312
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:55,098
Based on the password,
it appears to be... Mr. Broots.

313
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:59,370
Damn. Get me the imbecile
who's supposed to be guarding the annex.

314
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,309
Now!

<i>[Broots]</i>

317
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:15,417
but what exactly happened
between you and Damon?

318
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,121
You're right.
It's not your place to ask.

00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,059
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- <i>[Footsteps Overhead]</i>

320

- [Whispering] I'm not done yet.
- Keep working.

321
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,909
Hold it... right there.

322
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:44,421
Real easy-like,

Ooh. Boy-
I could sure use a drink about now.

331
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,899
I'd settle for the D.S.A.
That we just risked our lives for.

332
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,267
Oh, yeah. Sure.

333
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,329
I'm sorry.

00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:23,349
- Jarod, please.
- I'm not going to do it.

335
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,888
You have to finish this project.

336
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:29,983
No, Sydney.
I can't do this.

337
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,392
Jarod, we know the enemy
is trying to genetically alter...

338
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:35,330
the smallpox virus
to carry Ebola.

339
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,802
<i>Our only interest is in developing</i>
<i>a vaccine to prevent a holocaust.</i>

340
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:44,233
I'm not comfortable
with this area of research.

341
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:46,902
I don't understand, Jarod.

342
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:50,435
In order to make a vaccine,
I have to re-create the deadly organism.

343
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:53,745
- Mm-hmm.
- Concentrations to achieve airborne toxicity...

344
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:57,117
solubility levels, half-lives.

345
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,349
It would be too easy for somebody
to take this information...

346
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:01,983
and use it destructively.

347
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,292
I don't wanna see that happen.

348
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,494

00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:15,437
He's gonna- He's gonna use your work
to biologically attack someone?

00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:18,202
Tomorrow at 5:00.

351
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:21,506
The question is-Who?

352
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,292
What have you found out
about the leak?

353
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,522
If I had Broots, I'd be a lot further along.
But as it is, your monkeys...

354
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,156
have only been able to identify
that the Centre leak...

355
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,462
has arranged for the delivery
of some kind of shipment.

356
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:46,367
- To whom?
- They don't know who or where
or why or even when.

357
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,997
That happens when you don't have
an opposable thumb.

358
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:53,100
All we have to go on appears
to be the shipment order.

- <i>It's in code.</i>
- Brilliant analysis.

360

They're trying to break it now.

361
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,814
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
there was anyone here with you.

362
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,946
Oh. I believe
Mr. Lyle was just leaving.

363
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:11,121
Well, I am really impressed

the concept of sibling rivalry to new levels.

- Thank you, Sydney.

your feelings for Damon...

Don't let it destroy you.

- Yeah, neither did I.

00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:25,343
Still worried about the innocent masses?
Still the same?

487
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:30,688
- Jarod- humanity's seed of hope.
- Give me the case.

488
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,954
TheJarod I knew
couldn't pull that trigger.

489
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:40,895
You wanna stop me,
shoot me in the back.

490
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,963
My guess is you're still
too human for that.

491
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:57,516
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Jarod!</i>

492
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,056
- <i>[Broots] Now don't move.</i>
- <i>[Jarod Groans]</i>

493
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:11,860
Okay, just like that.

494
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,902
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

495
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:15,937
You could take me
into the Centre.

496
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:20,907
<i>The Schedule 7 or not, with me</i>
<i>as the prize, they would welcome you back.</i>

497
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:25,538
Well, the way I figure...

498
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:27,548
there's a time
and a place for everything.

499
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,743
And right now, I owe you.

500
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,378
Besides, I respect you.

501
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:34,581
- Ow. Me?
- Yeah.

502
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:40,427
You help people.
You care.

503
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,590
When others look away,
you-you try and make a difference.

504
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:45,599
Well, I didn't make
a difference this time.

505
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:49,103
And that's why you can't look away now,
and neither can I.

506
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,765
You know, considering
what we've been through...

507
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,741
I think I have a right
to ask you this.

508
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,778
What happened between
you and Damon?

509
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:05,276
[Sighs]
It's on the D.S.A.

510
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:10,122
Because, you know,
I've been thinking about what you said...

511
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,922
about discovering Damon's pattern.

512
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:15,862
<i>It's- It's obviously political...</i>

513
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:18,422
even possibly global.

514
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,128
A private,
nondenominational service...

515
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,001
<i>to pray for an end</i>
<i>to the Bosnian conflict...</i>

516
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,097
<i>is scheduled for 5.00</i>
<i>this afternoon...</i>

517
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,075
here at Freedom Hall in Georgetown.

518
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:29,838
- Take it!
- <i>The service...</i>

519
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:33,177
<i>referred to by the parties</i>
<i>as the "seed ofhope"-</i>

520
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,307
Humanity's seed of hope.

521
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:38,217
<i>Will bring together representatives</i>
<i>of the Czech Republic...</i>

522
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,619
<i>Serbia and Bosnia...</i>

523
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:45,183
<i>on the eve of the peace talks which are</i>
<i>scheduled to start Monday in Washington.</i>

524
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,196
<i>The Centre owns you,</i>
<i>and there's nothin'you can do about it.</i>

525
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,357
- Oh, my God.
- Broots?

526
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:54,300
- <i>[Woman On TV, Indistinct]</i>
- <i>Broots?</i>

527
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,930
<i>He's going to hit the service.</i>

528
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,134
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Sydney? Sydney?</i>

529
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,145
The floodgates
have finally opened.

530
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,545
The techs have finished
putting all the pieces together.

531
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:09,709
- You know where and when
Damon is going to strike?
- The jet's waiting.

532
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:13,312
- What about Lyle?
- Leave him here to run his circus.

533
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:18,487
<i>[Chorus Vocalizing]</i>

534
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,912
<i>[Broots] How do you think</i>
<i>he's gonna deliver the virus? The wine?</i>

535
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:49,253
Not everyone is going
to take Communion.

536
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:54,193
But everyone's going
to breathe the air.

537
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:58,830
Jarod, look.
It's Damon.

538
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:03,598
- Aerosol delivery.
- <i>He's gonna spray the crowd.</i>

539
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,402
- Get everyone out of here.
- Okay.

540
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,676
Uh- Excuse me!

541
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,613
Uh, I've been alerted
there's a bomb in the building.

542
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:18,381
So if you could all just please exit,
uh, quickly and calmly, please.

543
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:35,064
<i>Jarod. You just can't</i>
<i>leave it alone, can you?</i>

544
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:38,436
<i>This isn't about you.</i>

545
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:42,967
You're using my work to infect countless
numbers of people. And for what?

546
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,741
Gotta make a living.

547
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,713
Who's helping you
at the Centre?

548
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,984
The same person
who always has.

549
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,821
- Ow!
- <i>Back off, Jarod...</i>

550
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:00,555
or you can say good-bye
to another friend.

551
00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:04,132
Not this time.
[Grunts]

552
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,396
Damon!

553
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,406
Let him go.
This is between us.

554
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:16,069
Your friend comes with me.
I'll let him go...

555
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:18,112
when I know
I haven't been followed.

556
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,672
That's funny.
I believed you once.

557
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,514
- Then you know what I'm capable of.
- No, Jarod.

558
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:28,113
It's over, Damon.

559
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,420
You're not gonna pull
that trigger, Jarod.

560
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:33,086
<i>You don't have it</i>
<i>in your eyes...</i>

561
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,356
just like when we were
together at the Centre.

562
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,695
He has a daughter...

563
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,598
who needs him.

564
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,705
That doesn't make any difference.

565
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:48,705
[Groans]

566
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,673
No!

567
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:56,013
It does to me!

568
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,164
King me.

569
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:20,336
- Daddy!
- Ah!

570
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,741
- Debbie!
- Daddy, I missed you so much.

571
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:25,211
<i>[Broots]</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

572
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,716
Oh, I missed you too. Oh!

573
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,945
I got something for you.

574
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,453
Happy birthday.

575
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:35,752
Paris?
<i>Je t'aime,</i> Daddy!

576
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:39,253
<i>Je t'aime aussi.</i>

577
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,594
Sam, let's go.

578
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:49,364
There's a couple of things
I need to wrap up at the Centre.

579
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,736
Good game, kid.

580
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,234
I love you, Daddy.

581
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:01,616
- <i>This is Sydney.</i>
- <i>[Jarod On Phone] It's me.</i>

582
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:05,847
- You okay, Jarod?
- Physically.

583
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:09,618
It's natural to struggle to come
to terms with what happened.

584
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:18,923
I never...
pulled the trigger before.

585
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,231
I pray you never
have to again, Jarod.

586
00:42:22,304 --> 00:42:25,000
The guilt you're feeling
comes from a conflict...

587
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:29,169
over your desire to
exact revenge for Kenny...

588
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:32,475
and the necessity
of what you did.

589
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:36,347
I just keep playing the moment
over and over in my head.

590
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:38,648
You saved Broots's life...

591
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,484
and the lives of
untold numbers of people.

592
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:43,615
I just...

593
00:42:45,026 --> 00:42:46,960
feel so empty.

594
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:49,155
You have to forgive yourself, Jarod.

595
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:53,099
There's an old saying:

596
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:56,626
"He who saves but one life...

597
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:59,071
saves the entire world."

598
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,340
L-I have to go.
