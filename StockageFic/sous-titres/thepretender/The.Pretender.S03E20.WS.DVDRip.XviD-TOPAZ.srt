- Angel.

Shut the door, please.

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,178
Yeah.

4
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:25,418
[Clears Throat] I thought maybe we could,
uh, have lunch together.

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,483
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,462
Why does something have to be wrong
when a father asks his daughter to lunch?

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,161
It doesn't. It's just- I'm sorry, Daddy.
I didn't mean it that way.

8
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,568
Oh, that's all right.
I probably deserved it.

9
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:43,371
I just thought we could sit down and-
[Clears Throat] talk... for a while.

10
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:48,972
God knows you've-
you've been through a lot, huh?

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,416
- I would love to have lunch with you.
- Good. Good.

12
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,012
- We need to speak with you, alone.
- Not now, Raines.

13
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,456

- It can't.

Didn't even get the bodies
out until the '40s.

63

It's been cursed here ever since.

that this man was here recently.

- Not me.

Maybe you should come in until
this blows over. It's getting worse.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,944
I'd rather take my chances out here
in this weather than inside of that place.

72

- Good luck.
- Thanks.

319
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,775
You mind tellin' me
what that was back there?

320
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,841
Smitty's death was not accidental.

321
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
Listen, pal, this place breeds
cabin fever and paranoia.

322
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,714
If the doc says it was an accident,
then it <i>was.</i> Case closed.

323
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,850
There's more going on here than cabin fever,
and Smitty knew it.

324
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,523
<i>There's something very wrong here.</i>
<i>I can feel it and so do you.</i>

325
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:51,001
If there's something goin' on here, that just
makes the stress on the men that much worse.

326
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,527
- It's my job to keep this place from fallin' apart.
- Someone will come for us.

327
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,040
You taken a look out there lately?
It'll be days.

328
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:01,340
<i>Not even those crazy Inuits and their dog sleds</i>
<i>go out in weather like this.</i>

329
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:06,441
<i>Until then, we are stranded. I don't need any</i>
<i>loose talk makin'things worse. You understand?</i>

330
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,755
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>

331
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:32,601
[Relieved Sigh]
You scared the hell out of me.

332
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,248
You mind if I join you?

333
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,689
Is that yours?

334
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,284
- My son.
- He's cute.

335
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,854
- You must be very proud.
- I never even seen him.

336
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,231
<i>My wife found out she was pregnant</i>
<i>just after I shipped up here.</i>

337
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,295
Got two months left on my contract.
They won't let me go home.

338
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,399
I'm never gonna see him.

339
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,944
Of course you will.
You'll be going home soon.

340
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,244
No, I'm not.
No one's goin' home alive.

341
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,375
Manny.

342
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,312
Manny!

343
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,115
Manny.

344
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,727
- What's Qallupilluit?
- <i>An old Inuit story...</i>

345
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,061
about an evil creature
that lives in the ice cracks.

346
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,124
It kills those that get too close.

347
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,398
Smitty said there was a stranger here.
Did you see anybody?

348
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,497
The Qallupilluit is here.
It's under the station.

349
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:39,407
I hear him sometimes at night.

350
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,275
- Where under the station?
- I don't know!

351
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:46,613
I hear him from my bunk.
He's in the floor, in the walls, everywhere!

352
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,421
This man was here.
Have you seen him?

353
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,017
I want to see
my son and my wife!

354
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,962
- You promised you'd get me out of here!
- Manny, Manny! Hey, hey, hey!

355
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,397
<i>Come on. Manny, you all right?
You okay? Look-

356
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,458
<i>[Clanging]</i>

357
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:09,735
Why don't you go to the doc and have him
take a look at that, okay? Go ahead.

358
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:14,108
Manny's goin' through a lot of stress right now.
He doesn't need you makin' it worse, okay?

359
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,876
- What's he so stressed out about?
- It's none of your business.

360
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,383
You know, I really
don't know who you are.

361
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,819
But ever since you showed up here,
things have been going from bad to worse.

362
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:26,015
So why don't you just-

363
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,651
<i>Manny, what? What?</i>

364
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,560
- What? What? Talk to me, man!
- It got- It got- It got Doc!

365
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:34,189
- <i>The Qallupilluit! It got Doc!</i>
- Get the captain.

366
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,358
<i>Come on!

367
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,460
Doc!

368
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,528
Doc.

369
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,032
The incinerator!

370
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,620
- Doc's death was no accident.
- You implyin' that one of us is a killer?

371
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:43,565
I warned you the men were experiencing
disturbing levels of isolation stress...

372
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,967
- <i>and that they were at the breaking point!</i>
- <i>You got somethin'to say?</i>

373
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,028
Say it, all right? It wasn't me!

374
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,633
- Then why did you decide to go
to the infirmary when you did?
- I tore my stitches!

375
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,906
When? When you were struggling with Doc,
or when you threw him in the incinerator?

376
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,140
- What?
- Wait a minute! I know what you're doin'!

377
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,548
You put things in people's minds that don't
even belong there. Don't walk away from me!

378
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,677
<i>[Beth]</i>
<i>Get away from me! Back off, Joe!</i>

379
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,212
- Where was you when we found Doc?
- Everybody, calm down!

380
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,521
What did you say?
What about you?

381
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,689
- Maybe this is all of your doing, huh?
- Maybe it wasn't any one of us.

382
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,324
<i>Maybe there's someone here with us.</i>

383
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,528
[Scoffs]
What, like Manny's Qallupilluit?

384
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,334
<i>No, he's right, man. I seen someone.</i>
<i>A man, comin'and goin'with the Inuits.</i>

385
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,637
<i>He was with them a couple of weeks ago.</i>
<i>Joe saw him too.</i>

386
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,507
- No. No, I didn't.
- Joe. Joe, you saw him.

387
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,037
- You were with me, man.
- Joe Taylor, talk to us.

388
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,686
I caught a glimpse of him
when they were deliverin' the supplies.

389
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,383
Did anybody see him leave?

390
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,129
[Gasps]

391
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:59,336
Joe Taylor, check the generator,
then bolt the door to the mechanical room.

392
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,038
We lose power in a storm like this,
it's a death sentence for all of us.

393
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,913
<i>Manny, salvage whatever you can from</i>
<i>the infirmary. We may need it before this is over.</i>

394
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,384
When you guys are finished,
you come back in here.

395
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,546
- We're gonna stay together till
we get help from the outside.
- If outside help arrives.

396
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,183
- Shut up!
- Tell me, why are you the one
that gets to keep the gun?

397
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,819
'Cause I am the one with the gun.

398
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,357
Now do what I told ya.

399
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,425
<i>Come on, man.</i> Come on.

400
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,903
I have no idea what the hell's
goin' on around here...

401
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,471
but I sure in hell
am gonna find out.

402
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:45,587
<i>[Mr. Parker]</i>
<i>Find out everything you can...</i>

403
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,387
about Major Charles and this breach.

404
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,620
- Where did you get this?
- Someone from within the Centre...

405
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,425
e-mailed a video of your father's office
to an off-site location.

406
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:58,026
- <i>All I had to do was retrieve the original feed.</i>
- That's why they made me leave.

407
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,969
Good work. Broots.

408
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,200
- Who sent it?
- Well, it's hard to say.

409
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,435
- But I know who it was sent to.
- Jarod?

410
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,001
Yeah. From what I can tell,
Major Charles found out...

411
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,378
- about something called the Alpha Project.
- Never heard of it.

412
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,610
- Neither have we.
- [Clears Throat]

413
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,846
Well, whatever it is, it's being run...

414
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,084
from an Arctic research station
funded by the Centre.

415
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,821
Obviously, Major Charles <i>was</i> there-

416
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,090
may still be.

417
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,998
<i>Cinch up your long johns, boys.

422
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,152
Except for that guy, Jarod, man.
He's gonna be a problem.

423
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,088
So what do you want to do next?

424
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,606

Wh-What are you doing?

426
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:22,017
Isn't that the gun that, uh-
When your mother was, uh-

427
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,714
- Are you here for lunch, Daddy?
- Something bothering you?

428
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,223
Yeah.

429
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,151
Major Charles.

430
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:37,123
Why didn't you tell me about this?

431
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,327
Well, you've been through enough.

432
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:41,870
I just didn't want to see you like this.

433
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:44,202
I'm going to Ellesmere, Daddy.

434
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:46,970
We don't even know whether
Major Charles is still there.

435
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:54,648
What are you really afraid of?
That I may find Major Charles-

436
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:57,049

Or what drove him there?

- All right, just calm down.

00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,215
Please don't make me do this.

479
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,912
I'm not waitin' around to be next!

480
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:51,518
- <i>[Jarod] Captain, no!</i>
- Crazy bastard! You forced me to do that!

481
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:54,563
You didn't have to shoot him!
God, Manny, are you okay?

482
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:57,225
We're gonna take you to the infirmary.
This'll stop the bleeding.

483
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,201
It's just a flesh wound.
He needs medical attention.

484
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,932
Is that right?

485
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:05,372
- What are you doing?
- I know I'm not the killer.

486
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:08,035
Jarod was with me when the power went out.
It couldn't be either one of us.

487
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:10,705
- Then maybe the both of you did it.
- <i>[Jarod] Maybe it's none of us.</i>

488
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,682
If you let me take a look at Smitty's body,
maybe I can tell you who the killer is.

489
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,219
The only thing you're gonna take a look
at is the inside of that storage locker...

490
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,517
<i>where I'm gonna put you</i>
<i>till I figure out what to do.</i>

491
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:22,023
Now get him up!

492
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:24,559
- Put us in there, man, 'cause I'm gonna kill you.
- Now!

493
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:27,926
Worse than the Qallupilluit will ever get you, man.
I'm comin' after you, Captain!

494
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:31,398
- Let's go! Let's go!
- <i>Comin'after you, man!</i>

495
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:34,027
- <i>Let's go, people! Move!</i>
- It's gonna get you good!

496
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:39,200
Manny, shut up! Wait a minute.
We got a problem.

497
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:43,439
I was here right before the power went out.
I know I locked this door.

498
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:49,047
What is it?

499
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:53,319
Dynamite's missing.

500
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,825
So either the two of you are lying,
or we are not alone.

501
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,726
[Manny] Our Father,
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

502
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:03,323
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

503
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,197
- That should do for now.
- Thanks.

504
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,868
Both the generators are blown.
We're gonna need these coats.

505
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:18,970
Manny?
We're gonna get out of here now.

506
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,617
- What'd you find?
- Your Qallupilluit.

507
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,950
What do you mean?

508
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:29,389
If you want to find the killer,
we have to find a dead man.

509
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:38,497
- <i>[Broots] Wow! Sydney, look at those clouds.</i>
- <i>It's an Arctic front.</i>

510
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:41,298
I've never seen anything like that.
Miss Parker, take a look.

511
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,202
I'll catch it in <i>National Geographic.</i>
How much longer?

512
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:50,735
[Woman] Looks like I'm gonna have to put
down for a few hours at a Canadian air base.

513
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,906
- Weather's still too rough to get any closer-
- Great.

514
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:56,450
If we can't get in,
they can't get out.

515
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:02,013
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>What dead man?</i>

516
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,582
There's no sign of searing
or smoke in his lungs.

517
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,029
- He was dead before the fire
because of the blow to his head.
- Why would Doc lie?

518
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:13,296
The scalpel that we all assumed killed Doc
is covered with 0-positive blood.

519
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,703
But according to his chart,
Doc's blood type was B-negative.

520
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:19,708
W-We saw the skeleton
in the incinerator.

521
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,712
Remember your laboratory skeleton?
It's missing.

522
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,374
- Doc killed Smitty?
- [Beth] And faked his own death.

523
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:29,316
- But someone had to have helped him.
- Joe Taylor.

524
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:32,377
<i>He was probably</i>
<i>helping Doc all along.</i>

525
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:35,720
When Doc faked his own death,
he had to killJoe Taylor to cover his tracks.

526
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,783
Doc is still here doin' all this?
Why?

527
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,987
Maybe we should ask the captain.

528
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:41,962
What?

529
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:45,023
You know more about what's going on
in this place than you are letting on.

530
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,331
- I knew you were a part of this.
- He's not.

531
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:49,462
But he knew who the visitor was...

532
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:52,007
and why he was here.

533
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,043
It was you that Major Charles
came to see in the first place.

534
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:58,547
What do you know
about Major Charles?

535
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,775
He's my father.

536
00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:12,884
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

537
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,754
Sorry, guys.

538
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:19,097
It's still gonna be 24 hours before
we can get a chopper in there.

539
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:21,159
Thank you, Captain.

540
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:24,872
- <i>[Door Shuts]</i>
- [Exhales]

541
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:27,432
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

542
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,571
<i>Are you prepared for what</i>
<i>or who we may find out there?</i>

543
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:34,639
I'm not sure.

544
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:37,481
This is...

545
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:39,544
surreal.

546
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,613
So much of my life-

547
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:44,922
my mother's death,
the Centre, Jarod-

548
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:47,224
<i>all leading to this moment.</i>

549
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:49,764
There's a sense of something...

550
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,959
ominous waiting for us.

551
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:55,595
- Overwhelming sense of impending doom?
- What?

552
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:00,137
- Nothing.
- I just hope we're not too late.

553
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:09,073
Your father and I served together
in the air <i>force-</i> Circle of Fire Unit.

554
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:13,087
<i>My wife and I were very close</i>
<i>to him and to your mom.</i>

555
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,487
We helped him search
for you for years.

556
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:20,791
Several years after your disappearance,
I heard that the major had been murdered.

557
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:24,492
A little over a year ago,
your father contacted me.

558
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:29,095
- Why?
- To tell me what the Centre had
done to him and to his family.

559
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:32,402
You see, Jarod, he- he never
stopped searchin' for you.

560
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:35,603
<i>Then he found out what the Centre</i>
<i>was workin'on here...</i>

561
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:38,010
under cover of this research facility-

562
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,980
- And he asked for your help.
- <i>And I agreed.</i>

563
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:45,248
The idea was to expose the plan and then
hopefully reunite him with his family-

564
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,922
with you.

565
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:55,997
My guess is there is another
research facility on-site...

566
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,693
probably somewhere near.

567
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:02,465
It took me a little over eight months
to come to the same conclusion.

568
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:09,234
<i>It's right down here.</i>

569
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:21,322
<i>[Beth] This must be what's left</i>
<i>of the original station from the '20s.</i>

570
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:26,521
<i>[Captain] With a slight modification.</i>
<i>Its own independent power source.</i>

571
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,928
I finally found this place
several weeks ago.

572
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:32,957
- <i>I was able to get the evidence</i>
<i>your father was lookin'for.</i>
- <i>[Beth] Evidence of what?</i>

573
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:35,196
<i>What they were actually</i>
<i>researching here.</i>

574
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:38,638
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>This equipment-</i>

575
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,905
- It was used for amino-acid sequencing.
- Why would they need that here?

576
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:44,378
They were doing genetic research.

577
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,506
Amino acids...

578
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:49,210
are sequenced in an infinite
number of patterns...

579
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:54,348
which in turn form the basic building blocks
for all life- D.N.A.

580
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:58,723
- In this case, human D.N.A.
- Dr. Moore was working on
the Human Genome Project.

581
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:02,025
<i>More than working.</i>
<i>Dr. Moore was a brilliant geneticist.</i>

582
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:04,692
He had completed mapping
the human genome years ago.

583
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:08,294
While the rest of science attempts
what he's already achieved.

584
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:12,000
- What's a genome?
- A genetic blueprint for human life.

585
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:15,601
- You mean he figured out
God's cookbook for human beings?
- Exactly.

586
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,873
But why hide
such a significant discovery?

587
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:21,542
<i>Unleashing the secrets</i>
<i>could be used to benefit mankind.</i>

588
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:25,917
Or unleash a Qallupilluit. What was the Centre
planning on doing with this research?

589
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,149
I don't know.
Your father discovered their secret.

590
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,385
- They're using this research to create a-
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>

591
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:33,587
[Screaming]

592
00:40:33,663 --> 00:40:36,564
[Doc] I knew when we met,
you weren't here to watch the weather.

593
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:39,726
- What have you done with my father?
- Unfortunately, nothing.

594
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,737
He found what he came for
and left before I was able to stop him.

595
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,638
- <i>If your father hadn't come,</i>
<i>none of this'd be necessary.</i>
- [Groaning]

596
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,405
- You mean, killing everybody,
you crazy son of a bitch?
- Yes, Manuel.

597
00:40:49,478 --> 00:40:53,574
- You took the dynamite.
- No one can ever know what happened here.

598
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:58,643
There's a timer set to detonate in three minutes,
but... you needn't fear that blast.

599
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:01,646
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Beth, look out!</i>

600
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,985
[Gunshot]

601
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,497
You okay?

602
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:19,139
- <i>[Manny] He's dead.</i>
- [Shuddering]

603
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:23,637
- Captain.
- [Gasping]

604
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:28,014
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- There's no time.

605
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,917
You have to get Beth and Manny
out of here before it blows.

606
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:35,150
Use this. My friends at the Inuit camp
monitor the same band.

607
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:37,988
- They'll help you like they helped your father.
- My father?

608
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,120
I sent him to my daughter's.
You'll find him there.

609
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,724
<i>Oh- Oh, God.</i>

610
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:48,159
Give her this.

611
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:55,172
<i>[Gasping, Shuddering]</i>

612
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,349
Tell my daughter I love her.

613
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,784
I will. I promise you.

614
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:12,223
<i>Captain, what was it
that my father found here?

615
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:17,655
It wasn't just... any human genome
they were working on.

616
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:22,600
It was yours.
[Panting]

617
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:28,368
<i>Captain.</i> Captain!

618
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,811

619
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:42,153
