Jon designed our wedding bands.

them to be the only two alike in the world.

he went into the field to work.

500
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,099
But, then again, neither are you.

501
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:35,970
How long, Walter?

502
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,499
How long beforeJon Florence
started to show symptoms?

503
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:42,172
<i>How long before</i>
<i>the internal bleeding started?</i>

504
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:46,616
How long before his brain tissues
started to leak into his ears?

505
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:51,213
How long before his internal organs
started to liquefy? How long, Walter?

506
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,123
- Give me that syringe.
- <i>Why?</i>

507
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:58,459
Jon Florence never had this option.
Why should you?

508
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,124
- Jarod, it was an accident.
- He knew he was going to die.

509
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,193
And I'll bet the last thing he wanted to do
was just to see his family one more time...

510
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,068
to say good-bye to his wife
and to his child.

511
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,836
But you couldn't give him that peace,
could you, Walter?

512
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,878
<i>Because then the truth would come out</i>
<i>about how you were trying to play God...</i>

513
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:16,073
<i>with all these viral experiments.</i>

514
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,514
You tookJon Florence's life...

515
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,882
and you ruined his family's as well.

516
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,150
- That is no accident.
- All right, I did it. I admit it. I killed him!

517
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:27,317
<i>The-The research</i>
<i>was very valuable.</i>

518
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:31,329
- Please, give me the vaccine!
- All right, Walter.

519
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:34,525
But I will warn you.
It's only sugar water.

520
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,932
Sugar water?

521
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,061
I don't know how to make a vaccine.

522
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:41,663
You see, I'm not really a virologist.

523
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,403
- The truth is, this place gives me the creeps.
- What?

524
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:49,504
You can check out anytime you like,
but you can never leave.

525
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,550
No! No!
Don't leave me! Jarod!

you didn't really infect him?
- <i>[Shouting Continues]</i>

531
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:11,529
Nah. Why don't you do it?
In 48 hours.

<i>Help.! Please.!</i>

- After the police get this.
- <i>Help me.!</i>

<i>Oh, God, help me.!</i>

<i>Jarod.! Jarod.!</i>

538
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,859
- What is that smell?
- I can't smell.

539
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,828
Go left.
You take that room.

540
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:48,938
Good morning, class.

541
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:53,137
Today's lesson takes us into
the fascinating world of cockroaches.

542
00:41:53,212 --> 00:41:56,943
- Nothing. He's gone.
- Yes, but not forgotten.

543
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,781
- [Groans]
- This is a bug motel.

544
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,253
When the hormones
off a roach's body...

545
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:06,120
<i>which is the wet stuff</i>
<i>you just walked through...</i>

546
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,991
<i>combines with the sticky stuff inside</i>
<i>of the box, which you are standing in...</i>

547
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:12,826
it forms a bond...

548
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,662
which is stronger than epoxy.

549
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,328
Welcome to the world's
largest bug motel.

550
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,135
You son of a bitch.

551
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,473
Enjoy your stay.
Class dismissed.

552
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,536
I'm stuck.

Chivas on the rocks.
One ice cube.

556
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,769
Clever way of contacting me, Sydney.

557
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,179
No one at the Centre
would've ever known what this meant.

558
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:10,018
I had to see you face-to-face.

559
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,318
Did Miss Parker take the bait?

560
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:15,849
Presumably.

561
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,862
I have to ask you for something.

562
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,595
You're in no position
to ask me for anything.

563
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,931
Not even your forgiveness?

564
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,934
- What?
- For keeping you in the Centre.

565
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,941
For the lies all these years.

566
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,904
Did you send me this?

567
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,349
No, I did not.

568
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,390
Parker did with your name on it.

569
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,926
- What is it?
- <i>Reminders.</i>

570
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:54,728
Issues I must take up
with myself...

571
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,791
God...

572
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,227
and with you.

573
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:19,386
- It's too late.
- I come to you with an olive branch.

574
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:26,156
All right.
You want my forgiveness?

575
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,825
Then tell me what happened
to my mom and dad.

576
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,397
I can't.
I don't know the truth.

577
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:38,170
Then you and the Centre
will never get me back.

578
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:43,237
And I can't forgive you, Sydney.
I can't forgive myself.

Where will you go now?

00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:29,394
I'm starting a new job.
