498
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:27,497
Thank you.

499
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:29,509
- Say bye-bye, sweetie.

<i>[Sydney] Broots has circumvented</i>
<i>the security sensors.</i>

502
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:42,252
<i>We have 10 minutes.</i>

503
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:46,885
<i>Let's just take a closer look at those files</i>
<i>and get the hell out ofhere.</i>

504
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:53,798
It's all gone.

505
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,560
Raines.

506
00:44:56,637 --> 00:44:59,299

<i>No. If Raines knew we found those files...</i>

507
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:01,307
we'd be dead.

508
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:05,503
Well, if he didn't
take them, who did?
