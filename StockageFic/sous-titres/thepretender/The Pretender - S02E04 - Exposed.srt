1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,101
Previously on the pretender

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:06,601
I guess your mother never told your about this place.

3
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,402
No.

4
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:13,503
She came here exactly the same every year.

5
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:15,504
She loved the spring.

6
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,405
You were in love with her, weren't you?

7
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:20,506
Yes. There's part of her she kept hidden.

8
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,407
Mr. Lyle shows up, your father disappears.

9
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,208
It's too coincidental to be just a coincidence.

10
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,709
what is it? Jarod.

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,910
I don't like to be watched.

12
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:56,211
So you're drawing with indicates.

13
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:58,812
Or would you like me to leave?

14
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:01,313
No, not you Sydney.

15
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,114
Them.

16
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,215
They record everything, don't they?

17
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,616
Everywhere I go.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,217
Every thing I do, every word I say.

19
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:14,318
Shut them off, Sydney. Shut the cameras off.

20
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,919
I don't control them, Jarod.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,320
-Just ignore them.
-But I can't.

22
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,521
Won't you understand?

23
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:25,222
I can feel them on all the time.

24
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:26,723
There's nothing I can do, Jarod.

25
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:28,524
It's not fair.

26
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,025
Turn them off.

27
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,526
-Jarod, no. Stop.
-Guys turn them off.

28
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:38,827
Okay, smile at the camera.

29
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,328
Alright, well done, kids.

30
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,529
Ooh

31
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,629
Where are those parents who don't need them.

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,130
Hey, how are you folks doing? You know we've got special going...Um...for extra copies for gramma, granppa?

33
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,431
Do I look like I drive a mini lamb

34
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,132
You know this man?

35
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,033
Yes, Sure. That's Jarod...adams. Yeah.

36
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,634
He worked here a couple of weeks.

37
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,235
Good guy, give me this.

38
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,136
Hard woman.

39
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,337
You know where he is now?

40
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:17,638
Nope. But he did tell me that someone would be by to pick this up.

41
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,039
Right here.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,740
I'm someone.

43
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:27,541
This is Manhattan.

44
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,142
This is extortion.

45
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,543
Oh, come on. This is Manhattan.

46
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:44,744
Your parents must be very proud.

47
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:45,645
Excuse me.

48
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,246
Ah, this is a ... viewer

49
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:04,747
Oh view master with no reel.

50
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:06,448
Tragically some bought it.

51
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,449
Why tragically?

52
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,350
Because it means I'll be forced to listen to you attach some great set me out of meaning to that toy.

53
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:16,151
What I think the distress of your father's disappearance is starting to get to you.

54
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,252
The only thing getting to me is Jarod.

55
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:20,053
You should consider a vacation.

56
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,954
My help just said, am I?

57
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,955
So we put a bullet in Jarod.... But I can't do that now, can I?

58
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:28,556
Because I don't know where he is, do I?

59
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,557
Say cheese.

60
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,358
That's rap./Let's rest. Sounds great.

61
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,159
Hohoho, great gig.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,360
She'll be shooting public

63
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:30,561
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

64
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,262
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

65
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:42,263
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 4
Exposed

66
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:02,964
Too pasty.

67
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,865
Not pasty enough.

68
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,466
Get her a treater.

69
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,167
I didn't know shall I dig her.

70
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:13,268
Darrin, don't you think that's a little harsh?

71
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,569
Harsh? From an agent?

72
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,770
Brian, it's a modelling firm, not a halfway house form of a prom queen.

73
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,971
-Mr Faxon.
-Jarod.

74
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:26,372
Brian, I assumed you've seen Jarod.

75
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:27,573
Very impressive.

76
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,274
No. It's exceptional.

77
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:35,075
You've obviously worked the Marsks, Elvton, Payne, Newton...Their influence is unmistakable

78
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,676
Hey, you enjoyed the books quite a bit.

79
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:39,377
The books. Yes, it's very...

80
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:42,678
Your schedule of the shoot for Cindy Thomas portfolio at eleven thirty.

81
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,779
I haven't met her yet, but I heard she is...exceptional.

82
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Uh, she is still very raw, but her potential is amazing.

83
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:53,481
And so far no photographer has captured the true look,

84
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:59,482
the illusive quality will make her the next of ... her.

85
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:02,782
Kimberly Green.

86
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:05,283
She died of a car accident, right?

87
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,884
That's the offcial version.

88
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:08,885
Was it something else?

89
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,386
A man was stalking Kimberly.

90
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,287
We think she drove in the river by accident.

91
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,288
There's no doubt in my mind he killed her.

92
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,989
Her body was never found.

93
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,890
Then they'll never catch the stalker.

94
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,491
Yeah, still out there somewhere.

95
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,592
Oh, Brian, I need you do uh...

96
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,793
I used to have the entire thunder birds collection on reels for this.

97
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:44,994
Thunder birds?

98
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:45,495
Yeah.

99
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:50,096
Oh it's like star wars only little talking puppy heads.

100
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:51,597
Kind of like your old birds?

101
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,198
Only raffles but the line was busy.

102
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,899
What's on the phone ... Thomas?

103
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Your father's vacation home.

104
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:02,101
I spoke to his house boy, who for six years has spoke perfect English but today

105
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:05,302
When I asked if he see my father, he couldn't understand the damn word.

106
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:08,103
He will come back.

107
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:11,404
So?

108
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:15,105
Oh, ah, this package came for you.

109
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,206
For me, and, it's moving.

110
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,207
Jarod.

111
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,708
Oh, that is Mrs. Paul.

112
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,909
So much for your empty view master.

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,710
Here, you two bound.

114
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:37,711
Miss Parker.

115
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,512
Where's daddy?

116
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:59,413
He leaves toy mad me.

117
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,314
Don't be Jarod.

118
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,815
Mr. Lyle.

119
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,116
Miss Parker, I swear we had an appointment in my office thirty minute ago.

120
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:10,617
A ... met a rose. Unfortunately, it was a false lead on Jarod.

121
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,418
Um, it's too bad.

122
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,319
So we came ... again.

123
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
In New York, I believe.

124
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,021
He's already left his last locale when we arrived.

125
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,822
Any clue as where he may be going?

126
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:24,523
I saw nothing that could be interpreted in that manner.

127
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,324
How unfortunate!

128
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:29,125
Got it better.

129
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,826
I'm going out.

130
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:41,827
Anyone asks where I am,

131
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:43,928
lie.

132
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,429
You look great, Cindy.

133
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,430
Fantastic.

134
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,231
Ah, extraordinary.

135
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,632
Look, it's great.

136
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:56,733
Great.

137
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,534
Relax. Have fun.

138
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:05,835
Be kid.

139
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,336
But...It supposed to be sexy and provoketive.

140
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:12,037
We are selling you now, so be...you.

141
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,538
Okey, why not?

142
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,438
Say cheese.

143
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,939
Hey, ah, that's it.

144
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,640
That's what I want, you great.

145
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:30,141
You can go home now.

146
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:36,542
That was a little ridiculous, but that was a lot of fun, thank you.

147
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:42,143
Jarod, that black shot just maybe become around the next stage's catalog.

148
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:44,844
Exception, couldn't agree with Brian more.

149
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:49,945
I am curious that where the hell did you come up with that technic.

150
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:52,446
Happy Faces Photo Phun. Excuse me.

151
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:04,847
Hello?

152
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:08,548
Hey, excuse me, my name is Jarod.

153
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:12,849
Excuse me.

154
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,750
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

155
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:18,751
No...problem. I was just...working.

156
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,252
Um, a beautiful lady.

157
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:25,053
I bet people would pay money to see that.

158
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,454
Just, just ah...experimenting.

159
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,855
No flaws now.

160
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:35,456
But to me it's the flaws make the face interesting.

161
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,757
There are some photographer like youself inside.

162
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:42,558
I am a photo-enhancer.

163
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,259
But I thought I saw you taking pictures in studio.

164
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Now I am used to having a camera..on me.

165
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,261
But lot of people may not feel that way.

166
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:53,862
I...told you I am...not a shooter.

167
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:56,763
Okey, it must be someone else like you.

168
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:59,864
Have a nice day, you, it was nice to meet you.

169
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,565
And I am telling you, Cindy.

170
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,866
Miami has the best donut.

171
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:30,667
Come on. Humid food and stun crabs. maybe, but donut?

172
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:32,668
I had my first donut when I was here.

173
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,469
It was a long story.

174
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,670
You are idiot. This is a great town.

175
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,971
Police just walk around just take everything in.

176
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,972
And what happened to Kimberly.

177
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:46,473
You two are friends?

178
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:49,874
As much as she let me. She is a pretty quiet person.

179
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,975
Won't close to anybody except her assistant.

180
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:58,876
I don't mean to blame but it's really tough to find any friends when you're suspicious of everybody.

181
00:11:58,877 --> 00:11:59,977
Stalker.

182
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:03,278
He made her life a living hell.

183
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,679
He used to send her pictures of herself.

184
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
What kind of pictures?

185
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:11,581
Well, just doing everyday things, like reading a story, eating at restaurant.

186
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,282
You store at your mind of every one of them.

187
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,683
Once gets close of you touch with acid

188
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,184
All she has wanted to be is normal, you know.

189
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,785
I know the feeling.

190
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:27,386
Is someting wrong?

191
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:30,587
No.

192
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,388
Everything is fine.

193
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,689
Thank you for all help. I am really appreciated.

194
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,590
It's my pleasure.

195
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,491
Shut them off, Sydney. Shut the cameras off.

196
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:17,092
I don't control them Jarod.

197
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,393
-Just ignore them.
-But I can't.

198
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:23,594
Won't you understand?

199
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,395
I can feel them on all the time.

200
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,896
There's nothing I can do Jarod.

201
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,097
It's not fair.

202
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:42,898
''Fashion Model Escapes Stalker's Acid Attack''

203
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,899
''Super Model Dies in Tragic Accident''

204
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,498
It wasn't fair, was it? Kimberly.

205
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,199
Just wasn't fair.

206
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
What?

207
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,201
Little known fact.

208
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:12,402
Bob's make wonderful pets.

209
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:15,803
Yeah, it was great hanging string on through boilling water.

210
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,504
get point of one of these?

211
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:18,605
It's about your father.

212
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:20,506
I thought that point was clear.

213
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:22,407
If you know where my father you should tell me.

214
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,708
If you tell me where my parents are.

215
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,209
I don't know.

216
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,610
Find out.

217
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:27,611
This is not funny, Jarod.

218
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:29,412
Now you know how I feel.

219
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:33,113
Happy hunting. .....and to Gladys I say hello.

220
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:35,314
Gladys? Who is...

221
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,915
Good morning. May I help you? Would you...

222
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,916
Oh! Miss Parker.

223
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:51,617
Gladys.

224
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:53,418
Guilty.

225
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,419
Exactly what the hell am I doing here, Gladys?

226
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,820
Jarod said you would find this....very valuable.

227
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,721
It sent a middle value, I suppose.

228
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:07,522
I am old tears

229
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:11,223
You cann't chip here because you have two pieces missing.

230
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,024
Oh would you like a cup of tea?

231
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,825
you seem a little tense.

232
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:19,526
What the hell I suppose to do with this.....?

233
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:23,027
Jarod said a man you have lunch with tomorrow will be able to help.

234
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:24,028
What man?

235
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,029
Where?

236
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,330
Jarod said you know.

237
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:39,131
You would never know where the Chuck's Lobster House, would you?

238
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:45,432
All the women never know the exact motives of the person who stalked Kimberly Green,

239
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,333
I've identified several character traits

240
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:55,134
which all stalkers exist by getting into the stalker's head becoming a stalker

241
00:15:55,635 --> 00:16:00,535
First of all most stalkers will believe the victim belongs to him, and him alone.

242
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:04,436
and attempting to control the victim's life through fear.

243
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:09,337
by controlling victim's actions with fear.

244
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:13,138
And manipulate her ability to interact with other people.

245
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:20,939
A fear achieved by ...avoiding face-to-face competitions.

246
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,240
It's what the victim can't see. That's the most terrified.

247
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:29,441
And, what may have happened in the case of Kimberly Green

248
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:36,242
the victim rejects the stalker's...attemps to control her life.

249
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:39,543
The stalker's no longer in control.

250
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:42,544
And can turn to else.

251
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,145
Zoe, I'm sorry.

252
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,746
It's okay.

253
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,647
We're done.

254
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,048
Thank you.

255
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:01,649
I've been on this issue before but never think it is like this.

256
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,550
-What you call it again?
-A simulation.

257
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:08,451
I needed to get inside the head of someone who's doing some pretty horrific things.

258
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,352
You did a great job, thank you.

259
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:11,453
Oh one question.

260
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:14,054
Why did you walk up to that police man?

261
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:16,355
The strange officer catches the stalker for me

262
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,356
That's a little out there.

263
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,757
I've started to feel kind of weird you know.

264
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:20,758
Oh I'm sorry to get too weird.

265
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,759
I didn't mean to scare you.

266
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah, well.

267
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:29,261
I saw the cop and I figured it was talk to you to feel a little nervous.

268
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,062
What

269
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,563
I don't usually remember my dreams but this...

270
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:38,264
ridiculous one was...uh...

271
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:44,365
I...I was sitting in some kind of bar, and

272
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:48,866
...was walking around, whenever.

273
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:55,867
And...I was trying to flirt with the bar tender...who was a woman.

274
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:01,068
All this time we're talking saying some...really clever things.

275
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,769
And, you know, I, I dream clever.

276
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,670
And then, she turns around.

277
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,471
And it's Miss Parker.

278
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:15,572
And now, I'm, I'm really turned on and

279
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:19,273
She reaches out and grabs me and poses me across the bar

280
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:23,174
and starts ...me on my brother.

281
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:28,075
Sorry interrupt your session.

282
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,776
A session? We're not having a session.

283
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,077
But I'm trying to get a beat on Miss Parker.

284
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,678
-Have either of you seen her?
-No.

285
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,379
Not since lunch.

286
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,980
Oh, no, ah, actually I think she said something about pursuing a lead on Jarod.

287
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:42,881
Really?

288
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:43,682
Yep.

289
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,383
Lunch in Maine?

290
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:47,884
Need trick.

291
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,785
Never call me when she returns,

292
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:50,786
From lunch.

293
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:56,587
How did he know about our sessions?

294
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,088
You think you're the part of the planter?

295
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:02,789
Sydney?

296
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,390
Wow!

297
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:08,791
Sorry!

298
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,692
I haven't seen you.

299
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:15,493
You have a good eye, not being a photographer?

300
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:16,994
Kind...kind of hobby.

301
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:18,695
It's...it's honest.

302
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,896
You captured her.

303
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:23,797
If the rest of these are like this, you should do the shooting work.

304
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:26,798
I couldn't do that, never.

305
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,599
What's wrong?

306
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,500
Cindy.

307
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,501
I found this on my...

308
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,002
He's up to me now.

309
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:45,003
Why?

310
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:47,904
Because he needs new target.

311
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,605
I want you to move in with me.

312
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,806
I'll hire private 24 hours security guard.

313
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,807
That can't make any difference if he wants to get me, he'll get me.

314
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:57,908
Just like he got Kimberly.

315
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,209
Welcome Chuck's Lobster House madam. May I help you?

316
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,910
Oh, Miss Parker.

317
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:25,011
Is there anyone in this ... doesn't know me?

318
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
Jarod's table is this right this way.

319
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,213
You've got a company.

320
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,814
Jarod's here.

321
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,015
I am afraid it's only me.

322
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:34,516
Ben?

323
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,117
Interesting thing, Jarod has set us up.

324
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:45,918
Well police explored super model Kimberly Green's death accidental.

325
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,519
Her sister Erika Green believes like many,

326
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,920
she was murderd by the stalker who have been harassing her for months.

327
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,321
Her sister Erika Green believes like many,

328
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,922
she was murderd by the stalker...

329
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,723
''Sister Mourns Super Model's Death''

330
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,223
My name is Jarod Adams.

331
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,724
I'm a photographer with the Darrin Faxon Agency.

332
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:28,425
I don't have anything to say you people.

333
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,826
The stalker's back.

334
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:34,527
He's up to one of your sister's friends, Cindy Thomas.

335
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:36,528
Come in.

336
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,029
It's not more difficult for missing family.

337
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,130
Kimberly wasn't the stalker's only victim.

338
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,831
I lost the only family I ever had.

339
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:55,632
When was this taken?

340
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,233
One of the fast homes we were in.

341
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:03,934
We had a strange childhood that I didn't understand.

342
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:05,835
Oh...I might.

343
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:10,436
We growed up in the system, went from one fast home to another.

344
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,637
You never knew what kind of situation you were walking into.

345
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:17,638
But in my word, Kimberly would never let anyone hurt us.

346
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:26,539
Yes.

347
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,140
Look, this is the fourth time I told you people I am not switching.

348
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:37,441
I tell you what, why don't you give me your home number and I call you back.

349
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,642
I don't think so.

350
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:44,043
I can't stand....

351
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:45,944
I know what you mean.

352
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,745
I think I would like your sister.

353
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:51,246
She strikes means of survival.

354
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:52,747
She was.

355
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,448
There was the only one thing she couldn't handle.

356
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,249
Feeling trapped.

357
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,250
My whole life, but the stalk.

358
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,051
One for the other. A way out was all she could think about.

359
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,152
I am sure it was on her mind when the car went off the bridge.

360
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:13,353
At least now she is at peace.

361
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:31,854
''The river was dredged, the body was never found. Search party was called off 23 hours later.''

362
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:12,354
561, information.

363
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:14,355
561?

364
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,756
Yes, ....town of Florida. May I help you?

365
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:18,057
Thank you.

366
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,858
It's the only information I need.

367
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,359
I wonder that you want a long distance business, Erika.

368
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,560
Jarod, Jarod.

369
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,561
Jarod. Are you ok?

370
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:48,262
Yeah, I'm alright.

371
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:49,963
Don't have to do that again, Jarod.

372
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,164
I thought you were dead.

373
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:36,165
I thought if I pretended to be dead, everyone would leave me alone.

374
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:40,266
You and me both, Kimberly.

375
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,067
You and me both.

376
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:52,668
-Another.
-Right away, Miss Parker.

377
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:58,169
Courtesy of Jarod, I think I have finally reached the end of my rope.

378
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,070
Afraid, am I that.

379
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,971
I haven't seen this in years.

380
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,272
Was it yours?

381
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,273
No. It was your mother's.

382
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:09,974
Jarod stayed with me a few month ago.

383
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:11,775
It started to make sense by now.

384
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:12,676
What is?

385
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:15,177
It was pre-occupation with your mother.

386
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:17,878
And, this....

387
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:24,479
He told me the next time you and I met, to give it to you.

388
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
I don't know why but,

389
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:28,781
I have been carrying it with me everywhere.

390
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,282
She is a dancer in there.

391
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:38,183
I am afraid it doesn't work without the other figurine.

392
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:40,484
I am sorry I don't know where it is.

393
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,385
I thought this was lost.

394
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:49,186
But Jarod found it...in an antique along with other items belong to your mother.

395
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,787
She bought it one day when we were togther.

396
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:57,688
It always reminded me of her delicated beauty,

397
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:00,689
her graceful dancer skate.

398
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,890
My mother was a dancer?

399
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,391
A great one.

400
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:06,992
She never told you?

401
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,893
I am learning that there are a lot of things she never told me.

402
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:14,994
But it is a ... lesson I took as child.

403
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:17,195
Do you still dance?

404
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:18,896
No I stop...

405
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:23,297
She stopped too.

406
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:25,798
After she met your father.

407
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:29,799
Ben, do you know where my father is?

408
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
He is missing.

409
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,601
And Jarod led me here and hoped that I would find him.

410
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,602
I'm sorry. I don't know about your father.

411
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,603
Only your mother.

412
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:48,104
So, It's gonna been taken any time?

413
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,305
You know that it wasn't.

414
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:53,506
Erika I know you speaks to your sister every night at ten thirty.

415
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,507
I am not the stalker.

416
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,808
And you're expecting me to just believe that?

417
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,109
I know where Kimberly is.

418
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,510
If I was the stalker, if I wanted to invade her privacy, I would be doing that instead of standing here talking to you,

419
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:06,711
the one person that can help her to trust me.

420
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,012
I understand how she feels.

421
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,813
No one could understand that.

422
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:16,414
I do.

423
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:22,015
I told you, Jarod. You are safe here.

424
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,416
They are not watching you.

425
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,917
This is the only camera in the office.

426
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,018
I took it down this morning.

427
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,719
Remember, it's only a special favor to you.

428
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
I have to put it back in a few minutes.

429
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:37,921
So we can talk?

430
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:39,722
Just you and me?

431
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:41,623
You can do anything you like.

432
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:06,624
What is it, Jarod?

433
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,025
There's something in the clock.

434
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,326
Right here in the middle.

435
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,527
You said they were not watching.

436
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,628
Jarod, believe me I didn't know.

437
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,829
You said I would be safe here, you promised.

438
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,830
Jarod.

439
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,631
Damn you.

440
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:41,032
After he attacked, making my death was my way out.

441
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:43,533
Out of one trap into another.

442
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,534
It's ...living nightmare just happen now.

443
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:50,535
What is it about?

444
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:51,936
Always the same thing.

445
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:54,437
His eyes.

446
00:29:57,438 --> 00:30:01,038
The night he attacked, I felt his eyes on me all day long.

447
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,239
As I approached my building, I turned.

448
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,740
And he was standing there,

449
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,541
wearing a ski-mask,

450
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,742
hiding his face, and he tried to put acid on mine.

451
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,343
The only thing I registered was eyes.

452
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:18,744
Tell me about it.

453
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,745
They were cold,

454
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:24,346
had no feeling.

455
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:27,847
Was there any place that you felt safe?

456
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:28,848
Home.

457
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:31,249
And the Agency.

458
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,650
But you know at the end I thought I was being watched even there.

459
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,151
I think I was just being paranoea.

460
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,152
I don't think so.

461
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,053
The public doesn't know who Cindy Thomas is.

462
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:46,254
But the stalker does.

463
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,155
You think he's access to the Agency?

464
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:48,856
I don't know.

465
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:51,157
But I need your help to find out.

466
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,158
I need you to help me find those eyes.

467
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,159
No, Jarod.

468
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,060
It's the only way out of this trap.

469
00:30:58,661 --> 00:30:59,661
Trust me.

470
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,562
Together we will win.

471
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:09,163
The relationship between your mother and I

472
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:12,564
last almost fifteen years before she died.

473
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:18,965
I can still see her beautiful vision walking out the ...on the sunny day of April.

474
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,566
I was on the ladder when she called to me.

475
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:25,967
Her ... broken down.

476
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:29,568
And she tried to fix it herself.

477
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,769
Yes, she was covered in oil.

478
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,970
So did you help her with crack?

479
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,271
She helped me to the doctor,

480
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,872
I.. lost the ladder.

481
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:43,773
That's all she was, always helping others.

482
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,774
Even when she was in need.

483
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,775
Is that ..spring you two fell in love?

484
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:52,776
That's was the spring we became friends.

485
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,877
That's what we were for many years.

486
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:58,978
She would come up to the end of every April,

487
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,879
spend the first two weeks.

488
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,580
and that for thoses weeks of joy.

489
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:08,281
It may sound cony but this is simple thing she loved.

490
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:11,382
Gathering flowers on by the lake,

491
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,083
Watching the stars.

492
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,984
Catherine had a non-quenchable zest for life.

493
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:20,485
A sparkle, until,

494
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,586
She met my father?

495
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:26,687
Oh, at first she seemed happy,

496
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:30,788
but, year after year they sparkle faded.

497
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,389
But she kept coming to see you.

498
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,690
I was an oasis, the life she was trapped in.

499
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,891
She never told me about that life,

500
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,192
only her feelings.

501
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,393
I swear she was for me.

502
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:47,294
It was many years before our lips touched.

503
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:54,195
But I truely believe that we were met spend our lives each other.

504
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:57,996
We can only have what we had.

505
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:03,197
I hate, to know that she was so sad.

506
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,898
She was until you came along.

507
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,699
After you were born the sparkle returned.

508
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,500
You gave her the strength to remember who she was.

509
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:16,901
She was making big changes in her life.

510
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,202
Then she was gone.

511
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:23,803
God I miss her.

512
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,404
I do too.

513
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,205
Don't be sad.

514
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:33,306
She was never sad when she talked about you.

515
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:37,907
That is all she really ever wanted to talk about.

516
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,608
What's the other figurine that went in here?

517
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,909
Another dancer, a little girl.

518
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,810
Shame they can't dance together any more.

519
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:04,511
What are you ... doing here?

520
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,112
Your work.

521
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,613
It's excellent.

522
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,514
I can't believe you never show this to anybody.

523
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,915
I told you I couldn't do that.

524
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,316
Toby you have a gift.

525
00:34:16,017 --> 00:34:17,617
It's like the camera speaks for you.

526
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:21,818
These are...beautiful people.

527
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:25,019
I am ...not...not one of them.

528
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,720
Beauty is more than appearance.

529
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:30,021
It's also about real emotion.

530
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:33,522
I looked your photographs especially the eyes of your subjects,

531
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,223
and I see a lot of that emotion.

532
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:39,224
What do you want?

533
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,125
Toby took these?

534
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,026
Everyone who was at the shoot.

535
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:17,727
Anything?

536
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:23,628
No.

537
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,629
Maybe wasn't there.

538
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,730
Maybe he changes his habits.

539
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:32,931
Stalkers always hunt their prey in the same way over and over again.

540
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,432
Who was there?

541
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:37,833
What's this?

542
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,334
Who's figure behind the back drop?

543
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,335
Oh, my God.

544
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,236
Brian.

545
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:04,737
Too..., no ...

546
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:08,638
Oh, please, send this one to...maybe you need new hand model.

547
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,239
Ah, this is just give me for you, Brian.

548
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,240
-Mr. Faxon, ..is going on the conference now.
-Oh, lovely.

549
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,741
Kimberly.

550
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:27,142
Hello Brian.

551
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:35,443
Kimberly.

552
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,144
Kimberly.

553
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,045
Kimberly.

554
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:46,746
Hey.

555
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:48,747
What's your problem?

556
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,148
My name is Zoe.

557
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,649
Oh...I am sorry I thought you...

558
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,650
What?

559
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:08,951
Hey!

560
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,552
Who's there?

561
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,553
You are trapped, Brian.

562
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:18,754
Now how is it feel?

563
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,855
-Over here, Biran.
-Kimberly.

564
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:22,756
-This way, Brian.
-Cindy.

565
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,657
You can't see us.

566
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,058
But we can see you.

567
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,159
Now we have all the power.

568
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,360
Who are you?

569
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,461
I am you, Brian.

570
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:35,062
I am weak. I am a coward.

571
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,463
I hide in shadows and watch.

572
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:41,664
Because creating fear and others is the only way that I have strength.

573
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,265
What do you want?

574
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:46,866
Are you feeling trapped?

575
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:53,267
Vulnerable? Terrified? Just like Kimberly and Cindy felt.

576
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,768
Are you afraid I am going to hurt you?

577
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,969
The worst part is you don't know how.

578
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,170
And you don't know when.

579
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:06,371
Then again that's what stalking is all about, isn't it?

580
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:08,672
Admit it, Biran.

581
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:11,973
They rejected you and that just tore you up inside.

582
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:13,974
I just wanted to be with them.

583
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,275
You want control.

584
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:19,076
And when you couldn't have your way with Kimberly, you stalked her.

585
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:22,377
And trapped her, and you tried to destroy her.

586
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:25,578
With acid.

587
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:28,779
Then you stalked Cindy in the very same way.

588
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,780
I just want Kimberly and Cindy to be mine.

589
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:34,581
Oh, well.

590
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:38,282
Now, you are mine.

591
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,383
Ah....

592
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,184
Will you relax, Brian?

593
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,685
It's just CO2 and water.

594
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,086
What's the matter, Brian?

595
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,387
Look like you're seeing the ghost.

596
00:39:57,388 --> 00:39:59,388
I thought you, I thought you were...

597
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:00,589
No.

598
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,190
I am not.

599
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,691
I am not afraid any more either.

600
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,192
Relax.

601
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:12,093
Let your portfolio speak for yourself.

602
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:13,794
Don't worry. Darrin's going to love you.

603
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:16,595
I...I've never thought this day would come for me.

604
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:21,196
No matter what happens, I...thank you, Jarod.

605
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:22,497
I count that.

606
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:04,798
What?

607
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,199
Pretty, isn't it?

608
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,900
Pretty?

609
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,101
The music.

610
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,202
How is usual Jarod there is no music at the end of your games.

611
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:17,803
Oh, well. I am very sorry that you didn't have a nice trip.

612
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:21,204
But you have everything you need to find what you're looking for.

613
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:00,905
Why did you give me this, Jarod?

614
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:04,906
Oh Let just say: happy birthday, Miss Parker.

615
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:07,707
My birthday isn't until January third.

616
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,908
That's the point.

617
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:40,909
She would come up to the end of every April.

618
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:50,210
May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December

619
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:55,011
I have been looking all over for that.

620
00:42:59,012 --> 00:42:59,512
Daddy?

621
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,613
How are you doing, Angel?

622
00:43:07,414 --> 00:43:09,014
You poach him from my office?

623
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:15,515
You've been gone for over a month. Where have you been?

624
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,216
If I told you, I couldn't protect you.

625
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:23,717
Come along. Mr. Lyle and Mr. Raines want to meet with us.

626
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:24,218
But Daddy..

627
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,819
Just listen to your father.

628
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,620
Follow my lead.

629
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:31,621
Of course.
