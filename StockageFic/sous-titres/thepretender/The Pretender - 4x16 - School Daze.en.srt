[Phone Beeping]

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,605
- [Ringing]
- [Miss Parker] What?

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,540
- [Jarod] Always the workaholic.
- Jarod-

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,205
Tormenting hours are from 9:00 to 5:00. 
Call back tomorrow.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,271
Who said I was calling to torment you?

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,783
Maybe I was just feeling nostalgic.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,253
If you're feeling homesick, come visit.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,256
I have a room all ready for you.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,589
Generous offer,
but I will regretfully decline.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,855
So. What is it, Jarod?

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,228
I was hoping you'd give my best
to the rest of our dysfunctional family.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,529
Particularly Mr. Raines.

13
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,901
Oh, I'll be sure to say hey,
next time I see him.

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,634
When was the last time you saw him?

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,642
He hasn't been around
much lately, has he?

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,611
I count Raines's absence as a blessing.
I don't question it.

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,738
If you don't question...

18
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,113
- you don't learn.
- [Beeps]

19
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,081
I brought the Triumvirate
phone logs you requested.

20
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,651
Back burner, Broots.
I have a holier crusade for you.

21
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,060
Find out where Raines
has been lately.

00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,569
- [Beeps]
- Hello?

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,132
Well, it's about damn time.
Tell me you found him.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,144
Look, I'm paying you
all this money...

27
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,146
'cause you're supposed
to be on the inside.

28
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,079
This boy should be dead by now.

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,753
Bolton, Minnesota must
be a podunk, nothing town.

30
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,221
How hard can it be to find him?

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,350
Well, he goes to school, doesn't he?

32
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,360
The clock is ticking.

33
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,623
My new trial is in five days...

34
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,599
and this boy's testimony is the
only thing that they've got on me.

35
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,330
I want you to find him.

36
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,838
I want you to kill him.
Otherwise, you're dead.

37
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,272
Got me? Don't let me down.

38
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,648
What's the problem, buddy?
You in some kind of hurry?

39
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,811
Yeah.

40
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,117
As a matter offact, I am.

00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,569
- [Claps]
- Good morning, class.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,571
My name is Mr. Brodie.

45
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,573
I'm your substitute teacher.

46
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,937
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

47
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,946
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

48
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,575
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

49
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,052
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

50
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,557
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

51
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,820
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

52
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,658
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,460
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

54
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,468
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.

55
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,715
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

56
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,152
Mr. Conklin, your regular teacher...

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,489
is on vacation, so before we get started...

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,256
I'd like to get to know
all of you a little bit better.

59
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,560
- Do you know about sex?
- [Laughter]

60
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,237
Mr. Conklin said we're gonna
start our sex education this week.

61
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,139
- My mom signed a permission slip.
- Kevin-

62
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,905
Interested in biology. Good.

63
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,743
[Boy]
I already know about sex.

64
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,080
- My dad has the Internet.
- Joel- Likes computers.

65
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,512
Mr. Brodie?
Are you married?

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,648
Uh, no, uh, Gemma.

67
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,353
- I'm not.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

68
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,624
- Yeah. Does she know about sex?
- [Laughter]

69
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,928
I'm the one that's supposed
to be asking the questions, remember?

70
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,664
What about you, uh, Matthew?

71
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,468
- What are you interested in?
- Uh-

72
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,474
I like to read, I guess.

73
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,942
You like to read.
That's a good thing.

74
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,106
And you, uh, Eric.

75
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,775
What are your interests?

76
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,378
Cool stuff. Espionage.
Counterintelligence.

77
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,355
You know, I could tell you more,
but, uh, I'd have to kill you.

78
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,018
[Laughter]

79
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,856
Eric's a freak!
He can't even write.

80
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,192
- It's all gibberish.
- It's not gibberish, Joel.

81
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,391
It's asecret code,
so knuckle-dragging mopes...

82
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,400
- like you can't read it.
- Oh, yeah?

83
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,995
It's probably a love letter
to your girlfriend Molly over there.

84
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,064
[Laughter]

85
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,578
All right. Can we, uh,
get back on track here?

86
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,979
- [Laughing, Chattering]
- Uh, class.

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,746
- Class.
- [Laughing, Chattering Continue]

88
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,016
Enough!
[Whistles]

89
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,683
Could you cut me
a little slack here?

90
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,591
It's not easy being
the new kid in school.

91
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,994
I'll bet some of you know about that.

92
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,262
Tell me something.
How many of you were born here?

93
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,327
How many of you spent
your whole life in Bolton?

94
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,267
Mr. Brodie? I was born here,
but my brother wasn't.

95
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,610
Okay. And how many of you
have brothers and sisters?

96
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,144
- Does this mean we're not 
gonna learn about sex?
- [Laughter]

97
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,191
[Woman]
It was a child's eyewitness testimony...

98
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,591
that sealed Esposito's fate
to a life in prison.

99
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:07,224
However, just last month
the court granted Esposito a new trial...

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,359
based on a procedural technicality.

101
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,869
The charges against Esposito
stem from the brutal murder...

102
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,872
of a Brooklyn shop owner.

103
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,172
According to police, Esposito bludgeoned
and then buried the victim's body...

104
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,838
unaware the crime was being
witnessed by a fifth grader...

105
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,542
on a field trip from nearby
Woodbury Elementary School.

106
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,963
What's our rule
about other people's things?

107
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:46,471
- Excuse me.
- Those aren't your files, are they?

108
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,236
Uh, no, but there was
nobody in the office so I just-

109
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,803
Our rule about other people's things
is, "we don't touch them."

110
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,317
- I understand, but there was-
- Butts belong in ashtrays, mister.

111
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:02,047
It's all right, Mrs. Warner.
Jarod's our new sixth grade teacher.

112
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,818
I'll expect those back, young man.

113
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,360
Don't worry about
Mrs. Warner. She's a lifer.

114
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,623
- A lifer?
- Been here 32 years.

115
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,961
Teaching a 10-year-old
is the only language she knows.

116
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,161
Kind of scary, isn't it? Just like
being in grade school all over again.

117
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,830
Or for the very first time. Hi.

118
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,103
- Hi.
- Jarod, Rachel Daly, our student counselor.

119
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,110
Jarod's taking over the sixth graders
while Mr. Conklin's in Hawaii.

120
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,670
You believe Conklin's luck?
He's always been talking about Hawaii...

121
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,579
and out of nowhere he wins a trip.

122
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,515
Said he didn't even
remember entering the contest.

123
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,780
- Hmm. Unbelievable.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...

124
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,948
I've got a fourth grader
who is habitually pulling fire alarms.

125
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,219
- Nice to meet you, Jarod.
- Nice to meet you.

126
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,387
Principal Bauer, while I've got you here-

127
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,921
I have a student in my class-
Uh, Matthew Reese.

128
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,900
His records only go back 11 months,
and before that...

129
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,166
- it's like he doesn't exist.
- Matthew only moved here last year.

130
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,174
But even still, wouldn't
his old school transfer the records over?

131
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,234
Normally, but according to his mom,
his last school had a fire.

132
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,542
All the files were destroyed.

133
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,174
Well.

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,684
I guess that explains it.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,393
[Miss Parker]
Raines has been going to an insane asylum?

136
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,728
Uh, the Pratt Institute.
It's about an hour south of here.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,234
He's been going a couple of times a day.

138
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,169
Look. There he is.

139
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,901
- Cue men with big butterfly nets.
- No, no. He's not a patient.

140
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,034
He's visiting someone.
There's a woman.

141
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,406
A woman who means something to Jarod.

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,608
- The question is, who is she?
- [Sydney] My God.

143
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,553
Sydney?

144
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,583
- [Sydney] It's Edna Raines.
- Raines's wife?

145
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,684
- It's impossible.
- Kick the rock over, Syd. 
What am I not seeing?

146
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,753
Edna Raines committed suicide
more than 20 years ago.

147
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,425
Or so you were told.

148
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,934
- Broots, get a town car.
- No, it's too late.

149
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,971
The guy at the hospital
told me she escaped last night.

150
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,646
[Children Laughing, Chattering]

151
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,419
Okay, a teacher's pay
is one thing, Jarod...

152
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,219
[Laughing]
but eating the school lunch-

153
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,227
- What, do you have a death wish?
- I was intrigued.

154
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,095
A tube of processed meat
covered by a deep-fried carbohydrate...

155
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,326
and skewered with a stick
so that it's fully portable.

156
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,929
- Sort of a meat Popsicle.
- Is that your first corn dog?

157
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,743
- Mmm. Good.
- [Laughs]

158
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,904
You're much braver than I am.

159
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,140
I've noticed that Matthew
doesn't socialize much...

160
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,151
with the other children.

161
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,312
Are there any issues
about him I should know about?

162
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,687
Matthew's been a little slow
assimilating since he transferred here...

163
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,818
but some kids are just like that.

164
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,921
- Why the interest?
- I just figure the more I know 
about my kids...

165
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,262
the more I can help them.

166
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,240
[Esposito]
Three days and counting.

167
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,608
I don't want to hear
you're getting close.

168
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,113
I want to hear that this kid is dead.

169
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,776
If you can't figure out which boy 
it is and get this job done...

170
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,617
then I'm gonna come do it myself.

171
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,953
You better worry that I just
don't bury you with him.

172
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,358
[Doorbell Rings]

173
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,806
- Hello.
- Hi.

174
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,472
My son said that there was
a new teacher in town...

175
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,072
so I wanted to bring you
a little something to say welcome.

176
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,141
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Oh!

177
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,347
It's hot. I'd probably better do this.

178
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,652
I know what it's like
to be new in town.

179
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,522
Matthew and I just
moved here ourselves last year.

180
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,085
You said, uh, Matthew.
Matthew Reese?

181
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,530
Oh! I'm his mom.
I didn't say that, did I?

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,659
- No.
- No. [Laughs]

183
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,431
Where did you two move here from?

184
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,439
From back East.

185
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,169
[Doorbell Rings]

186
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,037
Excuse me.

187
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,113
- Hello.
- Uh, hello.

188
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,720
- Hello, Justine.
- Hello, Gail.

189
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,726
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

190
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,230
We're in the same single moms'
cooking group here in town.

191
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,356
Oh, uh- Mmm.

192
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,458
[Doorbell Rings]

193
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,216
[Jarod]
It's pretty cool, huh?

194
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,551
You can see a whole world of things that
are too small to see with your human eye.

195
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,250
Hey, maybe we can use it
to see Eric's tiny little brain.

196
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,590
- [Laughter]
- Mr. Brodie, how do they 
swim around like that?

197
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,721
That's a very good question.

198
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,163
Why don't you all read
chapter four and find out?

199
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,258
- [Students Groaning]
- I lost that book.

200
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,303
[Chuckles]
Get to work.

201
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,467
- It's pretty neat, huh?
- Yeah.

202
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,773
But I've seen protozoans
and stuff before.

203
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,747
We had microscopes in
the science room at my old school.

204
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,148
- Did you like your old school?
- I guess.

205
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,153
Must have been pretty tough-

206
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,451
leaving your old friends like that.

207
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,321
Mom said we didn't have a choice.
We had to move.

208
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,958
- I'm not really supposed to talk about it.
- [Bell Ringing]

209
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,279
Come on, Joel.
That's for my eyes only.

210
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,617
Oh.

211
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,316
I'm sorry, dude. Here.

212
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,360
[Laughs]

213
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,192
- This is sweet.
- It's way over your head.

214
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,062
Oh, yeah? Let's find out.

215
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:29,533
Hi. I'm Eric Gantry,
and I'm a scrawny little freak...

216
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,838
and I'm so madly in love with Molly.

217
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:39,551
[Joel On Recorder] Hi. I'm Eric Gantry,
and I'm a scrawny little freak...

218
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,178
and I'm so madly in love with Molly.

219
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,654
What's our rule about
other people's things, Joel?

220
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,523
- What?
- We do not touch them.

221
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,098
Pretty manly, freak-

222
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,431
Always having a teacher rescue you.

223
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,946
It seems he has it in for you.

224
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,187
It's no big deal.

225
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,695
What's a secret agent
without an archenemy, right?

226
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,524
Just forget about it.

227
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,545
- Hey!
- [CarStarts]

228
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,075
- [Tires Screeching]
- Hey!

229
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,789
[Sydney]
I still can't believe Edna's alive.

230
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,058
[Miss Parker]
You sound as if you liked her, Syd.

231
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,455
Very much so. You see, Edna was
not like so many company wives.

232
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,961
There was something
more alive about her.

233
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,260
There's also something
familiar about her.

234
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,766
She was working as a physician,
right here at the Centre...

235
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:08,998
- in the staff dispensary.
- Right.

236
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:11,165
In fact, I think she saw me
when I had the mumps.

237
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,142
- Your mother trusted her completely.
- She did?

238
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:18,647
Edna, you see, had
many admirable qualities.

239
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,239
She was as vocal
in community politics...

240
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:24,081
as she was at Centre cocktail parties.

241
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:27,589
How did she end up marrying Raines?

242
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:30,455
After the murder of their daughter, 
Edna fell apart.

243
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:33,086
I was told she took
an overdose of barbiturates.

244
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:37,624
I was at the funeral, Parker.

245
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,430
I wonder what's really buried
out there in the Centre cemetery.

246
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:42,630
I've got Broots out hunting for Edna.

247
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,673
[Sydney]
Raines must be doing the same.

248
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,709
I think it's testing
his new-found innerpeace.

249
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:51,975
- [Knocking]
- Not a word to anyone, Sydney. Good night.

250
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:57,609
Broots, tell me something good.

251
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:03,355
Oh, it's so good to see you again, 
Catherine.

252
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,059
- [Bell Ringing]
- Great little town like Bolton-

253
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,569
Never thought we'd have
sickos hanging around our school.

254
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,571
Did you get a good look at him?

255
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,632
- No, and he didn't stick around for questions.
- Reminds me.

256
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,202
Kids are having a big dance
on Friday- Sadie Hawkins-

257
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,512
in light of yesterday, I'd feel better
if we had another chaperone there.

258
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:32,213
Oh. I look forward to it.
And I can't wait to meet this Miss Hawkins.

259
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:40,190
Wait, honey. Forgot your lunch.

260
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:42,993
Remember, I'm working late, okay?
So leftovers for dinner.

261
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,727
- Bye.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Gantry.

262
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,269
My name is Jarod Brodie.
I'm Eric's new teacher.

263
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:51,101
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about some trouble he's having.

264
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:55,042
Oh, you mean Joel? Yeah, Eric
told me about what happened yesterday.

265
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,011
Joel is a bit of a problem.

266
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,537
But you think Eric's all right otherwise?

267
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:04,017
- "Otherwise"?
- Oh, you know, I just worry, that's all.

268
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:06,611
You know, with this whole
"secret agent"...

269
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,021
spy game of his.

270
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:11,025
Pretending isn't so bad.

271
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:14,085
Yeah, as long as
he's not hiding in it.

272
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:18,065
But it is the sixth grade.
I'm probably just being silly.

273
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,898
Hey, it's not silly
to care about your son.

274
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,904
I'll have a talk with him.

275
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,532
- [Bell Ringing]
- Thank you.

276
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,875
Excuse me, Mrs. Warner.
The parking sticker you gave me-

277
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,074
I can't find it anywhere.
I must have lost it.

278
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,647
Boys- They'd lose their heads
if they weren't attached.

279
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, technically,
lack of cranial attachment...

280
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:43,814
would nullify all other
motor skills, therefore the notion-

281
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,624
Uh, if it helps, I believe
it was sticker number 48.

282
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:54,497
No, Mr. Brodie, you had 55.

283
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,869
Number 48 belongs
to Larry Grasso, our janitor.

284
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,808
Thank you.

285
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,685
Mr. Brodie! Hi.

286
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:12,813
Matthew forgot his lunch.

287
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,152
So, I have just been dying to know...

288
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,215
what you thought of my risotto.

289
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:20,353
Actually, I was- I was going to call you.

290
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,158
Really?

291
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,358
The other evening, when
I was asking you the questions...

292
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,334
about where you used to live-

293
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,496
I know why you were dodging them.

294
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,199
Did- Did I give you that impression?

295
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:35,040
Gail, I know why you and Matthew 
had to move here.

296
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,079
You can trust me.

297
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,080
Really.

298
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,410
You have no idea how hard it's been...

299
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,784
keeping this a secret
and living this lie.

300
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,221
I mean, I-I thought
that he was a nice guy.

301
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,158
You know, I had no idea
about the hidden camera.

302
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,388
I guess everyone's
got the Internet these days.

303
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:56,761
- And- And before you knew it-
- You never lived in Woodbury?

304
00:18:56,832 --> 00:19:00,598
There was no testimony, no trial?

305
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,501
Trial?

306
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,073
[Sydney]
How is Edna?

307
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:11,545
As vacant as the Bates Motel.

308
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,249
Edna? Do you remember me?

309
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,379
We were colleagues at the Centre...

310
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:22,515
- many, many years ago.
- Sydney.

311
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,650
That's right.

312
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,025
You do remember.

313
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:32,000
Edna? Edna, can you hear me?

314
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:35,265
Forget it, Syd. She's been clap-on,
clap-off all afternoon.

315
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:38,933
Twenty years of sedation must have
taken a damaging toll on her brain.

316
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,976
But something brought her here-

317
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,238
Something brought her here
looking for my mother.

318
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,906
- What?
- Let's try and find out.

319
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:49,075
Well, there's only one reason
the Centre would have gone to...

320
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,449
such lengths to keep her quiet.

321
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,011
She knows their
dirty little secrets.

322
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,024
I want to know them too.

323
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:58,720
Even if Edna were lucid...

324
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,592
she may not have
the capacity to tell you.

325
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,928
Well, this dig isn't over.

326
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,024
Takes one to know one, right?

327
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:08,764
Maybe we should
pass the shovel to Angelo...

328
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:12,001
and see what he can find in there.

329
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:29,721
[Eric]
Tough day, huh?

330
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:34,126
- I'm afraid so, Eric.
- Did you just get some bad news?

331
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,426
Yeah.

332
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,433
Wow.

333
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:42,267
That's some pretty sophisticated
spy equipment you got there.

334
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,272
What's that thing?

335
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,639
Hey, look at this-
An operative's communicator.

336
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,975
- You know, so my superiors can contact me.
- When you're on a mission.

337
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:53,810
Eric, Joel was kind
of a jerk yesterday...

338
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:57,614
the way he was making fun of you
in front of everybody like that.

339
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,620
I try not to let him get to me.

340
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:03,146
I don't really care what he or
any of the other non-operatives think.

341
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:06,922
Except for Molly, right?
I see the way you look at her.

342
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,930
That's supposed to be top secret.

343
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:12,195
Again, stupid Joel compromised everything.

344
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,327
Check this out.

345
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,706
I keep all my secrets in here.

346
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,766
You don't exactly have
the proper clearance...

347
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,176
but, uh, I'll make an exception.

348
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:27,010
Whoa.

349
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:30,518
- A surveillance photo. Nice going.
- She probably hates me.

350
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,521
Nah. No, you got that
dashing spy-thing going on.

351
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:35,523
Girls love that.

352
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,322
- Still, what do I do?
- Well, if I were you, I would just...

353
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:42,023
face it head on and tell her how you feel.

354
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:45,066
Noway. Suicide mission.

355
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:48,160
When you care about somebody,
you've gotta tell them...

356
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:50,330
while you've got the chance.

357
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:52,499
I wouldn't know what to say.

358
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,678
Here.

359
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,737
Practice into this thing,
and when you get it right...

360
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,806
tell her.

361
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:04,079
[Bell Ringing]

362
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,815
Mr. Brodie?

363
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,825
Thanks.

364
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:13,191
You're the first friend
I've made since I came here.

365
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,933
[Eric's Voice] You're the first friend
I made since I came here.

366
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:26,031
[Jarod's Voice] How many of you
spent your whole life in Bolton?

367
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,610
[Eric]
I keep all my secrets in here.

368
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
[Thinking]
Woodbury.

369
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:12,416
Eric is the witness.

370
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,258
Mrs. Warner, have you seen Eric Gantry?

371
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,564
He was talking to the janitor a few minutes
ago. Then I saw him walking home.

372
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:30,503
- Damn it.
- Mr. Brodie!

373
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:53,253
This is Agent X-4 checking in.

374
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,278
Eric! Eric!

375
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,316
[Tires Screeching]

376
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,492
Eric! Eric!

377
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,963
What happened?
Where's Eric?

378
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:32,899
I was trying to help the kid.

379
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:38,964
- You're a U.S. marshal.
- There's a leak inside Witness Protection.

380
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,271
I was just about to pull Eric in.

381
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:44,312
- They're gonna kill him 
if you don't stop them.
- Who?

382
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,042
- Who shot you?
- Didn't see him.

383
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:49,607
Gotta be Esposito's inside man.

384
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:52,210
You hang on.
I'm going to get some help.

385
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,051
Save Eric. The killer knows where he lives.

386
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,092
Don't let him go home, Jarod.

387
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,559
Don't let him go home.

388
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,164
- Operative's communicator.
- So my superiors can contact me.

389
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:13,241
[Beeping]

390
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:37,729
[Beeping]

391
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:04,056
- [Muffled Cries]
- Shh, shh. It's me. Come on.

392
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:06,959
Back to my house.
Let's get your mom.

393
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,726
When I heard that animal
got out, I was, uh- I was so scared.

394
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,563
But then Witness Protection called
and they said not to worry...

395
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:16,035
that they were sending someone
out to keep an eye on us.

396
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:20,974
The janitor. Esposito's man
already got to him.

397
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,806
My God.

398
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:25,574
They gave me a number to call
in case of an emergency.

399
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:28,582
You can't. There's a leak
inside the agency.

400
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,641
It's not safe.

401
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,552
Okay. Okay, so what do we do?
We call the police?

402
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:35,988
My gut says that we stay
under everybody's radar-

403
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,992
at least for tonight.

404
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,994
Sit down and try to relax.

405
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:45,394
Mr. Brodie, I am so, so sorry...

406
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:48,163
that I lied in class when you asked
who's lived here a long time.

407
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:51,263
I mean, they told me
that sometimes I had to lie.

408
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,535
- It's not like I wanted to.
- Eric-

409
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,577
You did the right thing.

410
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:10,125
- Mom, I'm done.
- Okay, honey.

411
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:13,923
Hey. There's eight cartons
of ice cream in the freezer.

412
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,931
After your homework.

413
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,731
- He's a terrific kid.
- Yeah.

414
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,708
You two have been through a lot.

415
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:32,042
Yeah, but he's just a boy,
and he deserves a childhood...

416
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:34,082
surrounded by family and friends...

417
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,583
and instead he was hustled away
in the middle of the night...

418
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,620
taken away from everything.

419
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,951
It's not fair.

420
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:43,787
I know.

421
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:46,123
At least he has his mother
to take care of him.

422
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:49,653
My little man. I don't deserve him. 
I really don't.

423
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,134
Saw the murder-
His class was going on a field trip...

424
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:57,434
and Eric woke up with some sniffles
and a fever coming on...

425
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,565
and I really should have
kept him home...

426
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,575
but I didn't.

427
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:05,340
- See, I had made plans that day.
- What happened wasn't your fault.

428
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:08,749
I am his mother.

429
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:12,116
I'm supposed to keep him
safe and happy, and he's neither.

430
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:14,121
And the worst part is...

431
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:18,421
that once the new trial starts,
it's gonna start all over again.

432
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:25,428
[Sydney]
Quietly, Angelo.

433
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,731
I'm taking you to see
a friend of mine- Edna.

434
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:32,501
- Sydney's friend dead.
- No, she's very much alive.

435
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,769
No. Dead inside.

436
00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:44,251
That is why I need your help, Angelo.

437
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,253
Got it?

438
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,324
- Working late, Sydney?
- Isn't it past Bonzo's bedtime?

439
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,563
I have this idea...

440
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:03,867
that Angelo might
be able to empath...

441
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:07,636
- Jarod's next move.
- Your idea will have to wait.

442
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:11,543
Angelo's skills are required
in another pursuit at the moment.

443
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:14,681
That a problem?

444
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,718
No, of course not.

445
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,583
Come on, monkey boy.

446
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:27,419
[Eric]
Mom, what's gonna happen to us?

447
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:31,557
I don't know, kiddo. We may have
to play it fast and loose again.

448
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,761
Mom, I can't leave. Not yet.

449
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:37,600
Honey, I don't know
that we have a choice.

450
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:40,540
- Mom, please. There's something I have to do.
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

451
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:43,737
This never should have
happened to you.

452
00:29:43,812 --> 00:29:47,373
Now try and get some sleep. Okay?

453
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,156
So what now?

454
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:02,526
The marshal said that Esposito's man
is someone inside the school.

455
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:04,690
I find him before he finds us.

you're married to has kept you
doped up for the last 20 years.

459
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,728
Why? What did you know?

460
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:36,957
So good to see you again, Catherine.

461
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:42,128
That's right. I'm Catherine, your friend.

462
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:45,173
I'm here to help you,
but you need to help me too.

463
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,674
So good to see you again, Catherine.

464
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:50,974
And I know you came here
to see me for a reason.

465
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:55,506
Please... tell me what it is.

466
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:57,609
So good to see you again, Catherine.

467
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:00,416
Look. I'm not Catherine.

468
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:02,423
All right?

469
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:04,857
Catherine's been dead
a very long time.

470
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,191
Do you hear me?

I'm not my mother.

How are your mumps, little Miss Parker?

473
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,671
You remember.

474
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,299
Edna, please-

475
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,139
Tell me why you came here to see me.

476
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:35,050
- Mirage.
- "Mirage." What is mirage?

477
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:38,178
What your mother started.
Work she hoped you'd finish.

478
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:41,224
What kind of work?

480
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,823

She's a Witness Protection

- But why would she do that?
- Money. Eric's testimony...

489

is the only thing that could
put Esposito back in prison.

490
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,100
- Where is he?
- Uh, he's still sleeping.

491

- No. This wasn't forced open.
It was unlocked from the inside.

00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:05,767
but I didn't want to leave
before I told you something.

503
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:07,776
Yeah? What?

504
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:10,074
All year long, I-

505
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:14,149
No. No, I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

506
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,055
Here.

507
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,318
Uh, can you just listen to this?

508
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,792
- Please?
- Sure.

509
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,391
Sorry to interrupt
your love connection...

510
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,956
but you already got a date-with my fist.

511
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,789
Eric.

512
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,791
Just the young man I was looking for.
Why don't you come with me?

513
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,327
There's someone here to see you.

514
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,364
Hey there, buddy.
Remember me?

515
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,300
Eric! Eric!

516
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:15,038
[Jarod]
Molly.

517
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:18,604
- Have you seen Eric Gantry?
- That jerk Joel chased him that way.

518
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:26,881
Eric! Eric!

519
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,784
Oh, my God. She has him.

520
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,830
Jarod, what are we gonna do?

521
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:36,593
- Where could they have taken him?
- Wait a minute.

522
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:41,102
- Smart boy, Eric.
- [Tape Rewinding]

523
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:43,162
- [Eric On Tape] Leave me alone.
- [Esposito] Shut up.

524
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,969
My God.

525
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,805
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't worry, kid. It's a short walk.

526
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,314
- Sorry I didn't bring a hard hat.
- [Daly] Come on, Eric.

527
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,315
- Let me go!
- Call the police.

528
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:56,618
[Eric]
Come on!

529
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:59,621
I swear to God,
I will not testify against you.

530
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,623
- Please let me go!
- Sorry, kid, but as long as you're alive...

531
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:04,455
you stand to seriously
foul up my life.

532
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:07,691
- Get in the hole.
- No!

533
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,698
Be a good boy, Eric, and do as he says.

534
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,362
Both of you.

535
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:16,429
Why don't you fill it yourself?

536
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,348
Thank God, Jarod.

537
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,783
- I saw him dragging Eric here and I didn't-
- I know, I know.

538
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:32,981
You know something?
I don't think this hole is full enough.

539
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,991
Oh!

540
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,358
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

541
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,330
- Good. You go take care of your mom now. Go.
- Okay.

542
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:48,971
It's kind of fitting, don't you think?

543
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,030
You've gotten yourselves into a hole...

544
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,701
you can't get out of.

545
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,405
- Jarod, come on.
- Come on. We were just talking to that kid.

546
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,210
Oh, yes, like the way
she was just talking...

547
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,648
to that federal marshal-
when she murdered him...

548
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:04,084
or the way you were just
talking to the shop owner...

549
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:06,748
two years ago when he was
bludgeoned to death.

550
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,420
Oh. Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

551
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:16,331
Jarod?

552
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,998
- Jarod, what are you doing?
- He's crazy.

553
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:24,199
Eric was just a boy.

554
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:26,742
All he wanted was his childhood-

555
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,835
to be with his family,
to play with his friends.

556
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,403
But you took all that away from him.

557
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,109
In an instant, everything
he knew was just taken away.

558
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,515
Well, now it's your turn to disappear...

559
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:40,750
and no one will ever miss you.

560
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,588
Okay, I did sell Eric out...

561
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,562
and I did shoot the marshal,
but I can help you out.

562
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:49,929
- I can testify against Esposito.
- Shut up!

563
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't know. Why don't you offer her
some more money, Esposito?

564
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:55,802
- You're insane. You can't do this.
- Who the hell are you?

565
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,806
I'm just a guy who's digging your grave.

566
00:36:57,874 --> 00:37:01,071
Oh, that's right-You two already dug it. 
I'm just filling it in.

567
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,782
You better talk quick.
This stuff dries fast.

568
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,819
All right! All right, I did it!
I said I did it.

569
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:16,448
- Come again?
- I killed the shop owner.

570
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,120
I hired her to kill the kid.
Is that what you want to hear?

571
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,289
- Yes. As a matter of fact, it is.
- [Tape Rewinding]

572
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,459
[Esposito On Tape] I killed the shop
owner and I hired her to kill the kid.

573
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,469
Is that what you want to hear?

574
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,404
You're still going to disappear-
Both of you.

575
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,277
- [Daly] What are you doing?
- [Esposito] I gave you what you wanted.

576
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:37,836
[Daly, Esposito Shouting]

577
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:43,853
- Jarod! You can't just leave us in here.
- Wait! Wait!

578
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,184
Jarod!

579
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:48,190
What about Mirage?
Anything yet?

580
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,192
Uh-
[Clears Throat]

581
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,094
Well, I've, uh- I've scanned
the D.S.A. file directory, and-

582
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:56,462
The headlines, Broots.
Not the fine print.

583
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,694
No. Nothing on Mirage.

584
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:02,465
Maybe it's just nonsense. I mean,
this lady is a little whacked-out.

585
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,030
Most of the time, yeah,
but not when she said Mirage.

586
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:07,042
I know it.

587
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,442
- So-
- It's back to the salt mines for me.

588
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:10,765
[Bell Ringing]

589
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,405
Come on, Joel.

590
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,604
What did you bring for me today, freak?

591
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,047
What's this? Brownies?

592
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:22,050
Oh.

593
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:24,086
Don't, Joel. You'll be sorry.

594
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,714
Oh, I haven't been sorry yet.

595
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,184
[Snickers]

596
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,388
Mmm!

597
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:37,797
Mmm! That's good.

598
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,065
Too bad your mother
didn't make you any, freak.

599
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:51,046
Patience.

600
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,446
It won't be long, with the amount...

601
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,450
of prune extract we put in 'em.

602
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,284
I would say right... about...

603
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,550
now.

604
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:03,785
[Rumbling]

605
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,363
I wonder what came over him.

606
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:17,906
Something he ate, maybe?

607
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:19,965
Hmm.

608
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:32,450
[Laughing, Chattering]

609
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:37,256
No!

610
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:45,125
Well, Agent Gantry,
mission accomplished.

611
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:47,795
Mission accomplished.

612
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,999
[Bell Ringing]

613
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:00,876
Excuse me.
Seen the paper this morning?

614
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,941
Now, I can't understand...

615
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:06,216
how they got the story, and yet
there's not one mention about the guy...

616
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:10,055
- who made it all happen.
- Teaching can be such a thankless profession.

617
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,060
Not entirely.

618
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:18,797
- Thank you,Jarod.
- Thanks, Mr. Brodie.

619
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:24,305
Eric, can I talk to you for a sec?

620
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,273
I listened to your tape.

621
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,680
It was sweet.
I'm really glad you gave it to me.

622
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:37,743
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,948
So I was wondering-

624
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:42,856
Do you want to go to the Sadie Hawkins
dance with me tomorrow night?

625
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,917
Yeah! I-I mean-

626
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:47,986
- Of course I do.
- Good.

627
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:50,862
I'll... see you in class.

628
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:00,442
Mom, we don't have
to leave tonight, do we?

629
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,946
Does a certain secret agent
have one last rendezvous?

630
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,341
Yeah.

631
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:12,521
[Miss Parker]
She okay, Sam?

632
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:15,456
She went and laid down.
I haven't heard a word from her.

633
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,458
Mrs. Raines? Edna?

634
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,734
[Whispering]
Oh, man.

635
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:30,205
Now we're left empty-handed.

636
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,776
Not exactly.

637
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,313
I still have Mirage.
