00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:06,036
[Man]
Jarod booked out of here 
a couple days ago.

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,040
I sure miss that old boy.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,043
- To know him is to love him.
- Amen, brother.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,104
I kind of took him under my wing,
so to speak. Yeah, I kept my eye on him.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,809
I'm sure that's just like you, Junior,
always thinking of the other guy.

6
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,342
I believe in helpin' those
less fortunate.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,086
"Darwin Transport."
Yep, this is it.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,627
- This is what? Jarod stayed in that?
- Yep.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,220
He'd lock himself in there
for three, four days at a time.

10
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,424
Paid me to check in on him
now and again.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,731
You know, bring him a little bread,
some water, chain him up-

12
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,737
- [Together] Chain him up?
- Live and let live.

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,263
That's my motto, especially when
there's cash comin' myway.

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,278
Hell, he'd even ask me to zap him
with a carbattery now and then.

15
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,213
Whatever turns you on, I guess.

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,409
- Why, Jarod!
-Jarod!

17
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,578
I didn't know you was in there!

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,918
I got ya, didn't I?
[Wheezy Laugh]

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,752
Buy yourself a fifth of happiness.

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,822
I couldn't get a shot of joy for this.

21
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,675
There's no place like home.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,945
Well, they say there's a fine line
between genius and insanity.

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,350
[Miss Parker]
Jarod's line was erased long ago.

24
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,786
Huh. What's a home without TV?

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,664
- That's Jarod's handwriting.
- Since when do we follow his directions?

26
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,667
There's always a method
to Jarod's madness.

27
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:47,672
So if it says don't touch, don't touch.

28
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,544
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- [Miss Parker] Lyle!

29
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,950
Oh, no.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,012
It won't budge.
Junior? Junior!

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,991
[Junior]
Seeyou later, Miss Parker, Mr. Lyle!

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,654
Oh, damn it!

33
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,789
We never told that
scum-toothed idiot our names!

34
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,798
Jarod set this up.

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,839
Now we're his prisoners.

36
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,740
[Helicopter Passing Overhead]

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,745
Worst heat wave we've had in years...

38
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,475
and this one's been locked
in the hole for three days.

39
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,549
We're gonna need to scrape him out 
with a shovel.

40
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,590
[Jarod]
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,094
I could use a shower, though.

42
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,425
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,434
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

44
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,063
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

45
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,540
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

46
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,045
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

47
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,308
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

48
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,681
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

49
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,947
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

50
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,182
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.

51
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,019
[Jarod]
Life's a gift..

52
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,260
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

53
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,311
# [Jarod Whistling]

54
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,779
Good morning, gentlemen.

55
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,986
- [Groans]
- Excuse me, sir. 
If you don't mind my saying...

56
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,394
it's creepy that you just spent 
the last three days in the same hole 
Officer Rion hung himself.

57
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,398
Sometimes, you gotta walk
in somebody else's shoes...

58
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,457
to understand
what they've been through.

59
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,298
Call it a... simulation.

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,804
Is that something they teach you
in criminal investigation training?

61
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,737
It's just something I picked up
as a kid. Lieutenant-

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,242
Kimbrall. Molly Kimbrall.
I'm with the provost marshal's office.

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,404
-Jarod Stevens.
- Yeah, I know.

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,744
The base's grapevine
is pretty much sizzling...

65
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,011
with word that C.I.D.'s here
investigating Rion's suicide.

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,749
Colonel Dance assigned me to escort you around.
He wants to see you in his offiice A.S.A.P.

67
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,882
- He's a little pissed.
- Pissed?

68
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,324
Ticked off.

69
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,988
- You know, mad?
- Why should he be mad?

70
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,032
I've only kept him waiting
72 hours and 13 minutes.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,331
[Man] I am honored
you finally decided to pay me a visit...

72
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,564
even if it did take you
three and a half days.

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,403
I was just doing a little recon,
trying to be a good soldier.

74
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,842
That's an understatement.
Top 10 in your class at West Point.

75
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,345
J.D. with honors.
Georgetown Law.

76
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,076
And I saw Rambo 27 times.

77
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,520
Captain Saunders here is the leader
of Rion's training unit.

78
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,456
- He was there the night he died.
- We'll be doing some talking, Captain.

79
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:57,394
- Most definitely.
- Your file tells me damn near
everything except your rank.

80
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,761
I don't even know if you're
supposed to call me "sir."

81
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,767
Well, that is the army. Not only
does it promote the incompetent...

82
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,532
but it allows C.I.D. offiicers
like myself to kick around anyone...

83
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,200
from a private to a general
regardless ofrank.

84
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,641
But if it makes you feel any better,
I'll call you "sir."

85
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,373
Would you excuse us for now?

86
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,075
Gladly, Colonel.

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,711
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help, sir.

88
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,583
Afteryou, Lieutenant.

89
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,691
Okay, Stevens, let's just stop
all this nice crap.

90
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,698
- Agreed?
- Fair enough.

91
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,894
P.O.W. survival training
is about the systematic breaking down...

92
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,302
of a man's psyche, his identity,
even his will to live.

93
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,773
It's about survival.
Now, it is my duty...

94
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,402
to see who can and cannot
pass that test.

95
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,845
If a man fails here,
he goes down alone.

96
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,578
But if he fails that test in war,
he takes his brothers down with him.

97
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,315
Now, that's all very noble,
but let me tell you about my duty, Colonel.

98
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,687
Your duty is akin
to a snake in the grass.

99
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,352
Around here,
we protect and police our own.

100
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,555
We don't need some Pentagon copperhead
slithering around our feet.

101
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,793
Maybe the late
Warrant Officer Rion does.

102
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,167
Rion's death was
investigated thoroughly.

103
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,436
He was in the hole during P.O.W. training,
and he snapped.

104
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,875
- And mutilated and hung himself.
- He snapped!

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,844
Now, anyfurther investigation
will be a waste of your time...

106
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,009
and, more importantly, mine.

107
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,714
Rion's parents are convinced that
their son's death was not a suicide.

108
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,553
They can't accept the fact
that Scott killed himself.

109
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,116
Now, it ain't pretty,
but it is true.

110
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,960
The truth is exactly
what I intend to find out...

111
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,958
sir.

112
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,334
# [Classical]

113
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,405
[Chuckles]
Whoa.

114
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,018
Yes, I'm studying the impact
of unique physical characteristics...

115
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,216
on sensory processing.

116
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,089
I would have guessed that.
There's something weird...

117
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,755
about this shipping invoice
that Jarod left at his last lair.

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,424
- Weird how?
- It's such an obvious clue.

119
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,094
It's like Jarod wanted Miss Parker and Mr. Lyle
to go down to Texas and investigate it.

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,502
Maybe he did.
What else did Jarod leave?

121
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,166
Some army stuffi-
manuals, books, equipment.

122
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,573
A- A worn-out Rambo video.
But there's just so much stuff...

123
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,578
I haven't had time
to go through it all yet.

124
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,705
We need to alert
Miss Parker and Lyle...

125
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,375
as this may be relevant
to their investigation.

126
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,011
That's the other weird part.
No one's heard from them yet.

127
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,350
It's like they just vanished.

128
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,515
[Miss Parker] I can't get
a signal out through these walls.

129
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,582
Screw signals.

130
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,798
- Why don't you just point it at my head? Huh?
- Don't tempt me.

131
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,801
- What the hell kind of game
is Jarod playing anyway?
- Hmm. Let's see.

132
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,532
He locks us both in here together
for God knows how long...

133
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,905
with nothing but a bucket of
stagnant water and a roll of toilet paper.

134
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,913
It doesn't take much time to figure out
this isn't just a game of survival.

135
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,972
This is survival of the fittest.

136
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,952
[Mr. Lyle] Well, at least
he's not a complete jerk.

137
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,954
He left us some army rations.

138
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,549
- [Monitor Beeps]
- Miss Parker. Mr. Lyle.

139
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,651
Welcome to your home
away from home.

140
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,390
Revise that last statement.
He is a complete jerk.

141
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,762
For all the years that I was
locked away at the Centre...

142
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,792
and for the three years I've been out,
the key to my life has been survival.

143
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,339
A fun little game.
Now ask yourselves...

144
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,465
what would you do to survive?

145
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,000
I found it's important to know yourself
and to know your family.

146
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,604
Have a good time.
Oh, by the way...

147
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,445
I've whipped you up
a yummy little meal.

148
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,452
Hope you enjoy it.

149
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,353
Mmm-mmm!
Barbecued grasshoppers.

150
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,362
[Chuckles]

151
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,166
Bon appetit.

152
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,037
Actually, they're supposed to be
very high in protein.

153
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,308
Tastes like liquorice.

154
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:16,014
What about you? What are you
willing to do to survive, Miss Parker?

155
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,054
[Gulps]

156
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,394
Mmm.

157
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,341
- Oh! Oh! [Spits]
- [Object Clatters]

158
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,747
A key.

159
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,876
Clever.

160
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,445
Another little piece
to Wolfgang Puke's puzzle.

161
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,590
I think I chipped my tooth.
Great. What next?

162
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,095
[Beeping]

163
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,347
[Jarod] So you've been here
ever since O.C.S. and M.P. school?

164
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,451
- You read my file.
- I'm C.I.D. I'm supposed to snoop.

165
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,929
You're a very capable officer.
Shouldn't you have your bars by now?

166
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:38,164
The reason I'm not a captain yet 
has less to do with ability 
than it does with biology.

167
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,637
It's not easy to be a woman
in this man's army, huh?

168
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,043
Chief Rion used to remind me that.

169
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,602
- You knew Rion pretty well?
- We were friends.

170
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,081
He treated me with respect,
not like some of these gung-ho idiots.

171
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,813
He was nice.
Really nice.

172
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,125
Is it true he called his parents the night
before he started P.O.W. training?

173
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,126
I'm the one who's supposed
to snoop, remember?

174
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,254
Sorry. It's just rumor is...

175
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,823
he told his father that someone on base
committed a breach of conduct...

176
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,701
which he was going to report when he
got back from the P.O.W. isolation test.

177
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,172
I guess he never got the chance
to make that report, did he?

178
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,176
No, sir.
I guess not.

179
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,312
The training area's just up the road...

180
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,749
but I doubt you'll find Sergeant Reed
any more helpful than Colonel Dance was.

181
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,016
Sealy, Sealy, Sealy.

182
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,023
Sealy!

183
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,254
It's hot out here, isn't it, Sealy?

184
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,522
[Sighs] That sure hit the spot.
You want some?

185
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,589
Want a sip? Huh?

186
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,804
Damn, I've been doin' that all day.

187
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,867
- Hang tough, Airborne.
- Don't crack, Sealy!

188
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,845
All you gotta do is quit, Sealy.

189
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,711
- [Car Door Closes]
- Quit.

190
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,342
You can go over there
and drink as much as you want.

191
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:03,377
We'll take you back to your nice, 
air-conditioned room. 
Take a nice, long, cold shower.

192
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,051
And after that,
you get to call your mommy...

193
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,119
tell her to come pick you up
at the airport on the first flight home!

194
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,188
- Is that what you want, Sealy?
- I'm not giving up, Sergeant.

195
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,192
- Hang tough, Sealy.
- Don't crack!

196
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,206
Mr. C.I.D. Step into my office.

197
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,970
[Man]
Don't give up!

198
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,508
I understand that you were in charge of
training the night that Chief Rion died.

199
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,520
Not only that, but I'm the one...

200
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,022
who opened up the hole
and found him hanging by his belt.

201
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,024
It's all in the report.

202
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,992
You must at least have a theory
about what happened.

203
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,053
He went in there by himself,
stayed down there all night by himself.

204
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,190
We were all right outside
the whole time.

205
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,666
Boy must've been scared of the dark
all I can figure.

206
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,430
Let his mind get the best of him.

207
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,201
- Enough to mutilate and hang himself?
- Never got a chance to ask him.

208
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,213
- You here to arrest me?
- Not today.

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,077
Good, 'cause I got work to do.

210
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,342
See, these boys are still alive.
It's my job to keep it that way.

211
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,416
[Rion's Voice] "Dear Mom and Dad,
We're almost finished here.

212
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,789
"I can't tell you how much
this opportunity means to me.

213
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,158
"Ever since I was little,
I've wanted to be on the Special Forces...

214
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,390
"just like Dad was.

215
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,625
"Our talks about his experience
as a P.O. W. in Vietnam...

216
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,930
"prepared me for what I had to
go through here in training.

217
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,768
"And like he always said, the most
important survival tool is the mind.

218
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,004
"I miss you both very much and
look forward to us being together soon.

219
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,477
Your loving son, Scott."

220
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,490
We should've heard something by now.
There's been no word from Miss Parker...

221
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,464
no word from Mr. Lyle,
no answer on their cell phones.

222
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,502
- Syd, I'm gettin' kind of freaked here.
- I'm concerned as well.

223
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,037
You think their disappearance
has something to do with Jarod?

224
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,701
All those military manuals we found in his lair,
don't they all have a survival component?

225
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,008
- Yeah.
- I'm going to send
another Sweeper team to Texas.

226
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:46,415
Broots, dig deeper into that shipping
manifest and all the other items we found.

227
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,852
Okay, I'm on it like a cheap suit.

228
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,687
What are you up to, Jarod?

229
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,490
Some P.O. W.s returned from the brutality
and isolation ofprison camp intact...

230
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,624
others as mere shadows
of the man they once were.

231
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,998
- [Young Jarod] They seem haunted.
- You're right.

232
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,094
[Young Sydney]
Study these men,Jarod.

233
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,698
Help us understand why
some survive and some shatter.

234
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,969
- [Knocking]
- Come in.

235
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,941
I found Cap-

236
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,070
Captain Saunders and the rest
of Chief Rion's unit...

237
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,081
- sort of.
- Where?

238
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,913
Well, they finished
the P.O.W. phase of their training...

239
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,113
and headed out to the south range
for some kind of initiation.

240
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,122
- Initiation?
- Yeah.

241
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,784
They could be anywhere
in this 50-square-mile area.

242
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,759
Well, I guess I better
bring my canteen.

243
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:07,788
Um, nothing personal, sir,
but you'll never find them.

244
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,894
They are experts.
They just go out there and disappear.

245
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,197
[Man]
Brand's ready, Captain Saunders.

246
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,199
You've earned it, soldier.

247
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,633
Give me the bottle.
Take a hit.

248
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,534
- You ready?
- I'm ready, sir.

249
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,816
[Yelling]

250
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,486
- Whoo! Yeah!
- You did it, man! You did it!

251
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,681
Is this what they call
a weenie roast?

252
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:14,451
- How the hell did you find us, C.I.D.?
- I followed your tracks.

253
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,361
- We don't leave tracks, Stevens.
- Call them what you will.

254
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:20,229
But there was a pressure indentation
by the creek bed...

255
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,234
a stone was kicked over
by the outcropping...

256
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:25,396
and someone with a size 11 -and-a-half
boot has a crack in their heel.

257
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,202
Sending up a flare
would have been less conspicuous.

258
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:31,210
You know, I'd be careful who the hell
you're sneakin' up on, C.I.D.

259
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:34,008
And I'd be careful
about violating regulations.

260
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:38,910
This is tradition, and it's voluntary.

261
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:42,422
- Right, Sealy?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:45,481
Demolitions man.

263
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,427
- Yes, sir.
- You don't find that very often
in survival training.

264
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,430
We all come from
different disciplines.

265
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:54,262
I was a medical officer,
counterintelligence.

266
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:58,236
Rion was logistics.
Duvall here took his place.

267
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:02,435
And Walker's our weapons expert.
Different disciplines, one mind, 
body and soul.

268
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:07,208
- We train to become a team.
- So you all knew Scott Rion pretty well.

269
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:09,545
When your training's about survival,
it's as important...

270
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:12,312
to get to know your friends
as it is to get to know your enemies.

271
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:16,186
- Your life depends on it, sir.
- A whole lot of good that did Scott Rion.

272
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:19,089
- Scott had his own problems.
- What kind?

273
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,252
Personal.
In fact, I sensed he was fallin' apart.

274
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:24,422
There were times I even
covered forhim during training.

275
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:30,462
Look, I wanted Rion to make it.

276
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:34,029
We all... wanted Rion to make it.

277
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:37,406
And I guess I should've gone to the colonel,
but I was afraid he'd kick Rion out.

278
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:41,140
Maybe if I had, he'd still be alive.

279
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:43,409
Well, like you said...

280
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:46,975
it's as important
to know your friends...

281
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:49,386
as it is to know your enemies.

282
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,519
[Horn Honking]

283
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:58,564
[Mr. Lyle]
We need fluids, or we'll dehydrate.

284
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:00,657
This tooth'll kill me before then.

285
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:03,999
When it comes to survival, Jarod
doesn't know the first thing about me.

286
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:08,063
Too bad you quit smoking.

287
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,972
Give it up, Daniel Boone.

288
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,814
Brr! I bet it's getting
pretty cold in there.

289
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:18,112
I hope you two are getting along okay.
You know what they say:

290
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:21,552
When opposite polarities come together,
things can get hot pretty quickly.

291
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:25,682
Oh, in case anybody's interested, there's
a tube of Anbesol in there somewhere.

292
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,989
Searching for it can keep you warm.

293
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:32,464
No. Matches for a fire
would keep me warm.

294
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,693
Shut up and find the Anbesol.

295
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,600
"Opposite polarities."

296
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:52,708
Oh, great.
We'll suffocate.

297
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,623
Found the Anbesol.
I bet you're glad I'm here now.

298
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,793
You can thank me later.
We're gonna choke on the smoke...

299
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,860
if I don't get this thing sealed.

300
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,841
I need... duct tape.

301
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,174
Perfect.

302
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:22,147
- Gotta hand it to Jarod.
- [Tape Ripping]

303
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:25,343
They say duct tape
is the best thing to have...

304
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,319
in a survival situation.

305
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:30,481
- Very clever.
- [Tape Ripping]

306
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:40,824
But he's not as clever
or smart as he thinks he is.

307
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:45,764
Few people are.

308
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,162
[Kimbrall]
What are you doin' here so late?

309
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,496
- I was going over files 
in Colonel Dance's office.
- After midnight?

310
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,502
Well, I guess you didn't get the memo
on the colonel's new "open door" policy.

311
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,095
You do like to ruffle feathers,
don't you?

312
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:55,403
Hop in.
I'll give you a ride home.

313
00:21:57,644 --> 00:22:00,010
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

314
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,374
[Animal Howling]

315
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,706
Taking a stroll down
memorylane, Sealy?

316
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:41,049
- You scared me, Stevens.
- Well, there's a lot of that going around tonight.

317
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:45,251
Somebody tried to blow up
me and Lieutenant Kimbrall.

318
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:48,021
Somebody who knows their way
around a firecracker.

319
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:52,053
It wasn't me. If it had have been,
they'd be mopping you up about now.

320
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:54,794
I see.
So, you having trouble sleeping?

321
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:58,031
I just thought I'd take a walk.

322
00:22:58,104 --> 00:23:01,733
To the place where Chief Rion died.
Interesting.

323
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:05,210
You can still hear him, can'tyou?

324
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:09,544
His screams.
His pain.

325
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:12,608
I was here when it happened.

326
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:15,687
It was his last night in the hole.

327
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:18,223
He was down there
howlin' and screamin' all night...

328
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,192
callin' out Captain Saunders's name...

329
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,252
and yellin' all kinds of crazy stuff.

330
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,628
[Groaning]

331
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,701
[Yelling]

332
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:36,706
It was horrible listening
to him the whole night.

333
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:41,876
Then around daybreak,
it just stopped.

334
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:45,213
I thought he passed out
till Sergeant Reed opened the door...

335
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,276
and we saw him...

336
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,418
hanging from the ceiling.

337
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:55,723
He'd gone and scratched himself all up.
It was like something out of a horror movie.

338
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:59,196
I don't know who or what
could cause someone to flip out like that.

339
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,130
I swear I don't.

340
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:04,693
- Why didn't you get him out?
- I wanted to. We all did.

341
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:07,501
- But we were ordered not to.
- Captain Saunders?

342
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:11,738
And Sergeant Reed. They said if we pulled
Rion out, he'd be kicked out of training.

343
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,305
So they just left him
down there to die.

344
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,544
It's not like they knew
he'd kill himself.

345
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:21,553
How could anyone have known?

346
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,420
[Mr. Lyle] It hasn't been easy
trying to put the murders out of my mind.

347
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,588
Looks like you've done
a pretty good job.

348
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:38,768
I met Sue at the University of Virginia.

349
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:42,501
She was part of an exchange program
with her sister Cindy.

350
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:45,169
One night, I stopped by their apartment.
The door was open.

351
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:49,807
So I went on in and found 'em-

352
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:52,113
what was left of them-

353
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:54,119
in the bedroom.

354
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:58,317
I was a suspect at first.
Then the police found a roll of duct tape...

355
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,689
in the trunk of
Cindy's ex-boyfriend's car.

356
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,025
The same tape that had
been used on both sisters.

357
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,430
Or maybe someone planted
the duct tape on an innocent man.

358
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:14,371
You know, to survive.

359
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:27,450
Don't you see what Jarod's trying to do?
Whether it's in this trap...

360
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,489
or at the Centre, he's trying
to keep us from trusting each other.

361
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:35,688
You've gotta trust me, Parker.
It's a must for our survival.

362
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,696
What's that?

363
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:39,959
Parker?

364
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,058
Parker?

365
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:44,330
You think of everything,
don't you, Jarod?

366
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:02,944
What's the watch about?

367
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,183
Survival.

368
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,854
Sydney! Syd!

369
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:12,557
That Sweeper team you sent to Texas-

370
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:16,193
They didn't find them,
but they interviewed some bum...

371
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:20,535
who had taken Miss Parker and Mr. Lyle 
to a shipping container 
where Jarod had been living.

372
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:23,701
- The shipping container-was it still there?
- Oh, no, it's gone.

373
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:27,440
I can't find it. All anyone
seems to know is that it's heading east.

374
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:30,176
- Along with Parker and Lyle?
- But that's not all.

375
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,184
For 10 bucks, the bum
told the Sweepers that...

376
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:35,085
Jarod had turned the container
into a kind of a P.O.W. camp...

377
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:37,089
and that he was the prisoner.

378
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:39,057
- Hmm. Survival.
- Exactly.

379
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,184
I sifted through everything
from Jarod's lair.

380
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:46,062
Most of it is used in training at military,
P.O.W. and survival units across the country.

381
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,760
Jarod may have been
at one ofthese facilities.

382
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,530
Or still may be.

383
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:57,406
- [Young Jarod] I've evaluated the data, Sydney.
- And what have you determined?

384
00:26:57,477 --> 00:27:00,207
It's not necessarily the prisoner
who suffered the most physically...

385
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,341
orwere held in captivity the longest who
experienced the most significant trauma.

386
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:07,079
Then what is the critical factor
to their survival?

387
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:09,917
[Young Jarod]
Their minds, Sydney.

388
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,423
Their will to survive.

389
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:14,426
If the captor removes their hope...

390
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,463
their ability to understand
their fears and overcome them...

391
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,795
the prisoner loses his grip
on reality, self-destructs.

392
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:14,213
[Imitating Ricky Ricardo]
Lucy, you got some explainin' to do.

393
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:16,881
- I saw that on a rerun.
- This isn't what it looks like.

394
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:20,722
I hope not, 'cause it sure doesn't look
very good to my friend over here.

395
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:26,363
I came here to look
in Chief Rion's file.

396
00:28:28,101 --> 00:28:31,298
I can't just sit back
and hope this all goes away.

397
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,498
I have to find out
what really happened to Scott.

398
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:36,133
You don't believe that
it was just a suicide either, doyou?

399
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,541
I don't know what to believe.

400
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:41,739
All I know is Scott's family
deserves the truth.

401
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:44,806
And if that means risking my commission
to get it to 'em, then so be it.

402
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,818
What you're risking is your life.

403
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,820
That bomb in your car
wasn't meant for me.

404
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:54,358
Why don't you tell me
about Captain Saunders.

405
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:58,230
I see the way he looks atyou.

406
00:29:02,468 --> 00:29:06,427
Well, when no one's around,
he's touched me...

407
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:08,337
inappropriately.

408
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:11,935
- How long has this been going on?
- A few months.

409
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,470
[Sighs]

410
00:29:17,116 --> 00:29:21,052
First, it was just comments.
Suggestions.

411
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,714
You get used to that kind of crap
when you're a female in the military.

412
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,588
You just learn to ignore it
and hope it stops.

413
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,026
- But it didn't?
- No.

414
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,860
- And you told Scott about it?
- [Scoffs]

415
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:35,264
I made him promise not to tell anyone.

416
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:37,997
What happened?

417
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,541
About a week before Scott's death...

418
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,375
I went off base to meet
some friends for dinner.

419
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:51,747
Captain Saunders was there,
Chief Rion, the rest of the unit.

420
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:55,811
Captain Saunders kept staring at me...

421
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:58,550
to the point that it was scaring me.

422
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,592
So I got up and left.

423
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,323
I just wanted to get out 
of there and go home.

424
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:08,163
Captain Saunders grabbed me.
He wouldn't let go. I tried to fight him.

425
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:11,035
- I was yelling at him to let go of me.
- Get off of me!

426
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:13,693
But he wouldn't stop.

427
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:18,037
I was so scared.
He was trying to push me into the car.

428
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,908
Then, all of the sudden,
someone pulled him off of me.

429
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,106
Scott Rion.

430
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,178
He told Captain Saunders
he was going to report him.

431
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:34,554
They argued. Captain Saunders
told Scott he'd forgotten the first rule-

432
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,525
that the unit always comes first.

433
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:39,562
He said it wasn't over
between them...

434
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,098
that he'd make sure
Scott learned his lesson.

435
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:47,934
When Scott committed suicide,
I felt responsible.

436
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:52,669
Scott did commit suicide,
but it wasn't by choice.

437
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:55,712
I don't understand.

438
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,341
His psychological profile
showed no signs ofinstability.

439
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,851
Prisoner of war training is tough...

440
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,115
but Scott knew he only had
to endure one more night.

441
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:07,316
Then what could have made him
go out ofhis mind?

442
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:09,655
Something I found in his mind.

443
00:31:09,726 --> 00:31:12,718
You're saying he was given something
to make him go crazy?

444
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:16,630
That's what hewas trying to tell us.
He wasn't mutilating himself.

445
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,761
He was writing a word.
Scott knew he was drugged.

446
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:24,365
Hewas attempting to tell us
who did it and how.

447
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,409
That seems so impossible.

448
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:30,106
Rion knew that Saunders was involved
in a secret research project...

449
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,274
to develop drugs to interrogate
prisoners of war.

450
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,341
The name of that project was-

451
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:38,721
[Kimbrall]
"Abyss."

452
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:41,019
Scott knew he was given
the Abyss drug.

453
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:44,652
As he became more
psychotic and disoriented...

454
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,821
he attempted to tell us.

455
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,498
So what are you gonna do about it?

456
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,464
I'm going to give Captain Saunders...

457
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,168
a little taste of his own medicine.

458
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,189
It's okay to drink now.

459
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:20,521
Trust me.

460
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,436
"Tick tock."
Jarod wanted you to find that watch.

461
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:38,242
He knew it meant something to you.

462
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:41,341
It was my-

463
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,787
our mother's.

464
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:53,459
She won it in a swim competition
when she was little...

465
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,626
and Daddy gave it to me
for my 12th birthday.

466
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,330
I used to use it to time myself...

467
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,704
treading water when
we would go to the lake.

468
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,209
And this one particular morning,
it was early.

469
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:11,077
I took the skip out alone,
and I went way out into the middle.

470
00:33:11,148 --> 00:33:16,108
I t started taking on water,
and before I could make it back, it sank.

471
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:18,313
And I tried to swim...

472
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:20,913
but it was just so far.

473
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:25,394
All I could do was tread water
and hope someone would find me.

474
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:30,559
My legs were cramping, and my arms
were aching. It was terrifying.

475
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,535
Every time I wanted to give in...

476
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:37,836
and to surrender to the pain,
to let myself sink...

477
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:44,672
I would hear the ticking of this watch.

478
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:47,182
And it was like Mother's voice
whispering to me...

479
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:49,617
to fight for my life-

480
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,620
to fight to survive.

481
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,257
And I did.

482
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:01,096
[Scoffs]

483
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,496
Anyway...

484
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,195
eventually Daddy came and rescued me.

485
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,206
But it was this watch
that saved my life.

486
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:13,766
- I lost it a long time ago.
- Looks like somebody found it.

487
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:21,448
[Engine Shuts Off]

488
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,043
What now?

489
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,625
Syd! Syd!
I found it.

490
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,722
I found the container,
and you're not gonna believe where.

491
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,730
- [Pounding]
- [Broots] Miss Parker? Miss Parker?

492
00:35:46,803 --> 00:35:51,035
Broots? Broots, you lovable moron,
is that you?

493
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,042
Yeah, I guess.

494
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,806
- Open the door!
- [Sydney] You'll have to do it.

495
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:58,313
- What?
- [Broots] It says out here:

496
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:02,409
"To open, 
pull the "Do not pull' lever inside."

497
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,420
Really!

498
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,391
[Buzzer Sounds]

499
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,391
Jarod shipped us back to the Centre?

500
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,561
- Ironic, isn't it?
- It's a regular junior jumble.

501
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,570
When I catch him, I'm gonna kill him.

502
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,971
- Well, you may get your chance.
- We tracked him to an army survival camp.

503
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,601
- Where?
- It's in Texas...

504
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:30,305
right next to the container yard
where you started.

505
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,848
Welcome back, ladies.
Sorry to ruin your "R" and "R"...

506
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:45,156
but we have new orders to move up your
three-day survival solo into the wilderness.

507
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,923
You'll be assigned separate quadrants.

508
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,966
Your mission is to escape and evade
for the next 72 hours.

509
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,967
All that you need
and all that you are getting...

510
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:53,969
is in your gear,
which you can pick up at the table.

511
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:56,164
- Make me proud! Let's go!
- [All Shouting]

512
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,332
- Let's go!
- Make me proud!

513
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,000
Let's go! Come on!

514
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:02,044
- [Shouting Continues ]
- Move it!

515
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:04,205
- Let's go!
- All right!

516
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,327
[Yelling]

517
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:05,770
[Jarod]
Wake up, Saunders.

518
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,140
Wake up!

519
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:12,512
Where am I?
What's happening?

520
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:16,678
I bet Scott Rion
asked himself the same question.

521
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:20,018
- Who's in here?
-Just demons in your mind.

522
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,183
- And victims fromyourpast.
- [Gasps]

523
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,751
What's the matter, Saunders?
Feeling a little crazy?

524
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,423
- Stevens, is that you?
- You look scared.

525
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,363
Scared to death!

526
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,264
[Yells]

527
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:38,231
This is gonna cost you your commission.

528
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,970
Well, it can't really cost me my commission,
because I don't really have one.

529
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:43,376
The truth is, my name's not Stevens.

530
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,074
I'm not even in the army.
[Chuckles]

531
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,447
What have you done to me?

532
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,645
The same thing you did to Scott Rion.
[Echoing]

533
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,847
Rion hung himself.

534
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,914
He couldn't cope.
I told you that!

535
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:57,755
Because of the hallucinogens
you put in his M.R.E.

536
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:01,957
Drugs you designed to increase
his feelings of fear and terror.

537
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,660
Man, this is crazy!

538
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:06,929
Almost as crazy
as Scott Rion must have felt...

539
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:08,937
when you left him
in the hole all night!

540
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:12,168
As the drug took control of his mind,
he had two options-

541
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:14,437
either go crazy, or kill himself.

542
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,172
No! No!

543
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:20,273
You knew he was going to report you
for the sexual harassment of Lt. Kimbrall.

544
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,844
You would have been court-martialed,
lost your precious career.

545
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:27,822
You can't prove any of it.
You can't prove it.

546
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:32,692
That's why I whipped up
my own little special batch...

547
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:34,423
of Abyss.

548
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,125
- [Gasping]
- As you know, it starts out slowly.

549
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,294
And then it builds,
getting stronger with each wave...

550
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,339
until your mind slowly
slips into insanity.

551
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:45,374
It should be kicking in
pretty well right now.

552
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:48,809
Your eyes playin' tricks on you?
Your skin crawling?

553
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:51,108
Your mind losing its grip?

554
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:55,208
Oh, uh, the key to your handcuff is.

555
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:58,812
You should have your hands free
in case you wanna mutilate yourself.

556
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:03,655
Well, gotta go now.
Have fun in your own private little...

557
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,525
hell.

558
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:10,293
Oh, one more thing.
Rion's belt...

559
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,632
just in case you would want
to, uh, hang around.

560
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:19,538
- Have fun.
- Wait! Wait! Don't leave me in here!

561
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,873
Wait! Don't leave!

562
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:24,345
[Whimpering]

563
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,575
Let me out, man!

564
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:34,545
Look. You're right!

565
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:37,616
Okay? I did it! I did it!

566
00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:40,254
[Panting]
I drugged him.

567
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,525
[Sobbing]
I drugged him.

568
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,330
Come on, man!
Let me out!

569
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:52,364
Mmm- Uh-uh.

570
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:54,933
Let me out!

571
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,502
How long should
we leave him in there?

572
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,048
The drug should wear off
in a couple of hours. After that...

573
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,050
he'll just weep.

574
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:06,555
[Panting]
Let me out!

575
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:24,296
[Kimbrall] The colonel assures me
Saunders will get everything he deserves.

576
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:27,502
Twenty to life
at Leavenworth minimum.

577
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:31,035
And Rion's family will get a full apology
and disclosure of what happened.

578
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,048
From Colonel Dance personally.

579
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,141
Thank you, Lieutenant.
And I have a feeling...

580
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:37,379
those bars of yours
won't be long in coming.

581
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,048
You know, I don't know
your rank, Jarod...

582
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,614
but I am honored to call you "sir."

583
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,392
Thank you.

584
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,559
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to practice some of those...

585
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,000
escape and evasion skills
I've learned here.

586
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,402
Good luck.

587
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,781
[Phone Ringing]

588
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,080
- What?
- [Jarod] Aside from the chipped molar...

589
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,953
- it sounds like you survived.
- No thanks to you.

590
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,254
Actually, everything you needed
was there all along.

591
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,261
All you had to do
was open your eyes and see.

592
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:23,797
What exactly was it
I was supposed to see?

593
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:26,335
That survival comes down
to knowing the difference...

594
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:29,428
between your friends
and your enemies.

595
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,440
I suppose you're trying
to tell me that...

596
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,942
Lyle is my enemy
and you're my friend.

597
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,376
Maybe. And you have to be willing...

598
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:39,244
to do whatever it takes to survive.

599
00:42:39,315 --> 00:42:41,613
You can sure bet that Lyle will.

600
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,777
[Line Disconnects]

601
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,094
[Gunfire]

602
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:56,394
