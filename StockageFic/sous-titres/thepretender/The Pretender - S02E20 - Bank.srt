1
00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:04,119
I want a list of people who are on that bus with Jarod.

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,519
The uh... bus company says they can't disclose passenger identification.

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,639
The bus company says.

4
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:12,538
You are truly pitiful.

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:17,234
Well, yeah, they have certain privacy regulations, there's a certain protocol that we have to follow.

6
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,235
Daddy?

7
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:19,436
Daddy?

8
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:20,795
Well, are you gonna invite me in?

9
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:23,094
-Hello?
-Of course.

10
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,195
Hello? Miss Parker?

11
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,018
Come in.

12
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,258
I like what you've done with the place.

13
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,659
Your mother would love it.

14
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,355
Oh, that is special.

15
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:41,639
Is that new?

16
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,275
It was a gift

17
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:47,213
when I graduated college from you.

18
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:50,052
You remember.

19
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:56,175
When you were ten years old.

20
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:59,421
You'd just come home from your first piano recital.

21
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,492
What was the name of that piece you played? "For Elise".

22
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:03,953
Bach's Minuet in G.

23
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:09,177
-Daddy what are you...
-Oh she was so beautiful, like you.

24
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:12,139
I wish people would remember your mother the way she really was.

25
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,836
They always taint her memory with lies.

26
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:16,137
Lies?

27
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,101
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.

28
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,179
The truth about Mum is in my heart.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,380
Nothing can change that.

30
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,181
Daddy?

31
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:33,938
Why are you here?

32
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:35,631
Well, bad dream.

33
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,232
I was awake all night.

34
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:38,800
I just ah...

35
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,701
make sure you are alright.

36
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,796
Bach's Minuet in G?

37
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:47,374
I would love to hear you play that again.

38
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,635
-You sure it was her father?
-Yeah.

39
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:03,538
Strange that Mr Parker would go back to that house after all these years.

40
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:05,336
Typically unpredictable.

41
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,300
Working hard I say.

42
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,201
Miss Parker.

43
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,672
Oh, this came for you.

44
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:16,174
I hear your father came to visit.

45
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:22,677
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Does it look like I want to talk about it?

46
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,278
Dover Town Bank?

47
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,633
''Something of interest today at 11:00 - "
The secrets to your past.

48
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,034
Jarod.

49
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,722
A letter from your mother?

50
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:59,232
''March 20th, 1970.''

51
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,935
''I am counting the days until our trip to Europe.''

52
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:05,581
''How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world.''

53
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,799
''For now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us,''

54
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:15,393
''but I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th.''

55
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,713
''All my love. Mum.''

56
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,374
April 14th.

57
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,758
The day after Mum died.

58
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,859
Miss Parker?

59
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:51,091
Oh, oh. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Harold Rosen.

60
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:54,316
Can I interest you in one of our Easter Annuities or IRA accounts?

61
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,682
Back off Bugs.

62
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:57,777
Exscuse me.

63
00:03:57,978 --> 00:04:01,178
I'm expecting a package, a letter or something left for me, the name is Parker.

64
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,979
Dad.

65
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,413
Mum sent me here to get the child support.

66
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:08,711
She said not to leave until you pay.

67
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,399
One of the tellers can assist you.

68
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,236
Easter Annuity?

69
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:34,172
I guess not.

70
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:43,921
Mam, I have customers ahead of you. If you'll please wait in line?

71
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:54,641
Patience has never been one of your virtues, has it, Miss Parker?

72
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,654
You've got quite a set showing up here.

73
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:02,157
Well, even you wouldn't pull a gun in a bank.

74
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:04,616
Where did you find that letter?

75
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,559
In the last place you'd expect.

76
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,519
Would you...care to read more?

77
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,359
You son of bitch.

78
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,113
You could have just sent these.

79
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,114
Why drag me down here?

80
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,576
So you wouldn't miss...him.

81
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,202
Morning, Mr Fenigor.

82
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:30,738
Mr Fenigor! Got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight.

83
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,839
Fenigor?

84
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,136
The man who helped my mother rescue the children at the Centre?

85
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:38,598
The man who helped your mother try to save me.

86
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,299
He's a regular, comes here every Friday morning. He's been doing it for years.

87
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:50,960
My friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us.

88
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:52,717
He may know who killed my mother.

89
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,052
And who my parents are.

90
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:57,695
The secrets to both our pasts.

91
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,073
Everybody sit tight!

92
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,059
This is a robbery!

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,060
Go down!

94
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,261
Let's go!

95
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,518
You move, you die! Are we clear?

96
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,319
The are pretenders among us.

97
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:15,657
I was taken from my family.

98
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,399
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

99
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,696
How many people died because of what I thought up?

100
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,882
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment searching for my past.

101
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:26,876
He is a pretender.

102
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,922
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

103
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,660
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

104
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,576
He defends the weak and abused.

105
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,012
Life is a gift.

00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:40,013

DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

109
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:48,857
You are a doctor?

110
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,298
I am today.

111
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
Move down. Move down.

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,800
Let's go. Shut up.

113
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,455
I find one exploding dye pack, somebody's not going home for lunch, you got that?

114
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,516
- What are you doing?
- Ending this thing.

115
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,095
By getting everybody killed?

116
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:09,802
The sooner they get their money and leave the sooner we get the answers from Fenigor.

117
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:13,852
Listen to me people, nobody speaks, nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

118
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,253
- Come on, come on.
- Shut up.

119
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,358
- Everybody keep their hands where I can see it.
- Down! Face down!

120
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,359
Dad, don't.

121
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,260
Alarm!

122
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,181
Frank K lsaac, Assistant Manager.

123
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,202
I have a family.

124
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:35,778
I bet you do.

125
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,961
Put the gun down and turn around.

126
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,276
I can't allow you to walk out of here.

127
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,414
We got ourselves a problem then, don't we?

128
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:47,460
Clave.

129
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:48,473
Shut up.

130
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:51,701
Now I'm going to count to three.

131
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:54,402
You're going to lay that pistol down onto the floor.

132
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:57,803
One.

133
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:01,604
Two.

134
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:26,512
Get back.

135
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,118
Now!

136
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,794
What the hell are you looking at? Check the front door.

137
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:40,520
Get down.

138
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,238
Now!

139
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,158
You have something to say, Sister?

140
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,662
Nothing you want to hear.

141
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,178
Keep that way.

142
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,058
Alright everybody up, move over here. Come on!

143
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,222
It's not too late to stop this.

144
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:06,753
Tell him that.

145
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,454
Now shut up and move!

146
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:16,301
This is Lieutenant Roll.

147
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:19,602
I want SWAT snipers deployed to all buildings across the street and surrounding the bank.

148
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,503
I did that, Lieutenant.

149
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,976
Sniper teams deployed and in position in three minutes.

150
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:26,959
Okay, get me an open line into the bank!

151
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:28,916
Get those people back!

152
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,917
Come on! Let's go! Move! Come on!

153
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:32,337
Everyone in!

154
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,861
Everybody down behind the Manager's desk. Now!

155
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:36,562
Move!

156
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:38,712
Get down!

157
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:40,941
You move, you are dead.

158
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,577
We want your valuables. Watches, rings, wallets, whatever you've got, give it up.

159
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:47,558
Your wallet.

160
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:48,859
Inside.

161
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:52,520
Hurry up.

162
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:53,721
That means you too, lady, come on.

163
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:56,200
He looks like he's just seen a ghost.

164
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,777
He has. And I intend to rattle some bones as soon as I can get to him.

165
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,337
How was it that this guy is still alive and I didn't know about it?

166
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:05,196
Well I guess that Daddy keeps some secrets from you.

167
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,932
Did he tell you about those letters?

168
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,041
I'm sure he didn't know about them.

169
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,516
Oh that would be a stretch considering I stole them from his strongbox.

170
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,095
I'm afraid I woke him up.

171
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:15,896
When?

172
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,259
Last night.

173
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:18,638
Why are you here?

174
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,057
Well, bad dream.

175
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,558
I was awake all night.

176
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:25,382
Hey, you think a man with as much to lose as your father would have a better home security system.

177
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:26,399
You are lying.

178
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:28,763
Ask him about that little gift I left for him.

179
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,700
Are you sure it was Jarod?

180
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:39,842
He took some of Catherine's things and some of mine and left this behind.

181
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:44,338
Jarod is rubbing our noses in it.

182
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:52,213
Whose phone is that?

183
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,314
Hello? Hello?

184
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,015
Hello? Miss Parker?

185
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:00,916
- Hello?
- Give it.

186
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,017
Miss Parker?

187
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,118
Parker?

188
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,072
It's Broots.

189
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:07,473
It's Broots.

190
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:11,098
Can you hear me? Hello? Hello?

191
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,299
Watches and wallets, come on, give it up.

192
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,800
Put it in the bag.

193
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,299
Jude.

194
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,859
You weren't going to shoot my little brother, were you, lady?

195
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,213
I'll leave the executions to you.

196
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:40,242
Throw something over him.

197
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,613
Out of sight, out of mind, ah?

198
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:50,414
Hey!

199
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,498
Leave her alone.

200
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:56,799
Alright.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,600
Alright.

202
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,101
Get up.

203
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:02,938
- What?
- Get up!

204
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:09,693
What are you doing, Clavell?

205
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:10,694
Getting us out of here.

206
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:11,895
Come on.

207
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,096
Come on.

208
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,913
Two armed robbers have entered the Dover Town Bank.

209
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,656
We do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken.

210
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:26,532
She never hung up the phone so I was able to triangulate the signal.

211
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:29,093
And called the Dover Police, they told me about the robbery.

212
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,255
Then I called Mr Parker's office,

213
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,181
but nobody's got back to me.

214
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,978
We need to go to Dover.

215
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:41,018
- Without a directive from upstairs? Sydney, forget it.
- Miss Parker is not just a colleague, Broots.

216
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:43,778
She is a friend.

217
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,314
Just a minute, a situation is developing.

218
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:50,676
One of the robbery suspects is emerging from the bank with a hostage at gunpoint.

219
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,452
Sydney, is that who I think it is?

220
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:57,658
I want a helicopter to the airport and I want a plane waiting on the runway!

221
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:00,655
Oh, boy.

222
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,695
You got one hour to set it up or people start to die!

223
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:06,039
Where is this?

224
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:06,778
Dover.

225
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:08,712
Dover Town Bank?

226
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:10,795
Round up your group.

227
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:31,699
''April 13th 2 AM. We failed to rescue Timmy.''

228
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,600
No!

229
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:35,354
Raines had already destroyed that sweet little boy.

230
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,653
Raines, what are you going to do with Timmy now?

231
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,880
There is no Timmy any more.

232
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:42,516
They'll call him Angelo now.

233
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:47,517
''We plan to rescue Jarod tonight and tomorrow you and I will be on our way to a better place.''

234
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,660
''All my love, Mum.''

235
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:09,979
Going somewhere?

236
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,732
Apparently not.

237
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,152
There is no smoking here.

238
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:33,982
Call a cop.

239
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,300
I need the key to the outer vault door.

240
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,522
Dad, give it to him.

241
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,193
Dad?

242
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,376
This your daughter, Frank?

243
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,133
You stay away from her.

244
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,238
Okay, dad.

245
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:58,456
She sure is a peach though.

246
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:04,233
Your mother should be shot for sending you here.

247
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,951
If you cared about me, she wouldn't have asked me to do this.

248
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,179
That's what she said? I don't care about you?

249
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,118
She is telling you lies.

250
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:14,899
Lies.

251
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:17,512
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.

252
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,017
The parents lying to their children.

253
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,233
Now where have I heard that one before?

254
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:28,461
My father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me.

255
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:32,802
Like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a suicide?

256
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:39,216
But if you really believe that why are you so hell bent on finding out what Mr Fenigor has to say?

257
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,532
Combo to the vault cage?

258
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,133
Only the senior manager has it. He's not in today.

259
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:54,602
How are you doing, sweetie?

260
00:15:57,503 --> 00:16:00,092
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

261
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,433
Why don't I put a bullet through your brain?

262
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:07,637
I can open the vault.

263
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:11,933
What are you? Some kind of handyman?

264
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,434
Just versatile.

265
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:15,419
You know there's another way out of here.

266
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,563
One with less bloodshed, specifically yours.

267
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:19,682
What are you talking about?

268
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:22,583
There is a vent that leads down to a main sewer line.

269
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:24,257
It leads right out of here.

270
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,376
Then how do you know that?

271
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:28,619
I studied the blueprints before I came in here.

272
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,022
You're not the only one who's on the run.

273
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:35,995
So you're a handyman and a fugitive architect?

274
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:37,397
You are versatile.

275
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,279
Now open it.

276
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,317
That's very good.

277
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:58,218
Let's go.

278
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:05,793
Tell the cops to bring us something to eat, I'm starving.

279
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,256
You are always starving.

280
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:09,353
Get in there.

281
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:14,499
Give me a bag.

282
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Come on.

283
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,122
Keep an eye on.

284
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:23,614
Mr. Fenigor.

285
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:25,915
My name is Jarod.

286
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:29,512
Do you remember me?

287
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:32,258
Should I?

288
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:36,616
I was one of the children that you and Catherine Parker tried to rescue from the Centre.

289
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,762
You tried to help me once.

290
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:40,877
Please.

291
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,362
Help me now.

292
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,896
I, I don't knwo what you are talking about.

293
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:49,114
You are the only person who can help me find out who my parents are.

294
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,841
Look you are being held against your will,

295
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:54,742
you feel trapped and you feel terrified.

296
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:58,153
I lived my entire life that way, please, help me.

297
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,961
You and her together?

298
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,217
It's complicated.

299
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:12,179
- You don't know what you're asking of me.
- I am asking you to honour Catherine Parker's memory.

300
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,915
Please tell me who my parents are.

301
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,438
Help me find out who I am.

302
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,098
I can't.

303
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,499
Please.

304
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:25,172
- I can't. I'm sorry. I just can't.
- Mr. Fenigor.

305
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,173
No.

306
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:44,974
No.

307
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:45,875
Hey.

308
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:48,817
I have to help him.

309
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,518
I didn't shoot him so he could be helped.

310
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,438
- Clave.
- Not now, Jude.

311
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,339
Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:59,237
It's one thing to defend yourself against an armed bank guard.

313
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,376
It's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back.

314
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,719
If this man dies, so do you.

315
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,320
In the electric chair.

316
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,822
The bullet punctured his lung.

317
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,839
He's drawing in air from the exit wound.

318
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:21,138
- I need hand towels and I need some soap.
- In the bathroom.

319
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,941
Details at this time are sketchy,

320
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,976
however another shot was just heard from inside the bank.

321
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:38,082
I'm going to make my way to the SWAT commander now for confirmation.

322
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:39,740
Don't you die on me.

323
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,976
I need a plastic bag and I need some tape.

324
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,074
I've got a bag.

325
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,959
We have to seal the wound or he won't be able to breathe.

326
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,479
Cut off strips about this long.

327
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,802
Apply constant pressure to the wound like this.

328
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,852
- I have to get him to a hospital.
- Nobody goes anywhere!

329
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:02,055
Maybe we should do it.

330
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:03,056
It's just one guy.

331
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:04,781
Nobody goes anywhere!

332
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:11,434
Find me something to elevate his legs.

333
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:15,511
He's diaphoretic.

334
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,616
His pulse is thready and he's bleeding internally.

335
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,574
I can stabilize him for a while but we need to get him to surgery.

336
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,416
What the hell am I doing here?

337
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:27,320
- How does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator?
- Well you wouldn't be the prey if you get back to the Centre where you belong.

338
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,279
Oh, nice!

339
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:30,399
Fitting.

340
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,715
You are so willing to ruin my life.

341
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,821
Is your father's validation that important to you?

342
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:44,242
I'm standing here with Christy Isaac whose daughter Kaylee is a hostage inside the bank. Christy?

343
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:46,874
Please don't hurt my daughter.

344
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,375
She's all I have.

345
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:50,476
Mum.

346
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,816
Kaylee, Kaylee, I love you.

347
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,839
Frank, please take care of her.

348
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,014
It's difficult for little girls to figure out their fathers, isn't it?

349
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:02,015
What?

350
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,961
You give your loyalties to a man who fills your head with lies.

351
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:10,042
- Lies about those letters, lies about Fenigor.
- And I suppose my loyalty should go out to you.

352
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:14,214
- And what would you do if Fenigor confess that it was your father who killed your mother?
- He did't. He loved her.

353
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,554
You are so sure of that, aren't you, Miss Parker?

354
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:24,261
It appears to me that the police seem to be mobilising for a possible assault on the bank.

355
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,036
Everybody into the vault.

356
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:27,437
Let's go.

357
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:33,398
How is he doing?

358
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:38,002
He is stable, for now.

359
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,538
How well do you know him?

360
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,776
Comes in every Friday to pull cash out of his trust account.

361
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,122
Does he ever come in to make deposits?

362
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,616
His account is funded by an outside source.

363
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:49,882
Some company from Blue Cove.

364
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:56,817
So the Centre is paying Fenigor to keep quiet.

365
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,898
Question is who?

366
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,019
And quiet about what?

367
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:08,632
Over here, Broots.

368
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,292
Anything?

369
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:13,493
No.

370
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:17,540
Police, locals, no one I recognize.

371
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:21,198
Maybe we are the only ones who know that Jarod is here.

372
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:25,295
Think again.

373
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,682
It's Gar and another of Raines' guys.

374
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:31,954
They're not the only ones. That's Sam.

375
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,696
This place is crawling with Sweepers.

376
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,997
We need to figure out what Raines is up to.

377
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:37,555
I'll follow Sam.

378
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,556
You follow the others.

379
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,057
Wait, wait, wait, Sydney.

380
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,119
Oh God, what am I doing here?

381
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:46,100
I must be out of my mind.

382
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,112
What are they doing?

383
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,578
Working on escape plan B.

384
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,401
''April 13th, 7AM.''

385
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,138
''I have a bad feeling about the people surrounding me.''

386
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:18,134
''If I can just get through this tonight,''

387
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:20,418
''we'll be on our way to a better place.''

388
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,834
''All my love, Mum.''

389
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,632
I know it's not easy reading those letters.

390
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,173
Look I broke into your father's house,

391
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:36,113
trying to find something about my past,

392
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,358
but instead I found out about yours.

393
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:44,661
Your mother deserved a better fate than what she got.

394
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:46,098
You're damn right she did.

395
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:56,302
She used to send me letters on my birthday, holidays.

396
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:58,955
I never knew about these.

397
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,393
My father paid me a visit this morning.

398
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:10,454
Talking about how you taint the memory of my mother with lies.

399
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,782
And you believed him.

400
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,078
Daddy.

401
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,379
I have to go to the bathroom.

402
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:21,515
- Hold it.
- I cannot.

403
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:25,221
These men are crazy. I'm not going to risk getting us both killed.

404
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:30,922
Clave.

405
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,099
What are you doing?

406
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,300
Your job.

407
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:34,401
Clave.

408
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,834
The kid has to use the bathroom, so do I.

409
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:41,135
- Hold it.
- Hey, give us a break, huh?

410
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:47,436
Jude.

411
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:38,415
Thanks for what you did back there.

412
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,021
When you got to go, you got to go.

413
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:46,136
My Dad says that he wants to take care of me, but,

414
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,695
but then he lies to me.

415
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:53,196
Daddy.

416
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:54,458
Why are you here?

417
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:55,872
Ah, bad dream.

418
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,373
I was awake all night.

419
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,417
I don't know what to believe.

420
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,042
Believe what's in your heart.

421
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:16,743
Come on.

422
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,444
Jarod.

423
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,581
Mr Fenigor, you've been shot. Don't try to move.

424
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,341
You saved my life.

425
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,236
I did what was needed to be done.

426
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:39,237
Jarod.

427
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,416
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:44,279
I'm sorry I took you from your family.

429
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:53,599
- I do want to let you know how sorry I am.
- Mr Fenigor please.

430
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,091
Tell me who my parents are.

431
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,661
Is that the key to his safe deposit box?

432
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:15,411
- There might be something about my mother in there.
- If there is, you'll get it.

433
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,112
Miss Parker, I brought you this far. I'm not going to shut you out now.

434
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,839
Fenigor, my mother called you her friend.

435
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:24,920
You owe her. You owe the both of us the truth.

436
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,521
Who killed my mother?

437
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,452
Who killed my mother?

438
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,278
Miss Parker, please, he can barely breathe.

439
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,101
Who's paying you off to keep it a secret?

440
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:35,819
- What's happening to him?
- There must be blood around his lungs.

441
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,918
I need some sort of tube to drain it out.

442
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,034
I have a sports bottle on Daddy's desk.

443
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:43,035
Jude, Jude!

444
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:47,480
Jude, the old man can't breathe. We need the water bottle that's on the Manager's desk.

445
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:50,181
I don't know.

446
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,079
He's gonna die if we don't help him.

447
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:55,933
I know you couldn't do anything about that guard, but you can do something now.

448
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:05,356
Just hang on, come on.

449
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:11,239
Get back.

450
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:20,693
Don't Move!

451
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:25,522
Back off, or I drop little brother.

452
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:28,723
I've already shot two people. You think one more's gonna make a difference?

453
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:31,462
No, please. Please don't kill my father.

454
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:40,178
What's it gonna be?

455
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:48,622
Mr. Raines guy is in a SWAT uniform. He is right up there.

456
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,880
The target must be Jarod.

457
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:55,154
We have to take care of the sniper before he shoots Jarod.

458
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,920
Well, don't look at me. I can't even squash a bug, Sydney.

459
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:02,518
Then guard the alleyway.

460
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:03,814
Don't let anyone follow.

461
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:07,077
Are you up to this, Broots?

462
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,963
No, but it's never stopped me before.

463
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,473
Sydney, Mr Raines would like to see you.

464
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:26,631
You won't be needing that.

465
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,340
What the hell were you doing in there?

466
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:01,214
She said the old guy needed help.

467
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:01,858
Help?

468
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:03,696
I need help.

469
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,675
You pull something like that again, you're gonna end up just like the guard.

470
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:09,121
Brother or not.

471
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:22,683
You okay?

472
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:24,784
I wanna go home.

473
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:25,420
Me too.

474
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:26,421
Get away from her.

475
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:28,899
What?

476
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,600
- She tried to save us.
- You could have got us all killed.

477
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:33,136
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

478
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,999
- You do as I say. I'm your father.
- Oh yeah, since when?

479
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:40,635
You know, you can keep your money.

480
00:30:41,903 --> 00:30:45,173
I cannot believe Mum thought it would make a difference if I came down here.

481
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:51,040
This is because of you.

482
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,821
I can't figure out if you're ignorant or just stupid.

483
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,273
- You listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

484
00:30:57,463 --> 00:30:59,923
You think that little girl came down here today for money?

485
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,903
There is something here a lot more important to her than cash.

486
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:07,953
And I feel real sorry for you if you're too blind to see what that is.

487
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:16,793
Miss Parker reached out to help someone.

488
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,395
Spare me.

489
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,096
Your mother would be very proud of you.

490
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,339
You put on quite a show today.

491
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,622
Sydney taught you well.

492
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,736
Sydney taught me to believe that you can be anything you want to be.

493
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:50,332
You should have known better than to come here without a directive.

494
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:56,479
You should know better than to defy Tower policy by having Jarod assassinated.

495
00:31:58,143 --> 00:32:00,032
You're in over your head, Sydney.

496
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,455
Shoot him if he tries to leave.

497
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,600
I've made some mistakes.

498
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:25,635
I don't want to lose you.

499
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:46,836
Mr. Fenigor?

500
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,059
You were my mother's friend.

501
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,060
Her confidant.

502
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:55,177
Please tell me who killed her.

503
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:00,672
He is not gonna tell me.

504
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,201
Maybe he already has.

505
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:12,895
Could you really do it, Gar?

506
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,176
Could you kill me if I stepped out of this car?

507
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,277
Yeah.

508
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,597
Move the car, buddy.

509
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:31,334
Thank you kindly Gar.

510
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:36,133
Now do as the officer says, move the car.

511
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:49,811
Fenigor's deposit records.

512
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:55,054
Transfer from the Centre Bank in Vinemy.

513
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,761
Ten thousand dollars a month.

514
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:01,455
Every month for the last twenty-eight years.

515
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:07,578
Do you recognise the account number?

516
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,581
- No.
- It's your father's.

517
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,782
How do you know?

518
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,579
You'd be surprised what I know about him.

519
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:15,559
That's it?

520
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,060
That's it.

521
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:20,062
What else does he know?

522
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:21,861
Apparently everything.

523
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:25,120
Mr Fenigor.

524
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,021
What secrets are in this envelope?

525
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:30,122
What is it?

526
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:36,016
It's about prodigy.

527
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:40,735
This is where you came from.

528
00:34:42,943 --> 00:34:45,999
Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything.

529
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,675
Both of you.

530
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,660
What are you going to do with that dye pack egg?

531
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:24,661
Well.

532
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,542
Handyman was right.

533
00:35:26,843 --> 00:35:29,443
There's an access entrance to the main sewer line.

534
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,921
We're gonna get out of here, little brother.

535
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:32,422
Come on.

536
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,602
This is your lucky day, people.

537
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:54,878
Thanks to Jarod's brilliant escape plan none of you will have to die today.

538
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:56,217
In spite of everything,

539
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,515
it's been a real gas.

540
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:05,777
Well, at least we won't starve.

541
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:07,672
Give me that one.

542
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:09,982
- What?
- Give it.

543
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:16,412
Come on, Jude.

544
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:26,115
Jude, what the hell are you doing?

545
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:31,097
Hurry up! Help me with the old man!

546
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:32,678
Be careful with him!

547
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,379
Out, out.

548
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:35,938
Hurry.

549
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:49,757
Mind if I cut in?

550
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:53,221
I don't like being locked up in little rooms.

551
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:56,938
This is mine.

552
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:12,712
Well, thank you, Jarod.

553
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:18,642
Let's get out of here.

554
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:27,820
The crisis is over. The hostages are coming out of the bank now and the paramedics have gone in.

555
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,521
Move, move, come on.

556
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:42,522
Jarod.

557
00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:44,123
Mr Fenigor.

558
00:37:44,824 --> 00:37:45,324
Jarod.

559
00:38:01,563 --> 00:38:03,735
Mr Fenigor, why is my father paying you?

560
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:05,336
Is it about who killed my mother?

561
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:06,337
Jarod.

562
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:07,638
Answer me.

563
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:10,422
- In the red files.
- Red files?

564
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:13,759
- Prodigy red files.
- Prodigy.

565
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,360
Freeze.

566
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:38,421
All units, shooter second story 641 building across from the bank. Move.

567
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,122
Please.

568
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,323
You were right. Fenigor was in there.

569
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:13,616
Did we get him?

570
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,817
Wounded. He is in an ambulance.

571
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:18,117
I'll take care of the details.

572
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:19,855
Do you think he told her anything?

573
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:23,438
Nothing that can't be denied.

574
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:37,232
Are you alright?

575
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,318
Perfect.

576
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:41,700
Where is Jarod?

577
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,301
He got away.

578
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:46,798
Another failure.

579
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:49,151
I'm fine, daddy.

580
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:51,052
Well?

581
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,100
Maybe you'll sleep better tonight.

582
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:01,378
''March 20th, 1970.''

583
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:04,331
''I am counting the days until our trip to Europe.''

584
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,959
''How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world.''

585
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:12,979
''For now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us.''

586
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:17,533
''But I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th.''

587
00:40:17,823 --> 00:40:20,073
''All my love, Mum.''

588
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:41,674
Daddy?

589
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:44,116
Am I still welcome here?

590
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:46,518
It's late.

591
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:48,696
Thank God you're alright.

592
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:53,996
I'm sorry I didn't say that earlier.

593
00:40:57,023 --> 00:40:59,139
You didn't have to come all the way out here to tell me that.

594
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:00,837
Oh yes, Angel, I did.

595
00:41:01,423 --> 00:41:05,482
See, I wasn't entirely forthcoming with you this morning.

596
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:06,483
Oh?

597
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:11,494
Truth is, somebody broke into my house last night.

598
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,138
That's terrible.

599
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:18,801
I hope you didn't lose anything valuable.

600
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,815
Ah, nothing that can't be replaced.

601
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,539
I wish I'd known earlier. I could have asked Jarod if he had anything to do with it.

602
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,732
Hmm, well, I wanted you to know.

603
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:32,836
Can't have secrets between family now, can we?

604
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:35,837
Daddy?

605
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:39,621
How come that Center sniper shot that old man outside the bank?

606
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,837
Oh, tragic accident.

607
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:43,838
Any idea who he was?

608
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:48,738
Not a clue.

609
00:41:50,623 --> 00:41:51,598
Get some rest, Angel.

610
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,199
You sure earned it.

611
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,300
What?

612
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:20,895
I never had a chance to say goodbye.

613
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:22,357
How did you get away?

614
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:25,641
Escape plan B, remember?

615
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:26,812
The vent.

616
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:28,513
How was it down there?

617
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:32,595
Let's just say that I'm hoping my next pretender isn't as a sewer worker.

618
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:33,861
Did you talk to your father?

619
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,172
He just left.

620
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:41,273
He didn't say it was you who broke into his home, didn't say it wasn't either.

621
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:42,453
Fenigor?

622
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,495
I told him I didn't know who he was.

623
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,479
So you lied?

624
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,837
Like father like daughter.

625
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:00,054
Jarod, we were so close to finding the truth.

626
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,498
You'll figure it out.

627
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:08,452
And so will I.

628
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:10,958
The question is,

629
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:15,672
what becomes of us when we have all our answers?

630
00:43:22,023 --> 00:43:23,415
That is the question.

631
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:35,273
This is where you came from.

632
00:43:40,074 --> 00:43:43,274
''Bank''
End
