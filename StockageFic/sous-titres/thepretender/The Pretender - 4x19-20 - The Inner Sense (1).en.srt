1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,901
Previously on The Pretender.

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,269
Enough!
We don't want him dead.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,864
[Tires Screeching]

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,638
Nice to meet you, Jarod.
I'm Zoe.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,146
- [Jarod] I want to stay with you.
- [Zoe] I know.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,312
But you can't stay, can you?
I can see it in your eyes.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,254
[Jarod] Edna Raines knows things
about your mother, Miss Parker.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,087
I need to talk to you
about your mother and Mirage.

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,786
It could be a matter
of life and death.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,988
[Sydney]
Edna Raines is dead.

11
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,497
She knew all the secrets,
especially about the Mirage Project.

12
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,090
[Miss Parker] Jarod's e-mail
said to keep digging.

13
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,796
It's your mother's grave. Miss Parker,
your mother- she's not here.

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,101
Then where the hell is she?

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,947
Oh, come on. Everybody's been on 
at least one vacation.

16
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,677
I swear, Zoe,
I've never been on vacation.

17
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,447
Not even, uh, Mount Rushmore?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,323
- The Alamo?
- Mm-mmm.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,088
What about Niagara Falls?

20
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,960
I definitely would have
remembered that.

21
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:10,435
Wait, I did eat at a "Stookey's"
off of I-65 once. Does that count?

22
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,961
"Stuckey's." Only if
you bought the pecan log.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,976
- What's a pecan log?
- Oh, you really have never
had a vacation, have you?

24
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,912
Who needs a vacation...
when I have you?

25
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,113
You swear to me
you're in total remission?

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,888
Yeah. I probably pissed off
a few H.M.O.'s, but what the hell?

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,696
- Zoe-
- Hey.

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,460
You're not going 
all mushy on me, are you?

29
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,763
- [Ringing]
- [Electronic Voice] 
You have a video phone call.

30
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,066
That's my video phone.

31
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,869
- Um, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

32
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,214
[Ringing Continues]

33
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,240
- Hello, Son.
- Oh, my God! Dad!

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,083
I've been searching for you for over a year.
Where have you been?

35
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,056
I know. The boy and I
had to go underground for a while.

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,252
We kept searching for you too,
but with no luck...

37
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,693
until an anonymous tip came my way.

38
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,095
I was able to unscramble your password,
which got me into you here.

39
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,363
- Then you're both okay?
- Thank God the boy and I are both well.

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,928
- The boy?
- He's sort of like my brother. I'll-

41
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:25,069
I'll explain it to you sometime.
Dad, this is Zoe.

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,241
- Zoe, this is my dad.
- Jarod's been pretty damn worried 
about you, sir.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,284
He's cute.
What happened to you?

44
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,616
When can I see you?

45
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,781
We have to be careful.
I don't trust the security of this line...

46
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,757
so I'll make it quick.

47
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,192
Jarod, I found Emily.

48
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,787
I found your sister.

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,095
What? How? Where is she?

50
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,467
She's a reporter at the Philadelphia Examiner.
For security's sake...

51
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,406
I've left vital information about
her where abouts on your secured e-mail.

52
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,535
She told me that recently,
she was very close to finding you.

53
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,637
She cried when I told her
I knew how to reach you.

54
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,875
I think you should go to her.

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,248
- Will you bring her back to me, Jarod?
- Yes!

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,983
- Yes, of course I will.
- Good luck, Son. Keep me posted.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,254
My- I found my dad.
Um-

58
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,162
My- I-We've been looking
for my sister for so long...

59
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,166
and now I found her, and I can, uh-

60
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,567
Um-What about our trip?

61
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,765
It can wait.
We'll have time.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,174
And if I have any say in the matter,
lots of it.

63
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,509
You're not gettin' all mushy on me,
are you?

64
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,742
Go find your sister.

65
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,472
[Man]
Somebody call 911!

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,633
[Woman]
She's in the alley!

67
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,109
- What happened?
- A reporter was attacked.

68
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,669
- They say she was thrown out of that window.
- A reporter?

69
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,045
An Emily something.

70
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,848
Emily? Emily!

71
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,516
Emily? Emily?

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,960
- Please help me.
- That's what I'm here to do.

73
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,965
I'm going to help you.
I'm Jarod. I'm your brother.

74
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,002
- Jarod.
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

75
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,501
- [Gasps, Coughs]
- Emily? Emily?

76
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,337
Somebody call an ambulance!

77
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,537
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

78
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,546
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

79
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,175
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

80
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,652
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

81
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,157
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

82
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,420
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

83
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,258
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

84
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,060
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

85
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,068
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.

86
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,315
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

87
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,823
- Pupils are unresponsive.
Respiration is shallow at 40.
- Pulse is weak and thready.

88
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,059
Probable closed head injury with
internal bleeding and multiple fractures.

89
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,192
Keep her head stabilized.
Start an I.V. drip and run a C.B.C.

90
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,295
Page Radiology. We need
an abdominal and head CAT scan, stat.

91
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,500
- Who initiated C.P.R.?
- I did.

92
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,907
Your actions may have saved her life.
Are you a doctor?

93
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,911
No.

94
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,913
[Jarod]
I'm with the F.B.I.

95
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,940
- The victim is someone we've had
our eye on for sometime now.
- Why?

96
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,546
Let's just say that a few of her journalistic
choices have struck a nerve in D.C.

97
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,886
The victim's office is in here.

98
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,000
Name's Detective Brookins.
Call me Stan.

99
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,096
Agent Jarod Curtis.

100
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,107
Tell me what you know,
the whole story.

101
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,541
Well, the victim came to
the office early this morning.

102
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,103
So early, it was the night shift janitor
that probably saved her life by walking in.

103
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,843
Anyway, from what I can tell,
the woman was ambushed here...

104
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,910
then thrown out this window
two stories to the pavement.

105
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:36,221
- Any description?
- White male, 35-ish, average build, dark suit.

106
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,422
Got the sketch artist
workin' on it now.

107
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,524
I want all of her files boxed and 
sealed and sent to your precinct.

108
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,195
And I'm also gonna need
an office for a few days.

109
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,610
[Miss Parker]
Well, it's about time you got back, Lyle.

110
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:56,671
So, what's the flavor of the day,
little brother?

111
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,717
Mail-order mamas from Malaysia?

112
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,015
Or cannibal quiche from the Kalahari?

113
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,923
- If you're here to talk with our father, he's gone.
- Well, then find him.

114
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:12,829
[Chuckles] Pounding boilermakers
is hardly the breakfast of champions.

115
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,891
This isn't about you.
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,993
Okay, now I know you're sloshed.

117
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,004
What's going on, Parker?

118
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,771
[Sighs]
It's-

119
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,506
It's about our mother.

120
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,609
She's gone.

121
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,448
- Our mother's been dead a long time.
- No.

122
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,513
I mean, she's not there.
I mean, her-

123
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,020
She's not there?
What do you mean she's not there, Parker?

124
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,757
Parker?

125
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,935
You wouldn't understand anyway.

126
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,774
- But I wanna know.
- Bet you do.

127
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,010
[Electronic Female Voice]
Message voice box 04. Record.

128
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,556
- [Beeps]
- It's me.

129
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,116
I've got a bad feeling Miss Parker
knows about Catherine's empty grave.

130
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,630
[Sydney] You believe
someone stole your mother's body?

131
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:23,101
Except for this scotch-induced
earthquake rattling between my ears...

132
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,036
I'm not sure exactly
what to believe anymore.

133
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,472
Let's face it, Sydney.
Catherine Parker's body being gone...

134
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,308
fits in with all the other
bizarre happenings around here.

135
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,780
The reappearance of Edna Raines who,
after 30 years, everyone thought was dead.

136
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,412
And who now really is dead, thanks
to the bald butcher she called "Hubby."

137
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,548
The murder of that harmless 
clerk Leonard down in SL 26...

138
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,150
because he just happened
to see the wrong memo.

139
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,856
And now, Catherine Parker's empty grave.
That's a lot of strange coincidences.

140
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,399
No. Not coincidence.
Mirage.

141
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,698
Mirage? You mean what Edna Raines
told you before she died?

142
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,171
What was on both of those memos,
the one I found on Lyle's desk...

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,605
and the one that killed that clerk.

144
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,768
Well, oddities, yes...

145
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,835
but status quo here at the Centre.

146
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,847
I never thought I'd hear you say...

147
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,941
"Murder is business as usual," Syd.

148
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,987
All I'm saying is, at times...

149
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,420
it is best to let some things go.

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,288
My mother's grave is empty, Sydney.

151
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,819
Maybe, just maybe, she had otherwishes
that you didn't know about.

152
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,991
For her burial, I mean.
People sometimes make choices...

153
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,695
that are difficult to explain.

154
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,261
No.

155
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,208
This is one big fish I'm reeling in.

156
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,374
Broots, our best evidence-
We follow the body.

157
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:47,715
In this case, my mother's.
We start with the autopsy records.

158
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,880
Parker?

159
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,389
Why won't you let go of this?

160
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:00,959
Because something inside me
is telling me to do this.

161
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,269
And I'm listening.

162
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,508
Her condition is only fair,
Agent Curtis.

163
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,178
- So please minimize your time with her.
- I will. Thank you.

164
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,334
Em?

165
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,533
It's your brother...

166
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,667
Jarod.

167
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:52,182
I was too late this morning.
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,778
But I'll never be late again.

169
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,415
I promise you.

170
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,359
[Lyle]
How goes the world tour?

171
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,294
Indeference to Winston Churchill...

172
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,389
or whoever the hell said it...

173
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,525
"The sun never sets on the Centre."

174
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,968
And I'm making sure it never sets
on the Parkers either.

175
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,529
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Glad to hear it.

176
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,734
Since when is Raines
hosting Triumvirate personnel?

177
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,643
He'll be a blip on our radar as long
as everything goes well with Mirage.

178
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,681
Unfortunately,
we've got company there.

179
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,717
I've all but confirmed
that Sis is on that same track.

180
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,719
- Ah, damn.
- Oh, it's nothing.

181
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,755
She's way behind the curve.
I'll make sure she stays there.

182
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,017
I don't want her knowing
for her own good.

183
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,857
Hell, if she knew the truth,
she'd only wish she didn't.

184
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,257
- Okay.
- [Crunch]

185
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,267
- God! What'd I just step in?
- I don't know.

186
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,735
- But if you hurry, you can still catch it.
- Ew!

187
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,571
[Sydney] I can't believe you actually found
Catherine Parker's autopsy files, Broots.

188
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,110
Well, I haven't found it yet.
But, according to Buzzie...

189
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,271
the only way to download
a visual archive in the Sublevel...

190
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,338
is to tap directly into the Sublevel's
mainframe terminals.

191
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,112
- Who the hell is Buzzie?
- My pal down in Communications.

192
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,051
You know the old guy
with the hearing aids?

193
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,248
He's always griping about
the constant ringing in his ears.

194
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,417
- I've got that problem myself.
- Get this.

195
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,087
You know the rumor that J.F.K.
was kept alive as a vegetable somewhere?

196
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,096
Buzzie claims it was 
right here in SL 18.

197
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,760
Yeah, right next door to the alien corpses
Nixon showed Jackie Gleason.

198
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,067
- That was here too?
- [Sydney] Hey!

199
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,835
This is Room 12.
This is it.

200
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,747
[Broots] Wow. This is the room
where they did your mother's autopsy.

201
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,794
- This shouldn't take long.
- [Zipper Unzipping]

202
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,696
Sydney?

203
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,019
- Parker, you okay?
- Fine, Syd.

204
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,318
- I got it.
- [Raines] This begins the visual data archive...

205
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:18,159
to be known as number 566773.

206
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,460
The autopsy of Catherine Elaine Parker.

207
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,592
Date and time to follow.

208
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,728
Dr. William Raines, M.E.

209
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,739
Versatile guy, that Raines.

210
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,537
Beats 'em, bursts them,
slices and dices.

211
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,703
[Raines]
Initial findings indicate...

212
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,805
a single gunshot wound into
the cranial region as cause of death.

213
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,612
Angle and force of the head wound...

214
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:44,952
strongly indicate the gunshot
was self-inflicted.

215
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,127
- [Drill Whirring]
- Let's just skip to the end, Broots.

216
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,722
Oh, God. We've heard
all these lies before.

217
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,290
I just need to see
where the body goes.

218
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,336
Box the body for transport
per the family wishes.

219
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:11,010
On a personal note, I would simply like to go
on record to express my heartfelt remorse...

220
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,746
and to say that this is
and will always be...

221
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,448
a tragic death in
the annals of the Centre...

222
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,358
the likes of which I hope
never to encounter again.

223
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,360
So, what now?

224
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,865
We do a little exploratory
surgery of our own...

225
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:35,339
see just how remorseful
Dr. Death really is.

226
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,706
[Man] I'm as sorry as I can be
about the attack on Emily.

227
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,905
I wish all my tenants were like her.

228
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,712
I sort of connected
with her right off-

229
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,116
her lookin' for her family...

230
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,212
me not ever knowing
my father and mother.

231
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,258
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:55,461 --> 00:15:00,899
She was so close to changing
all that for herself.

233
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,968
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was hot on the trail 
of her brother.

234
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,467
Said she was, like,
this close to finding him.

235
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:09,131
She'd tear up everytime
she talked about it.

236
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:13,768
When was the last time that you saw my-
uh, the victim?

237
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:17,211
Um, must have been
a couple of nights ago.

238
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:21,877
To tell you the truth,
she seemed a little tense.

239
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:26,719
Said something about being, uh,
close to a big discovery.

240
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,758
The brother that she was looking for?

241
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,294
I-I don't think so.

242
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:35,389
This was something disturbing to her.
It wasn't a happy discovery.

243
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,476
Did you find something?

244
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:50,604
I'm not sure.
Uh, thank you for your time...

245
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,241
but I'd like to look around
for a little bit.

246
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,251
Sure. Hey, you saved me a trip.

247
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,653
I was about to go into town and tell the police
about this guy that was hanging around here.

248
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:02,851
It-It was the same guy from
the police sketch in the evening paper.

249
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:06,828
I-I can't believe they left out the most
important part of the description.

250
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,455
What's that?

251
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,933
The fact that-
Well, the guy was missing a thumb.

252
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:27,316
- [Women Laughing]
- [Lyle] I've never even met you.

253
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,750
Who said anything about breakfast?

254
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:34,456
Mr. Lyle?

255
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,584
Something tells me you haven't
read the morning's paper.

256
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,665
You try to kill with kindness,
and this is what happens.

257
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,101
Put a team together.
We're goin' back to Philly A.S.A.P.

258
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,162
Right.

259
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,851
Allow me.

260
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,513
I'm not going to Sublevel 18.

261
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:08,080
Oh. But you should.

262
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:11,525
It's a regular "Freaks-R-Us" down there.
You know the history.

263
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:16,191
J.F.K.., dead Martians. The room
where you did my mother's autopsy.

264
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:23,471
It's gonna be a bitch gettin'
that tank up and down the stairs.

265
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,668
It's common knowledge
I performed your mother's autopsy.

266
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:30,804
But... is it common knowledge...

267
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:34,544
that my mother's body
isn't in her grave?

268
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,848
What are you talking about?

269
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,880
What the hell did you do
with her body, you ghoul?

270
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:45,986
What any responsible
medical examiner would have done-

271
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:49,396
honor the wishes of the deceased.

272
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,663
If you have a problem with that,
take it up with her...

273
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:55,364
because this discussion is over.

274
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,713
Miss Parker, you told him
about your mother's empty grave?

275
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:07,716
He's gonna-
He could- He could-

276
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,718
He could lead us
right to the answer.

277
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,720
[Broots]
You told him on purpose.

278
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,484
That fish I said I'd be reeling in-
I just baited the hook.

279
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,584
Now we troll.

280
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,892
- You with us, Syd?
- [Elevator Bell Dings]

281
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:04,263
[Woman]
I'm sorry, Agent Curtis...

282
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,071
but I cannot in good conscience
allow the victim to be transferred.

283
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:11,103
How would your conscience feel when they put
you in jail for violation of a federal order?

284
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,911
- That order is worthless in my eyes.
- I have seen her charts.

285
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,953
Her edema levels are back to normal,
as well as hervital signs.

286
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,955
- The answer's still no.
- Whoever tried to kill her knows he failed...

287
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:23,652
and he will be back to finish the job,
I guarantee you that.

288
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:27,390
Releasing her to the next of kin 
would be my only option here. 
And correct me if I'm wrong...

289
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,625
but so far, none have turned up.

290
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,294
Until now.
I'm Emily's father...

291
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,428
and I think you should give
the agent here what he wants.

292
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,377
I'll prep her for immediate release.

293
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,940
- It's so good to see you.
- How is she?

294
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,747
- She's going to be okay.
- Great.

295
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,754
[Tires Screeching]

296
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,524
Check over there.
Willie, stairs.

297
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,583
You, follow me.

298
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,533
- How many were there?
- Four.

299
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:11,139
Go! Go!

300
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,841
238.

301
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:25,116
Damn! Where did she go?

302
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,782
- Released. She just went downstairs.
- Take the stairs.

303
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,361
That ambulance over there is mine.

304
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:43,172
I know a place that we can be safe.

305
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,208
You drive.

306
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,053
Good way to get yourself killed, pal.
Out of my way.

307
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,926
- See this woman come this way anywhere?
- Nope. Never seen her.

308
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:18,568
[Siren Wailing]

309
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,706
Damn!

310
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:28,342
I wanna thank you, Sister Mary,
for everything you've done for us.

311
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:30,545
After all you've done
for our parish, Jarod...

312
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,554
- you just stay as long as you want.
- [Bells Tolling]

313
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:35,216
And we'll take
very good care of Emily.

314
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:56,871
Nothing.

315
00:21:56,947 --> 00:22:00,314
- No luck, huh?
- It's like he doesn't exist.

316
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:03,444
Well, whoever this guy is,
Emily's been tracking him for a while.

317
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
Here, let me give you
a hand with the notes.

318
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,058
"Misplaced personality disorder."
"Man with no name."

319
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:18,158
"Talks to voices."
"Enigma."

320
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,897
Maybe it's a story
she's been working on.

321
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:27,571
Or a lifelong mystery
she's been trying to solve.

322
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:29,805
She thought this guy
might have been you.

323
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:34,183
She's been searching, just like me.

324
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:37,311
Just like... we all have.

325
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:45,255
Why would the Centre
want to murder her?

326
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,592
And how does he fit in?

327
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:56,138
[Broots]
Boy, you put the worm on...

328
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,140
and he took it hook,
line and sinker.

329
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:08,176
Man.

330
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:11,414
But I never pegged Raines
for the rustic type.

331
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:15,117
In the middle of nowhere,
you can't hear anyone scream.

332
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:21,363
I need to get to that fire.

333
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,269
[Miss Parker]
Anything, Broots?

334
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,807
Looks like a Raines time capsule.

335
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:43,819
Everything from old mortgage papers
to his kid's kindergarten artwork.

336
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:45,821
Move over, Monet.

337
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,722
Looks like "Ethan."
His son?

338
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:53,252
I've tried not to fire too many synapses
remembering things about the Raines family.

339
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,390
You think Raines used to live here?

340
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,559
Well, we used to visit
his house occasionally...

341
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,569
but it was on
the other side of town.

342
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:04,767
Maybe he used this place
as some kind of personal storage depot.

343
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:07,742
Yeah. Well, no offense
against his kid's artwork...

344
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:10,371
but this is starting to feel
like a dead-end trip down memory lane.

345
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,782
Miss Parker?

346
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,284
I think another street
just opened up.

347
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,457
Huh. St. Christopher medal.

348
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,657
Miss Parker, look.

349
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,108
[Emily Moans]

350
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:49,884
Emily? Emily?

351
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:57,115
Hi.

352
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:02,462
It's me, Em.
It's your brother.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
- Jarod?
- Dad's here too.

354
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:12,932
We're all together now.

356
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:19,812
Take your time. Take your time.
What is it you wanna tell us?

357
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:24,320
I found this picture
in your research files.

358
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:27,413
You thought he was me, didn't you?
Who is he?

359
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,015
Ethan.

360
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:35,030
- Ethan?
- He hears the voices. Talks-

361
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:38,966
He talks to the voices. I read that
in your notebook. What voices, Emily?

362
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:42,300
Hey, I think she should rest.
Come on.

363
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:44,363
Okay.

364
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:53,373
NuGenesis.

365
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,714
NuGenesis?
My God.

366
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:58,845
The Centre Fertility Clinic?

367
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,822
I have no fond memories of that place.

368
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,528
Here.

369
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:19,141
"AA8585."
Is that a file number?

370
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:24,044
- From NuGenesis?
- Does that have anything to do
with this man Ethan?

371
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,589
Follow NuGenesis.
Follow him.

372
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,334
Follow him.

373
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,104
Emily? Emily?

374
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:02,677
You know, if you consider yourself
any kind of friend of hers...

375
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:04,743
you'll destroy those disks.

376
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:07,517
- And you will destroy it now!
- But I can't!

377
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,058
I can't, Sydney. I don't really
have a choice in the matter, do I?

378
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:12,822
I mean, this is Miss Parker's life.

379
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:16,195
- This is her past. 
She has every right to see it.
- See what?

380
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:21,701
Do what you must, Broots.

381
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:26,902
But I won't be a part
of opening this Pandora's box.

382
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:29,878
[Miss Parker]
What Pandora's box?

383
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:32,779
[Broots] I was able to reconstruct
one tiny piece of the disks...

384
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:35,215
we found at Raines's forest house.

385
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:38,448
- The same place we were today?
- Yeah, but- Just watch.

386
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,619
[Raines] I hope you're feeling
comfortable here, Catherine...

387
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:47,561
after all you've been through.

388
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,396
I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be
thanking you for your kindness, Dr. Raines.

389
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:53,459
But thank you.

390
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:56,334
- My mother was there.
- Yeah. But what's important is the date.

391
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:59,933
Look. Look at the date code
on the D.S.A.

392
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,809
Your mother was shot and killed
at the Centre in April.

393
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,576
- This says June. There must be a mis-
- No.

394
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,583
It's physically and
technically impossible...

395
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:12,644
to alter the dates on the Centre
D.S.A. surveillance system.

396
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:15,418
Sydney didn't want me to show you this.
I don't know why.

397
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:17,426
But it's a lock.

398
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,758
Your mother did not die
in that elevator, Miss Parker.

399
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:24,289
Are- Are you saying
my mother is still alive?

400
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,102
Your mother alive?
Does this make any sense?

401
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,241
- Do you think that was hers?
- I don't remember it, but anything's possible.

402
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:45,947
Keep decoding the forest house archives.
And don't tell anyone.

403
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:48,547
- Not even Sydney?
- Especially Sydney.

404
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,718
He's done everything except
handcuff me to a freight train...

405
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:52,762
to keep me from digging into this.

406
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:56,128
There must be someone you can trust.

407
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:59,498
Where's Angelo?

408
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,972
Looks like the same kind
of insanity I grew up with.

409
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:12,481
Are you sure this is the address
Emily gave us for Ethan?

410
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,484
Positive.

411
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:19,750
He's been videotaping
himself for years.

412
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:22,223
Is there anything
on NuGenesis AA8585?

413
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:25,955
Nope. But there's enough material here
to write a dissertation on bomb-making.

414
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,963
But this guy's taken it a step further.

415
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:29,862
He's designing his own bomb.

416
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:42,774
Huh. Look.
There's an unmailed letter...

417
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,838
to his parents, the Clausens.

418
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:49,783
According to this time code, this video
was made less than one hour ago.

00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,649
There's your little bomb-maker.
Let's see what he's been up to.

420
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,990
Just leave me alone!

421
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:08,693
- Who's he talking to?
- I know I shouldn't yell.

422
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,168
I won't be bad anymore.

423
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,728
According to Emily's notes...

424
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,331
there were signs of erratic behavior,
of multiple personalities.

425
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,536
He must be wrestling with
some kind of demons inside.

426
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:21,512
Emily said he could hear the voices,
whatever that means.

But I'm tellin' you, I need to talk.

You swear that after the explosion...

00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:44,269
the pain will be gone?

434

will end if he pulls off some kind 
of bombing for them.

Okay, I'll do it.
First, I wanna see my mom and dad.

00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:57,275
Why won't you let me see
my mom and dad? It's been so long.

438
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,375

00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:29,070
- What? Are you sure?
- What's he doing?

446
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:33,812
- He's talking to the voices.
- He's gonna- He's gonna hurt my mom and dad?

00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:35,820
He can't hurt my mom and dad.

[Major Charles]
Wherever he's going, he's not coming back...

449
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,093

Come on.
Let's go.

451
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:58,843
It's not my fault that Jarod found
his sister before the Sweeper team did.

452
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:01,471
It's your fault she was still alive.

453
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,072
Well, what did you teach me
about water under the bridge?

454
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,584
If it gets deep enough, it'll drown you.
What about Mirage?

00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:21,275
- Freeze!
- I'm F.B.I. It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:23,372
F.B.I.

498
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,543
- There were reports of shots fired.
- Upstairs. Two bodies.

499
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,382
I was too late.

500
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:39,430
You knew my mother was alive,
but you didn't tell me?

501
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:42,365
Yes.

502
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:49,063
Then give me one good reason not
to blow your Flemish brains out.

503
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,574
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.

504
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:06,513
[Sighs]
Well, as you know...

505
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:10,187
I gave your mother
her last psychiatric session...

506
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:12,992
less than an hour
before her supposed murder.

507
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:17,593
- Supposed suicide in the elevator.
- "Supposed."

508
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,639
What does that mean, Sydney?

509
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:33,485
Catherine?
Catherine, please relax.

510
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:38,751
Sydney, I just found out that
someone I love is planning to kill me.

511
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:42,783
- Who?
- I can't tell you. A friend.

512
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:45,228
But it's forcing me to-

513
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:49,097
to make a very difficult decision.

514
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,729
I'm going to stage my death
in hopes of saving my life.

515
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,569
- I don't understand.
- And I don't have time to explain it all.

516
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,575
But you know these people,
what they're capable of.

517
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,941
I try not to imagine.

518
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,606
Their latest is
a project called Mirage...

519
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,013
and they've made me a key player.

520
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:09,646
My only way out is dying,
by their hands or my own.

521
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:12,714
[Sydney]
This is dangerous talk.

522
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:16,159
These are dangerous times, Sydney.
I'll do what I have to to survive.

523
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:19,994
And then I'll come back and rescue
Jarod and Angelo and my little girl.

524
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,296
What about your little girl?

525
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:26,767
She's my gift from God...

526
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,744
and I don't know how to save her
without causing her this pain.

527
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:36,009
Promise me, Sydney.
Swear to me that you'll protect her...

528
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:38,016
that you'll never tell her about this.

529
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:40,018
- You owe me.
- I know I do.

530
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:42,680
Whatever happens, no matter
how badly she wants to know...

531
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:47,488
I don't want my baby girl
to ever have to face the true tragedy...

532
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,757
of her family's secret.

533
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,095
- Promise me.
- I promise.

534
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,317
Godspeed, Catherine.

535
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:23,217
An hour later,
the gunshot rang out.

536
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:27,356
You know the rest.
I never saw Catherine again.

537
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:31,865
- Do you know what it is?
- What?

538
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:37,307
Mirage. The tragedy...
of my family's secret?

539
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:42,712
I'm afraid I don't.
That is the truth.

540
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:52,023
Ethan's parents were murdered
as a message to him.

541
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:56,824
Finish the 7677 bombing, or else.
Sounds like a message from the Centre to me.

542
00:38:56,896 --> 00:39:01,595
- That has the Centre fingerprints all over it.
- This too.

543
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,659
- You hacked into the NuGenesis mainframe?
- Uh-huh.

544
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,900
And you won't believe
what I found in file number AA8585.

545
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,610
[Jarod]
AA8585 was a shipment...

546
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:15,340
of cryogenically frozen sperm samples.

547
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:18,212
They were airlifted
to the Centre decades ago.

548
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:20,809
Someone wanted
to get pregnant pretty badly.

549
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:23,912
Yeah, but they weren't
just anyone's samples, Jarod.

550
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:26,048
They were mine.

551
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,700
- How much does Jarod know?
- [Lyle] We're not sure.

552
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:40,170
But Major Charles's seminal records
have been compromised at NuGenesis.

553
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,037
[Lyle] And there's more.
Jarod was spotted at the parents' house.

554
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:46,566
- Before or after they were killed?
- After, thank God.

555
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:50,103
- And Mirage?
- [Sighs]

556
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,740
He's still out there.

557
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:55,378
There's gotta be some way to get 
to Jarod before he beats us to him.

558
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:58,685
There is one.
We give him something...

559
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:01,282
more important to go after.

560
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,727
Something named Zoe.

561
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,129
[Mr. Parker]
Good thinking, Mr. Cox.

562
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,133
[Major Charles]
It only gets stranger and stranger.

563
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,897
- More on your records at NuGenesis?
- Yeah.

564
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:14,496
For the past 25 years,
comparative genetic test follow-ups...

565
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:16,939
have been conducted using my D.N.A.

566
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:19,944
The question is, who or what
are they comparing it to?

567
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:24,642
It doesn't say. But the results
were sent to a private residence...

568
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:26,651
in Blue Cove, Delaware.

569
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:31,489
Come on.

570
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:44,334
[Engine Starts]

571
00:40:47,172 --> 00:40:49,106
Okay, let's go.

572
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,834
You all right?

573
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,109
Something feels... weird.

574
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:01,118
- We're talkin' Mr. Raines.
It's supposed to be weird.
- No.

575
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:03,450
This is weirder than him.

576
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:19,167
- What are we lookin' for?
- The truth.

577
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:21,468
I'll check over here.

578
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,065
No.

579
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,338
It's not over there.

580
00:41:26,412 --> 00:41:28,471
How do you know, Son?

581
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:30,811
I just know. It's-

582
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:33,511
It's like a strange deja vu.

583
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:39,688
- What are you mumbling about?
- I decoded some of the archives
from the forest house.

584
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:43,990
And, well, if a picture's worth
more than a thousand words...

585
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:46,395
I think I've just
uncovered a thesaurus.

586
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,865
This is about six months
after your mother supposedly died.

587
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:54,363
- Well?
- He'll be here in a few minutes.

588
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,932
- You sure you wanna do this?
- [Sighs]

589
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,342
I have to.

590
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:20,763
- What? What did she have to do?
- Well, wait. Just watch that door.

591
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,036
Like you've seen this place before?

592
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:32,168
It's like I've been here before.

593
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:41,042
[Gasps]
Oh, my God.

594
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,183
Jarod out of the Centre?
Impossible. How could that be?

595
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:48,089
Secrets and lies.

596
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,254
- Hi, Jarod.
- Hello, Mrs. Parker.

597
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,560
Thank you for coming.

598
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,761
Close the door.

599
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:11,813
Gynecological instruments?
What is all this stuff?

600
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,216
Tools of the trade.

601
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:21,051
- A birthing table?
- The question is, whose?

602
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,287
Come here, Jarod.

603
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:29,834
There's something I wanna tell you.

604
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,131
My mother was pregnant?

605
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:39,268
You're going to have a brother.

606
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,613
[Major Charles]
This is just too weird.

607
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:44,740
Birthing tables, incubators...

608
00:43:44,817 --> 00:43:47,012
genetic follow-ups of my semen.

609
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:50,612
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

610
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,657
I have a brother.

611
00:43:52,724 --> 00:43:55,921
I have a brother?

612
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:58,087
Jarod and I share a brother?

613
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:01,360
It must be Ethan.

614
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:06,801
- But where is he?
- [Ethan] My parents are gone.

615
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:11,400
Mom is dead.
Dad is dead.

616
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,468
[Raines]
I'm your father now.

617
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:28,193
[Sydney]
Details are sketchy, Jarod.

618
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,821
I'm just now trying to piece
a lot of this together myself.

619
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:37,164
This feeling is so strong, Sydney,
that I've been to that forest house before.

620
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:39,898
But my mind wants to block it out.

621
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:42,805
I have a feeling too, Jarod,
and it says you're lying.

622
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:47,141
- Miss Parker.
- I'm glad to hear your mind
hasn't blocked me out yet.

623
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:49,203
Tell him, Syd.
Like he doesn't know.

624
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:52,978
Well, we saw the D.S.A.,
and you were definitely there.

625
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:56,043
- Then why don't I remember it?
- [Miss Parker] You're the genius.

626
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:59,750
- You tell us.
- If I could I would, Miss Parker. You know that.

627
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,918
I've never held back
when it comes to your mother.

628
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,758
[Miss Parker] You were on
the D.S.A., Jarod. She talked to you.

629
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,063
- She told you secrets.
- I don't remember.

630
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:10,256
- Did she tell you why she faked her own death?
- I don't know.

631
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,892
Or how in the hell that baby
she was carrying is your brother?

632
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:17,064
- Look, I don't know.
- Or where she was going,
or where the baby went, or-

633
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:19,607
I don't know!

634
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,338
[Sydney]
It is entirely possible that...

635
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:27,007
your subconscious mind has
blocked out those recollections, Jarod...

636
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,916
either by itself or with
the help of someone else.

637
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:32,078
So those memories could
still be in Jarod's head?

638
00:45:32,154 --> 00:45:36,818
Every waking moment of our lives
is stored somewhere in our minds.

639
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:39,019
[Jarod] Well, for what it's worth,
Miss Parker, I believe that-

640
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,022
that our brother is a man named Ethan.

641
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,364
Now, I don't know where he is...

642
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:50,132
but somehow he's involved
with a project called 7677.

643
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,642
You figure out 7677..

644
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,836
you find baby brother.

645
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:02,840
[Ethan]
I'm almost ready with 7677.

646
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:04,886
I just need a few more components.

647
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,684
But I'm telling you,
I need to talk. Okay.

648
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,118
[Grunts]

649
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,502
Still nothin' on this guy, Agent?

650
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,061
- Still nothing.
- [Man] You can't drag me
out of my house like that!

651
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,506
I got a whole grilled cheese
goin' right there on the stove.

652
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,669
Hey, where do you want him, Detective?

653
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,475
- Come on!
- [Brookins] Ask, and ye shall receive.

654
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:34,880
That's the local munitions guy
you asked us to haul in.

655
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,750
Name's Jed Sidel.
Small-time middle man, all-around weasel.

656
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:42,848
Well, what a coincidence.
Weasel season has just opened.

657
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:47,595
Jed.

658
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:50,496
- Agent Curtis, F.B.I.
- Hello.

659
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:52,898
On behalf of the Bureau,
I would like to say congratulations.

660
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:54,765
- Hmm?
- Well, you're moving up in the world.

661
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:58,204
- I am?
- Aiding and abetting in the making ofbombs.

662
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:02,438
Helping to murder innocent citizens.
I mean, this is hardly fencing stolen TVs.

663
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:05,776
You're hittin' the big leagues.
Your parents must bevery proud of you.

664
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:07,782
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

665
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,718
Well, he doesn't seem to think so.

666
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,847
I don't know who that is.

667
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,693
- That wasn't my question.
- What-What-What was the question?

668
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:22,287
Why are you helping
your friend here make bombs?

669
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:28,462
- No, no. Ethan ain't no friend of mine.
- Ethan?

670
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:31,665
I thought you didn't know him.

671
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,140
Do you have any idea what this guy's
gonna do to me if I spill to you?

672
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:39,307
I mean, he talks to people
that aren't even there. He's crazy.

673
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:41,406
Unlike the lovable lifers
in federal prison.

674
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,249
- Hmm?
- I hear shower time's a real scream,Jed.

675
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:49,485
Explosives. Yes.
He was looking for explosives.

676
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:51,583
Like C-4, Semtex, uh, digital fuses.

677
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,753
And all I did,
and this is all I did...

678
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,389
was call a guy on the phone, and I-
and I set up a meeting.

679
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:58,057
- That's it.
- Where and when?

680
00:47:58,133 --> 00:48:00,397
Mm-hmm.

681
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:04,303
At the warehouse at midnight.
Broad Street and Franklin.

682
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:18,344
[Engine Starts]

683
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:33,257
There was only about
one minute of stuff left on the D.S.A.

684
00:48:33,335 --> 00:48:35,667
But what's there is really telling.

685
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,337
Dr. Raines, leave us alone, please?

686
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:51,512
Catherine, I don't think
that would be a good idea.

687
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:54,988
I think it would be a great idea.

688
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,364
Jarod, there's something
I have to tell you...

689
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:08,835
that you can never forget.

690
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,532
Okay.

691
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:14,235
I may not live much longer,
and if I don't...

692
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,837
there's something very important
I want you to tell my daughter.

693
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,848
Will you promise me
that you'll tell her?

694
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,009
I promise.

695
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,419
It's something I don't ever
want anyone else to hear.

696
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:35,754
What's wrong, Broots?
Fix it.

697
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:38,994
Well, there's nothing to fix.
She unplugged it. That's all there is.

698
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:42,629
My butt that's all there is.
Make it talk.

699
00:49:42,705 --> 00:49:46,664
- I-I can't.
- My mother's dying secret.

700
00:49:46,742 --> 00:49:50,769
The one thing
she wanted me to know...

701
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:54,543
is not only lost electronically,
but somewhere inside Jarod's head...

702
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,550
and he can't remember a thing.

703
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,109
Hmm.

704
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:04,490
Raines. Raines must have
erased that portion of Jarod's brain.

705
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,189
- You mean, like, hypnotized him
or brainwashed him or something?
- Very likely.

706
00:50:08,263 --> 00:50:11,198
I don't know how Raines locked
that memory in Genius Boy's mind...

707
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:14,702
but I'm gonna free it up
if I have to crack his head open...

708
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,034
and carve it out
with a melon scooper.

709
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:19,267
- How are we gonna do that?
- We track Raines.

710
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:21,673
I'll bet my ass
he knows where Ethan is.

711
00:50:21,744 --> 00:50:24,907
We find Ethan, we find Jarod.

712
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,196

714
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:03,144
Relax, son.
Everything's going to be just fine.

715
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:05,806
I feel so alone.

716
00:52:05,881 --> 00:52:10,648
But you're not, Ethan. I'm here for you.
You know that, don't you?

717
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,025
After you earn the trust
of the Triumvirate with the bombing...

718
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,551
you'll come to live at the Centre
where we'll do great things together.

719
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,599
I'll be calling you soon.

Ethan? It's okay.
I'm not here to hurt you.

722
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,206
No, you're the one
who killed my parents.

723
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,374
I didn't kill your parents.

[Voices Whispering]

How do you know I can trust him?
I can't trust anyone.

00:52:48,323 --> 00:52:51,952
Not you, not him.

Damn it!

You look surprised to be here.

734
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:48,041
Well, I'm surprised I'm still alive.

735

Dead men tell no tales.

736
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:55,316
I'm assuming since we're here, this has
nothing to do with Centre business?

00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,223
No.

00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,036
Tell me what I need to know,
and you're out of here.

to let me just walk away? Hmm?

- Thank you for coming.

There's something I wanna tell you.

746
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:53,812
You're going to have a brother.

747

[Jarod] I don't remember this.
Sydney, I don't remember this.

Go back into your memory, Jarod...

752
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:28,176
to when you were a young boy.

753
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,241
Are you there now?

754
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:37,349
Go back to a moment when Raines came
to take you from the Centre.

755
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:40,452
And where did he take you?

756
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:43,430
[Jarod]
A house in the woods.

757
00:55:43,498 --> 00:55:47,594
- Can you see the house now?
- Yes.

758
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:50,536
Go inside.

759
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:54,063
- Are you there?
- Yes.

760
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:59,079
I smell wood. Wood paneling. Cedar.

761
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,707
Very good, Jarod.

762
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:06,152
I walk through a sliding door.

- She's there.
- Who is?

Hi, Jarod.

766
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:17,354
She didn't die in the elevator.

- She seems troubled.
- By what?

768
00:56:25,474 --> 00:56:27,806
She wants me...

769
00:56:27,876 --> 00:56:30,902
to tell her daughter
something very important.

770
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:32,844
What?

771
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,409
It's very important that
she know the truth about Ethan.

772
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:39,477
Ethan?

773
00:56:40,822 --> 00:56:43,382
That's what he told me
his name would be.

774
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,552
I don't understand.
How would he know?

775
00:56:46,628 --> 00:56:50,325
- How do you?
- I call it my inner sense.

776
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:52,696
Inner sense?

777
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:56,465
For most, it's the hairs
on the back of your neck...

778
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,006
or that nervous feeling
in your stomach.

779
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:03,135
[Jarod, Mrs. Parker Together]
For me, it's voices I hear all around me...

780
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,679
usually warning me of things
that are about to happen.

781
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:07,715
Like souls talking to you?

782
00:57:07,783 --> 00:57:09,944
Something like that.

783
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:13,784
I've been blessed
with this gift, Jarod.

784
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:16,517
And though she doesn't know it,
so has my daughter.

785
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:19,617
Though neither of us quite like Ethan.

786
00:57:19,694 --> 00:57:24,461
Ijust pray his gift isn't
abused by the wrong people.

787
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:26,467
[Young Jarod]
Why are you telling me this?

788
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:29,629
Because Ethan is also your brother.

789
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:33,504
Unknown to me, while I was sedated...

790
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,806
for a minor surgery not long ago...

791
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:40,609
my husband...

792
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:44,584
used your father's seed
to impregnate me.

793
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:47,588
- My father's genetics.
- Yes.

794
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:49,920
Mr. Parker wanted
to create a child...

795
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:52,391
with this inner sense...

796
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,724
who could also
be special like you are...

797
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:58,391
to use, no doubt,
as they have used you.

798
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,471
Mr. Raines showed me proof
of what had been done...

799
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,237
and that Mr. Parker
is planning to kill me...

800
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,609
when the baby is born.

801
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,047
[Young Jarod] Mr. Raines scares me.
Why do you trust him?

802
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,950
I trusted him because-

803
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,954
because he trusted me.

804
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:25,255
That and...

805
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:30,128
it was the only way for me to give 
this child a chance at a real life.

806
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,931
But now-

807
00:58:35,003 --> 00:58:37,301
Something's wrong.

808
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:42,435
The voices are telling me
I won't leave this house alive.

809
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,106
[Young Jarod]
That's why you brought me here.

810
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:52,483
You're special, Jarod,
and I know you won't forget.

811
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:59,192
I want you to tell my daughter
to complete my plan.

812
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:02,492
[Young Jarod]
Plan?

813
00:59:02,564 --> 00:59:07,558
She'll understand one day.
Just tell her to trust her inner sense.

814
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:10,400
It will guide her actions.

815
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:20,143
Jarod, your soul is a trusting one,
just like your mother's.

816
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:23,150
- You know my mother?
- Yes.

817
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:28,419
And one day,
you'll be back together again.

818
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,822
And Ethan will help you find her.

819
00:59:32,627 --> 00:59:38,532
[Jarod, Mrs. Parker Together]
Trust your inner sense.

820
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:49,773
[Typing]

821
01:00:38,957 --> 01:00:41,551
- Mr. Lyle.
- Any news from Cox about Zoe?

822
01:00:41,626 --> 01:00:43,560
According to his last message,
he's ready.

823
01:00:43,628 --> 01:00:47,997
But this is why I'm here.
Our people at Triumvirate Headquarters...

824
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:50,534
thought you might find that
quite interesting.

825
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,839
Raines has been a busy boy.

826
01:00:56,908 --> 01:00:59,502
[Broots] I intercepted a communique
between Raines and the Triumvirate...

827
01:00:59,578 --> 01:01:01,671
and I'm probably
not the only one who did.

828
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:04,944
- Spit it out, Broots.
- It's about 7677.

829
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:07,143
And that thing, that Mirage-

830
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:09,414
That "thing" is my brother.

831
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:11,422
Whoa.

832
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:15,085
Okay. In a nutshell,
there's some project called 7677.

833
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,823
And if it goes off as planned, Mr. Raines
is gonna be in charge of the Centre.

834
01:01:18,897 --> 01:01:23,357
A Raines coup.
Thank you.

835
01:01:23,435 --> 01:01:25,426
Hello?

836
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:30,669
Why do I feel Iike you know
what Broots just told me?

837
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:36,544
- Raines has been working towards
this his whole sordid career.
- Using Ethan.

838
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:40,915
He took him as a child,
placed him in a surrogate family...

839
01:01:40,986 --> 01:01:44,353
with people who would allow
Raines to control his emotions.

840
01:01:44,423 --> 01:01:47,654
In other words, screwed him up
so badly, he would only trust Raines.

841
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:52,095
So Raines could have
total control over him...

842
01:01:52,164 --> 01:01:54,291
turn Ethan into
his private assassin.

843
01:01:54,366 --> 01:01:58,666
And when Raines killed
his surrogate parents...

844
01:01:58,737 --> 01:02:03,970
he severed all emotional ties to anything
connected with the outside world.

845
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:06,306
[Jarod]
Well, that is what Raines does best-

846
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:08,243
take people away from their families.

847
01:02:09,881 --> 01:02:11,678
What are you going to do?

848
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,741
[Sighs]

849
01:02:16,154 --> 01:02:18,418
I don't know.

850
01:02:19,624 --> 01:02:22,422
Do what your mother would have wanted.

851
01:02:22,494 --> 01:02:24,689
Finish her work.

852
01:02:26,398 --> 01:02:28,332
Work she died trying to accomplish.

853
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,925
My mother may still be alive, Jarod.

854
01:02:31,002 --> 01:02:33,527
What if she's not?

855
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,768
You can stop Raines.

856
01:02:37,843 --> 01:02:40,710
I don't know!

857
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:43,270
Ow!

858
01:02:43,348 --> 01:02:47,079
Trust your inner sense, Miss Parker.

859
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:53,523
I do.

860
01:02:57,762 --> 01:02:59,593
Now...

861
01:02:59,664 --> 01:03:01,791
I'm going to find my-

862
01:03:03,668 --> 01:03:06,865
our brother.

863
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:31,855
Have I ever told you...

864
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:35,457
how truly inspired this Holy Roller
gag of yours has been?

865
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:38,002
What are you talking about?

866
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:41,061
Oh, come on.
You're about as born-again as I am.

867
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:45,935
But, hey, after you botched things
so badly last year...

868
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:48,673
this religion thing saved your ass.

869
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:50,681
There's no shame in that.
Of course...

870
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:54,150
the way the Triumvirate's been touting
you lately, who needs divine intervention?

871
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:57,746
- You're making no sense.
- Oh, I am.

872
01:03:57,822 --> 01:04:01,349
Just as much as this communique that
I intercepted from the Triumvirate does.

873
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:08,257
You've gotten pretty tight
with our bosses in Africa.

874
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:11,166
7677 and Mirage.

875
01:04:11,236 --> 01:04:15,002
Your power play.
Ringin' a bell?

876
01:04:15,073 --> 01:04:17,940
How did you get this?

877
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:21,536
If you can find God,
I can sure as hell find that.

878
01:04:21,613 --> 01:04:26,141
And to think all this time,
I thought Bobby Bowman...

879
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:28,549
was your only special
project on the outside.

880
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,781
I guess you never heard of progress.

881
01:04:30,855 --> 01:04:33,619
What I'm about to propose
is all about progress.

882
01:04:33,692 --> 01:04:38,356
- What do you want?
- I want to run the Centre with you.

883
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,331
The 7677 bombing goes down...

884
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:44,334
Mirage- or is it Ethan-

885
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:47,394
comes into the Centre just like you 
promised the Triumvirate...

886
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:49,337
and it all can happen
because I decide...

887
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,343
not to tell Mr. Parker
that you stole his son.

888
01:04:55,447 --> 01:05:00,578
Yeah. That you stole
his prizes Project Mirage.

889
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:04,349
Now, if I read
that communique correctly...

890
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:06,856
it's about time for you
to activate Ethan...

891
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:11,259
and finish 7677.

892
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:13,160
What do you say, partner?

893
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:22,433
[Ringing]

894
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:30,681
[Raines]
7677 is a go.

895
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:35,550
This is your final call.
After this, it's up to you.

896
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,522
Now, walk three blocks
to the bus station.

897
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,752
Open locker number 9...

898
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:46,320
and you'll find the final instructions
for the bombing.

[Voices Whispering]

900
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:08,709
We couldn't stop him now
even if we wanted to.

901
01:06:08,787 --> 01:06:11,153
Happy?

902
01:06:11,222 --> 01:06:13,486
- [Door Opens]
- Damn happy.

903
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,885
- You son of a-
- Hey, hey.

904
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:20,157
Is that any way to talk 
to your new partner?

905
01:06:20,231 --> 01:06:23,064
Whoops.
I mean, new boss?

906
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,493
[Man]
We have a clean trace on the call.

907
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:30,667
We'll monitor Ethan until he finishes 7677,
and then we'll bring him in.

908
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:34,735
- No screw-ups.
- Lock him up down in SL 25...

909
01:06:34,813 --> 01:06:36,906
with the rats.

910
01:06:44,189 --> 01:06:47,818
We've had too many years and too much
success for things to end this way.

911
01:06:47,892 --> 01:06:50,190
Who said it's ending for me?

Hi. Anything I can do to help?

916
01:07:29,968 --> 01:07:31,959
As a matter offact, there is.

01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:15,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

920
01:08:15,313 --> 01:08:17,804
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

921
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:24,221
We have so much we have to catch up on.
I'm going to find Mom...

922
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:28,988
and we're all going to be
together like one big family.

923
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:33,053
And what about Ethan?
Dad told me everything.

924
01:08:33,131 --> 01:08:34,996
He's not crazy...

925
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:37,057
not like you thought he was.

926
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:43,000
Our brother, he's gifted.

927
01:08:43,074 --> 01:08:45,008
He's special.

928
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:50,343
Don't let them destroy Ethan
like they did our family.

929
01:08:50,415 --> 01:08:52,212
I won't.

930
01:08:56,221 --> 01:08:59,019
I promise.

931
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,930
Sweet dreams.

932
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:22,936
Why the glum looks?

933
01:09:24,482 --> 01:09:28,282
Well, I recovered more of
the forest house archives.

934
01:09:28,353 --> 01:09:30,878
- And?
- Sit down, Parker.

935
01:09:37,862 --> 01:09:40,126
[Raines]
I can see the head, Catherine.

[Groaning]

937
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,790
- It's a-
- [Mrs. Parker] Boy.

938
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:48,100
[Raines]
You're right. It is a boy.

939
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:52,772
Oh!

940
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:56,644
Hello, Ethan.

941
01:09:56,714 --> 01:09:59,444
Hello.
I'm your mother.

942
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:03,044
I have such big plans foryou.

943
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:08,819
- Why didn't you want me to see this?
- There's more, I'm afraid.

944
01:10:08,893 --> 01:10:14,456
After my work was through, I wanted
to raise you and your brother and sister...

945
01:10:14,532 --> 01:10:17,228
like a real family.

946
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:22,039
But I'm not gonna be able
to do that, little man.

947
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:35,612
I just realized I'm not going
to be able to seeyou grow up.

948
01:10:37,288 --> 01:10:41,691
But you have a brother and sister
that will find you and protect you.

949
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:44,853
You tell them to finish my work...

950
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:47,227
to finish my plan.

951
01:10:50,068 --> 01:10:52,002
I love you.

01:11:07,585 --> 01:11:10,315
- Um, I don't think you need to see-
- No.

954
01:11:10,388 --> 01:11:12,379
I need to know.

955
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,057
I'm sorry.
I'm just following orders.

956
01:11:23,134 --> 01:11:25,967
[Mrs. Parker] You really had me convinced
that you had changed...

957
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:28,369
that you cared about this baby.

958
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:30,339

- Have her cremated.
- Yes, Doctor.

I'm your mommy now.

964
01:12:28,366 --> 01:12:32,928
Raines executed my mother.
He won't take my brother too.

965
01:12:38,176 --> 01:12:40,872
Syd, talk to her.

966
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:45,408
There's nothing left to say.

967
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:49,819
[Major Charles]
You found Ethan's computer?

968
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:52,549
At the warehouse where
he picked up the bomb components.

969
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:56,150
I reconstructed the hard drive and was able
to break down the bomb schematic.

970
01:12:56,227 --> 01:12:59,287
But even better, I found out
where the bombing is going down.

971
01:12:59,363 --> 01:13:02,332
7677. It's the number of a subway train.

972
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,336
- D.C. Underground.
- The subway's not his target.

973
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:08,964
It's his delivery system.

974
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,601
Train 7677's route
ends at Freedom Station.

975
01:13:12,677 --> 01:13:15,237
Directly above that
is the National Hotel.

976
01:13:15,313 --> 01:13:19,306
The exact place where hundreds of foreign
dignitaries are staying for a peace conference.

977
01:13:19,383 --> 01:13:21,317
So much for peace.

978
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:23,979
I broke down the password
on a well-hidden encryption file.

979
01:13:24,055 --> 01:13:26,649
Ethan's programmed the bomb's timer
on this laptop too.

980
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:29,249
The train is leaving the station
in exactly one hour from now.

981
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:32,296
- It's just enough time to stop this 
and save Ethan.
- Come on.

982
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:37,766
- [Ringing]
- [Electronic Voice] You have a video phone call.

983
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:46,769
I'm sorry to call so late, Jarod,
but I thought for sure you'd be interested...

984
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:49,108
in saving the life of a close friend.

Ouch!

- Jarod!

987
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:55,516
- Lyle, let her go!
- That's exactly what I wanna do.

988
01:13:55,586 --> 01:13:59,955
But Mr. Cox actually wants to exploit
the safety and well-being 
of your girlfriend...

989
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:01,889
to his advantage.

990
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,722
All right.
What do you want?

991
01:14:03,794 --> 01:14:05,955
To propose a quid pro quo.

992
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:08,863
Don't, Jarod!
I don't know why these people want you...

993
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:11,197
but they will kill you, I know that!

994
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:13,169

If you want Zoe to live...

995
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:15,865
you'll surrender yourself to us 
tonight at Rosing's Farm...

Highway 12, outside Blue Cove...

997
01:14:18,376 --> 01:14:21,038
in exactly one hour.

998
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,341
Lyle! Damn it!

999
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:31,013
One hour from now. That's exactly when
Ethan will be on that subway train.

1000
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:46,098
[Rats Squealing]

1001
01:14:58,182 --> 01:15:01,083
From the bottom of my heart,
Miss Parker-

1002
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:01,879
From the bottom of my heart,
Miss Parker-

1003
01:15:04,086 --> 01:15:09,456
My first memory of you
was in the Centre lobby.

1004
01:15:09,524 --> 01:15:11,458
You were smoking a cigarette.

1005
01:15:11,526 --> 01:15:17,158
I was six or seven,
and you knelt down...

1006
01:15:17,232 --> 01:15:21,100
took a drag and blew smoke in my face.

1007
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:23,535
And here you are...

1008
01:15:25,173 --> 01:15:29,735
still blowin' smoke.

1009
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:36,811
For what it's worth, Miss Parker-

1010
01:15:36,885 --> 01:15:40,286
I can never have my mother back...

1011
01:15:40,355 --> 01:15:43,415
but I can damn well save my brother.

1012
01:15:43,492 --> 01:15:48,520
You tell me everything you know
about 7677...

1013
01:15:48,597 --> 01:15:51,794
and I consider
letting you live another day.

1014
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:57,936
I'm the last chance saloon here,
Raines.

1015
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:05,043
7677 is a Washington D.C.
subway train...

1016
01:16:05,113 --> 01:16:09,812
departing from Beacon Station
in a little over one hour from now.

1017
01:16:09,885 --> 01:16:12,285
Then what?

1018
01:16:12,354 --> 01:16:14,288
When it pulls into Freedom Station...

1019
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:16,347
the subway and everything
above it will blow up.

1020
01:16:21,296 --> 01:16:25,198
It's your brother who will plant
the bomb and guide the subway.

1021
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:31,603
- Our Father, who art in heaven-
- Not so fast.

1022
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:35,837
Before she died, my mother said
something about her "unfinished work"..

1023
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:37,776
about her "plan."

1024
01:16:37,846 --> 01:16:39,643
What did she mean by that?

1025
01:16:42,184 --> 01:16:45,676
- Then you never found it either?
- Found what?

1026
01:16:45,754 --> 01:16:50,521
Word has it your mother left a D.S.A.
explaining exactly what her plan was.

1027
01:16:50,592 --> 01:16:53,755
But it was the one piece
of incriminating evidence...

1028
01:16:53,828 --> 01:16:56,592
I never found or destroyed.

1029
01:16:56,665 --> 01:16:59,828
You find it, you find her plan.

1030
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:06,133
You gotta know
something more about it.

1031
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,904
It's about what everything's about,
Miss Parker.

1032
01:17:08,977 --> 01:17:13,380
It's about the Centre, all the lies.

1033
01:17:14,816 --> 01:17:16,977
Just remember...

1034
01:17:17,052 --> 01:17:19,020
whatever answers your mother
may have left behind...

1035
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:23,217
there is still one person alive...

1036
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:25,259
who does know the whole truth.

1037
01:17:26,895 --> 01:17:29,363
- Who?
- [Gunshot]

1038
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:37,936
[Sighs]
Daddy?

1039
01:17:38,006 --> 01:17:41,772
It's not right for my little girl
to have blood like that on her hands.

1040
01:17:44,613 --> 01:17:47,548
Was it the blood
you were worried about...

1041
01:17:47,616 --> 01:17:50,915
or the truth?

1042
01:18:02,697 --> 01:18:05,291
Jarod should be here in 20 minutes.

1043
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:08,029
Take your positions.
Be ready.

1044
01:18:08,103 --> 01:18:10,571
[Mr. Lyle]
And you're sure he'll come?

1045
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:13,039
Oh, he'll come.

1046
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:48,737
Zoe, we couldn't have
done this without you.

1047
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:52,143
- Go to hell.
- All's fair in love and war.

1048
01:18:52,213 --> 01:18:54,238
You know, it's too bad
you're not Asian.

1049
01:18:54,316 --> 01:18:57,410
But maybe when all this is over, we can
find a place for you in our renewal wing.

1050
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:03,753
- Why can't you just leave Jarod alone?
- Because he belongs to us.

1051
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,637

1052

1053
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:49,634
- It's not Jarod!
- It's Major Charles.

[Cell Phone Ringing]

1055
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:28,167
- Dad?
- It's me- Zoe.

1056
01:20:28,243 --> 01:20:31,212
- Then you're all right?
- Yeah, everything's okay on this end, Jarod.

1057
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:34,942
Though I am pretty damn curious
about who Cox and Lyle are.

1058
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:37,951
- I am so sorry that you got involved with this.
- Be careful, Jarod.

1059
01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:39,748
I will.

1060
01:22:24,192 --> 01:22:26,126
Ethan?

1061
01:22:26,194 --> 01:22:29,459
- Stay away!
- I'm not going to hurt you.

1062
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:32,022
- [Voices Whispering]
- [Grunting]

1063
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,364
- They say not to trust you.
- No, they don't.

1064
01:22:34,435 --> 01:22:37,233
- Not all of them.
- I wish I didn't have to hear them!

1065
01:22:37,305 --> 01:22:41,674
It's your inner sense, Ethan.

1066
01:22:41,743 --> 01:22:45,406
It's what makes you special.

1067
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,415
- Who are you?
- I'm your brother.

1068
01:22:51,219 --> 01:22:53,414
- She told me about you.
- She?

1069
01:22:54,589 --> 01:22:56,989
Of course.

1070
01:22:57,058 --> 01:23:00,653
One of the voices.
She's the one you must listen to, Ethan.

1071
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:04,487
- Who is she?
- Your mother.

1072
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:08,400
You never got to know her.
They never allowed you to know her.

1073
01:23:08,469 --> 01:23:12,371
But she is your mother.
She's your guide, Ethan.

1074
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,431
Listen to her voice.
It's your inner sense.

1075
01:23:14,509 --> 01:23:19,845
- Mr. Raines is my guide.
- No, he took your gifts
and he used them against you.

1076
01:23:19,914 --> 01:23:23,873
He taught you to fear those voices
instead oflearning how to embrace them.

1077
01:23:23,952 --> 01:23:27,217
He used you, Ethan.
He's still using you.

1078
01:23:27,288 --> 01:23:29,916
Don't let him use
your gift for destruction.

1079
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:35,395
- I have to follow his word.
- If you do, then innocent people will die.

1080
01:23:35,463 --> 01:23:38,125
That's not you, Ethan.
That's not who you are.

1081
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:42,135
Just listen to her voice, Ethan.
Focus on her voice.

1082
01:23:50,311 --> 01:23:54,805
Trust him, Son.
Jarod is the one.

1083
01:23:59,187 --> 01:24:00,916

You can break free of the hold he has 
over you. Just listen to her voice.

01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:37,919
You have a family now, a real family.
We'll always be there.

1090
01:24:39,494 --> 01:24:41,758
Now tell me, where is the bomb?

1091
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:52,339
You can't stop the train.
The bomb can't be defused.

1092
01:24:52,407 --> 01:24:55,604
I was on three bomb squads and two
army demolition units. I can defuse it.

1093
01:24:55,677 --> 01:24:58,646
The bomb's on the undercarriage.
There's no stopping it or the train.

1094
01:24:58,713 --> 01:25:01,477
Then we're gonna have to send the train
somewhere else. Where's Freedom Station?

1095
01:25:01,549 --> 01:25:04,143
- It's on the track veering right.
- Where's the track veering left go?

1096
01:25:04,218 --> 01:25:06,209
It's to an abandoned maintenance yard.
They closed it years ago.

1097
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,187
- Well, hang on.
- Look, it's no use.

1098
01:25:08,256 --> 01:25:10,451
I programmed it to automatically
take the track to the right.

1099
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:13,722
- Did I tell you I was a rocket scientist too?
- 3,000 yards.

1100
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:18,830
- 2,900.
- Come on!

1101
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,630
2,800! Do it!

1102
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:28,471
- I got it.
- The train has an auto brake
that engages in 40 seconds.

1103
01:25:28,543 --> 01:25:31,876
- The bomb goes off 20 seconds after that.
- Come on! Get out of here!

1104
01:25:40,455 --> 01:25:43,322
Freeze it, please!

1105
01:25:45,827 --> 01:25:48,853
- Miss Parker, listen to me.
There is a bomb on board.
- I know!

1106
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:51,194
- We have less than 60 seconds.
- Then defuse it!

1107
01:25:51,265 --> 01:25:53,096
I can't!
It's underneath the train!

1108
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:55,829
- Then stop the train!
- It's too late!

1109
01:25:55,903 --> 01:25:58,565
If we are lucky, this train will
slow down enough for us to jump off.

1110
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,199
But I can't stop the explosion.

1111

This is your brother,
Miss Parker. Our brother.

1112

It could be a beginning.
Don't make it an end!

[Jarod] It's your mother's voice
he can hear, Miss Parker.

1116

Maybe you can hear it too.
Trust that voice.

1118
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,728
The auto brake has engaged.
We have less than 20 seconds.

- What's the matter with him?

Side effects of Raines's work.
Now what's it gonna be, Miss Parker?

Help me save him.
Help me save our family.
