1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Previous scene on the pretender

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,701
Problem of the center?

3
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:07,802
Well, My father been at his desk in The Tower at 7 am for the last thirty-five years.

4
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:10,003
-Two weeks in a row he has a no show.
-That's weird.

5
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:12,104
Thank god. You are Back, Daddy.

6
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:13,205
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:14,706
Mr. Lyle.

8
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:15,707
And Bridget is the new cleaner.

9
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:17,208
What am I, in the twilight zone?

10
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,609
We thought It would be a good idea to have Bridget

11
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,808
provide assistance in the capture of Jarod.

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,409
All I know is that he is barking a lot of orders
and all the smart people seem to be following them.

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,810
Maybe he's part of the Triumvirate.

14
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:27,811
The Triumvirate?

15
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:29,512
What the hell would they be doing here?

16
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:30,513
Seizing power?

17
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:34,012
Their appearance certainly would explain your father's disappearance.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,610
Why would they make my father disappear?

19
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:38,811
Because someone shot Raines.

20
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:42,012
They are not going to stop until they find out who did.

21
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,313
Who is Mr. Lyle?

22
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:47,514
He's the boogeyman.

23
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:55,115
The money was removed from the Center offices on the home through electronicly

24
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,716
We're double checking the transfer records.

25
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,017
We're hoping its an
accounting mistake.

26
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:04,818
Jarod stole fifteen million dollars of Centre funds and donated it
to charity.

27
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,819
The only mistake is rubbing our noses in it.

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,820
¡°Your welcome and surprisingly generous donation

29
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,121
will help the organisation for years to come.¡±

30
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:14,822
¡°The million dollars will bring

31
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,123
much hope and joy to the children.

32
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,124
God Bless.¡±

33
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:18,525
¡°Prayers be with you.

34
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:20,026
Have a nice day.¡±

35
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:22,727
I'll get him.

36
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:24,328
Please do.

37
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,829
Jarod's a lot more dangerous than I thought.

38
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,430
I like ice cream.

39
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,131
I really like ice cream.

40
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:32,732
-There you go Jarod.
-Thank you Phil.

41
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,733
Very interesting device.

42
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:47,434
It's a Wheelo.

43
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,135
And it's purpose is?

44
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:53,136
Nothing. It just goes round and round and round.

45
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,437
So it chases itself in a circle?

46
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:56,638
Yep!

47
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,839
Would you be interested in selling that for ten dollars.

48
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,140
Sorry!

49
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,541
Fifteen?

50
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:08,142
I couldn't. My grandpa gave it to me for my birthday.

51
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:11,143
-Twenty?
-Twenty-five!

52
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,144
Sold!

53
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:16,145
Thank you!

54
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:17,846
Wow!

55
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:21,847
Hey Kiddo!

56
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:26,648
Got you a burger, some fries.

57
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,348
Gonna set you up nice
here. Okay sir. Hey!

58
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,949
I'll be right back. Okay?

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,250
How are you doing Scooter?

60
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,451
Dewey! You, you shouldn't come around here.

61
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:22,052
How else are we supposed to get an ice cream cone.

62
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,253
Freaky weather.

63
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,154
Must be a hundred degrees in the shade.

64
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:28,855
You look good Scott.

65
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,356
What do you want Nick?

66
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:31,357
It's not what I want.

67
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,058
It's what I need . . . you.

68
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,159
Oh no. Not this time.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
Opportunity knocks.

70
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:40,761
Oh really?

71
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:43,562
Because you know your last opportunity cost me seven years of my life.

72
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,163
Jeez! Come on.

73
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:47,864
Ten months I've been out of prison.

74
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,265
I've just got my son back. Okay?

75
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,166
I'm not interested.

76
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,267
Get interested.

77
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,368
Dad?

78
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,569
Sean, go wait out front. I'll be right there.

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,370
Go on Sean. You do as your daddy says now, okay?

80
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,171
-But . . .
-Just go, please.

81
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,172
I see your dilemma.

82
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,173
The deal is one job and you and I are history.

83
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,374
Why don't you get Martinez?

84
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:17,175
Dead. He said no.

85
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,176
Crew?

86
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,177
The three of us plus one.

87
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,178
Who opens the safe?

88
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,379
Trinnie's sending some guy in from Brooklyn.

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,280
One, um, R.H. Cross.

90
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:36,881
Cross. I don't know him.

91
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:38,282
I don't know him either.

92
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,583
Trinnie swears by him even though he's only got one good arm.

93
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:43,684
A one armed safe cracker. That's . . .

94
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,385
I'm picking him up at three o'clock at the train station.

95
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,486
We start tonight.

96
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,687
Scottie, don't be late.

97
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,688
-Hey! Okay.
-What's that?

98
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,589
No. No. It's nothing.

99
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,690
These guys come back and give me a hard
time.

100
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:20,191
Hey nothing's wrong. Hey! Come here.

101
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,192
The train station.

102
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:32,593
Leaving town?

103
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:33,794
Business meeting.

104
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,095
Yeah? What do you do?

105
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,296
I'm a one armed safe cracker.

106
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,997
Yeah? Which
arm?

107
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:41,898
It's a good question.

108
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:58,899
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Then one day, the pretender run away...

110
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,501
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 2
Scott Free

111
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:32,802
Jarod is at something.

112
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,803
I can feel it coming on like the flu'.

113
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,404
After his recent brush with death

114
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,705
perhaps he's just enjoying life for a bit.

115
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,106
Maybe he decided to take a vacation.

116
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:45,607
Did you eat the whole onion for breakfast?

117
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,108
-Broots.
-What?

118
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,809
Sorry you missed the party in Omaha.

119
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,410
Jarod. What about Omaha?

120
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,011
Whoops! I guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time.

121
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,112
Good thing they sent a replacement.

122
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,513
What are you talking about Jarod?

123
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:05,914
I'm talking about the blonde.

124
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,315
Five ¨C seven, hundred and twenty
pounds, killer legs.

125
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,016
You're not giving up on me, are you Miss Parker?

126
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,217
You wish.

127
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,118
Your attention please.

128
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,419
-Announcing the immediate arrival of the Brooklyn Express at platform sixteen.
-That's my train. Gotta go.

129
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,320
What was that all about?

130
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,221
That's what I'd like to know.

131
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:42,122
R.H. Right hand.

132
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:43,323
Avani?

133
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,524
Don't look around. We're being watched.

134
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,125
Cops?

135
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,726
Listen up. I'm only going to say this once.

136
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:53,227
The location's changed. The new score is in Indianapolis.

137
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:55,628
I'm from Flatbush. I don't know anything about Iowa.

138
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,829
Indiana.

139
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,930
Same thing.

140
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:01,631
I wrote down the locations, the security codes, the whole deal.

141
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,332
Hey this ain't kosher.

142
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,033
I need to call Trinnie.

143
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,434
You do that and you lose this.

144
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,435
You get another package just like it when the job is finished.

145
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,236
Target?

146
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:17,237
That's my business.

147
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,438
I'm gonna meet you in four days at the Hotel Argyle in New York.

148
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,739
I've reserved a room in your name.

149
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,840
What's to keep me from walking away with the whole thing?

150
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,141
You do that and I'm gonna hunt you down like I did Martinez.

151
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,942
Then they'll be calling you ¡°No Hands¡±.

152
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,143
That's cold.

153
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,244
Your attention please.

154
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:43,245
-Announcing the immediate departure of the Indiana Star.
-That's your ride.

155
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,846
I want you to leave this at the job.

156
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:49,847
What is it?

157
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,548
It's a Hallmark card.

158
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,949
Always send the very best.

159
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,850
Leave it.

160
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:00,551
My tools are in there.

161
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:01,852
Buy new ones.

162
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,853
Because every cop along the line is looking for a man

163
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,354
with a bum arm carrying a black leather bag.

164
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:09,755
I'll take the bag and the heat.

165
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,456
How are you going to do that?

166
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,357
See you in New York.

167
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:35,758
See you in New York. See you in New York.

168
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,259
Your attention please.

169
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,760
Will Mr Paul Johnson, please meet your party . . .

170
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,061
Mr Cross.

171
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,762
Call me R.H.

172
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:03,763
Why wasn't I informed about Omaha?

173
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,764
No, no, no. Switch those masks, please.

174
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,865
With due respect Miss Parker,

175
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:11,066
it's not my job to inform you of Jarod's whereabouts.

176
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,867
It's your job to inform me.

177
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,468
-According to your file . . .
-My file?

178
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:18,569
Correct.

179
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,070
According to your file you've had Jarod trapped

180
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,171
in Las Vegas, Chicago, Washington and Florida.

181
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,872
It seems you've had ample opportunity to bring him back.

182
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,273
How would you like me to feed you my file.

183
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:35,174
There's no reason to be defensive about your shortcomings Miss Parker.

184
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,075
Moving in?

185
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,676
Possession is nine-tenths.

186
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:42,277
Now if you'll excuse us we have a meeting to attend.

187
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,978
Oh, any progress locating your missing father?

188
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,679
Who says he's missing?

189
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,580
A man packs his belongings and vanishes it's a logical assumption.

190
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,981
You gave that paper weight to your father when you were a little girl.

191
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,882
I thought he threw it away.

192
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,883
I'm sure he's fine.

193
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:17,384
He would never just leave without saying goodbye, would he?

194
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,485
You're dead and the rest of us are in handcuffs.

195
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:47,786
Twenty minutes.

196
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:51,387
That's all the time we got before security guard makes his run.

197
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:54,888
You're going to have to work faster to bypass that second alarm.

198
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,289
I'm working as fast as I can.

199
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,290
There was a day when you could have done it in your sleep.

200
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,391
Remember those days Dewey?

201
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,992
Scooter was the best I ever saw.

202
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:05,893
Sixteen years old, picking combination locks down at the YMCA ¨C

203
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,394
stealing wallets and jock straps.

204
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,595
What did you do with all those jock straps?

205
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,396
You know, it was a long time ago, Nick.

206
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:14,197
I took you off the streets.

207
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,298
I treated you like you were my own son.

208
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,599
Yeah! And when the heat was on

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
you hang me out to spend seven years in a federal prison.

210
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,801
Forgive me if I don't shed a tear about how things used to be.

211
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,402
I think we should cut him loose.

212
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:36,103
This job is going to be difficult enough in a perfect world.

213
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:38,704
I don't need a guy with his head half in the game.

214
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,505
I know him.

215
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:47,006
You on the other hand are a question mark.

216
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:51,107
Should I call Trinnie and get another locksmith?

217
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,308
Nah!

218
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,309
Let's try it again.

219
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,810
Long night huh?

220
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,011
Yeah!

221
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,712
Let's pick this up tomorrow night at my place.

222
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:29,413
-You got a pen. I'll write down the address.
-Yeah.

223
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:30,814
Oh thanks.

224
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:34,715
Oh here. Eight one six Highland.

225
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:38,216
Eight one six Highland.

226
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:45,517
¡°To Dad, Love Sean¡±. Is that your son?

227
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,518
My life.

228
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,719
He gave me this for father's day.

229
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,120
Come along Jarod.

230
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:09,921
Miss Parker just gave that man a present Sydney? Why?

231
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,822
It's father's day Jarod.

232
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,823
She gave her father a gift to show how much she loves him.

233
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,724
You want me to put this out on the net for you?

234
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:49,025
Oh yeah. I want to know who he is and where he comes from.

235
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,726
I bet my pension there's someone out there looking for this guy.

236
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,627
The part is still going to be the rent-a-cops

237
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:11,028
Oh I never thought I'd need this again.

238
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:23,329
What? Can't open a door you blow it off its hinges?

239
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,830
You never know what you might run into.

240
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,731
Sometimes looking dangerous is enough.

241
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:44,032
Sean, what are you doing here?

242
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,633
I live here.

243
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:46,934
No. No. You know what I mean.

244
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,035
You're supposed to be at Mrs Albertson's.

245
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,436
I went to the shop.

246
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,337
They said that you didn't show up today.

247
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:54,338
No I didn't.

248
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,739
Actually that was my fault.

249
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,740
I saw some of the furniture your father built

250
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,041
and I suggested we meet right away.

251
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,742
My name is Cross. RH Cross.

252
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,743
RH stands for Right Hand.

253
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:06,944
What's that stuff?

254
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,845
Oh well you never mind that stuff.

255
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:12,946
If your probation officer catches you skipping work

256
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,347
you're going to be in big trouble.

257
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,548
I don't want anything to happen to us.

258
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:17,849
Who's . . . . who's the father here.

259
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,450
Now I want you to go back to Mrs Albertson's house

260
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,051
and you stay there ¡®til I pick you up.

261
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,352
-But . . .
-Just do what I say . . .

262
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:38,053
Wait, wait, wait. Sean. Hey. Listen.

263
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:42,054
I just . . . I just need you to cut me a little slack here.

264
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,455
Hey! I love you.

265
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,656
I love you too.

266
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,257
See you Right Hand.

267
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,058
Nice to meet you Sean.

268
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,359
So why are you doing this?

269
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
What?

270
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,261
Why are you doing this job?

271
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,362
You don't want to be doing it.

272
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:21,763
Which means that Avani is holding some sort of big hammer over your head.

273
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,664
Oh I never knew my parents.

274
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:33,565
Sean's mother passed away after he was born

275
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,566
and I was sent up a year later, you know.

276
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:41,167
They passed Sean around from family to family like I was.

277
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,268
But you got him back.

278
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,269
And I intend to keep him.

279
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,070
Sean needs his father forever.

280
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,071
Jarod.

281
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,772
You need to finish the last simulation.

282
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,173
I made this for you Sydney.

283
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:12,574
For me?

284
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:17,675
Do you like it?

285
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,776
No Jarod, I don't like it

286
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:23,277
and I don't want to ever see anything like it again.

287
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,278
Let's get to work.

288
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,979
We just received these from our satellite office in Indianapolis.

289
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,280
His name's RH Cross.

290
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:48,381
He's a safe cracker from New York.

291
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,382
And we should be interested because . . ?

292
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:54,383
According to the office Cross's take was nearly a quarter million dollars.

293
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,584
He also left this behind.

294
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,185
According to the red notebook

295
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,286
Cross was going to rendezvous with Jarod

296
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,487
at the Argyle Hotel in New York City.

297
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,788
Jarod would never leave such an obvious trail.

298
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,189
Cross screwed up and left that behind.

299
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,890
That's quite a reach.

300
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:14,991
According to the security on the ground in Indianapolis

301
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,292
Cross was nearly caught.

302
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:24,193
Bridget go to New York. Find Cross.

303
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,794
I still don't understand the significance of this.

304
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:37,595
Jarod's sending you two a message.

305
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:38,596
Which is?

306
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:41,497
You're going nowhere fast.

307
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:49,098
We got eighteen minutes until the security guard makes his round.

308
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,099
I don't like this.

309
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
That van followed us ever since we left the warehouse.

310
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:54,601
-The cop's have made us.
-If they have...

311
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,402
...then they're still following Dewey all over the city.

312
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,003
I've got every contingency covered.

313
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,404
Let's just do it.

314
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:42,805
How long?

315
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:43,806
Five minutes.

316
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,007
You've got three.

317
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:48,108
What the hell is that?

318
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,309
He's early.

319
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,110
Twenty minutes huh?

320
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,211
What is it?

321
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:06,212
The guard.

322
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:11,913
How long before you're in?

323
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:13,414
Two minutes.

324
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,715
Oh. What are you going to do?

325
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,416
I'm covering contingencies.

326
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,117
I'm in.

327
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,918
You stole an electronic key card?

328
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,219
It opens the federal diamond depository in Wilmington.

329
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,820
What are you talking about?

330
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:42,521
He's saying there is no money.

331
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:44,322
Just another job.

332
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,323
That's what this has been about since the very beginning. Right?

333
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:52,324
Twenty million dollars in raw uncut diamonds.

334
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:56,825
My source says that the stones will spend thirty-six hours in the vault before distribution.

335
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,126
We move on Monday before the offices open up

336
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,827
and anyone realises the access card is missing.

337
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,528
Our deal was one job.

338
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:06,529
I'm out.

339
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,530
I'm sorry to hear that Scottie.

340
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:13,531
Change your mind the door's always open.

341
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,532
Best laid plans huh?

342
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,233
I'll see you tomorrow.

343
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:50,034
Dewey, this is Nick.

344
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,635
Hey! You okay?

345
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,336
Oh, I'm fine. Good.

346
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,337
I guess this sort of thing happens when you deal with a piece of work like Avani.

347
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,238
What's wrong?

348
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,239
This is too easy.

349
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,140
-What is?
-This.

350
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:12,541
Nick would never let me walk out with this much on the line,

351
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:14,542
not unless . . .

352
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:17,943
You got a car?

353
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,144
Yeah, come on.

354
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:23,345
Sean. Sean.

355
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,346
Sean. Answer me.

356
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,447
The house is empty.

357
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,548
I'm really sorry Scottie

358
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,849
but there's no way I can let this opportunity slip away.

359
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,350
I need you.

360
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,451
Your Sean is safe.

361
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,352
How safe he stays is up to you.

362
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:00,053
Research five took it off the National Police Net.

363
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:04,254
Why would Jarod's picture be on a law enforcement scan?

364
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:05,855
Well according to the background data

365
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:09,456
he's suspected of being part of a robbery group here in the North East.

366
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,157
What did you say?

367
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:12,058
The initial scan was sent

368
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,959
by a detective Harold Evans of the Middletown PD

369
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,460
Middletown?

370
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:20,461
That's less than a hundred miles from here.

371
00:25:21,162 --> 00:25:23,062
The question now is what is Jarod doing

372
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,763
associating with a group of street criminals.

373
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:27,764
Well actually this crew is slicker than that.

374
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:31,265
They have an MO of targeting high profile, high tech takedowns.

375
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:32,466
Such as?

376
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,667
Such as, um, payroll companies, security houses, mostly diamonds.

377
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:39,668
Run profiles on all the potential targets

378
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,669
within a five hundred mile radius of The Centre.

379
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,970
Everything this crew might be interested in

380
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,671
and I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans.

381
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,772
If he stole a Baby Ruth when he was six

382
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:51,973
I want to know how many nuts it had.

383
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,474
I've been going over the layout of the vault room.

384
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,875
I'm thinking we've got a better chance of blowing the inner doors.

385
00:25:58,676 --> 00:25:59,676
Sounds right.

386
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:01,577
What do you think Scottie?

387
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:06,678
I want him back.

388
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,579
I'm here right?

389
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,880
That's what you wanted.

390
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,081
Now you give me back my boy.

391
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:15,682
Focus, for the kid's sake.

392
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:20,083
These doors are only reinforced steel so we should. . .

393
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:21,984
Where my son is. And I want to know right now.

394
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:30,785
You pull the trigger on me, you pull the trigger on Sean.

395
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:36,086
Scottie let him go.

396
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,787
Where's Sean? Where's my boy?

397
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:42,288
We finish this job you and Sean'll be back together again, I promise.

398
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,289
Give me the gun.

399
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,190
Give me the gun!

400
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:01,591
Anything happens to my boy,

401
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:03,592
you'll wish I'd killed you.

402
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:14,193
Never underestimate the father-son relationship.

403
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,194
Jarod, I told you, I can't accept this.

404
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:46,495
But I made it for you.

405
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:49,796
I'm not your father.

406
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:52,897
This card is meant for someone else.

407
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:55,998
Don't you love me Sydney?

408
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:03,899
We have work to do.

409
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
It smells like gin in here.

410
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,301
What the hell is this?

411
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:35,302
I don't have the time or inclination to banter with you detective

412
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,603
so I will get right to the point.

413
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:37,804
You got a name?

414
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:44,005
Let's just say that I'm the person who holds your pitiful little life in her hands.

415
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,306
Is that so?

416
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:48,607
You tell me.

417
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:56,608
Go ahead, open it.

418
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,309
Where'd you get these?

419
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,610
That's not important.

420
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:12,711
What is, is that multiple copies are in my possession.

421
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:19,712
Good.

422
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,813
You put this picture out on the police net.

423
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:26,314
So?

424
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,315
I want him.

425
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,616
Can't help you.

426
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,817
I want him!

427
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:39,918
Harold.

428
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,719
I'm sorry for both our sakes.

429
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,920
I think I know where they're gonna hit next.

430
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,521
Relax your prostate boys.

431
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,522
We've got Jarod nailed to the wall.

432
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:13,623
The blonde's gonna bust a G-String when she . . .

433
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:14,924
What?

434
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,625
Please continue.

435
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:24,326
And while you're at it, maybe you can explain this.

436
00:30:24,627 --> 00:30:26,627
I spoke to RH Cross in New York.

437
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:29,528
He was sent to rob the Centre's office in Indianapolis

438
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:31,629
by a man matching Jarod's description.

439
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,530
We did try to warn you about that.

440
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:35,531
And how was Detective Evans?

441
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:37,732
You had me followed?

442
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:38,533
Yes I did.

443
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,334
And I want to know everything you know

444
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:42,235
and I want to know now.

445
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:51,036
Jarod's become part of a robbery crew.

446
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:54,637
Evans thinks their next target will be the Federal Diamond Depository in Wilmington.

447
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,238
I think we should blanket the area

448
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,739
and grab the whole bunch on the way in.

449
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
I disagree.

450
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,841
Oh what a surprise.

451
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:02,042
You have a better plan?

452
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,943
You've tried the open snare approach before.

453
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,244
Jarod's too smart to let us grab him on the outside.

454
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:07,745
You let him inside the vault,

455
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:11,846
lull him into a false sense of security and get him . . . clean.

456
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,747
Why don't we just mail him the diamonds and call it a day.

457
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:18,648
I know Jarod, the way he thinks.

458
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:20,549
Yet you still can't catch him.

459
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,950
Ladies! We follow Bridget's plan.

460
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,951
Mr Broots you'll be given complete control of the security system at the diamond depository.

461
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,752
You can do that?

462
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:31,453
suggest you visit the building

463
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,654
and begin implementing a total lockdown of the facility.

464
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,155
I don't believe this will work.

465
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:38,656
I think it's time to end this pursuit of Jarod once and for all.

466
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:46,357
You can do that?

467
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,158
Dewey got these photos of the Depository this morning

468
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,159
and the keycard will allow us to penetrate the outside security system.

469
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,260
Bodies on the ground?

470
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:58,161
Minimal.

471
00:31:58,162 --> 00:31:59,662
I made the lock system this morning.

472
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,563
It's hard wired infra-red.

473
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:03,864
Can you beat it?

474
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:05,265
Yeah! I can beat it.

475
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:07,766
We have no problem then.

476
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,867
Oh no. Not now.

477
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,068
What did you say?

478
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:17,869
Ah Nothing.

479
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,370
You look a little shook up.

480
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,171
No. No I'm fine.

481
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:25,372
We're all set then.

482
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,273
Oh no.

483
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:40,874
The coloured areas represent access points at the depository.

484
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:44,375
When the grid is red the building is locked down.

485
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,176
When it's green obviously it's not.

486
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:52,477
My guess is that Jarod and his crew will disarm the video monitoring system as soon as they gain entry

487
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:58,378
but it won't matter though because I'm the only one with the password to the system.

488
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,979
Very impressive Mr Broots.

489
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,180
I'm confident that Mr Broots has covered all contingencies.

490
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,681
Are you confident Mr Broots?

491
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:34,282
Here we go!

492
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:39,183
Alright. They're inside.

493
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,184
Let's end this.

494
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:41,085
Not yet.

495
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:42,086
Not yet?

496
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:44,687
He's sitting there waiting for us . . .

497
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:47,788
And knowing that gives us the upper hand.

498
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,289
The advantage of surprise.

499
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,290
Your point?

500
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,891
We have him Mr Lyle.

501
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,392
Let's not make another mistake.

502
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:39,693
What is that? What're are you doing?

503
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,294
I could stop and could explain it to you

504
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:43,495
or I could just do it and get the hell out of here.

505
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:45,196
The choice is yours.

506
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:56,797
Jarod would never have walked in here without a plan to walk out.

507
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,298
We stay the course.

508
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:04,599
Look, you want to sit on your collective thumbs, fine.

509
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
I'm going to do my job.

510
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,801
I won't allow you to compromise this situation.

511
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,502
You're going to shoot me?

512
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:47,503
Done.

513
00:36:58,204 --> 00:36:59,504
What happened?

514
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,505
Drill bit cracked.

515
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:04,106
-You got another one?
-Yeah in my bag.

516
00:37:04,107 --> 00:37:05,707
-I'll get it.
-No. No No. I'll get it.

517
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:06,408
I know where it is.

518
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:07,609
Pull out the broken bit.

519
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,410
Make it fast.

520
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,911
Scottie, give me a hand over here will you?

521
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:13,212
Just one second. I'm nearly done.

522
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:13,813
Now.

523
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:15,514
Yeah! Sure.

524
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:23,815
Hey!

525
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,016
You open these doors.

526
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:31,317
I want Scottie's son brought back to him.

527
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,718
Open the doors.

528
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,319
What are you doing?

529
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
Maybe you don't understand English.

530
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,621
I want Sean released.

531
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:39,022
I know Dewey's got him so you call him

532
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,423
and you tell him to cut him loose.

533
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,424
You open the door or you die.

534
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,225
Go ahead.

535
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,226
Tell him Scottie.

536
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:49,027
Nick don't.

537
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:52,028
Shoot.

538
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:59,029
You see, sometimes looking dangerous is enough

539
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,730
and sometimes it's not.

540
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:07,631
Now call him!

541
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,932
Dial!

542
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:34,833
This is Nick.

543
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:38,434
Let the kid go.

544
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:41,435
Yes! Right now!

545
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,236
The phone?

546
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:55,337
Hm, hm, hm. You should have called Trinnie.

547
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,738
Scottie, you let me out of here.

548
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:05,939
You know, every night for ah, seven years

549
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,840
I thought about, you know, what you were doing.

550
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:10,241
And then when I get out,

551
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,842
finally get my life back,

552
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:14,243
you take my son?

553
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:16,744
Scottie that was business.

554
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:18,545
This is personal.

555
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:22,246
Let's get out of here.

556
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:27,647
Don't leave me here.

557
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:30,748
Scottie!

558
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,649
Scottie! Don't leave me here! Scottie!

559
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,350
Hey! I've got two on the move.

560
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:40,951
Jarod.

561
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:42,252
Give me my gun.

562
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:47,053
If you want Jarod, give me my gun.

563
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:55,854
Tell the sweeper teams to move.

564
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:56,855
Wait. What the hell is this?

565
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:59,056
All the access points in the building are unlocking.

566
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:01,057
One area's still secured? What's that?

567
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:17,558
Sean!

568
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,459
Sean. Sean!

569
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,660
Sean. Sean!

570
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:29,661
Scottie!

571
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:36,862
Sean.

572
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:44,063
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!

573
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:46,964
Like I was so scared, you know.

574
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,865
Are you okay?

575
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:50,866
I'm okay.

576
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,467
You're fine? You're fine?

577
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:53,868
Dad, don't make a big deal.

578
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,469
Oh! Oh!

579
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,570
Look, I hate to break this up

580
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:01,571
but don't you think you two should be hitting the road?

581
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:05,572
Here, take this with you.

582
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:11,373
Don't worry, it's money that was owed to me.

583
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,674
Ah, you know, I don't understand.

584
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:22,075
Consider it an early father's day present.

585
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,276
Good luck huh?

586
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:29,277
Thanks.

587
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:31,478
Good luck.

588
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,579
Sydney.

589
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,280
Hope your stay at the depository wasn't too unpleasant?

590
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:56,581
You made quite an impression on the new regime.

591
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:00,882
I hope this doesn't end up making things harder for you.

592
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,883
Well, I appreciate your concern but that's not why I called.

593
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:07,684
I've been thinking,

594
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,685
and I was wondering if you ever thought about

595
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:13,686
what it would have been like to have been my father?

596
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:17,387
That was never an option Jarod,

597
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:23,888
so I never allowed myself to even entertain such a notion.

598
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:30,989
Well thank you Sydney,

599
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,990
for your honesty anyway.
