to become a U.S. citizen.

172
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,837
I pulled some strings, got him a commission
as cultural liaison at the local port authority.

173
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,839
[Water Running]

174
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,740
Now, I suggest you refocus 
your attention on Jarod...

175
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,405
and climb off my back
before I run out of patience.

176
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,971
Is that a threat?

177
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,142
What do you think?

178
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,062
You must really like sugar dates.

179
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,335
Actually... they're for a friend.

180
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,172
These prayer beads belong to-

181
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,940
Who are you?

182
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,005
I'm a friend of Kim Chay's.

183
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,642
I need to ask you some questions.

184
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,606
I built this for the other Cambodians
in the area.

185
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,939
A little piece of what we left behind.

186
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,501
Come.
We'll talk in the back room.

187
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,342
Please.

188
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:02,887
My country is very beautiful,
but it has seen much pain-

189
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:06,858
the war with America,
the genocidal march of Pol Pot.

190
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,795
The leader of the Khmer Rouge.

191
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,797
Yes.

192
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,856
Please, sit.

193
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,512
Nearly 25 years has passed...

194
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:36,078
but I can still smell
the burning bodies.

195
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:41,184
I keep these to remember,
to never forget what man is capable of.

196
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:47,991
Kim Chay was tortured
by the Khmer Rouge.

197
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:49,899
Worse, I'm afraid.

198
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,709
I had a brother
who lived in her village.

199
00:16:56,777 --> 00:17:00,474
Kim Chay's family was at home
when the soldiers came.

200
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,482
Her father, her mother, her brother...

201
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,619
were executed in front ofher.

202
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:09,952
Yousee, she wasn't born blind.

203
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:13,356
It is told that she attacked
the offiicer in charge...

204
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:16,362
to try and save her family...

205
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,194
that she drew his blood...

206
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,200
with her bare hands.

207
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,293
She was six years old.

208
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,408
This man?

209
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,911
Yes. This man is Colonel Chen Thon.

210
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:42,081
He was an officer in the Khmer Rouge-
an evil killing monster.

211
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:44,953
Did you witness Thon
commit these murders?

212
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,959
No.

213
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,791
The only witness
still alive is Kim Chay.

214
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:52,832
Some of the worst officers fled
to the Golden Triangle...

215
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,835
and flourished in the heroin trade.

216
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,667
If Colonel Thon is here...

217
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:02,470
then Kim Chay's life is in great danger.

218
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:06,000
And now, I fear, so is yours.

219
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,985
It turns out Mak is being sworn in by
the Port Authority tomorrow afternoon.

220
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:21,494
- And you intend to be there?
- Lyle knows his ticket to the top 
is still Jarod.

221
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:25,998
But all he seems to care about is making good
on a promise he made five years ago...

222
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,000
to a virtual stranger.

223
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,229
- Your point?
- There's more to this than we know.

224
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:32,704
And this Mak character is the key.

225
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:37,210
Hell, maybe Jarod'll
even make a surprise appearance.

226
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,546
- [Sighs]
- Well?

227
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:43,549
It's like Mak just appeared
out of thin air.

228
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,346
There's no birth certificate...

229
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,011
uh, school records, nothing.

230
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,749
- Records can disappear.
- They can also be erased.

231
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,725
I tried to open up a computer file 
on Mak I had found earlier today...

232
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:55,728
to double-check some information.

233
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:59,027
It was gone. Wiped out.
It's like any history of this man is-

234
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,590
- Being destroyed before our eyes.
- Lyle.

235
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:04,102
He told me he met Mak in Thailand.

236
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:07,106
Broots, take that photo,
run it again for a visual match.

237
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:10,234
And this time isolate the primary search
to Southeast Asian targets-

238
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,278
books, magazines, newspapers.

239
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:15,577
And hurry. This guy could be gone
before we find out who he really is.

240
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:20,476

I know you don't want to
talk about what happened...

245
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:21,274
but I'm not going to just go away.

246
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,848
I never had a real home.

247
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,459
I understand pain...

248
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,518
and loss.

249
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,524
Tell me about your blindness.

250
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:50,570
It was the time of Year Zero.

251
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:56,782
Pol Pot and his followers
wanted to stop Thon...

252
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,684
begin the war with themself
as the only power.

253
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:04,190
The killings began with the teachers.

254
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,794
Then the spiritual leaders.

255
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,057
And finally the artists.

256
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,067
Your mother and your father.

257

They were writer of poetry.

258

Words of comfort and joy to the people.

259
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:30,312
Colonel Thon make my father
read from his own book.

260
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,317
Then he kill him...

261
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:35,684
and the other members of my family.

262
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:40,954

263

264

But I have to examine your eyes.

265

00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:05,642

- This is Sydney.

272
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:50,556
I checked Kim Chay's eyes.

273
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,793
There's no sign
of damage or disease.

274
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,597
Have you ever encountered
something called terror silence?

275
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,604
First cases surfaced...

276
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,573
after the bombing
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

277
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:05,509
Hospitals began seeing patients
quite unable to communicate.

278
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,106
And yet these people showed no signs
of physiological damage.

279
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:13,448
Their afflictions were psychosomatic reactions
to the horrific savagery they witnessed.

280
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:19,185
I believe that Kim Chay's blindness
is a form of terror silence.

281
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,855
Well, the human mind is capable of
almost anything in order to protect its host.

a life of darkness, Sydney.

What approach should I take?

In some cases,
the stricken have responded...

285
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,605
by confronting the object of their terror.

286
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,608
But be very careful.

287
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:40,544
If she's pushed too hard,
she may never emerge from the darkness.

Miss Parker is planning a little trip
across the river this afternoon.

It seems she has become interested
in local politics.

to be more precise.

that's known as a conversion disorder.

I do not understand.

298
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,841
When something emotional,
something traumatic happens to a person...

299
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:22,115
it can manifest itself
in a physiological way.

300

Okay. I ran the picture of Mak

00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,927
because I was acquitted
of all the charges.

514
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:37,295
And as for the tattoo,
well, it's just one of several.

515
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,301
Want to see the others?

516
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:46,708
You bought yourself out of jail...

517
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:49,540
and used a war criminal
to broker the deal.

518
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:52,547
Well, you have been...

519
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:55,709
a busy little beaver, haven't you?

520
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:58,886
Okay.

521
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:01,889
[Exhales]
For the sake of argument, 
let's say that...

522
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:05,825
I did these horrible things
you're accusing me of.

523
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:08,329
- There's still no way to prove it.
- I have Mak.

524
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:10,831
Or Colonel Thon, as it turns out.

525
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,334
I put the right deal on the table...

526
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:17,429
he'll offer up you and
your psycho-pathetic sins 
on a silver platter.

527
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:20,409
No pun intended.

528
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,069
And...

529
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:27,013
to whom are you going
to give this information?

530
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:30,575
The Triumvirate, for starters.

531
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:33,781
I'm sure they'd be very
interested to know...

532
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:37,815
they have a flesh-eating serial killer
running their organization.

533
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,092
I cut a deal with Thon,
and you're finished.

534
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:46,328
Oh, um, I'm sure the Colonel
would be interested in your offer...

535
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,894
if, of course, he could hear it.
[Chuckles]

536
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:55,940
So I guess you didn't read
the paper this morning, huh?

537
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,615
The authorities are calling it 
a tragic accident.

538
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,580
I prefer to think of it as karma.

539
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:19,798
I'm just crazy about leftovers.
Aren't you?

540
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:22,337
My God.

541
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:24,396
You're insane.

542
00:41:35,718 --> 00:41:38,744
[Judge] And that I take
this obligation freely...

543
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:41,756
And that I take
this obligation freely...

544
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:44,816
without any mental reservation...

545
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,987
without any mental reservation...

546
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:48,825
or purpose of evasion.

547
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:50,661
or purpose of evasion.

548
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:52,496
So help me, God.

549
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:54,331
So help me, God.

550
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:59,238
Congratulations.
You are now all United States citizens.

551
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:13,946
- I didn't think you would come.
- Are you kidding?
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

552
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:17,823
- How does it feel to be a citizen?
- Like I finally have a home.

553
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:24,688
You heard that Colonel Thon
died in a car accident?

554
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,702
I saw the paper.
But you are wrong.

555
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,001
He died when you gave me
the courage to face him.

556
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:33,974
What made you change your mind
about confronting him?

557
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:38,309
A friend reminded me
how much beauty there was in the world.

558
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,044
Thank you, Jarod.

559
00:42:55,931 --> 00:43:01,130
I hope you find a way
to let the light back into your life.

560
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:07,465
Thank you.
