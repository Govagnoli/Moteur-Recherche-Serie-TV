1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,038
I told Jarod he was welcome
in the crew quarters...

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,098
but he said he wanted to be here,
nearer the animals.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,473
Careful where you walk.
He let some of them run free.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:15,878
Let's see if he left.
anything else besides... this stench.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,509
Oh, look at these.
Wild Kingdom, National Geographic.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,553
Hey, here's that crocodile guy.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,316
[Australian Accent]
"That mammoth snake's a real beauty, ain't she?

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,688
I'm gonna try and ride her."

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,456
You were saying that Jarod
claimed to be an animal behaviorist?

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,656
Yeah. Some zoo up north.
Some place in, uh-

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,189
Blue Cove, Delaware?
That's where I've been waiting...

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,702
since someone failed to notify me 
about this little road trip.

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,398
- Lyle-
- It's an oversight.

14
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,532
- Your people were gonna call my people.
- Actually, I was going to say-

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,340
- [Squishing Sound]
- Watch your step.

16
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:51,680
So, this is all Jarod did? Just watch TV
and, uh, play with his furry friends?

17
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,346
Actually, he spent most of his time
in front of the chimpanzee cages.

18
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,481
He'd sit there for hours,
mesmerized.

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,752
[Sydney]
Jarod knows the agony of being caged.

20
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,227
The prying eyes.
That's why he studied the chimps...

21
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:06,094
- because he related to them.
- [Laughs]

22
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,828
Nah. He just liked
watching them do it.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,235
- It?
- Yeah, you know, mate.

24
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,666
Okay, weird time.

25
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,509
Hot peppermint-flavored
massage oil.

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,606
Feather ticklers.
Edible apparel.

27
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,449
I guess it's all for, uh, for-

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,284
Sex, Broots.
The word is sex.

29
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,022
Looks like our little monkey's in heat.

30
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,621
[Woman]
Oh, good morning.

31
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,929
You must be Dr. Kinsey.
Welcome to the Arnett Center.

32
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,437
Thank you, Nurse Plenty?

33
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,871
- Plen-tay.
- Ah.

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,875
I took the liberty of
getting you all set up.

35
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,276
Your daily schedule is here.
Your weekly here.

36
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,473
Here's a little pamphlet
to explain the phones.

37
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,416
Andsince I didn't know which you prefer,
I brought you tea and coffee.

38
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,546
Well, thank you very much.
That's great.

39
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,922
At the Arnett Sex Center,
satisfaction is our motto.

40
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,458
Was there something else you needed?

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,725
Oh, yes, Doctor.

42
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,997
There is something I need very badly.

43
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,902
Uh, Nurse Plenty, I-

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,965
- Plen-tay.
- Uh-

45
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,172
Oh! I am so sorry, Doctor.

46
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,807
Monique slipped right past me.

47
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,851
She's not really a nurse, is she?

48
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,480
- No. She's your 9:00 patient.
- Ah. Monique Brooks.

49
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,289
Suffering from an uncontrollable urge
for sexual role playing.

50
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,496
We all like to pretend
once in a while, don't we, Doc?

51
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,662
Uh-huh.

52
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,864
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

53
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,873
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

54
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,502
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

55
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,979
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

56
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,484
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

57
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,747
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,584
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

59
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,387
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

60
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,394
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift..

61
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,642
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

62
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,679
It went from a couple of
quickies on the dryer-

63
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,687
To the upper deck at Dodger Stadium.

64
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,384
We crave daring places.
Need daring places.

65
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,689
It never occurred to us
that we had a problem.

66
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,854
Until this.

67
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,661
The paramedics said we were lucky
falling off the scoreboard like we did.

68
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:59,137
If it weren't for the peanut guy?
We might have been killed.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,699
Hmm.

70
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,709
We've been together five years.

71
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,235
And... we're still...

72
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,248
you know-

73
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,547
unspoiled... after five years.

74
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,786
Well, many people choose to wait.

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,694
In the grandscheme of things,
five years really isn't that long.

76
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,289
We've been married for four of them.

77
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,933
We have some videos here
I think might help.

78
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,301
Thank you very much!

79
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,369
Just don't try everything
in one night.

80
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,539
Excuse me.
You must be Dr. Kinsey.

81
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,641
- That's what it says on my door anyway.
- I'm Dr. Covney.

82
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,812
- All my patients call me Allen.
- Nice to meet you, Allen.

83
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,448
Hey. How many sex therapists
does it take to change a lightbulb?

84
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,822
Is there a lightbulb
that I can help you change?

85
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,918
It's just- It's just a joke.

86
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,761
[Man] Sort of like the funny ones,
only diffierent. Get used to it, Jarod.

87
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,393
Sex therapy's the butt of a lot of jokes.
The work we do at this clinic is important.

88
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,336
Speaking of which, Dr. Arnett,
my 11:00 group is waiting.

89
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,340
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,138
- Jarod, you got a minute?
- Uh, sure.

91
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,278
Syd, do you ever wonder
why these dolls...

92
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,979
always have the same surprised
expression on their face?

93
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,422
- [Snickers]
- Go ahead. Say it.

94
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,986
This is fish in a barrel territory.

95
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,363
Tell me about this stuff, boys.
Looks like Jarod could use a nice cold shower.

96
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,959
[Sydney]
Well, his is an inquisitive mind.

97
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,473
No reason he wouldn't use it
to explore his sensuality.

98
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,805
Syd's fancy way of saying
our boy has his horns up.

99
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,845
[Chuckles]
Horns up.

100
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,381
So, did you find anything useful?

101
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,782
Uh, well, basically whatever
turns you on, baby.

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,481
- To locate Jarod?
- Still lookin'. Maybe we'll get lucky.

103
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,953
- I'll keep you posted.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,522
[Lyle]
Forget to call me again?

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,398
Don't worry, Lyle. You can play 
with the toys when we're done.

106
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,372
The game's changing.
Due to recent lapses in communication...

107
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,843
I have decided to take a more 
supervisory role in the hunt for Jarod.

108
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:23,575
From now on, you'll report 
every aspect of your search to me.

109
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,810
Every aspect.

110
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,015
And if we don't, you'll go up to the Tower
and get us in lots of trouble.

111
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,581
Tattletale will go
so nicely on your resume.

112
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,385
Like you said, watch your step.

113
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,939
Reporting to Mr. Lyle can't be good.
Wonder what that means?

114
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,375
I know what it means to me.
Nothing.

115
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,279
I don't answer to anyone.
Especially my little brother.

116
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,285
This is interesting.
Shipping invoice, no return address.

117
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,685
Just a Web site.

118
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:07,124
lustyfun.com. This is where Jarod 
ordered all the stuff from.

119
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,718
Find a real address on that.
And, Broots, not a word.

120
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,128
- But Mr. Lyle just said we're supposed to-
- Broots.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,700
Think of your worst nightmare.

122
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,805
[Cracks Whip]

123
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,579
Mighty Bobcats from Marrietta University.

124
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,284
You must really like
these Mighty Bobcats.

125
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,986
You're a therapist.
You can use the term obsession.

126
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,552
Don't you have a similar attachment
to your alma mater?

127
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,564
I have a strong feeling
about the place.

128
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,830
Please. Jarod, I want to thank you
for stepping in on short notice...

129
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,428
and taking over for Dr. Blass.

130
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,441
I have to tell you, I'm concerned 
about Dr. Blass's patients...

131
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,807
how they're going to
make the transition to you.

132
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,312
Many have spent a long time
developing a trust with her.

133
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,008
Well, I'm going to have to work 
very hard to maintain that trust.

134
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,814
You never realize how many lives are affected
when a tragedy like Melissa's happens.

135
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,651
Has her attacker been caught yet?

136
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:16,025
No. Police are looking for one of her
court referral patients- Luke Carlo.

137
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,030
Melissa was working with him
as a term ofhis probation.

138
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,963
What happened?

139
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,934
Melissa had the admirable tendency
to care too much.

140
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,870
Carlo was a predator.
He took advantage of that.

141
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,874
He called her,
said he was having a crisis.

142
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,672
She ended up downtown
in some dive called the Eros Inn.

143
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,872
I hear she's in pretty bad shape.

144
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,881
She's a shell of who she was.

145
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,942
I just wish that you could have met
the Melissa that we all used to know.

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,988
She was a wonderful, loving woman.

147
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,935
[Dr. Arnett On Tape]
Mr. Truly, do you know why you're here?

148
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,377
Yeah. Judge Dettman
thinks I'm a pervert.

149
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,543
Tony?

150
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,552
I'm Dr. Kinsey.
I'm the new guy.

151
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,716
So, I understand you're the one who knows
everything that goes on around here.

152
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,555
Yeah. I live the lowly life of an intern.
I'm also workin' on my master's.

153
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,857
"Psycho-SexualAggression."

154
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,388
"Aberrant Sexual Behavior."
Hmm. Cheery stuff.

155
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,766
My honor's thesis is on sexual predators,
and I watch all the court referred sessions...

156
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,533
so I might as well make good use of it.

157
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,041
- Is this Dr. Arnett working with someone?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,543
This is your standard trench coat
and sneaker flasher. Here.

159
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,376
[Dr. Arnett] Everyone has fears.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

160
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,417
The key is to acknowledge
and understand them.

161
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,418
Yeah, well, I'm not afraid
of anything.

162
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,512
[Tony] It's amazing what you can learn
about a person's psyche by just watching them.

163
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,924
Mr. Truly, when I was a kid,
my father took me duck hunting.

164
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,122
I was laying out the decoys
and somehow the boat flipped.

165
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,688
I got trapped underneath
in this tiny air pocket.

166
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,759
The water kept rising
up my neck, over my chin.

167
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,830
I was terrified.
I nearly drowned.

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,911
To this day, I'm hydrophobic.

169
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,641
A shower, fine.
But a bath, a swimming pool...

170
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,979
the fear rises in me
as fast as the water.

171
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,076
See, fear is natural.
It's healthy even.

172
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,647
But we've got to control it.
We can't let "it" control us.

173
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,627
Did you observe Dr. Blass's sessions 
with Luke Carlo?

174
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,756
The guy that assaulted her?
Yeah. There are tapes of that guy 
in her office.

175
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,893
Scary dude. He was the kind of guy
that was just wound too tight.

176
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,770
Unfortunately for Dr. Blass, he decided that
she was gonna be the one that he went off on.

177
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,456
Interesting drawing, Broots.

[Clears Throat]
Oh, I was just doodling. It's nothing.

179
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,295
Well, doodling is often the most 
direct expression of the unconscious.

180
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,996
And I couldn't help notice there was
a certain resemblance to Miss Parker.

181
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,201
Yeah? Well, it's just
that she's so impressive.

182
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,268
You know, the way she's always in control.
The way she never shows fear.

183
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,042
Oh, God.

184
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,348
Fantasies about coworkers
are perfectly natural, Broots.

185
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,653
I'd be very surprised
if sublimated sexual feelings...

186
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,956
- didn't surface from time to time.
- So, what do I do?

187
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,156
Well, you can't keep
these emotions inside.

188
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,792
Otherwise they'll, uh, control you.

189
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,235
Oh, no. I'm not gonna tell her.

190
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,671
Tell her what?
Another crush, Broots?

191

Do you like the ocean?

My grandmother had a beach house
when I was growing up.

She was my sanctuary.
I guess the ocean still reminds me of her.

So, you said something
about a new patient?

244
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:42,631
Yes. She's suffering
from a generalized anxiety disorder...

245
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,696
brought on by emotional trauma.

Insomnia, panic attacks
and an overwhelming sense of fear.

The thing is, deep down inside,
I think she really wants to get better...

249
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,880
but the fear stops her.

250
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:02,220
Some days she's too scared
to even get out of bed.

Her heart races, she can't breathe.

She feels like she's losing control.

253
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,562

is she's beginning to think...

Of course, I don't have to tell 
you two about that, now do I?

326
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,035
Mmm. It'd be nice if you didn't.

327
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,799
So, uh, Roy, how do you know Jarod?

328
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:20,604
Never met. Except in chat rooms
and the humongous order he laid on us.

329
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:23,144
It got my wife's attention,
I can tell you that.

330
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,203
[Chuckles]
Yeah, we're still shippin' him 
stuff on back order.

331
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,614
Really? You know,
he just recently moved.

332
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,517
- You don't happen to have
his new address, do you?
- Well, yeah.

333
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,181
I think he gave it to us, yeah.

334
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:41,321
Yeah. 1248 Wren Park, Wyattville.

335
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:44,833
Yeah, 1248 Wren Park.
That-That's it.

336
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,734
Why don't you two come into the den.
We'll open up the sloe gin...

337
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:50,795
and see what kind of
natural wonders occur?

338
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:54,934
[Chuckles] I prefer my natural wonders
in national parks. But thank you.

339
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,206
Oh, come on, I just laid
some brand-new shag.

340
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,976
It's three-quarter pile,
extra thick padding.

341
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,074
Makes for some comfy cuddlin'.

342
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:05,052
- Are you talkin' about the four of us?
- You two swing, don't ya?

343
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,919
- [Broots Chuckles]
- Very tempting, Roy.

344
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,323
However, I could never share this stud 
muffin with anyone. Maybe next time.

345
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:14,761
- [Miss Parker] Buh-bye.
- [Door Opens, Closes]

[Phone Beeping]

347
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,197
Yeah, it's me.
They just left.

348
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,639
Jarod? I heard you went to see
Melissa last night.

349
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:28,870
- Yes, I did.
- I'm surprised you got in.

350
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:30,879
Most of the time
she's not even answering the phone.

351
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:33,472
- How is she?
- She's not doing well.

352
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:37,349
She's obviously paranoid and she's
exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behavior.

353
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,718
Now I realize she's been traumatized...

354
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,952
but I'm sensing there's something,
something else going on with her.

355
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,357
So, you think there
could be deeper issues at work?

356
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:48,955
Perhaps. I'm not sure.
I was hoping maybe you could tell me.

357
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,468
Up until all this, Melissa Blass was one of
the most solid, stable people I've ever known.

[Doorbell Rings]

359
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:04,972
Jarod, please.
I don't want to talk.

360
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,880
I have a delivery this time.

361
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:17,218
How would you like to take a walk 
on the beach?

362
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,632
[Waves Crashing, Seagulls Squawking]

363
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:33,738
Jarod, this is crazy.

364
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,939
We're shrinks.
Crazy is our business.

365
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,778
I want you to close your eyes.

366
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,250
Close your eyes.

367
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:48,484
Imagine yourself
at your grandmother's beach house.

368
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:53,256
Remember how safe
you used to feel there.

369
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:57,824
Hear the surf rolling in and out.

370
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,028
Feel the warm sun on your face.

371
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:04,436
Nothing bad can ever
happen to you here.

372
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,907
[Melissa's Voice]
And so I walked in.

373
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:09,672
There was a hand
clamped over my mouth.

374
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:13,408
Blindfold. Handcuffis.

375
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:17,282
- Handcuffs. Handcuffs.
- Jarod, I know what you're doing.

376
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,880
I use sensory-relaxation exercises
all the time with my patients.

377
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:24,119
And you know that they work.

378
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:28,186
It's very important that we talk about
the night you were attacked.

379
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:30,824
But I told you everything I could.

380
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,633
I need to know if you
actually saw Luke Carlo.

381
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,730
Did you actually see him?

382
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:40,401
[Breathing Heavily]
Well, he called me and lured me down there.

383
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,842
But did you see him?

384
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:47,314
Well, I don't know.
I don't remember. I-

385
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,317
- [Pills Rattling]
- No.

386
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:51,410
I guess I- I mean I never-
No, I didn't.

387
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:54,422
But why would anyone else
want me there?

388
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,357
Damn it! Oh!

389
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:08,063
- Pronil?
- Just a mild sedative.

390
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:10,196
Dr. Covney filled this?

391
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:12,536
He handles all the meds
at the clinic.

392
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,708
- Oh, hey, Jarod.
- Dr. Covney.

393
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:55,376
- Something wrong?
- How often are mistakes made
on prescriptions around here?

394
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:58,716
- Never. Why?
- Because this was given to a patient...

395
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,815
- in a bottle marked "Pronil."
- Daronex? Well, this is wrong.

396
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:05,656
This is really wrong.
Pronil's a sedative.

397
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:07,719
But Daronex- its main side effect
is heightened anxiety.

398
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,163
A steady diet of these will push
just about anybody over the edge.

399
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:12,723
Then explain to me
why you gave it to Melissa Blass?

400
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:16,294
Melissa? Now wait a minute.
I did not fill that prescription.

401
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:18,306
- Your name's on the bottle.
- I'm the one with the med permit.

402
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:22,606
My name is on all the labels.
But I didn't fill that one. Dr. Arnett did.

403
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:24,805
He takes care of
Melissa's meds personally.

404
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,577
But I can't believe
he'd make a mistake like that.

405
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:33,150
Neither can I.

406
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:41,623
We tried what you suggested,
Dr. Kinsey.

in your own bedroom.

408
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:49,167
Yeah. It was good.

409
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,900
Unfortunately, I got a little out 
of control. I couldn't help myself.

410
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:55,102
- I opened the curtains.
- And then it got great.

411
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:58,237
We had no idea we had so many
nice neighbors in our apartment complex.

from that lustyfun.com couple.

It's not the nicest place
Jarod's ever lived.

I'm so tired of being late for the party.

00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:11,415

we might not be late this time.

Look at all this stuff.

This computer's still warm.

431
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:25,223
Jarod's still living here.

432
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,064
This is too important
not to tell Mr. Lyle.

433
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,264
Don't you think this is important enough
that we have to let him know?

434
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:39,446
Sorry. I-I get hungry
when I'm nervous.

435
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:46,085
- Pistachio?
- Broots, when exactly...

436
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,749
did we find that receipt
in the box from Jarod's lair?

437
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:53,459
Right after Mr. Lyle left.

438
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,463
- We're out of here.
- What?

439
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:58,864
Why? Wait. Miss Parker?
Wait, don't leave me here.

440
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,320
[Melissa]
I can't believe the difference.

441
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,293
I already feel so much clearer.

442
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:02,057
I should've known something was wrong
with those other pills.

443
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:04,462
How could you?
They both look exactly alike...

444
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,894
and with what the Daronex
was doing to your mind.

445
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:12,698
Melissa? I think it's time
that we had a real talk...

446
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,365
about what happened toyou.

447
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,206
Look, you can put locks on your doors,
you can put bars on your windows.

448
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,007
But they can't keep out
the fear inside of you.

449
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,516
Yeah, but I already told you
everything I could.

450
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:30,281
The rest just isn't there.

451
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:33,517
Then let's go further back...

452
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,855
to the first time
you were attacked.

453
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:44,533
- How did you know?
- Call it... a doctor's hunch.

454
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:50,098
[Chuckles]
It was back in college.

455
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:53,268
You went to Marrietta University
with Dr. Arnett.

456
00:30:53,344 --> 00:30:55,278
Yeah.

457
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,581
I was, uh, coming home
late one night after studying.

458
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,643
[Sniffles]

459
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,415
[Sighs]

460
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,322
I was, uh, passing by
one of the old dorms.

461
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:22,798
A man in a mask
jumped out of the shadows...

462
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,174
grabbed me and pulled me inside.

463
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,274
They never even caught him.

464
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:35,142
But you bounced back.

465
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,585
Yeah, I did. I really did.

466
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:42,922
I got counseling, I-I worked 
really hard to become me again.

467
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:45,587
But always in the back of my mind...

468
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:50,828
part of me is just... shattered.

469
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:56,095
I don't know if I can 
bounce back this time.

470
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,207
No. No more crutch.

471
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,478
It's time to figure out what really 
happened downtown that night.

472
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,382
But how, Jarod?

473
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:12,013
By asking someone who knows.

474
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:16,185
Luke, I want you to just imagine
somewhere very peaceful.

475
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,457
It's very safe.

476
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,590
- Tell me what you're seeing.
- Trees.

477
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,032
Lots of green grass.

478
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,198
That's a-a park I go to sometimes,
not far from here.

479
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,369
There's a-a bench I like to sit on.

480
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,880
I look up at the clouds.

481
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:41,884
- Are you hearing anything?
- Music.

482
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:45,718
There's a-a guy who's always there...

483
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,723
and he brings his cello.

484
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,493
[Sighs]
It's really soothing...

485
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:56,158
sitting on the bench...

486
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,725
just listening to the cello.

# [Cello]

488
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:16,610
You were right, Luke.
It is relaxing here.

00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:19,281
- What the hell?
- You can run all you want.

490
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:23,452
But your guilty conscience 
will be tapping you 
on the shoulder wherever you go.

491
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:27,856
Look, I told you.
I'm not guilty of nothin'.

492
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,229
I didn't attack Dr. Blass.

493
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,964
I know. But someone made you
lure her to that hotel room.

494
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,133
Why?

495
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,438
Dr. Arnett attacked her,
didn't he?

496
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:45,414
I didn't wanna call her.

497
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,712
I like Dr. Blass.

498
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:52,882
She was the first person
who really seemed to care about me.

499
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:59,056
But one night, after a session...

500
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:01,063
Arnett grabbed me.

501
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,258
He told me he'd make me a deal.

502
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,824
He said that if I got her to the hotel,
he wouldn't report me.

503
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,837
I was, like, report me for what?

504
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:12,569
Missed appointments. Probation violations.
Whatever he could make up.

505
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:16,170
He said sending a deviant
like me back to prison was easy.

506
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:19,079
So either I called or he did.

507
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,684
The next day, when I heard...

508
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:29,454
I was, like-
I felt like I was gonna puke.

509
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:35,664
Dr. Blass always said...

510
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:39,430
"Recovery is a long road."

511
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:43,337
But one step at a time...

512
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,705
will get you there.

513
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:50,042
And I was taking those steps.
I was getting better, thanks to her.

514
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:53,140
Why didn't you come forward?

515
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,118
My word versus Arnett's?

516
00:34:56,186 --> 00:35:00,816
A lowlife like me
against the respected doctor?

517
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,194
No one will ever lay a finger on him.

518
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:08,322
Don't bet on it.

519
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:21,342
Jarod. You're working late.

520
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,710
Yes. I have a case that's
starting to trouble me.

521
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:27,307
Anything I can help you with?

522
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:30,319
Maybe you can.
Being that you have such an insight...

523
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:33,550
into the mind of sexual predators.

524
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:37,219
You see, I'm having trouble
understanding his motivation.

525
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:40,457
Well, you know, Jarod,
it's control.

526
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:43,728
Sex may be the avenue they choose...

527
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:48,238
but the underlying motivation-
it's always control.

528
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:53,267
To get it, he puts his victim down.

529
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:56,710
He debases their humanity.

530
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,715
It's the only way the predator
can convince himself he's worthy.

531
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,616
And if he refuses to seek treatment?

532
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,015
Without admission of responsibility...

533
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:11,026
there's very little hope
for improvement.

534
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:15,053
Then I guess I'd better find
a more radical form of therapy.

535
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:19,434
Thank you for your... insight.

536
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:45,720
Everyone has fears.
To this day, I'm hydrophobic.

537
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:56,700
So, Monique, you wanna play dress-up?

538
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:58,365
Really?

539

[Door Closes]

540
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:09,685
Melissa?

541
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:14,716
Melissa, is that you?

542
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:30,740
Melissa, I didn't know
you were out of the house these days.

543
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:41,247
Monique?
[Groans]

544
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,952
- Jarod.
- Just a B-12 shot, Dr. Arnett.

545
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:53,263
Whoops. It's a sedative.

546
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,461
Don't you just hate it
when medications get switched?

547

549
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:25,160
- Jarod?
- Relax, Doctor.

550
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:27,628
You're strapped down
and going nowhere.

551
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:30,360
Welcome to the Eros Inn, Doc.

552
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,267
Oh, that's right.
You've been here before.

553
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:35,703
What the hell are you doing?

554
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:41,335
Just tryin' to help you relax.
And what's more relaxing 
than a nice, warm bath.

555
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:45,643
- No, no! No, don't! Don't, don't, don't!
- That's right. Hydrophobia.

556
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:48,981
You really should see
a therapist about that.

557
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:52,146
Jarod, you're crazy.
What'd I ever do to you?

558
00:38:52,222 --> 00:38:55,783
Oh, it's not what you did to me.
It's what you did to Melissa Blass.

559
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,453
You're out of your mind.
Everybody knows Luke Carlo attacked her.

560
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:03,989
Not everyone.
Allow me to float my theory.

561
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,228
[Gasps]
Damn it,Jarod! You can't do this!

562
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,328
It's all about control.

563
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:11,738
Like back when you were in college,
when you were a Mighty Bobcat.

564
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,572
The way you took control
over those four innocent girls.

565
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,373
You don't know what
you're talkin' about.

566
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:18,880
I may not have all the details,
but I do have the broad strokes.

567
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:24,046
Oh, speaking of strokes?
Do you know yours? Breaststroke. Backstroke?

568
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,988
'Cause you're going to need them
the way this water level's rising.

569
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:29,651
- I swear!
- Now you know how Melissa felt.

570
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:32,593
Powerless. Drowning
in her very worst fear.

571
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,358
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you did it to her!

572
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:37,730
Jarod, no!
Please don't!

573
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:44,032
It was her fault! I put her down
12 years ago! She should've stayed down!

574
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:47,736
But she didn't! She wouldn't let
what you did to her destroy her!

575
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:51,508
- She kept rubbing it in my face.
- Then you tried to ruin her for good.

576
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:54,516
From the day you hired her at the clinic,
every day since then...

577
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,518
you've been planning
her second assault.

578
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,383
She had to learn her lesson!

579
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:03,392
Now it's time that you learn yours.

580
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:10,023
She had to learn her lesson!

everyone has fears.

[Whimpering]

585
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:50,796
Miss Parker,
I was starting to worry.

586
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,672
I hadn't heard any developments
in your Jarod pursuit.

587
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,679
That's because there was no Jarod pursuit,
was there, Lyle?

588
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,580
It was all just a setup.
The bogus shipping report...

589
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,641
the fake lair with all the sex toys.

590
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,586
The swinging couple, however,
was a very cute touch.

591
00:41:05,655 --> 00:41:09,557
You don't usually show so much imagination
when trying to screw me over.

592
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:12,686
I don't have the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

593
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:18,462
Next time, do your homework.
Jarod's allergic to pistachios.

594
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:31,312
- [Broots] God, she's amazing.
- Go on, tell her.

595
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:35,477
No, Syd. Women don't wanna be told.
They wanna be shown.

596
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,851
It's time I make my move.

597
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:49,663
Broots, I'm flattered.

598
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,293
In fact, it's kind of sweet.

599
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:56,866
But it's never gonna happen.

600
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:01,908
Good luck with
the chinny-chin-chin.

601
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,666
Mmm.

602
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,908
Mmm.

603
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:38,175
Oh, that sun feels nice.

604
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:41,945
[Sighs]
Well, it's a start, huh?

605
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,215
Today the porch,
tomorrow the world.

606
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:49,722
Melissa, there's a lot
of people who miss you...

607
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:54,230
who want- who need your help.

608
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:58,298
Well, I'm sure helping them...

609
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,962
will be the best therapy for me.

610
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,165
One step at a time
is the best therapy.

611
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:07,540
Jarod, thank you.

612
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:18,280
Good luck.
