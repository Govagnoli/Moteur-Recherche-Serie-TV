00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,729
[TV: Man]
Good morning, Washington.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,736
It's a sunny new day
here in the nation's capital...

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,738
but don't put away
those umbrellas just yet...

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,639
as there's a storm
moving up the seaboard.

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,234
The five-day forecast will follow
today's Washington Report.

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,246
[TV: Woman]
We're at Secret Service headquarters...

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,248
for today's Washington Report...

8
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,377
where officials are trying to piece together
the final hours of Todd Baxter...

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:24,890
a young agent whose body was recovered
from the Potomac River just last night.

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,892
Todd.

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,088
[Panting]

[Panting Continues]

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,935
[Man Shouting]
Jarod! Jarod!

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,147
Mike! Through here!

15
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,623
- Stop!
- [Shouting, Indistinct]

16
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,523
There he is! Get him!

17
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,672
Stop! Wait! Wait!

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,840
Will you help me, please?
My car is broken down and I need a ride.

19
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,718
- Please?
- All right. Hop in.

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,033
[Beeps]

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,093
Get me Mr. Parker.
The Pretender has escaped.

22
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,479
I'm free.

23
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,708
I'm Todd- Baxter.

24
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,911
- Jarod.
- Jarod.

25
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,682
- Got a last name?
- Just Jarod.

26
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,592
Just Jarod, huh?
How about them apples.

27
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,153
- [Chuckles]
- Apples?

28
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,536
I, uh- I don't know
how I can ever thank you.

29
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,770
Oh, just someday down the road
do somethin' nice for somebody.

30
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,404
The Secret Service is baffled
by the apparent suicide.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,506
After just three-and-a-half short years
as an agent...

32
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,212
how did such a promising young man
end up dead in the Potomac?

33
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,087
A question that may never be answered.

34
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,286
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,295
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

36
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,924
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,401
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,906
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

39
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,168
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

40
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,006
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

41
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,808
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

42
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,816
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.

43
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,064
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

44
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,876
[TV: Woman] More details emerging
in the apparent suicide...

45
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,878
of young Secret Service Agent
Todd Baxter...

46
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,882
who spent the final hours of his life
at this D.C. hotel, the River Glen.

47
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,475
Sources say he jumped
to his death in the Potomac...

48
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,350
after a night of drugs and depression.

49
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,984
However, friends and family we spoke with
say this is not the Todd Baxter they knew.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,324
I'm gonna make a difference.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,665
Does that sound hokey?

52
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,635
Hokey?
Is that a sporting event?

53
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,468
[Laughs]
Yeah.

54
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,135
Anyhow, all my life
I've known that, uh...

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,337
D.C.'s where things get done.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,314
It's a tough town and all that...

57
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,716
but with smarts and hard work,
a guy can-

58
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,448
Change the world.

59
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,315
But what changed Todd Baxter?

60
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,884
Was it the pressure of life
inside the Beltway...

61
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,522
the demanding years
in the Secret Service?

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,328
The answers are through those doors.

- Agent Holder?
- Yeah?

66
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,840
- Special Agent Wilkes.
- Oh, right, right, right.

67
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,848
- The behavioral science guy.
- Yes, I just got in from the airport.

68
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,851
I bet you didn't have lunch, either, did you?
Here. You hungry?

69
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,288
"Cup O'Soup. A meal in a minute."
That's a rather clever idea, isn't it?

70
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:55,054
- Idea? Are you from the Seattle office 
or Mars?
- Somewhere in between.

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,722
Well, I bet the boss
wants to see ya. Talbot.

72
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,890
He's got the place buzzing
over the Baxter thing.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,424
- You knew Todd?
- Yeah. Can't believe he'd do 
something like this.

74
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,437
Neither can I.

75
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,372
- Wilkes. Ellis Talbot.
- Sir.

76
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,375
Seattle faxed me
your papers this morning.

77
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,571
I could use a man with your expertise
about now. Follow me.

78
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,950
The maid called the D.C. cops this morning
and they called the Bureau.

79
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,952
F.B.I.'s running things.

80
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,454
Hoover boys are lookin'
at Baxter's body now.

81
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,957
From what I understand,
he'd been in the Potomac about a week.

82
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,960
He put a "Do Not Disturb"
sign on the door...

83
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,588
which is why it took the hotel people
so long to finally get curious.

84
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,427
[Holder]
Which fits with the rest of the story.

85
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,434
The night Todd checked in here,
witnesses downstairs say...

86
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,903
that he met up with an old girlfriend 
in the bar, they came here for a little sex...

87
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,099
and a lot of heroin.

88
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,109
Has anyone questioned the girlfriend?

89
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,111
The feds are still looking for her...

90
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,114
but indications are she was long gone
before Todd went on his bender.

91
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,810
And jumped.

92
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,412
[Talbot] Demons like his, I sometimes wonder
if I ever knew the real Todd Baxter.

93
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,853
Sure you want to get out here?

94
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,528
Yes.

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,932
- This will be fine.
- All right.

96
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,199
Your car didn't really
break down, did it?

97
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,069
No.

98
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,134
Why did you help me?

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,205
My gut told me to trust you.

100
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,648
Wait a second.

101
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,653
There you go.

102
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,451
Oh, no. I-I couldn't possibly.
You've helped me too much already.

103
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,856
Forget it.
Have an ice cream cone on me.

104
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,893
Ice cream?

105
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,898
Is it good?

106
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,957
[Chuckles]
Yeah, it's very good.

107
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,863
Look, I don't know what cave
you've been livin' in, Jarod, but...

108
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,874
you're ever in D.C., look me up.

109
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,671
I will.

110
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,512
Thank you.

111
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,914
Jarod?

112
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,046
You two work with the feds if you have to,
but report only to me.

113
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,852
So what is it you're not telling me?

114
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,692
F.B.I.'s floating a theory that this was 
a homicide. That's where you come in.

115
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,756
Baxter's suicide's embarrassing enough
without far-fetched speculation it was a murder.

116
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,426
You're the behavioral science expert.

117
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,369
Get them to see the truth
about Todd's psychological troubles.

118
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,006
The truth is all any of us want.

119
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,112
- Agent Ted Holder.
- Hi.

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,278
This is Special Agent Jarod Wilkes.

00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,224
V.C.T.F. The Bureau's finest.

123
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,090
I brought the Baxter autopsy files.

124
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,154
You boys have some catching up to do.

125

- [Muttering]
- Daddy? I just heard.

126
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,365
Oh, there's nothin' to fear.
The doctors just want the baby 
for observation.

127
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,037
Your little brother's gonna be just fine.

128
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,981
After all, you helped my new son 
into this world,
got me back to my old desk.

129
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,986
I've never been more proud
to be your father.

130
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,319
Oh, you got that look in your eye.

131
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,520
- What lie has Jarod been tellin' you now?
- It's not Jarod.

132
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,586
It's me.

133
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,593
I don't know, it just-
[Sighs]

134
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,934
So much has happened
in the last few weeks.

135
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,806
Bridget dying,
you coming home, the new baby.

136
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,677
Ah, I understand. Yeah.
You want things to be diffierent.

137
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,978
Listen, come here.
Come here.

138
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,187
You must never lose your desire
to get Jarod back.

139
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:46,282
The new child is the future of the family,
but Jarod is the future of the Centre.

140
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,259
Why?

141
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,192
He's our greatest achievement,
our biggest asset.

142
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,926
However, consider your life
officially changed.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,969
It's a brand-new day at the Centre.

144
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,402
- [Chuckles]
- [Kiss]

145
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,543
My attempts at cross-pollination
appear to be successful.

146
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,940
Very good.

147
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,523
Lies! Damn lies!

148
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,070
Lies!

149
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,197
[Jarod]
They finished the autopsy already?

150
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,208
Yes, it's all there in the report.
Oh, and get this-

151
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,211
Malone tells me they're not just thinking murder.
They're thinking signature killer.

152
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,213
- A signature killer?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,216
- Well, apparently their profiler 
has a theory.
- Profiler?

154
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,275
- [Woman] That's me.
- [Knocking]

155
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,590
- Were you expecting someone else?
- Call it deja vu.

156
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,355
With a twist ending.

157
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,727
- Jarod Wilkes.
- Rachel Burke.

158
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,733
- Agent Ted Holder.
- Nice to meet you.

159
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,703
Not to be rude, but isn't your signature killer
theory a bit presumptuous?

160
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,704
Well, it's just that. It's a theory.
But there's evidence to support it.

161
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,711
- Like?
- Like our autopsy.

162
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,714
It confirms that Todd Baxter
did not die from a jump.

163
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,216
He was strangled to death.
Probably a piano wire.

164
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,753
And despite a week in the Potomac,
we found these.

165
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,551
- Ligature marks.
- On both wrists.

166
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,752
Not exactly consistent with suicide.
Not to be rude.

167
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,354
And he was drugged, and there is 
evidence of sexual activity.

168
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,264
He may have a sexual need to be tied up,
maybe even asphyxiated.

169
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,302
[Phone Rings]

170
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,075
Or someone else tied him up.

171
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,081
Your signature killer?

172
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,709
- Yeah. It's just, uh-
- Instinct.

173
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,244
Somethin' like that.

174
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,582
They've located Todd's girlfriend,
an Emily Sadler.

175
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,527
I'd like to question her myself.

176
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,895
- I'll keep you in the loop.
- I look forward to that.

177
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,775
[Woman]
Todd and I met at Columbia.

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,540
I studied journalism,
and he was a criminology major.

179
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:28,118
What they say about Todd is true.
He was a really good guy.

180
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,655
But he had demons.

181
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,918
What kind of demons?

182
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,426
The kind he couldn't beat.

183
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,429
And this town made it worse.

184
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,795
I'd never seen him that wrecked.

185
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,528
- He was in a bad place that night.
- He had a drug habit, didn't he?

186
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,433
Yes.

187
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,200
It haunted him.

188
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,978
Did you try to help him?

189
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,015
Well, what do you think
I was doing that night?

190
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,019
That's why I went upstairs.
I was always tryin' to help him.

191
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:06,252
But then he pulled out the drugs,
and he started drinking.

192
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,719
And we started fighting.
Some things were said, so I left.

193
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,027
So you just... walked out.

194
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,898
Now that's my demon.

195
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,742
So, in your mind,
Todd Baxter was perfectly capable...

196
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,303
of jumping off that balcony?

197
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,212
Yeah.

198
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,219
He was always going too far.

199
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,278
That's the way he was.

200
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,890
Unless you know something I don't.

201
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,758
[Miss Parker]
This can't be right.

202
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,101
Sydney wouldn't have trashed these.

203
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,104
They're like therapy for him.

204
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,163
Ho-ho. Hello.

205
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,175
[Computer: Sydney]
Damn lies!

206
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,677
Always knew he was a mad scientist.

207
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,446
- The Centre does that to you.
- Go back to before he freaks out.

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,511
Oh.

209
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,347
[Miss Parker]
Angelo.

210
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,121
- Zoom in and freeze it.
- [Broots] It's a watch in a Centre bag.

211
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,595
Angelo must have dug it out
of the Centre archives.

212
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,963
And being an empath, he had to know
the effect it would have on Syd.

213
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,729
I hate seeing him like this.

214
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,899
[Exhales] How many black holes
has Sydney helped me out of?

215
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,737
Why didn't you come to me?

216
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,404
[Talbot]
You got 48 hours to find the truth.

217
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,744
The F.B.I. wants to chase theories,
they can do it till their badges fall off.

218
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,276
But I can tell you, I will not have 
my division wasting resources on Agent Baxter.

219
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,288
- Tell Jerry we're in, please.
- Sir, he is one of our own.

220
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,290
That's not the issue.

221
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,293
This whole mess has put a spotlight on us,
and it's a bad one.

222
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,295
Are you suggesting
that the F.B.I. is lying?

223
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,490
No. I'm saying
Agent Baxter was lying.

224
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,500
For all we know,
a heroin dealer killed him.

225
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,503
It's bad enough that this didn't 
show up on a background check.

226
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,938
- Now we have to find out the kid
had a million sick habits.
- A million and one.

227
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,305
Jerry Linden,
Office of Communications.

228
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,105
Special Agent Wilkes.

229
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,113
- Pleasure.
- If a reporter calls you, send him to Jerry.

230
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,378
Thank you, sir.
Do not leak this. It's not good.

231
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,251
Agent Baxter was arrested in college-
possession of heroin, intent to sell.

232
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,758
Well, I guess we'd better
just drop the case right now.

233
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,623
Case? You sound like the feds.
You got your 48 hours.

234
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,754
Then you're back in Seattle.

235
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,801
May I have this?
You've got it all on file.

236
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,202
We don't need this stuff
about Todd floatin' around.

237
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,263
Come on in.

238
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,839
The shredders in Seattle are smaller.

239
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,849
Secrets in D.C. are bigger.

240
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,353
You should see the size of the janitor's cart
they haul this stuff away in every Friday.

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,218
- Did Talbot put his personality 
through that thing?
- [Chuckling]

242
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,349
Have a seat.

243
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,450
Let me tell you somethin' about Talbot.

244
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,623
You know all that crap about Boy Scouts
who run alongside the president's limo?

245
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,327
He doesn't just buy it.
He lived it for 25 years.

246
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,199
Todd Baxter would have too.

247
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,397
Tell me something.

248
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,911
If they were such good friends,
why did she walk out of that hotel room?

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,881
I don't know.
He had an addiction.

250
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,815
Sometimes walking's the only option.

251
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:51,005
[Screaming]

252
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:55,039
Emily!

253
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:06,223
[Yelling, Groaning]

254
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,892
Damn!
[Groans]

255
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,958
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,146
They said muggings were up,
but I had no idea.

257
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:27,148
Thanks.

258
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:29,707
I'm glad you're all right.
Thank you.

259
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,319
That wasn't a mugging.
I think you know that.

260
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:41,496
Why did you leave Todd
at the hotel that night?

261
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:45,466
What do you want from me? He was my friend.
It's not my fault he couldn't see that.

262
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:49,733
He was murdered, and someone is trying 
to destroy what's left of his name.

263
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,297
I don't think you want that.

264
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,275
Why are you lying?

265
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,180
[Sighs]

266
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,019
I came to this town
to make a difference.

267
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,993
You sound like Todd.

268
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:19,000
- You knew him?
- He saved my life once.

269
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,708
[Sobs]
God, I miss him.

270
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:29,404
Then help me.

271
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,970
Help me protect his memory.

272
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:38,011
[Sighs]

273
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,959
Todd said he was meeting
someone at the hotel...

274
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:47,963
but he still had time to help me
with a problem I had at work.

275
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,124
That was Todd.

276
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,997
We had dinner and I left.

277
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:56,232
I hadn't heard from him
in a week, and then...

278
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,239
I see the news.

279
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,798
When they found his body.

280
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:06,506
I get this phone call.
The man on the other end knows where I live.

281
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:09,016
He knows where I walk my dog,
everything.

282
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,747
- He asked you to lie.
- He had the lie worked out.

283
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,755
It was scary.

284
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,587
I had to say that
it was sex and heroin.

285
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,594
Todd and I were best friends.
Just friends.

286
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:23,223
We were never together in his room 
that night, and he never did drugs.

287
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,097
They said he was arrested
for possession in college.

288
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,603
A total lie.

289
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,663
The man on the phone threatened
to end my career. I didn't care.

290
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,733
Todd was my friend.
I told him I was gonna call the papers.

291
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:38,377
And then he told me
to check my mailbox.

292
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,051
That's my father.

293
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:58,890
They made me choose between
Todd's memory and my father's life.

294
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,802
I-
[Exhales]

295
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:05,272
You did the right thing.

296
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:08,367
You did the right thing.

297
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,987
Did Todd tell you
who he was meeting that night?

298
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,819
No. Uh-

299
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:26,590
[Emily] Allhe said was,
"I'm gonna be in the paper soon."

300
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,755
And then he tapped his briefcase.

301
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,927
Like there was
something important in it.

302
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,908
I want you to stay at my place.

303
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,967
You'll be safe there.

304
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,614
There's no safe place
from the monsters.

305
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:49,412
Todd said D.C. was like
a big masquerade ball...

306
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,680
only the people in disguise
were monsters.

307
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,746
If you want to make a difference,
you gotta pull off a few masks.

308
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:57,019
That's why he's dead, Jarod.

309
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,584
[Angelo]
No hope.

310
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,854
No hope.

311
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,370
What is "hope," Angelo?

312
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,032
Sydney lost hope.

313
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,099
Sydney lost hope.

314
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:17,874
- What does it have to do with that watch?
- Centre takes hope.

315
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,610
What did they take, Angelo?

316
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,822
Check Syd's file. It's a long shot,
but see if there's something about "hope."

317
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,794
Okay.

318
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:37,658
Mr. Parker takes hope from Sydney.

319
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,896
What does my father
have to do with this?

320
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:48,500
[Tires Screeching]

321
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,145
[Sobbing]

322
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:02,419
[Phone Ringing]

323
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:14,068
Hey, how about I cook you lunch?

324
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,331
No, thanks. I'll pass.

325
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:19,101
You have your vegetable,
your chicken noodle, your shrimp gumbo.

326
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,200
Shrimp almost tastes real.

327
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:22,904
Mmm.
Tempting, but no.

328
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,210
This better be good.

329
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:28,944
Todd Baxter tells his friend,
Emily Sadler...

330
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:31,077
that his name is about to be put 
into the paper...

331
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:33,348
that he has something
important in his briefcase.

332
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:36,687
Three days later, Bill Radcliffi, 
reporter, covers Secret Service 
for the Washington Journal-

333
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,420
dies in a car accident.

334
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:40,928
An accident with one incongruous detail.

335
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:44,763
Ligature marks,
like those found on Todd Baxter.

336
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:49,362
I believe Baxter was going to meet this reporter
to expose something that he discovered.

337
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,372
And that "something"
was in his briefcase.

338
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,499
All we found was office paperwork.

339
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,635
What makes you so damn sure?

340
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:58,612
Let's just say that
I've gotten into the mind of the killer.

341
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,376
You've what?

342
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:06,653
Think about it. The killer wants 
to cover up what Todd has discovered.

343
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,714
That's why he had 
to kill the reporter too.

344
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,165
I don't think so.

345
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:21,499
The killer's into the act- the power
he exhibits over the helpless victim.

346
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,630
There's a purity in that violence.
It satisfies him.

347
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:27,403
I mean, if there is a cover-up,
someone else is calling the shots.

348
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,444
- Someone else?
- Yes.

349
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:32,106
- And this theory is based upon what?
- Hold on a second. Hold on.

350
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:34,445
There are two suspects?

351
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,486
You two might want to get on the same page.
You're running out of time.

352
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,615
Holder, come into my offiice.

353
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,318
You and I, we have to talk.

354
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:45,986
- Talbot could shut us down.
- Not me.

355
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:49,691
He could seal the evidence. It would take months
to reopen the case, even for the F.B.I.

356
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,529
- You and me, we have to work together.
- Yes, but not blindly.

357
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,796
But you can make these leaps of logic?
How does that work?

358
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,360
It's complicated.

359
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:59,033
Well, that isn't good enough.
There's evidence of a cover-up.

360
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:01,167
- Not by this killer.
- Then by who?

361
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,803
Todd Baxter was at that hotel room
to meet the reporter...

362
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,608
so he could expose the killer.

363
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:09,276
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe he needs to kill?
- "Needs to kill." No.

364
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:11,616
Maybe you ought to get into
his mind again. How does that work?

365
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:14,247
It's complicated.

366
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:17,415
[Exhales]

367
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,361
You know, Jarod, I think that under
different circumstances you and I-

368
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,060
Yes?

369
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,533
Still wouldn't have gotten along.

370
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:32,630
Is that so?

371
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,337
Well, for starters, you drink
processed powder and hot water.

372
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:41,247
You never know how tasty something's
going to be unless you try it for yourself.

373
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,252
Well, if we ever make it out of here,
I'm gonna show you what real food is like.

374
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,050
- I make an amazing bouillabaisse.
- Really?

375
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:49,353
Mm-hmm.

376
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:52,360
- Can you drink it out of a mug?
- You can drink it out of whatever you like.

377
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,824
[Chuckles]

378
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,806
You're lookin' for your family?

379
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,475
Yes.
They're out here somewhere.

380
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:18,920
I lost my dad when I was 10.

381
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:22,014
It's a tough age
to become man of the house.

382
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:25,458
- You grew up fast.
- Very.

383
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:30,124
But it taught me responsibility,
to always do the right thing.

384
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,326
And make sure others do too.

385
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:35,895
[Chuckles]

386
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:40,103
[Todd]
Make sure others do too.

387
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,610
[Emily] All he said was,
"I'm gonna be in the paper soon."

388
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:44,612
And then he tapped his briefcase.

389
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,376
[Jarod] Like there was
something important in it.

390
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,255
Doesn't make any sense.

391
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:58,623
You know, the thing I can't understand
about these papers, Jarod?

392
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:01,925
Why kill Todd over these?
They're all random, not connected.

393
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:05,626
Not even by a specific case.
It's like somebody just grabbed them.

394
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,636
To replace the ones
that were originally in his briefcase.

395
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:13,403
If somebody did switch 'em,
then Todd definitely had the goods on him.

396
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:15,467
The question is, who.

397
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:19,176
Hang in there, man.
We'll get him.

398
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,207
[Phone Rings]

399
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,511
- Agent Wilkes.
- It's Malone.

400
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:29,319
Listen, I went over those papers
you sent from Baxter's briefcase.

401
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,325
Nothing.

402
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:33,691
- However, I found something interesting.
- What?

403
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:36,026
That heroin charge against Baxter
from his college days?

404
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:37,793
- It's a fake.
- Yeah.

405
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,495
The campus cop
who arrested Baxter doesn't exist.

406
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:44,005
- Someone's trying to smear his past.
- I'll have to call you back.

407
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:46,439
[Dial Tone]

408
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,477
Let's take a walk.

409
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,010
Let me share something with you, Agent.

410
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:55,312
I'm under review, and I'm not inclined 
to believe in a conspiracy...

411
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,409
but I know what city I'm in.

412
00:25:57,486 --> 00:26:00,046
If this Baxter thing keeps goin' south...

413
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:03,285
we're gonna ruffle some feathers,
and we're gonna get clipped.

414
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,351
What about Todd Baxter?
Whose feathers did he ruffle?

415
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:08,020
What do you mean?

416
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:10,998
There was something in his briefcase
that someone didn't want exposed.

417
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:15,002
He also had heroin, barbiturates
and some fuzzy handcuffs.

418
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,004
The kid was messed up, Jarod.

419
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:19,632
I hired Baxter.
You think I want to believe this?

420
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:23,906
He was convicted of possession in college.
We should track down the arresting officer.

421
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,879
He already did.

422
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:32,180
You talked to the officer
that arrested him?

423
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:36,918
Yes. I would have rather not.
Trust me.

424
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:42,520
Jerry's seen the truth on this thing
from the beginning.

425
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,866
And I'm beginning to see it myself.

426
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,000
[Emily]
Linden switched the files?

427
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,067
Nice theory.

428
00:26:56,145 --> 00:27:00,377
But you got no proof unless you find 
the originals, and they're probably 
long shredded by now.

429
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:04,749
Well, then it's time 
to go digging through some trash.

430
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,100
[Glass Shattering]

431
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:29,331
- Typical shrink. Just flat nuts.
- Lies!

432
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,339
It was in a Centre evidence bag.

433
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,103
- Who did the watch belong to?
- I don't want to relive that.

434
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,371
Relive what?

435
00:28:38,347 --> 00:28:40,338
We helped him.
It was awful.

436
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:45,217
Then get it out in the open.
It's a brand-new day at the Centre. Remember?

437
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:49,724
All right. Years ago,
Sydney killed a woman.

438
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:03,201
[Malone] Agent Wilkes.
Just the man I've been looking for.

439
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,972
What?

440
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:11,069
Nice working with you again.

441
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:14,980
A year ago, you worked with us on a kidnapping
in Atlanta. You used a different name.

442
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,409
Who the hell are you?

443
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,530
Who are you working undercover for?

444
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:36,967
Congress.

445
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,269
I work for an oversight committee...

446
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:41,468
that keeps tabs on local
and federal law enforcement.

447
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:45,343
That explains your badge in Atlanta.
What brought you to the Service?

448
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:48,542
The committee smelled a rat
in the Baxter case.

449
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:50,608
They sent me down.

450
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:53,988
Still doesn't answer all my questions.

451
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,990
I'll answer any question you want.

452
00:29:56,058 --> 00:30:00,586
But right now, I found Todd Baxter's killer,
and I need your help to get him.

453
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,864
Syd killed a woman?

454
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:10,869
In a car accident. It happened during
the early stages of the Jarod Project.

455
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:13,497
Syd hired a college intern
from France, a young girl.

456
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:15,438
[Broots Exhales]
She was pretty.

457
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,840
Apparently, they were having an affiair.

458
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,846
They'd gone to dinner and were driving back
when Sydney lost control and broadsided a tree.

459
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:23,848
She died two hours later in the hospital.

460
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,350
- Her name was Hope?
- Claudia.

461
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,614
When Angelo said Sydney
lost hope, he meant it.

462
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:31,384
Now, these are
the Centre records of the accident.

463
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:33,186
I'm hoping that'll help us find Syd.

464
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,660
Provence Restaurant.
This must be where they dined before-

465
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,788
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.

466
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,133
- Did you glue this together?
- Yeah.

467
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:45,796
It's all 6,422 strips.

468
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:49,035
- After that, I got bored.
- Mmm. Yeah, well, Baxter certainly wasn't.

469
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:52,839
Between these articles and those
confidential memos you pieced together...

470
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:58,817
Baxter connected Linden to numerous
illegal operations and other so-called suicides.

471
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:01,820
Todd was definitely
trying to make a difference.

472
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:06,086
- How about those apples?
- Them apples.

473
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,525
- Hmm?
- It's "How about them apples?"

474
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:11,995
Oh. I knew it was
something about apples.

475
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:16,261
Bailey told me who you worked for.

476
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,600
They the ones who showed you
how to get into a killer's mind?

477
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:23,005
No. That was more home schooling.

478
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:26,407
That's some home.

479
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:29,209
You don't want to know.

480
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:32,149
Well, I decided not to wait.

481
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:34,152
Try this.

482
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,211
- Is this your bouillabaisse?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:39,448
Mmm.

484
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,459
Mmm!

485
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,291
How do you have time to track a killer
and make something this delicious?

486
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:49,300
Well, we all have our secrets.
Don't we, Jarod?

487
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,751
It only helps until the next morning.

488
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:17,660
And, uh, I'll be back then.

489
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,664
We know about the accident, Syd.

490
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:22,929
Look, I'm here with
some of my favorite ghosts.

491
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:25,937
Can't you see?
So leave me alone.

492
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,771
You wouldn't let us off that easy,
so forget it, Sydney.

493
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:33,938
It wasn't your fault.
You have to let Claudia go.

494
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:36,311
I can't.
We're celebrating.

495
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:38,646
Why?

496
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:41,209
Because.

497
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:43,619
Because they used her against me.

498
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:46,624
Syd, the Centre helped you.

499
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:49,092
The Centre sure helped.

500
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,619
They were there
right after the accident.

501
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:55,565
Centre Sweepers yelling...

502
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,503
"Oh, we'll give Claudia the best care."

503
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,437
And then...

504
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:04,169
two hours later...

505
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,234
I got the news.

506
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:13,318
I gave her this watch
for her birthday.

507
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,377
It would have been yesterday.

508
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,786
How did Angelo know about-

509
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:23,317
[Chuckles]
Angelo.

510
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:27,332
How does Angelo know about anything?

511
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,393
He knew that you need 
to deal with this pain, Syd...

512
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,404
that you were in love with her.

513
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,406
That wasn't Angelo.

514
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:39,069
- They told you that.
- That's what my father said.
That's what the file said.

515
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:42,342
- Centre lies!
- Careful, Sydney.

516
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:47,182
Oh, no, much later, when I found out
what the Centre was doing with Jarod's work...

517
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:49,187
and I rose up in protest-

518
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,018
They used the accident against you?

519
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,251
I did love her.

520
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:56,659
Like my daughter.
She was my student.

521
00:33:56,729 --> 00:34:02,326
But the Centre fabricated some story
of an affiair between us.

522
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,699
They threatened me with jail.

523
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,568
- They threatened-
- To separate you from Jarod.

524
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,736
Yes. They used it
to force me to do their bidding.

525
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:16,942
Not only was Claudia dead, but they
tried to destroy the very memory of her.

526
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:20,075
My father did this to you?

527
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:23,349
Not directly, of course.

528
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:27,882
But, yes, Mr. Parker
was running the Centre.

529
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,861
Now have a shot.

530
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,272
[Jarod]
Todd Baxter knew too much.

531
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,184
He connected Linden
to several major illegal operations-

532
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,745
character assassinations, extortion...

533
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:00,155
among other clandestine things.

534
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:03,889
Your director of communications has had
six Washington jobs in the last seven years.

535
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:07,729
Yeah. Travel office, D.O.J. cover-up,
framed a D.O.E. whistle blower.

536
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,291
Watergate plumbers
got nothin' on this guy.

537
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,361
Hasn't paid this well since G. Gordon Liddy.
His offshore accounts are packed.

538
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:16,704
Agent Baxter found out,
and that crafty son of a bitch killed him.

539
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:19,506
Made it look like a drug overdose
so I'd shut down the case.

540
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:23,412
- He played me.
- Except Linden isn't the killer, is he, Rachel?

541
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:26,280
Are you two reading
each other's minds now?

542
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,343
Murder is not in Linden's profile.

543
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:31,788
He likes to control the truth, but only from
the background. He was never in that hotel.

544
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:35,816
- Think he had someone do 
his dirty work for him?
- Mm-hmm.

545
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:39,763
- All right. When do we move?
- [Both] We don't.

546
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:45,065
There's a killer out there, and Linden 
is going to lead us right to him.

547
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:53,603
Daddy, the Centre did this.
You did this.

548
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,648
You forgot. The Triumvirate gave the orders.
I carried them out.

549
00:35:56,716 --> 00:36:00,243
- I knew you would say that.
- I don't like your attitude.

550
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,154
Daddy, please.
I just want Sydney to have some closure.

551
00:36:05,224 --> 00:36:07,419
[Sighs]
It can be arranged.

552
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:12,661
- [Intercom Beeps]
- Mr. Morgenstern.

553
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:24,599
[Gasps]

554
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:30,813
Claudia.
[Speaking French]

555
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:35,781
[French]
Oh, Sydney.

556
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:38,016
[French Continues]

557
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,491
When you told me what Sydney
was going through, I had her flown in.

558
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,724
She's a groundbreaking psychiatrist
at a teaching hospital outside of Paris.

559
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:49,630
A hospital funded by the Centre.

560
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:53,900
After the accident, she healed up quickly.
We gave her a future, a career.

561
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:56,669
And told her that Sydney was dead.

562
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:00,906
Well, that's one order
I wish I'd never taken.

563
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,949
Angel, a new life changes everything.
I told you.

564
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,041
It's a brand-new day.

565
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:24,567
- [Rings]
- Communications. Linden.

566
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:27,765
[Jarod]
I'm watching you.

567
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,774
Who the hell is this?

568
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:33,835
I'm the man you hired
to throw Todd Baxter out the window.

569
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,749
- Baxter committed suicide.
- No.

570
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,787
You hired me to kill him, didn't you?

571
00:37:43,622 --> 00:37:45,783
I'll take that as a "no comment."

572
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:50,022
If you care to explain yourself,
off the record...

573
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,859
meet me at the River Glen Hotel...

574
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:55,423
room 814.

575
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,077
Hello?

576
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,615
Hello? Anyone here?

577
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:20,753
You don't think I'd be foolish enough
to be armed, do you?

578
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:24,159
I'm about to find out
how big a fool you are.

579
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,892
Agent Wilkes.

580
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:30,629
- So what is this?
- It's the River Glen Hotel.

581
00:38:30,703 --> 00:38:35,299
Not exactly the Watergate,
but scandals can be made here as well.

582
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,810
Well, I sure hope you brought your wallet
so you can buy your freedom.

583
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:43,712
Innocent men don't need to.

584
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,751
[Jarod] These documents
that I stole from your office-

585
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:48,844
they seem to say otherwise.

586
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:58,686
Well, aren't you industrious.

587
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,229
Fabrications designed
to destroy an honest man.

588
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,396
Like the ones you create?

589
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:09,066
Like the ones
that Todd Baxter discovered?

590
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,542
You make a fortune creating scandals
that ruin people's lives...

591
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,704
even end them.

592
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,682
Jarod, if you're trying to get me
to make a verbal admission...

593
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,185
for something I know nothing about...

594
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:23,585
for you or...

595
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:26,056
whoever else is watching-

596
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,025
Damn it.

597
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:33,356
I'm afraid you got the wrong fool.

598
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,367
[Sighs]
You're right.

599
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,933
I am a fool for ever believing
you could possibly just tell the truth.

600
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:45,408
- We're done here.
- Oh, we are just...

601
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,275
getting started.

602
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,441
- We'd better get in there.
- No, just give him a minute.

603
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:58,722
- I wouldn't want you to miss it.
- Miss what?

604
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,487
Your suicide.

605
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:07,932
[Gasps]

606
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,333
[Grunts]

607
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,928
[Sighs]

608
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:17,373
# [Whistling]

609
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,274
What are you doing?

610
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,012
I'm setting the scene...

611
00:40:27,086 --> 00:40:29,611
just like the man you hired
to kill Todd Baxter did.

612
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:32,179
[Groans]

613
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:35,055
I'm gonna make it seem
like you had an evening of... drugs.

614
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:38,528
Then you took a swan dive
out the window.

615
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:41,691
Hope they find your body sooner.

616
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:45,430
- No, wait. Wait! No!
- Mmm. No waiting.

617
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:52,273
No! No!
[Grunts]

618
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:55,006
Who did it? You tell me
who killed Todd Baxter...

619
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,379
or they'll be fishing your body
out of the Potomac-what's left of it.

620
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,908
- I can pay you. Just forget about Baxter.
- Money?

621
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:04,046
- Yeah.
- Todd Baxter saved my life!

622
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:07,957
- You killed him. I'm gonna even the score!
- No! You're crazy.

623
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:11,554
Plan "B." Plan "B."
Go to plan "B"!

624
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,929
What are you doing?
You warning your accomplice?

625
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,936
You tell me who killed him,
or I will drop you out of this window!

626
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:22,337
Holder. Agent Holder.

627
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:25,809
- Where is he?
- He's in the service elevator 
at the end of the hall.

628
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:28,403
- Get up!
- No! No! No!

629
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,746
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

630
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,850
Is this more bouillabaisse?

631
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:19,125
No, I only had 30 seconds.
It's chicken noodle.

632
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:21,462
- [Laughs]
- The chicken almost tastes real.

633
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:25,026
Mmm.

634
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:34,708
That's why you're undercover.

635
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,578
You're alone in this world.

636
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:39,583
We all have secrets.

637
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,583
No family?
No one to get close to?

638
00:42:46,758 --> 00:42:50,592
Not yet.
I should get back to the office.

639
00:42:50,662 --> 00:42:54,689
Jarod. This-This was more
than just a case for you.

640
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:56,563
Why?

641
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's just say I was helping out...
an old friend.

642
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,341
Well, if you ever need a new friend,
you can call me.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
