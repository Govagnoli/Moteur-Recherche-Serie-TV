167
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,860
[Sniffles]
My dad...

168
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,930
was having an affair...

169

<i>with some woman</i>
<i>named Ashley.</i>

170
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,601

fighting about it.

171
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,674

to the pay phone in the marina to call her.

173

Then Mom left
to set up the house...

175
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,423
and that's when me and Dad
moved to the boat.

176
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,922
Dylan, who were
the two men on the dock?

177
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,425
They're from my dad's law firm.

178
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,367
The old guy's Edgar Hoyt.

179
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,100
The other one's name is Winston.

180
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,233
He's the head of Security.

181
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,479
He's a bad man, Jarod.

182
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,549
Why do you say that?

183
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,278
About a month ago,
I, uh, heard arguing...

184
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,650
<i>and it was Winston and my dad</i>
<i>on the dock.</i>

185
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,089
<i>He was threatening him, telling him</i>
<i>that he better not cross the firm...</i>

186
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,183

<i>how powerful they were...</i>

<i>and that he should do the right thing</i>
<i>to protect his family.</i>

188
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,492
<i>Then he slapped my dad</i>
<i>in the face and walked away.</i>

189
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,170
I wish he'd never started
working at that place.

190
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,608

would fear the most?

192
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,546

205

the service has discovered some irregularities
in your previous year's tax files.

206

It's nothing serious. We've just changed
the limits on some deductible items...

- Well, if I don't find any unforeseen problems...

233

He was an agent with the F.B.I.

<i>Hale wasn't having an affair.</i>

235

Then why'd my dad
let my mom leave?

236
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,246
My guess is that he was
trying to protect you.

the D.O.J. Has its eye on.

248

- Yeah, that makes two of us.

- Is there any word on what caused the accident?
- There was road construction.

254
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,518
Ashley lost control.
It was a freak thing.

255
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,119
A freak thing?

256
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,257
Ashley had an informant
inside Hoyt and Associates.

257
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,530
<i>This informant was collecting evidence</i>
<i>implicating the firm in the death of a key witness...</i>

set to testify against
one of their major clients.

259
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,130
Does this informant have a name?

260
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,800
He refused to identify himself.

261
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,674
- And the evidence?
- Ashley died before he received it.

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,941
Now, if you'll excuse me.

263
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,189
Great. It's great.

00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,315
- Well, I hope you found everything in order.
- So far so good.

Fast and sharp-
A lethal combination.

266
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,924
Well, a corporation in Delaware
kept me on retainer for several years.

267
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,627
It was a scary place,
but I learned a few things along the way.

268

Oh, one more thing.

269
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,504
I ran into a lot of references to work done
by a man named Peter Hale.

<i>[Dylan's Voice]</i>
<i>My dad was a hero?</i>

335
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,855
<i>He was helping the F.B.I.</i>
<i>Build a case against the firm.</i>

336
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,983
One of their clients was a drug dealer
named Vincent De Paz.

337
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,891
<i>He was facing trial for murder.</i>

338
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,488
Now, the state had an eyewitness-
a woman named Molly Brophy.

339
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,501
- <i>Three days before she was supposed to testify-</i>
- They killed her.

340
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,635
I found these on the Internet.

342

I think so.
The trick now is to prove it.

343
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,050
That's why my dad was so afraid.

344
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,389
<i>He must have found out</i>

You're still alive.

00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,792
- What have you done with my son?
- Dylan is fine. He's someplace safe.

353
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,294

You work for Hoyt and Winston. Where is Dylan?

My name is Jarod.
I am trying to help you.

355
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,200
- Why should I believe you?
- Because your son does.

356
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:14,261
And right now, he is scared, and he is confused
because he thinks his father is dead.

[Scoffs] You don't know
what you're gettin' yourself into.

358

to protect Vincent De Paz.

359
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,314
I know that Molly Brophy
and her granddaughters...

360
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,010
and Agent Ashley
were all murdered.

361
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,747
Now you better talk to me, Peter,
because right now, I'm your last chance.

362
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:43,530
I stumbled on some irregularities
in an unrelated case.

363
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,103
When I realized what I found,
I contacted the F.B.I.

364
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,367
- Agent Ashley.
- <i>He had me collecting evidence</i>
<i>so the feds could build a case...</i>

365
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,704
<i>even bring down De Paz</i>
<i>and the firm.</i>

366
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,870
And now he's dead.
He had a wife and child.

367
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,210
The F.B.I. Thinks his death
was an accident.

368
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,216
I met with Ashley that morning.
I handed over the evidence on De Paz.

369
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,344
The next thing I know, Ashley's dead-
the files have disappeared.

370
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,891
It was no accident.
It was Winston.

371
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,892
And I was next.

372
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,019
So you staged
your own death.

373
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,599
I panicked.

374
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:19,068
Winston watches everything.
He knows everything. [Sighs]

375
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,731
I figured the only way out was
if he thought I was dead.

376
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,935
At least that would buy me the time
to get Dylan away from here.

377
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,706
<i>Blowing up the boat was the best idea</i>
<i>I could come up with.</i>

378
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,374
<i>I sealed up the cabin and started filling it</i>
<i>with propane gas.</i>

379
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,046
<i>I called Dylan's school- uh, I was gonna</i>
<i>have him meet me-but he wasn't there.</i>

380
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,124
<i>I started to worry that something</i>
<i>might have already happened to him.</i>

381
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,523
<i>I knew Winston was</i>
<i>having me watched.</i>

382
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,653
<i>Either way, we stood a better chance</i>
<i>ifhe thought I was dead...</i>

383
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,130
<i>so I left the note,</i>
<i>got back on board.</i>

384
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,802
<i>I'd rigged a flare gun</i>
<i>in the cabin.</i>

385
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,873
<i>I grabbed a scuba tank</i>
<i>and slipped into the water.</i>

386
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,406
So, by the time Winston realized
that there was no one on the boat...

387
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,037
you and Dylan would be safe
with your wife in England.

388
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:09,217
Then when I saw you comin' out of the firm,
I thought I'd lost my boy for good.

389
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,288
Dylan thinks his father is dead.

390
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,949
Oh, God. I've let things get so bad
between the two of us.

391
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,892
But I did it to protect him.

392
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,793
Do you think he'll ever
be able to forgive me?

393
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,866

I lose probably the best part of me.

But... if you think leaving
is the best for you...

then, uh...

go with my blessing.

490
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,885

- I just want you to be happy.

Good night.

Well, congratulations, Parker.

- Looks like you're finally
in control of your own life.
- Yeah.

498
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,933
How does it feel?

499
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,236
- Confusing.
- I'll bet.

500
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,607
Listen, I'm gonna go lock
the back door.

501
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,680
You shut off the lights, okay?

502

It's on the side of the store,

Look, I have a flat tire, and I'm late

- so do you think I could use your phone?
- A local call?

Yes.

515
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,127

<i>You might say it's a local call.</i>

This is a $20 bill, okay?

518

So, now, do you think
I could use your phone?

Get out from behind the counter!

Maybe we should live on dry land for a while.
