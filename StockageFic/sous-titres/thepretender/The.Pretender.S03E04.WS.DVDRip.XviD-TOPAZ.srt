<i>Do you remember?</i>
- Just a little bit of help.

2
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:11,551
<i>I warned you to</i>
<i>stay clear of this place.</i>

3
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,754
I'll do anything that you need done.

4
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:16,024
<i>I just need something to eat.</i>

5
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,895
Not for me- for my child.

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,232
<i>I told you. This isn't a halfway house.</i>

7
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:23,897
- Is there a problem here, Manny?
- Oh, I didn't see you, <i>Mrs. -

8
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,474
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Is this man disrupting business?</i>

9
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:28,567
Well, he keeps coming in
asking if there's any work.

10
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:34,139
- Give him my table.
- Excuse me?

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,480
- <i>Treat him and his family</i>
<i>the same as any other patron.</i>
- <i>But, Mrs. -

12
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,986
When his family has finished eating,
pack a picnic basket...

13
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,956
and give them enough cash
for a hotel room for a week.

14
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:47,223
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, ma'am.

15
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,094
- It's all right to go get your family now.
- God bless you.

16
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:06,006
Dignity is usually
something you see taken...

17
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,576
not given.

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,923
Family is the most important thing
a person can protect.

19
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:20,120
It's all there is.

20
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,866

00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,332
Business.

24
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:39,982
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay.

25

I, uh-

26
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,516
I didn't get your name.

27
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,237
Your résumé is impressive.

28
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,509
- Flawed, but impressive.
- Flawed?

29
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:17,052
The job you did in Seattle
almost landed you in jail.

30
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:19,417
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

31
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,854
Mr. Kincade needs
a consummate professional.

32
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:26,588
If he is even slightly associated
with incendiary events...

33
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,755
other arrangements
will have to be made.

34
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,197
- Try English.
- How do we know you're any good?

35
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:38,569
You see that 18-footer
at the end of the dock?

36
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,906
- <i>Yes.</i>
- It belongs to the local sheriff, I believe.

37
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:44,206
Yes. Randall Carver.
That's him over there.

38
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,943

- Not anymore.

Miss Parker.

- I was just, uh, catching up on the pursuit files.

65
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,646
some crap about good luck.

66
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,842
Well, luck didn't help
this one very much.

67
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:06,445
<i>You got that right. I heard about</i>
<i>your show at the marina this morning.</i>

68
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,287
- Fourth ofJuly stuff.
- Well, Sheriff Carver's not celebrating.

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,352
The preliminary investigation
ruled the explosion accidental.

70
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:18,161
That's the idea.
<i>Clean, professional.

71
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,758
I wouldn't want anything to happen
like what happened last time.

72

Last time?

73
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,675
I read the papers.

74
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,267
I know all about how
those people died in your building.

75
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,210
<i>It was an amateurish job.</i>

76

<i>[Kincade] I thought you were spending</i>

79
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,995
I wanted to surprise you.
I had Doris fix us an early dinner.

80
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,826
- No time.
- <i>Well, I'm sure she can-</i>

81
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,060
<i>Manny told me you created quite a scene</i>
<i>this morning with a homeless man.</i>

82
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,160
It was more than just
a homeless man.

83
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,729
He had a little girl who looked like
she hadn't had a decent meal in weeks.

84
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,742
My wife's a sucker for the lazy
and unmotivated, Mr. Burns.

85
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,706
Jarod.

86
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:08,916
Jarod's a designer.

87
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,179
I thought I'd give him a shot
at the building downtown.

88
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,755
<i>Could you recommend
a place to stay?

89
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,226

There's not gonna be much available in town.

90
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,354
Well, the guesthouse is empty.

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,729
I couldn't possibly
put anybody out.

92
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:32,433
My husband is a sucker for
the aggressive and industrious.

93

<i>I'll have the housekeeper open it for you.</i>
<i>We'll talk in the morning.</i>

94

Don't wait up.

95
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,088
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I swear he was crying.</i>

96
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,318
He was watching
his own birth, Parker.

97
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:54,362
Seeing yourself ripped away from family
is enough to tear anyone's heart out.

98
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,830
Since when does Lyle have a heart?

99
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:01,461
Why is it so hard for you to believe
he might actually feel loss?

100
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:05,200
After all,
<i>Catherine was his mother too.

101
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:08,471

but she had nothing to do with who he is.

<i>Oh, she's pretty.</i>

"Trust can kill you or set you free."

109
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,635
I've heard that somewhere before.

110
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,274
<i>It sounds kind of cryptic.</i>

111
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,276
Jarod wouldn't have
sent this without a reason.

112
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,647
Find out who she is.

113
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,310
Sure.

114
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,290
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>I grew up a long way away from here.</i>

115
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,417
- That makes two of us.
- Really?

116
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,554
I imagined you as a little girl
with a pony and private schools...

117
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:04,292
leading this charmed life
like Alice in Wonderland.

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,335
My parents died in a fire
when I was a baby.

119
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,803
I was raised by my aunt in a little
trailer park just west of Corpus Christi.

120
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,807
That must have been
very difficult for you.

121
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:18,370
She loved me. That's the last time
I remember being truly happy.

122
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,440
And you?
Do you have family?

123
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,521
I have a sister out there somewhere.

124
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:30,615
- My brother was killed about six months ago.
- I'm sorry.

125
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:34,321
- Your parents?
- I lost contact with them when I was a child.

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,557
I'm still trying to find them.

127
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,998
You should never give up.

128
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,161
The thing you want most in life
could be right around the next corner.

129
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,019
I know you're not
who you pretend to be.

130
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,885
I used to deny it,
but I know what my husband does.

131
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,821
You're not here
to design a building.

132
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,587
You're here to burn one down.

133
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:10,064
That's not... really who I am.

134
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:19,239
I believe you, Jarod.
You're a good man.

135
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,276
I can see it in your eyes.

136
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:24,938
My husband used to be
a good man.

137
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,174
Unfortunately, people change.

138
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,222
Good night.

- Ah, angel.

141
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:53,167
Did you, um, change your hair again?

142
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,176
Do you like it?

143
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,543
Well, it's your head.
[Chuckles]

144
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,981
Daddy, I need to talk
to you about Lyle.

145
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:06,646
I don't mean to sound paranoid,
but I think he's up to something.

146
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,725
- Did he threaten you?
- Threaten? No.

147
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:14,125
I caught him watching the D.S.A. Of my-
of-of our birth.

148
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,790
- So?
- So, he was crying.

149
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,891
Ah, I <i>see.</i> Crying.
And you took that for hostility?

150
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,300
Well, no.
But given his track record...

151
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,305
I thought it was kind of strange.

152
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:28,343
Now, sweetheart, Lyle's a very deep
and complicated man.

153
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,776
- But, Daddy-
- No, let me finish.

154
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,509
He came to me a few days ago
in confidence and, uh, purged his soul.

155
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,780
<i>I think you could say he's, uh,</i>
<i>undergoing a transformation.</i>

156
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,412
You know, he wanted to know
the location of your mother's grave.

157
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:43,583
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:46,594
No, I can't.

161
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,932

Harold wasn't home yet.
He had a business meeting.

And at some point,
everything exploded.

209
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,733
I heard Harold scream,
and I turned, and he was on fire.

210
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,834
I reached out for him, but the flames were
too hot. There was nothing I could do.

211
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:28,645
So I ran down the stairs,
and I found Doris our housekeeper...

212
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,878
and that's when she told me
what she saw.

213

- What?
- A-A figure.

- <i>No.</i>

- <i>Sheriff, this is ridiculous.</i>

- She's been through enough already.
- <i>Mr. Burns.</i>

220

away from the scene of the fire.

<i>But, uh, I would appreciate it</i>
<i>if you didn't leave town right away.</i>

- Beautiful girl.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

Her name is Che Ling.
That's what it says right here.

224

She's from the Xinjiang province, one of
the poorest regions of Northern China.

- I've had better nights.

But I think he's satisfied,
at least for now.

240
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,432
I had your housekeeper prepare
a spare bedroom, so you can get some rest.

I can't go back to that house.
Not yet.

<i>came out to fix one break...</i>

258
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:34,234
another one would spring up.

259

<i>I can shut off the main outside,</i>
<i>but you should really-</i>

260

- Something about tax complications.

329
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,566
<i>When the police got there,</i>
<i>the apartment was empty.</i>

330
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,070
- Mail-order husband?
- Vanished. So was everything
connecting him to her.

331
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,073
<i>What about</i>
<i>a marriage certificate?</i>

332
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,541
There must be some way to find out
who she was so afraid of.

333
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:26,102
I contacted the license bureau. They couldn't
find any record of anyone named Che Ling.

334
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,115
It seems like everything about her
is disappearing right in front of our eyes.

335
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,117
This was just delivered
for you, Miss Parker.

336
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,454

00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:06,085
To try and find someone to trust.

345
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,189
<i>You wanna tell me again</i>
<i>why you came to Clear Bay?</i>

346
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:18,027
I was on retainer to do
some work for Harold Kincade.

347
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,762
<i>Mm-hmm. Like the work you did</i>
<i>in Seattle a few years back?</i>

348
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,328
I did a background check on you, Burns.
You got a half a dozen arrests...

349
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,169
for arson.

350
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,005
I got a dead man, a suspicious fire
and a whole lot of attitude...

351
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,669
and it doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

352
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,307
- Now why did you kill Kincade?
- I didn't.

353
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,648
- You were on the grounds.
- What about the boot prints?

354
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:41,347
- They're not my size.
- Easy for you to plant.

355
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,356
No, I want them
labeled as evidence.

356
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,393
Did Kincade cross you on the deal?
Try to rip you off? Is that why you torched him?

357
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:50,362
- Answer me!
- I'm not saying anything.

358
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,298
Which puts you right at the top
of the list in the murder of Harold Kincade.

359
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,393
- Not unless you have more than
a suspect rap sheet.
- Oh, gee.

360
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,302
- Tom, go away. This is police business.
- <i>Not anymore, it isn't.</i>

361
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:03,571
I've been retained by Kristi Kincade
to represent Mr. Burns in this matter.

362
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:06,875
- Kristi sent you?
- If you have proof of Mr. Burns's guilt,
charge him.

363
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,474
<i>Otherwise, I suggest you arrange</i>
<i>for his immediate release.</i>

364
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:25,195
Sheriff? What did Burns mean
when he asked about the boot prints?

365
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,427
You watched my interrogation?

366
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,526
I thought I could learn something.

367
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,539
Sheriff, you got a phone call.
They say it's an emergency.

368
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:41,109
Look, Deputy, why don't you
get back out on patrol, huh?

369
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:43,684

Oh!

374
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:05,037
When I heard you'd been taken in
by Sheriff Carver, I thought that-

375
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,040
It's okay now.
Everything's okay.

376
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,441
It's like a bad dream.

377
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,843

Excuse me, Mrs. Kincade.
I think there's something you should see.

381
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,750
Will you excuse me?

382
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,308
Is everything all right?

383
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,501
I believed in you.

384
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:47,347
I thought I'd finally found
someone who I could trust.

385
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:50,850
What are you talking about?

386
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:55,013
- Lighter fluid, fuses, a timer.
- Where did you get this?

387
00:27:55,123 --> 00:27:58,149
Did you think that killing him
was the only way for us to be together?

388
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,717
What? I had nothing to do
with the death of your husband.

389
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,459
- Then explain why Doris found
all this in the guest room.
- I don't know.

390
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,125
I trusted you!

391
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,829
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Don't- Let me go!

392
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,202
Not until you listen to me!
Now listen to me!

393
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,298
Yes, I wanted to see
your husband punished.

394
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,345
But after I met you,
everything changed.

395
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,778
I had nothing to do
with the death of your husband.

396
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,350
I could never do anything like that...

397
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,012

00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,283

You gotta run.

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,541
- I've done nothing wrong.
- Carver has information
about you that says otherwise.

402
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,543
You gotta go.

403
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,375
Go to the cabin.
Wait for me until I come for you.

404
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,247
I'll call Byner and see
what we can do.

405
00:28:57,352 --> 00:29:00,810
All right.
I'm innocent.

There are things
I need to share with you.

410
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,746
I found a photograph.
I'm not sure what it means.

411
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,047
- Photograph?
- A picture of-

412
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:35,054
- Miss-Miss Parker?
- Not now.

413
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,085
I'm not sure what it means,
but I think it concerns us both.

414
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,186
It's imperative we speak now,
Miss Parker.

415
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,130
Excuse me.

00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,871
What do you want?

417
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,168
We spoke to the sheriff
outside ofTahoe.

418
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,641
He recognized the picture
of Che Ling I put on the Internet.

- So?
- <i>So she was found three days</i>
<i>after that 911 call.</i>

<i>No one claimed the body.</i>
<i>She was buried in a pauper's grave.</i>

422
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,555
Are you telling me my father secretly married
a mail-order bride and then killed her?

423
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:14,287
- No, not exactly.
- The marriage records were erased, of course.

424
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:19,128

- Yes.
- Then why did he have his gun drawn?

- Then you admit knowing her?

491
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,927
It's just my good fortune that
he screwed up and killed himself.

492
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,295
I'm on the flight to Paris in two hours.
Do you have all the bank information?

493
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,664
The money will be wired to Paris
by the end of the week.

494
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:05,728
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yeah.

495
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,172
Are you sure?

496
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,268
- Can't it be sent ahead to Paris?
- What's wrong?

497
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:15,341
It appears there's an addendum
to Harold's original will.

498
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:19,510
- Meaning?
- Without your signature,
you'll forfeit a sum of money.

499
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,021
- How much?
- <i>$50,000.</i>

500
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,615
But considering the inheritance
is nearly 10 million...

501
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:28,126
I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.

502
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:31,130
I don't pay you to think.

503
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:35,430
Switch my flight to midnight and have your
assistant bring me those papers before I leave.

504
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,504
- But what about-
- Just do it!

505
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:04,529
<i>Good afternoon, Mrs. Kincade!</i>

506
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:09,160
- Who the hell are you?
- You helped me the other day
at your restaurant?

507
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,363
What are you doing here?

508
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,372
My little girl wanted to thank you.

509
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:16,739
And we wanted to say how sorry we were
for the loss of your husband.

510
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:23,407
What are you people doing on my property?
This is a private residence.

511
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,711
The deputy let us in
the front gate.

512
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:31,986
- The deputy?
- I hope we're not interrupting.

513
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:35,722
- <i>[Glass Breaking]</i>
- I saw you die.

514
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:41,359
<i>You should have taken</i>
<i>your original flight, Kristi.</i>

515
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,734
<i>But then again, I knew a girl like you</i>
<i>couldn't give up $50,000.</i>

516
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:50,770
- Jarod.
- Maybe you'd better sit down.

517
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,540
You look a little weak
in the knees.

518
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,081
I saw you walk into the cabin.
I saw-

519
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:59,277
No, you saw
what you wanted to see.

520
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:02,788
What you didn't see was Sheriff Carver
and me go out the back door...

521
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,518
<i>before your homemade bomb</i>
<i>blew it to bits.</i>

522
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:09,995
Oh, Sheriff Carver, he confessed
to the murder of your husband...

523
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,122
and he implicated you
in the whole thing.

524
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,596
- Jarod-
- It was a brilliant plan.

525
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:20,503
Really. I mean,
you had all the bases covered.

526
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:26,478
I mean, what better partner in a murder than
the man who was covering the investigation?

527
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,844
<i>And you both played</i>
<i>your parts brilliantly.</i>

528
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,043
I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Kincade,
but I need to ask you some questions.

529
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:35,122
He was on fire.

530
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,089
Let's go, Sheriff.

531
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,922
Oh, and then there were
the subtle touches.

532
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:44,191
Your tears were so convincing
the night you murdered your husband.

533
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,068
- Stay here.
- He's my husband!

534
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,161
Stay here!

535
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:55,140
Routine maintenance calls to
the gas company about that pesky leak...

536
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:58,769
<i>before the "accidental"explosion.</i>

537
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:02,007
<i>The only thing that was missing</i>
<i>was a patsy-</i>

538
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:06,815
a fall guy to come along
and pin the whole thing on.

539
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,358
I love you.
[Echoing]

540
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:22,525
- Jarod, it was never personal.
- Oh, you're wrong.

541
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,968
It was very personal.

542
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,630
<i>[Handcuffs Clicking]</i>

543
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:32,974
You know, there is one thing
that I still can't figure out.

544
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:36,508
What's that?

545
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:39,950
Whatever happened to that
happy little girl from Corpus Christi?

546
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:06,680
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

547
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,271
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

548
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,784
- What?
- [Jarod] I assume you found Che Ling.

549
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,653
I found her. She was in the county
cemetery with a wooden grave marker.

550
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,281
Another casualty of the Centre.

551
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,656
[Miss Parker]
Not according to Mr. Lyle and my father.

552
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,661
And you think
you can trust what they say?

553
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,663
As opposed to trusting you?

554
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:28,257
That's kind of like jumping out
of the fire into the fire, isn't it?

555
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:30,735
You think you know the truth
about your father...

556
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:33,432
and Mr. Lyle
and who killed your mother.

557
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:38,376
But the fact is, you only know
what the Centre wants you to know.

558
00:41:39,713 --> 00:41:41,613
What do you want from me?

559
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:46,015
The same thing you want from me-
a little trust.

560
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,556
- I have to go.
- Be careful, Miss Parker.

561
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:51,887
Remember what your mother
used to say-

562
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:56,691
"Trust can kill you or set you free."

563
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:10,841
Ah, there's my angel.

564
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,312
Sweetheart, you are beautiful.

565
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:17,282
- <i>Let's get a move on.</i>
- Where's Lyle?

566
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:21,377
Oh, he called.
He's gonna meet us there.

567
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,718
He said he didn't want
another minute to go by...

568
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:27,089
without arranging
a proper burial for Che Ling.

569
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:29,958
[Clears Throat]
I'll get the car.

570
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:32,396
- Daddy-
- Uh-huh?

571
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,964
You look very handsome tonight.

572
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,470
You betcha.
