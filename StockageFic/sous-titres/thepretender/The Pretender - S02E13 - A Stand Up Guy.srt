1
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,092
I swear to God,

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,862
I am starting to lose my mind.

3
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:10,579
It's bad enough that we've missed Jarod with all the close calls that we had.

4
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:13,773
But we are not even showing up in the right citys any more.

5
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,279
We'll get back on track, Miss Parker. We're just in a slump.

6
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,893
This is the Center, Broots.

7
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:24,333
We don't have ''slumps''.

8
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:28,834
What?

9
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,135
Well, well, well.

10
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:32,757
Long time no see.

11
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,161
And how was life treating you?

12
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,299
But you caught me in bed with his wife.

13
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:38,838
What do you want, Jarod?

14
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,576
Why is Mr. Lyle tailing me?

15
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:41,577
Mr. Lyle.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,561
Yes, he chased me through Albuquerque and in Santa Fe.

17
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,558
Although I don't see much hitchhiking in his future.

18
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:51,578
Hitchhiking?

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,254
Somebody cut off one of his thumbs.

20
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:55,855
Jarod.

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,841
I think you should tell us where you are.

22
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,452
We can protect you from him.

23
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:05,461
Although I really do appreciate your concern, I've got certainly used to taking care of myself.

24
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:07,258
Well, I really got to go.

25
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:08,459
I am late for work.

26
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:18,533
Hey, Joey.

27
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,116
Who is this?

28
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:22,417
He is a new guy.

29
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,180
- So, we set?
- My money.

30
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:27,198
Bobbie?

31
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:35,476
A beautiful thing, huh?

32
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:38,899
Plates will be here in three days. Take it easy.

33
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:42,619
What's this?

34
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:48,556
It's like a round pig

35
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,332
in a square hole.

36
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:52,322
You just don't fit.

37
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:56,341
Joey, corpse means cops.

38
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:58,398
Yeah, a live witness means trouble.

39
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,299
Sorry.

40
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:01,021
I came through with the counterfeit plates.

41
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:02,143
I got what you wanted.

42
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,892
Come on, shoot him. It's freezing in here.

43
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:07,436
Joey, these ain't smart.

44
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:09,718
You know he is right.

45
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:12,819
You do it.

46
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:16,013
Come on, man, show me what you got.

47
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,053
Do it!

48
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,258
Do it!

49
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,381
Alright, punch your ticket.

50
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:24,217
They don't call Bobbie Two-Guns for nothing.

51
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,051
These ain't right, Joey.

52
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,501
Alright, alright, but at least take him out to the docks.

53
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,535
No... Do it here.

54
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:32,936
Come on, Chicago boy.

55
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,012
Joey, I got kids.

56
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:40,101
- Say pray for them.
- I got a family, Joey, I mean, come on!

57
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:41,499
No, don't!

58
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,333
Shoot him!

59
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,519
Do it! Do it! Do it!

60
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,920
There are pretenders among us.

61
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,442
I was taken from my family.

62
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:08,213
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent then any of our others.

63
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:11,501
How many people died because of what I thought up?

64
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:14,616
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

65
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:15,436
He is a pretender.

66
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:19,682
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

67
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:22,219
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

68
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:24,362
He defends the weak and abused.

69
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:25,371
Life is a gift.

I am today.

75
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:53,115
- Breakfast?
- Yeah, let's get out of here. It stinks.

76
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:57,179
Hey, quite a marksman there ..

77
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:00,592
Nice shot.

''Body Found In Warehouse''

- Jarod.
- What's up?

80
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,261
Hey, how we do last night?

81
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,812
I don't know, Joey. Only about nine hundred and change.

82
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:33,513
What?

83
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:35,193
It rained.

84
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,194
Hey, Bobbie.

85
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,178
Make sure it is sent by ten o'clock, alright?

86
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,816
I don't want another phone call.

87
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,756
- I got to pay the rent.
- So pay it.

88
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:49,957
Hey, hey, give me aback.

89
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,357
Hey.

90
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,474
Let's talk in my office.

91
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,901
I love what's you done with the place.

92
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:14,420
(FBl) can't pick up our conversation because of the frost.

93
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:17,101
Look, if this is about what happened yesterday,

94
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,121
you caught me off guard, it will not happen again.

95
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,422
Oh, it was just a test.

96
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,520
You know, you definitely not make a full use of your talents.

97
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:30,357
In fact Tony says, you are the best ''print man'' he has ever seen.

98
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:33,801
A real artist, he says.

99
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,941
Well, I've printed him a million dollars.

100
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,092
Not saying anything.

101
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,377
So show me.

102
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:40,898
Excuse me.

103
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:42,975
Come on, let's see what you got.

104
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:54,692
Which one is real?

105
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:07,322
They are both real.

106
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:14,816
Guess I am an artist.

107
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,554
You really think I wouldn't find out who you are.

108
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,857
What the hell are you talking about?

109
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:34,672
Tell me again. Once again. What happened in Chicago?

110
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:38,016
I told you, I was a ''print man'' for Tony T.

111
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,359
What's this? Look at this.

112
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,596
Jarod Puzo.

113
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:45,673
Outstanding convictions for arson,

114
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,137
extortion, fraud,

115
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,891
outstanding warrants¡­you want me to continue?

116
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,892
Alright....

117
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,002
I jump bail.

118
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:55,378
I want it to lay low for a while.

119
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:59,638
The last thing I needed was some punk making his bones by ratting me out.

120
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,639
Ok.

121
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,440
A few months back, couple of FBls infiltrated our organisation.

122
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,832
- That's not good.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:21,413
A friend of mine says they could spin everybody.

124
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:25,298
Well, if you will remember, all that occurred before I got here.

125
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,397
Yeah. You got an answer to everything, don't you?

126
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:32,531
No more secrets, alright?

127
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,392
Artist.

128
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:53,457
''Federal Undercover Officer Found Murdered''

129
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:59,099
''Fellow Officer Charged in Slaying''

130
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:05,453
''Father Disgraced By Son's Indictment''

131
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:22,676
Your secretary said it was urgent.

132
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:26,617
I've got this surveillance tape of Satellite from Hartford office.

133
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,972
Oh, my god. Do you know the shooter?

134
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,755
I think we both do.

135
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:37,735
Mr. Lyle.

136
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,081
Jarod contacted us, said Lyle's been dogging him.

137
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:45,399
Last report was he was dealing with Japanese Yakusa.

138
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,432
Definitely Yakusa.

139
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:52,976
The Yakusa punish by taking a little finger of the offending party.

140
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,200
What's the guy have to do to lose a thumb?

141
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,821
Couldn't have a nice fellow.

142
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:01,372
Question is, how was the bustard up to?

143
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,759
I know all the Center office is monitored.

144
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,862
Disable the primary, the shots were from the backup units.

145
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:09,982
Well, you know, all our people there are dead.

146
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:14,138
Including the executive administrator, Mr. Strumps.

147
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:15,938
Lyle.

148
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,922
I want you to Hartford to clean up the mess.

149
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,035
I am not a cleaner any more.

150
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,598
My job is to find Jarod.

151
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,260
You said Lyle was after Jarod,

152
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,638
makes this your job.

153
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,215
Somebody has to find out what else he was after.

154
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,736
This is a ¡­

155
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,061
very delicate situation.

156
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:46,482
You are the only person I can trust.

157
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:55,801
Undercover agent Dean Clark was ringed today in the killing of Federal Officer Lester Knight.

158
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,851
Our reporter caught up with Sean Flanagan, the US prosecutor who's trying the case.

159
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,912
You said ... that agent Dean Clark killed Federal undercover agent Knight?

160
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:07,877
Agent Clark has been charged for the homicide connection with the death of a fellow agent.

161
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:10,782
They are both working undercover for the Molino crime family.

162
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,082
I told the department not to say this time.

163
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:18,178
''Father Disgraced By Son's Indictment''

164
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:22,376
He is the reason I joined RICO. I would never do anything to disgrace him.

165
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:27,402
You said you were drinking with an associate of Joey Molino at the night Lester Knight was murdered.

166
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,203
Yeah.

167
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:31,858
Bobbie Two-Guns. Molino's secondary command.

168
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:35,492
They call him Two-Guns because he carries his match of thirty-eights.

169
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,677
I told my lawyer that. Don't you guys in the Public Defenders Office talk to each other?

170
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:45,013
So you were with this Bobbie the night that agent Knight was murdered.

171
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,415
My assignment undercover was to take off Two-Guns.

172
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:52,794
He was hanging out at Faye's restaurant, ... me to go head to head with a bottle of gin.

173
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:56,539
So, I started drinking, be assing.

174
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,699
I got a call from agent Knight.

175
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:02,575
He said someone was feeding RICO information to Molino.

176
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,455
- Did he say who?
- No.

177
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:06,880
He said ''watch my back in the middle of the morning.''

178
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:12,813
The same morning that agent Knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner's bag?

179
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,501
The same dry cleaner's that you used.

180
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:16,738
I was set up.

181
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,552
Bobbie and I, polished off a quarter gin.

182
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:24,801
I didn't even remember leaving Faye's.

183
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:28,057
There is no way I could have driven over the bridge ... Knight's,

184
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:31,852
kill him and make it back home without running my car into a pole.

185
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,755
I am telling you I was set up.

186
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,257
The counterfeit plates come from Costa Rica.

187
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,773
Two sizes: twenty's, hundred's.

188
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:48,834
You have some work.

189
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:50,657
You are an artist.

190
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,278
I am getting to need the right materials.

191
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,318
- You know the suppliers?
- Of course.

192
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,802
- How much gonna cost?
- Hey, don't worry about that.

193
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,822
This deal goes down, everybody is getting fat.

194
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:03,722
Hey, Joey, you got a call.

195
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,955
- Who is it?
- I don't know. You want me to ask?

196
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:07,815
No, just give me the phone.

197
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:11,858
Hey, Faye, bring me Gibson.

198
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:13,602
I'll be right back.

199
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:19,276
Is that Waikiki?

200
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:23,533
Yeah. You can see the Diamond Head in the background.

201
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:25,356
It is beautiful.

202
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,798
I suppose to go there on my honeymoon.

203
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,799
Got put off.

204
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:33,473
So, Faye, so nice girl like you don't want a place like this.

205
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,503
I can't afford to move to Hawaii.

206
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,633
Seriously, like this, sell this place and go.

207
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,352
Joey, he sucked this place dry.

208
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:46,553
I've got no equity.

209
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,661
How did you link up with a guy like Joey?

210
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:52,459
My husband died and left me the restaurant.

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,260
I tried to make a go of it, but ran into some money trouble.

212
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,081
Joey said he could help. Woo, big mistake.

213
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:02,318
Hey, Faye, let's go.

214
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,731
You are the one who should get away from him,

215
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:10,232
while you still can.

216
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,934
- What happens to them?
- Nothing. They don't exist any more.

217
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:35,276
It has been a while since you work as a cleaner, Miss Parker, I am surprised.

218
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:36,719
My father has his reasons.

219
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:42,853
- What are we looking for?
- Anything that seems out of place or missing.

220
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,038
Lyle wouldn't pour out the heap like this unless this must be important.

221
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,378
This got to be something around here.

222
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:07,662
What is this?

223
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,714
Ah, this is an E-prong chip.

224
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:18,242
- Most likely ..in the Blue Box.
- Blue Box?

225
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:23,518
Each Center office has a dedicated hardware system from the mainframe,

226
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:24,922
called the Blue Box.

227
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,313
But, chips like this just couldn't fall off.

228
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:30,314
Blue Box is sealed shut.

229
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,292
Like this?

230
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,541
Yeah, that would be it.

231
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:40,132
What's up?

232
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:47,961
A friend of my friend tells me that ten pallets of raw currency paper being stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn for one night.

233
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:50,177
Tonight.

234
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:52,778
Wow.

235
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,698
You want to rob of the treasury department?

236
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:57,777
With uncle sam's paper,

237
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,536
no one but no one is going to be able to tell our bills,

238
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,002
from the real deal.

239
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:03,803
Hey.

240
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,079
Picasso didn't paint on toilet paper, did he?

241
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:09,172
Trust me.

242
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,080
Did I say something funny?

243
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,231
''Trust me.''

244
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:23,052
That's the last thing Lester Knight said to me, standed right where you are.

245
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:27,159
You slew that RICO cop here?

246
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,659
We locked him right where you are standing.

247
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,352
I thought he gonna freeze to death but he suffocated first.

248
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,632
I lost fifty bucks to Two-Guns on that bet.

249
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,901
But hey, dead is dead, right?

250
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,815
I thought he had a dry cleaning bag wrapped around his head.

251
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,162
I did that, to frame another RICO cop.

252
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:50,281
I am an artist too, you know.

253
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,772
Hi, Picasso, set it up.

254
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,798
You will get enough paper to print a billion bucks.

255
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:04,378
Have a big go, Picasso!

256
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,579
Yeah, baby.

257
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,353
- Security shift changes in twenty, let's move.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,503
Yeah, we got to go. The cops come.

259
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,661
How do you know this?

260
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,698
Trust me, I know.

261
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,837
Come on, let's move. Come on.

262
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:24,738
Come on, get out of here, come on.

263
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,662
Put the hands up. Get them right from here.

264
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:28,937
Stop the run.

265
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,298
Right there.

266
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,538
...

267
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:34,617
Get your hands off of me!

268
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,836
- You take Bobbie onboard.
- Did you have to get me in nose?

269
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,362
They shouldn't ... to take a bullet.

270
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:50,296
Best to know there's someone smelled like cat-food for at least a month.

271
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,296
How long have you been staying in that fish bath?

272
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,972
Let's just say the dry cleaner was not my business any more.

273
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,472
No, no, no, leave them on.

274
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,423
The more bruises, the less questions they are going to ask.

275
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:04,777
Jarod, we put a lot of pressure on people of Chicago to ..for you.

276
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,419
Now if you think Joey .., we pull you out right now.

277
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,455
We don't want to lose another undercover agent.

278
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:11,598
I am too close to bear out now.

279
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,501
So why did you set up this phony bust?

280
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,953
Molino seems to know everything before we do.

281
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:18,454
Looking for a link.

282
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:19,278
And?

283
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:23,534
And, he gets a phone call. And he takes off before you guys get there.

284
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:24,820
Could be a coincidence?

285
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:25,521
No.

286
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:27,972
There is a rat on the ship.

287
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,062
It's a big one.

288
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:39,943
Look, this wasn't a rag merchan you morons boosted

289
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,556
It was the US treasury department.

290
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,092
I told you already.

291
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:46,222
We were going to meet some friends and we went to the wrong warehouse.

292
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,201
Flanagan, we got a couple of wags who got their brains dead

293
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:50,241
How can you tell?

294
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,038
Now, who look stupid?

295
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,620
Us, or the guys who lost two undercover cops?

296
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,798
You guys know what you are looking at?

297
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,153
Twenty years.

298
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:03,840
Funny. That's what Dean Clark is looking at.

299
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,500
Must be a real disappointment for you, fellows.

300
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:07,835
You don't get it real in the morning.

301
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,073
The chance of putting Joey Molino away forever.

302
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:13,313
So you guys get wise crack all you want.

303
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:15,314
This time, I win.

304
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,341
The game is not over yet.

305
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,380
You can't be serious.

306
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,414
Molino's lawyer is in Judge Driger's chambers.

307
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:32,414
Apparently somebody forgot to read these gentlemen their rights.

308
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:33,315
What?

309
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,316
Oops.

310
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,314
Cut them loose.

311
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,215
Cut them loose?

312
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:37,456
You heard me.

313
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:42,999
It looks like this time you lose.

314
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,411
Well, I made a diagnosis. There is definitely certain chip missing.

315
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:59,221
Isn't there any way of determining what sort of information was stored on?

316
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:04,697
It's impossible to know what's on it, more specifically what's not.

317
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,599
Nothing is impossible.

318
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:09,412
Keep working.

319
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:34,658
So what happened at the warehouse?

320
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,493
The friend of the friend set it up.

321
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,332
Turns out it had a poor violation.

322
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,212
So with plan both ends against middle,

323
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,537
so we would have to go back to start.

324
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,434
Look, no things can turn out one hundred percent.

325
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,457
But we got enough paper to make a score.

326
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,261
And the friend of the friend?

327
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:01,413
Let's just say that he won't be talking to anyone any more.

328
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,734
And I'm mailing his wife a liitle present.

329
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,101
Is that a tongue?

330
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:18,201
Look, the paper we got is good.

331
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,859
So everything is gonna be okay.

332
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,761
I am counting on it.

333
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:28,862
- Oh, Bobbie.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:32,536
- I got you something too.
- What? The guy's brains?

335
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,616
Something better.

336
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:39,082
A little congrats for getting out of jail.

337
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:40,316
That is your drink, right?

338
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:42,981
I can't believe this guy.

339
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,454
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

340
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,617
All the panels and all the blue boxes,

341
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,093
contain sensitive information,

342
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:56,760
could jeopardize the operations if falling on the wrong hands.

343
00:20:57,663 --> 00:21:00,673
Lyle obviously knew it. He could get a price from one of these panels.

344
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:04,861
Set himself up, make him move back into the Center.

345
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:07,953
So this time he has to be dealt with full finality.

346
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:12,716
Situation has to be cleaned, but has to play close to the best.

347
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:14,341
You want me to set it up?

348
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:21,958
Daddy?

349
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,100
I am not an assassin.

350
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,834
You are sure you do the right thing.

351
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:33,379
It's taking a lot of manuring to rebuild my position here.

352
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:36,255
And Lyle's reappearance make me look inefficient.

353
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:40,856
Daddy.

354
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:44,722
Angel, it's about us protecting each other.

355
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:47,795
If you don't protect me,

356
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:51,619
I can't protect you.

357
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:01,995
I am going home,

358
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,275
and finish my present.

359
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,778
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Later.

360
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,079
Hey, Nicky, give me a ride, alright?

361
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,418
Can I get you something else?

362
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:17,536
I'll have vodka and rocks, if you join me.

363
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:20,579
- Twist my arm.
- Let me get it.

364
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:24,660
No, no. Not that. Joey waters it down, I keep the good stuff back in the freezer.

365
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,217
Oh...Wait¡­wait a minute.

366
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,818
No, thank you, I will pass.

367
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:33,673
I don't want drink anything that comes from the place where, you know, the cop died.

368
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:34,612
What are you talking about?

369
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:38,582
Joey told me how they ..the RICO cop in the deep freeze.

370
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:42,883
Oh, my god.

371
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,638
You didn't know.

372
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:49,082
That was the night Joey had me shut the place down early.

373
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,336
I just thought...

374
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:56,515
I had no idea they killed someone.

375
00:22:56,903 --> 00:23:00,621
What about Dean Clark? You know that undercover cop that was charged of the murder of Lester Knight,

376
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:02,755
Is he here that night?

377
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,911
He was in the bar, he was drinking gin with Bobbie.

378
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,942
He was so plastered they had to carry him out of here.

379
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,039
Are you okay?

380
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,902
I am just pulling my head out of the sand.

381
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:23,422
One cop is dead.

382
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,976
And an innocent one is going to be executed for it.

383
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:28,938
Hell!

384
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:32,754
How did I get here?

385
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:37,454
And how do I get out?

386
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,840
Central records please.

387
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,773
Yes, this is officer 557E.

388
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:58,097
I'd like to get a copy of all the requests made in the last two days for a rap sheet on one Jarod Puzo.

389
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,071
Yes, I'll hold.

390
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:05,158
Who?

391
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:09,521
Thank you. That's all the information I need.

392
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:26,174
You can't take it all. I need change for the customers.

393
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:27,218
Keeps all ... , Faye,

394
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:30,813
your head'll wind up on the wall next to your Hawaii shot.

395
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:34,473
I don't believe this.

396
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:35,472
What did you say?

397
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,073
Hey, hey, Joey, Joey,

398
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:39,212
the customers.

399
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:44,376
You want the money to keep coming in this place, don't you?

400
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:51,117
Where is Bobbie?

401
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:52,721
He didn't come in today.

402
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,034
He has married to the toilet.

403
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:56,835
So much drunk.

404
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:58,158
Mush.

405
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,121
I'll suppose to be across town.

406
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:01,932
I can make the delivery for you.

407
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:05,956
No one will be late with the gift.

408
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:18,257
Alright.

409
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:22,555
- Make suer it'll be there by ten o'clock.
- Not a problem.

410
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:23,921
I don't want to get a phone call.

411
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:33,974
Good evening, Mr. Flanagan.

412
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:37,693
Where is Bobbie?

413
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:39,817
Plumbing problems.

414
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,421
You are the white ass in the interview room.

415
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:45,019
First impressions can be so misguided.

416
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:53,558
You tell Joey,

417
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:55,599
if he wants our arrangements to continue,

418
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:57,433
I would need more money.

419
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,434
The people have to be paid.

420
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,512
- I understand.
- Good.

421
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:03,661
Just make sure you do.

422
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:08,601
No doubt about it.

423
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:14,535
Make sure that Broots takes focus on finding Jarod.

424
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,751
You know how he is.

425
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:19,574
We need proof for what happens on ADD goes on diagnosed.

426
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,181
What did he ask you to do?

427
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:26,631
I tell Broots what to do.

428
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:28,358
Your father.

429
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:30,893
It doesn't matter.

430
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,475
I don't believe you, Parker.

431
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:37,862
Lyle shows up and suddenly you are a cleaner again for one job.

432
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,379
What did your father ask you to do ?

433
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,797
He wants me to handle the situation.

434
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:46,518
To kill him?

435
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:49,714
Lyle has come in whatever he has come in.

436
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:53,638
You sound like you actually believe it.

437
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:54,372
I do.

438
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:00,273
What?

439
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,718
What's the name of it?

440
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,059
Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence.

441
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,392
What are you going to do about it, Parker?

442
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:10,981
To go and to handle the situation.

443
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,212
And then?

444
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:17,352
And then I am gonna go home and sleep like a baby.

445
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:28,458
Check.

446
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:37,438
Mate.

447
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:39,332
I warned you.

448
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:53,821
- That seat's taken.
- Eugene Clark?

449
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:54,633
Maybe.

450
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,215
I am a friend of Dean's.

451
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,811
You are a wise guy.

452
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:02,698
You got some nerve coming here like this.

453
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,080
I think it's agaist the law to hit a federal agent.

454
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,519
A federal agent? You worked with Dean?

455
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:11,198
No.

456
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,099
But I know he respects you.

457
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,752
He would never do anything to hurt you.

458
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:20,955
Look, I am not a father.

459
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:23,518
But I am a son, and I know,

460
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,933
the feelings that a son has.

461
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,761
Wanting to grow up like his father.

462
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,752
Wanting to make him proud.

463
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,139
I used to think that was Dean.

464
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,181
But last three months, I've been wrecked my brain wondering where I went wrong.

465
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:39,812
You did the best you could.

466
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:42,292
I got to go.

467
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:43,693
Mr. Clark.

468
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:46,559
Dean is a good cop.

469
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,760
Don't give up on him.

470
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:56,757
Lyle has been located in a hotel in Providence.

471
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,092
What are you going to do about it, Parker?

472
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:01,717
What are you going to do about it?

473
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,362
This time he has to be dealt with full finality.

474
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:06,102
What are you going to do about it?

475
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:08,922
I am not an assassin.

476
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:12,461
This time he has to be dealt with full finality.

477
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:14,437
Full finality.

478
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:16,838
Finality.

479
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,535
What are you going to do about it?

480
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:20,140
I am not an assassin.

481
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:24,041
You're sure you do the right thing....

482
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:04,293
- Yes.
- So close and yet so far.

483
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,351
That's become some one of an anthem for you, hasn't it?

484
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:10,718
- Mr. Lyle.
- Don't be disappointed, Miss Parker.

485
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,678
You can't catch Jarod, what chance you to get with me?

486
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:17,353
You sound like you're catching a cold, it must be dark and wet where you are.

487
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,356
That's temporary condition.

488
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:21,356
We want the computer chip.

489
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:24,955
I can't do that. Now that I want to keep the rest of my ..

490
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,338
If you excuse me, I've got a running with a very anxious buyer.

491
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,754
Twenty million dollars, Miss Parker.

492
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,240
God bless me the American Dream!

493
00:30:49,503 --> 00:30:50,802
You got something behind.

494
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:02,394
You've reached Hillman Marine. At the present, no one is availablt to take your call.

495
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:04,795
Our normal business hours are from...

496
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,519
- Broots.
- You have ever heard a place called ''Hillman''?

497
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:16,395
Oh, yes, in Connecticut. It's where the Center's data backup warehouse is located.

498
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:17,096
The what?

499
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,575
Every friday night at eleven fifty-nine PM,

500
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:24,721
all the Center mainframe from all across country do this mass computer backup,

501
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,632
and to this giant system from the Blue Boxes.

502
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,172
Boxes.

503
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,713
You think Lyle is trying to infiltrate the warehouse?

504
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,556
Can you think of a reason why he would?

505
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:47,936
It's how he could decrypt it.

506
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:49,458
What are you talking about?

507
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:52,940
The semiconduct panel he stole is encrypt. The code's impossible to break.

508
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:59,437
But if he were able to input this panel into the warehouse mainframe,

509
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,019
at eleven fifty-nine PM,

510
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:05,078
on...tonight!

511
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,479
Tonight, when the backup occurs,

512
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,893
it will automatically decrypt,

513
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:12,939
whatever information is on it.

514
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:16,039
What is how he gets twenty million for it.

515
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:16,956
Twenty million?

516
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:21,055
Man, crime does pay.

517
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:24,733
Alright, listen, is it located by a river, a lake, the ocean, something like that?

518
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,076
A river, yeah.

519
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:27,735
He rented a boat.

520
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:31,636
He does his business, he runs out to ... he escapes in a boat.

521
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:32,095
Unless¡­

522
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,139
Unless I make sure he doesn't.

523
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,733
Plates came in. They've been delivered this afternoon.

524
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,220
Excellent. Have them sent here.

525
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:49,358
Here?

526
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:50,459
Yeah.

527
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,835
Who is gonna surprised when we shut this dump down?

528
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:57,295
We print the money here and we'll torch the place.

529
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:00,017
What about Faye?

530
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:04,358
We can't leave any witnesses, can we?

531
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,359
''Hillman Marine''

532
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:41,337
Midnight stroke.

533
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:45,312
How did you find me?

534
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,072
I hit redial.

535
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:52,091
This is always the simple thing, isn't it?

536
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:53,098
The chip.

537
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:58,931
You know, twenty million dollars but two wages

538
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,899
apparently out of the question.

539
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,715
Why followed Jarod if this is what you wanted?

540
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:09,121
That was payoff the debt.

541
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,776
Jarod is to win friends and influence people.

542
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:14,462
I bring the man, all is forgivable.

543
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:17,252
The Center welcomes ...

544
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:18,898
We'll see.

545
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,282
So they sent you to clean up?

546
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,723
- Really gonna kill me?
- That's up to you.

547
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:30,141
Then why are you still talking about it?

548
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:38,756
It isn't as easy as it looks, is it?

549
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,034
You know why you don't want to kill me?

550
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:43,577
Because you are me.

551
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:48,098
It is natural desire for poeple like us to dominate the fine.

552
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:51,182
You and I have nothing in common.

553
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,083
We bo...

554
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:59,036
We both recognise,

555
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:04,120
that this notion of human equality just perpetuates mediocrity.

556
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:06,417
But we are not mediocrity.

557
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,235
Are we, Miss Parker?

558
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:10,900
We are independent.

559
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,101
And independence,

560
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:16,062
is the privilege of the strong.

561
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:20,179
Tell me, Miss Parker.

562
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,780
How strong are you?

563
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,891
Strong enough.

564
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,081
How strong are you?

565
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,282
Test me.

566
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,498
Nice working with you.

567
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,699
Yeah.

568
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,618
Mr. Flanagan? I hold a restaurant called Jax.

569
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,352
How did you get this number?

570
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:54,295
Some friends of yours are over there now setting you up to take a big fall.

571
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,755
I hope you remember this call if I need help in the future.

572
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,722
- Yeah.
- There were some cops hanging around the bar.

573
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,478
Cops?

574
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:10,498
I overheard one say Flanagan was going to set you up for a big fall tonight.

575
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,177
I thought you should know.

576
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:34,258
What the hell is this?

577
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:20,557
Turn around slowly and put your pistol on the pool table.

578
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:27,458
So what the hell is ( cellophane!)

579
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:30,400
And why you get to pay extra afford anyway?

580
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:31,601
What is this?

581
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:35,762
I just thought you'd like to see how Lester Knight looked, after you and Joey killed him.

582
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:36,652
Who are you?

583
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,832
Turn around and walk.

584
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:48,718
Get in it.

585
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,616
You are a dead man,Jarod.

586
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:54,917
You hear me, you are dead.

587
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:57,075
Woo, you need a chill out.

588
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,134
It's look cramp in there.

589
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:03,776
lmagine how Dean Clark must feel in his cell.

590
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:06,422
You are a RICO.

591
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,258
Did you know about this?

592
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,359
What you think!

593
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:12,377
Well the truth is I am not really a cop or a mobster.

594
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:14,178
It's sort of complicated.

595
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:17,582
Now each of you is responsible for the murder of Lester Knight.

596
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:22,401
So I thought it will be really need if you feel like he felt.

597
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:33,118
Listen, Jarod.

598
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:37,032
- It wasn't my idea about...
- Shut up, Joey.

599
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,338
Shut up.

600
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,479
Lester Knight found about Flanagan and Flanagan bumped him off.

601
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,639
Yeah, you dumped the body and then you framed Dean Clark.

602
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:50,800
Listen, Jarod, I'll give anything you want.

603
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,292
Actually you've just given me everything I need.

604
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:58,198
Jarod, please. You just you can't leave me in here and die.

605
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:01,181
It doesn't really matter if you freeze,

606
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:03,062
or you suffocate.

607
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,155
Like you say,Joey.

608
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:09,422
Dead is dead.

609
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:12,823
- Hey.
- Jarod, no.
- Dead is dead. You are dead.

610
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:35,456
It is a mess, Miss Parker.

611
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:39,292
No head. One of his arms, both of his legs are missing.

612
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:43,877
I'm guessing he got chewed up by the prop of a very large boat.

613
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,553
But it is him.

614
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:47,854
Thumb is got away.

615
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:50,097
Mr. Lyle.

616
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,955
Put a gun on you.

617
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:55,056
And made the choice for you.

618
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:56,237
I'll see you later.

619
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:57,838
Miss Parker.

620
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,138
Will you be alright?

621
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,921
I'm just tired, Syd. I am gonna go home to bed.

622
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:05,917
And I am feeling I am going to sleep like a baby.

623
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,676
I ...on that semiconduct chip before Raines had it confiscated.

624
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,260
It contained codes.

625
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,473
It is a computer chip, Broots.

626
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,481
No, no, no. I don't think you understand.

627
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:41,459
It contained genetic codes.

628
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:45,421
Genetic codes?

629
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,738
- Yeah.
- For what?

630
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,958
I think the properer question will be ''for whom''?

631
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:50,411
And?

632
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:51,712
I am not a geneticist.

633
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,721
I just can't help wondering if it has...

634
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:56,935
it's something to do with Jarod.

635
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:02,979
How is my angel?

636
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:06,558
There were genetic codes on that stolen panel.

637
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:08,179
Don't worry about. That's not important.

638
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,976
Important enough to have me killed a man.

639
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:14,754
Well, he is the enemy.

640
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:16,155
You did the right thing.

641
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:17,738
For who?

642
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:23,218
Smell like a cleaner..can't ..this life.

643
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,552
Let's rest, angel. You look like a hell.

644
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:31,856
It's a joke.

645
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,415
After you testify in court,

646
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,095
and all those blows over,

647
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:44,101
send me a postcard from Hawaii.

648
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:48,702
Hawaii? I don't even have enough money to get to Jersey.

649
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:52,098
You do now.

650
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,435
Where did this come from?

651
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:00,719
Joey's private account.

652
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,920
All the money he took from you.

653
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:06,163
Plus interest.

654
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:11,421
Who are you really?

655
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,078
An artist.

656
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:30,537
''U.S. Prosecuter, Mobster Arrested For Murder''

657
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:33,814
''Framed Cop Cleared''

658
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:01,815
''A Stand Up Guy''
