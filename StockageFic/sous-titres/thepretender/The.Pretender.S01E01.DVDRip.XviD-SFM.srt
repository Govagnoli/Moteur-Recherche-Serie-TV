[Buzz]

332
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,698
[Chuckling]

333
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,700
Very clever, Jarod.

334
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,702
Are you all right?

335
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,170
I'm broke.
You froze my bank account.

336
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,503
I must have just missed you
in Cincinnati.

337
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:24,509
The flowers were still fresh.

338
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:28,013
Well, my parents have been dead for 30 years.
I figured it was time I said good-bye.

339
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,014
- I want you to come home.
- [Chuckles]

340
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,516
There's an interesting way
to put it..."home."

341
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:35,520
- Why did you leave?
- You're the shrink, Sydney.

342
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:38,022
You want the truth?

343
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,524
It's because of the lies.

344
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,527
Your lies.

345
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:45,063
What lies?

346
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:49,966
I found out the real application
of my simulations, Sydney.

347
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,732
South Pacific
fleet simulation 118.

348
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:56,866
You took my results
and blew a ship out of the water.

349
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:59,741
A hundred and 33 people
were on board.

350
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,871
My outbreak simulation?

351
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,509
You used it in the field.

352
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:09,521
Forty-six people died
of the Ebola virus, Sydney.

353
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:14,549
Simulation 27.
Simulation 16. Simulation 42.

354
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,528
Jarod, these were
military contracts.

355
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:21,533
I had no way of finding out
about their ultimate application.

356
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,536
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

357
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,539
You need to come home.

358
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,541
I'm worried about you.

359
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:33,739
I've been walking around your room,
and it feels... empty.

360
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,615
Well, I can't say I miss it.

361
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,617
And by the way...

362
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:42,449
ice cream <i>is</i> good.

363
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,956
Jarod, this is getting serious.

364
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,220
- They brought in Miss Parker.
- Uh-oh.

365
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,694
Well, you better
watch your back too, Sydney.

366
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:54,494
- What are you doing, Jarod?
- Using the skills you taught me.

367
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:11,176
<i>[Man] I'm completely locked out here.</i>
<i>I got nothin'.</i>

368
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,219
- <i>Are you getting anything?</i>
- <i>No. Let me try a new access code.</i>

369
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:17,222
- Talk to me.
- We've been locked out.

370
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,249
Our client hired us to see if the stock exchange
was vulnerable to manipulation.

371
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:25,263
- Jarod spent four months on this simulation.
- What's the problem?

372
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,822
The client gave us five million
to testJarod's results.

373
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,425
<i>Jarod knew today</i>
<i>was the day of the test.</i>

374
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:34,098
<i>Everything was going to plan until someone</i>
<i>on the floor started to manipulate markets.</i>

375
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,835
- <i>They've stolen our five million.</i>
- Gee.

376
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,843
I wonder who that could be.

377
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:40,936
Well, at least we know where he is.

378
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:00,031
[Laughing]

379
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:02,966
That's some kind medicine
you got there.

380
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:06,971
I might laugh myself dead
before I poop!

381
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,974
[Chuckling]
Laughter is very good medicine.

382
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,101
And so is reflexology.

383
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:15,113
Nicole, massage these marks,
would you, please?

384
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:17,115
Thanks.

385
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,276
You gonna tell me the truth?

386
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,220
What truth?

387
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:25,780
A man who gives me the sun...

388
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,792
who massages my feet...

389
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,522
who gives me stinky tea...

390
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:34,189
Who are you?

391
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:40,434
Oh, so much sadness.

392
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:42,497
And so much joy.

393
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:55,053
<i>[Miss Parker] Comforting to know</i>
<i>there are only 137 hospitals...</i>

394
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:57,851

395
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,754
Your rooms have been prepaid,
Miss Parker.

396
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:02,453
- Prepaid?
- In cash.

397
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:05,691
And the gentleman left this.

398
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,430
Not a word.

399
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,077
- Alan. Hey.
- Jarod, hi. Hi.

400
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:23,081
Denise, I'll have
another ginger ale, please.

401
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,811
- Make that two ginger ales.
- Okay.

402
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,786
Either you've
just been mugged...

403
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,288
or it's been one hell of a shift.

404
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:34,292
Four gunshot wounds,
a lobectomy and a ruptured spleen...

405
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,351
and I'm only halfway through.

406
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:41,624
Alan, I think I might have
screwed up today.

407
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,691
Really screwed up.

408
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:47,638
Hey, how you doin'?
Yeah, I'm okay.

409
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:50,140
Hey, look, is this Trader's exchange?

410
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,202
Good. Look, I gotta
get a message to him. Yeah.

411
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,908
So...

412
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:59,109
what's the trouble?

413
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:06,758
The lobectomy? I think I left
a hemo inside when I sewed her up.

414
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:09,386
- No problem.
- No problem?

415
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:12,590
- You think that's gonna make the H.M.O. happy?
- Check her chart.

416
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:15,463
If the white count is spiked,
you've found your hemo.

417
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,331
Well, then what?

418
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:19,667
Take it out.

419
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:22,298
Tell her you found
some internal bleeding.

420
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,308
- Hey, you're the doctor.
- Oh.

421
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,970
- <i>[Pager Beeping]</i>
- Ah.

422
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:30,675
Always count on it happening
on your lunch break, huh?

423
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,090
Um, I gotta get back.

424
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:42,150
- Well, thank you for the advice, Alan.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

to speak to you face-to-face.

Don't look so surprised.
I don't want money. I want the truth.

What are you talking about?

456
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,378
Who am I?
Did the Centre adopt me?

457
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:21,749
Was I bought, or was I stolen?
And where are my mom and dad?

458
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,254
Jarod, we've been over this
a thousand times.

459
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,917
Your parents died
in a plane crash.

460
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:31,156
Yes, I know the story, Sydney.
It's been burned into my brain for 30 years.

461
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,665
But, you see,
I did a little checking.

462
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:38,499
There's this genetic anomaly
that's in my blood...

463
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,368
that should be in my supposed parents.

464
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,374
But it's not.

465
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:47,071
Therefore, it's impossible
that I'm their son.

466
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,015
So, the truth, for once.

467
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,517
- [Man] I thought you quit.
- [Miss Parker] Shut up.

- Damn it!
- What?

470

You have to believe me.

00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:12,570
But it doesn't matter.

474
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,572
It matters to me.

- Tell me who I am.
- I don't know either.

481

At the time, I had no reason
to question what the Centre told me.

- I swear.
- Then prove it.

Give me tomorrow's code
to the Centre's mainframe.

484
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,362
The truth about who I am
has to be in there.

485
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:47,428
- You know I can't do that.
- Sydney, you stole my life!

Gwen!

502
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:48,099
- Dr. Russell.
- Can I speak to you for a minute?

503
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,158
Is there a problem?

504
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:57,207
You're not supposed to have that.

505
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,710
I knew that Trader was involved.

506
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:02,838
What I couldn't figure out was
why would anybody help him cover it up?

507
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,849
I don't know
what you're talking about.

508
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:08,284
I didn't either, until I found this.

509
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:10,514
It's a printout of your record.

510
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:13,005
Who else knew you were in prison
besides Trader?

511

Who the hell are you?

512

what happened to Kevin Bailey's fair.

<i>Just tell the truth.</i>

520
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:42,600
What would you do
if your wife came home and told you...

521
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:46,434
that she'd been a crackhead
and a convict?

522
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,939
<i>I'd say she paid her debt.</i>

523
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:53,172
And I'd ask her why she didn't
trust me enough to tell me the truth.

524
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:57,508
At least that's what
I think I would do.

525
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:01,686
You don't know how scared I am.

526
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,649
I think I do.

527
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:19,693
I had to page Dr. Trader
that night at the Silver Rail.

528
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:23,032
<i>We all knew he drank...</i>

529
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:25,042
but nobody wanted to admit it.

530
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,044
I showed him the X-rays.

531
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:30,047
Even I knew that the boy
should have been stabilized...

532
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,515
but he insisted I was wrong and...

533
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:35,213
He was the doctor.

534
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:41,216
He severed the little boy's spinal cord
when he moved him.

535
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:46,264
<i>But it was Dr. Hendricks</i>
<i>who covered it all up...</i>

536
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:50,132
<i>and threatened to expose my past</i>
<i>if I didn't go along.</i>

537
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,136
See, uh...

538
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,764
when Trader realized
what he'd done...

539
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,367
he gave me the pre-op X-rays
and told me to burn them.

540
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:00,378
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

541
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,641
<i>I went to Dr. Hendricks instead.</i>

542
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:05,650
I don't know why I thought
it would do any good.

543
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:08,482
He's been covering for Trader for years.

544
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:10,488
He took the X-rays...

545
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:14,151
and he made me swear that I wouldn't
tell anybody that he had 'em.

546
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:17,218
He said that he might be able
to use them for insurance.
