1
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:10,678
Getting out a little early today, Sydney.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,079
Jarod.

3
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,541
My god, Jarod. They are going to see you.

4
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,418
Something bad is happening, Sydney.

5
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,736
There is not much time left.

6
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:27,159
Jarod, let's get out of here.

7
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:28,737
I need answers.

8
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:32,534
- Answers?
- Who I am? Where I came from?

9
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:34,922
Who my parents are?

10
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,495
Just give me something.

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,400
Even if it's just a name.

12
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:41,421
But I need to know now.

13
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:42,519
So do I.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,420
Jarod.

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,420
Me too.

16
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,262
I don't understand.

17
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:48,419
He deserves answers, Sydney.

18
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:57,738
Jacob!

19
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:09,320
I don't understand, Jacob.

20
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:11,515
It is complicated.

21
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:13,482
Please, Sydney.

22
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:15,915
I don't have much time.

23
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,975
Good morning, Broots.

24
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:40,476
Sorry to interrupt.

25
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:44,395
- Let me guess, Jarod?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:49,671
Just arrived this morning. He bought it from some place called the of Astro Arcade of lndianapolis.

27
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,996
He wasing working in a pin-ball parlor?

28
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:53,875
No, actually he was just hanging out.

29
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:57,300
The owner said he played this exact game for almost twenty-four hours straight

30
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,877
on one single coin.

31
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:00,420
Impressive!

32
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,321
Oh yeah!

33
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,638
And what Sydney is taking on, game boy?

34
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,039
Oh, Sydney.

35
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,135
He left this email.

36
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:10,534
''Our suffocated friend is awake.''

37
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:12,374
He is awake.

38
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:15,277
Jacob is a threat to Center interest.

39
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:18,277
Make sure Jacob never wakes up again.

40
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:24,634
''I'll be away fishing.''

41
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,481
Find out where Sydney is.

42
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:44,994
Thirty-one point four eight. This one is fast.

43
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,839
It's still more a few seconds of the track records.

44
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:52,075
It's five years you spent to attain this speed, R.J.

45
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:54,181
This guy isn't even on back just backed you.

46
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:55,438
What he says his last name was?

47
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,539
Jones.

48
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:59,042
He drives like Parnelli. That's for ... Let's go.

49
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:05,159
As the MCl car is coming in to the ... lane,

50
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:07,358
Tests are now open for the next hour.

51
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:18,200
That was incredible!

52
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,201
Thank you!

53
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:20,418
You are a some driver!

54
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,119
Excuse me.

55
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:22,551
Wonder how the secrets.

56
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,419
You know I could get faster. My foot slipped off the gas pedal going turn four.

57
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:28,633
Where did you learn to drive a race car?

58
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:30,153
lndianapolis.

59
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,820
Really? The brickyard?

60
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,742
The Astro Arcade.

61
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,343
There are pretenders among us.

62
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,712
I was taken from my family.

63
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:43,375
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

64
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,742
How many people died because of what I thought up?

65
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,901
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

66
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:50,916
He is a pretender.

67
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,062
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

68
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,599
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

69
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,682
He defends the weak and abused.

70
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:00,657
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: 笨笨/葱葱

74
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:12,882
You are a doctor?

75
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,339
I am today.

76
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:24,173
Jarod, this is Nigel Brinkman, our number one driver.

77
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,731
- Welcome to the big show, Jarod.
- Nice to be here.

78
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,362
Jarod is going to be taking over the number three car for Jimmy.

79
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:31,822
He had an accident in Milwaukee, didn't he?

80
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,502
My son broke his leg.

81
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:35,919
Doctor said it will be at least a year until he drives again.

82
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,800
But he will, you know why, he is a Roemer.

83
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,357
Jimmy got a little ... himself.

84
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:42,521
He took R.J.'s car and just cut the tyre and pulled it into a wall.

85
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,881
Well I can understand why R.J. would be a little defensive.

86
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:47,335
My son's going to handle it.

87
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,757
That's racing.

88
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:51,335
Come on, we take you to settle in.

89
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,557
I accept nothing but the best for my drivers, Jarod.

90
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:56,178
I can see that.

91
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,038
This one is an oldy.

92
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:01,757
Guess you can see that knife was R.J.'s first trophy.

93
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,161
He gained this in the India Lights Championship.

94
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,097
There is winning the national ...

95
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:11,418
There is finished in second at Long Beach . I am not sure why that I haven't seen it up there.

96
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,871
I would have won that race if the car's been set up right.

97
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:14,772
Really?

98
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,643
I don't remember our chief mechanic driving the car that day.

99
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,262
Hawkes is a dinosaur.

100
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,742
R.J., the visiting hours of the hospital are over...

101
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,332
- Oh, sorry. I don't realize that any...
- It is okay, darling, come in.

102
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:29,071
I think I get to go check the telemetry readings on the practise.

103
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,298
You are not going to see Jimmy?

104
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,582
Well, I'll try, okay?

105
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,912
Anna, this is Jarod Jones. He is taking over Jimmy's ride.

106
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:42,195
And this is my daughter-in-law.

107
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:43,196
Hi.

108
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:43,997
Pleasure.

109
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,454
She will give you a race paperwork started then we turn a test at one.

110
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,633
Well, this is uncomfortable.

111
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:53,896
It's racing.

112
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,472
I heard about your husband's accident.

113
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,973
I hope he'll be alright.

114
00:05:58,063 --> 00:05:58,693
Thanks.

115
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:01,103
Doctor says it's too soon to tell if it left damages on

116
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:02,838
permanent.

117
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:06,158
You need to fill in a background information form.

118
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,898
Background information?

119
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,375
So the media and sponsors know who you are.

120
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,276
I am not really interested in the publicity.

121
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,755
In this business you will answer more questions and eat more cocktail winnies than you've thought possible.

122
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,694
I am sure that everything is going to work out.

123
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:31,818
It looks like your family is very close.

124
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,981
Sounds that way, don't they?

125
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:52,039
''Jimmy Roemer Wipes Out Brother's Car in Practice''

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,240
''Jimmy Roemer's Career in Doubt''

127
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,158
Anything yet?

128
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:10,042
Well, I've gone over Sydney's messages dozen times. And the best I can come up with is ''gone to white cloud''.

129
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:11,198
Where?

130
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:14,453
Sydney has a cabin up in the mounts in white cloud lake.

131
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,535
He goes there to fish sometimes.

132
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:17,955
Sydney and trout.

133
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:19,952
Boggles the mind.

134
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,253
Do you know where it is?

135
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:21,754
Oh, yeah.

136
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:22,942
Write down the directions.

137
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,538
I still don't get the part about ''our suffocated friend is awake''.

138
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,161
The directions, Broots.

139
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,656
The last word is ''white cloud''.

140
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,213
You don't have to draw me a map.

141
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,337
So you both drive for the same team, but you race against each other?

142
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,152
Not exactly. R.J. here is what you might call my

143
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,212
supporting.

144
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,859
I don't understand.

145
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:03,061
Let's why we get ringroad here. It's little confused which my confrere smells my exhaust fume at most of the race.

146
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,058
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:09,276
It got away from me.

148
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:11,762
You didn't sign me this morning.

149
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,516
I was in your pit earlier.

150
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:16,801
Oh, yes. Are you a driver too?

151
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:18,402
Yeah.

152
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,617
Now, when you talked about the life and death aspect of racing

153
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:25,139
you come right to the heart of the drivers' very existence.

154
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,840
Really!

155
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:30,758
Did you want something?

156
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:35,082
Yes, I don't have a big car yet and I was wondering if you give me a lift.

157
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,583
I need to visit someone.

158
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:38,578
Yeah, alright.

159
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,674
It is the hospital Jimmy's in.

160
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:48,302
I thought I should meet the man I was serving for.

161
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:49,371
You wanna join me?

162
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:55,314
It must be difficult.

163
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,396
Working so hard,

164
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,562
never get a supporting you need to win.

165
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,539
I will win. I have to.

166
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,214
What was Jimmy doing in your car the day of crash?

167
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,453
He saw the pathetic data on the three car.

168
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:08,776
Jimmy wanted to know what's like to drive a competitor ride.

169
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:11,477
I feel sorry for him. And give him a shot. And the story.

170
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:13,442
According to the data after the crash,

171
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,539
Jimmy had a throttle wide open when he hit the wall.

172
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,059
I love my brother, but,

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,260
he didn't know his limits.

174
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,676
Your brother has a very rare disease.

175
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:30,155
In Jacob's case he's stimulated the brain and seems like... awaked areas injured years earlier.

176
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,816
Is he aware of the surroundings?

177
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,412
On and off. His motor skills are very elementary.

178
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:38,959
and his speech appears to be limited to single word out of he says.

179
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,500
I would like to see him now.

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,698
Well, before you do it, something else you should know about your brother's condition.

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Jacob.

182
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,259
Can you hear me?

183
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:23,371
This is Sydney.

184
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:26,272
May we...

185
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:28,673
Care...

186
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,474
She's on phone...

187
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,475
Greta...

188
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,381
He seems to be drifting from one thought to another.

189
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,863
I am not sure who this Greta woman is.

190
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,533
Greta was our mother's name.

191
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:48,934
Jacob.

192
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,419
Listen to this carefully.

193
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,195
Do you know what year it is?

194
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:02,701
1942.

195
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,480
I'd like to take him with me.

196
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:20,281
Mr. Raines.

197
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,957
We've gone playing the Sydney's telephone tape.

198
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:28,094
You're right. His brother is still alive.

199
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:31,152
But you will take care of that, won't you?

200
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:32,837
My pleasure.

201
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,161
Sun too hot?

202
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,502
Nah, I am fine.

203
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,519
Doctors say you can start re-... in another month.

204
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:49,841
I'd start today if it were on my way.

205
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:53,257
That's my little brother, getting no good when he's sitting on it.

206
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,539
Where have you been, stranger?

207
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,940
I have better things to do than hanging out the bunch of gimps.

208
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:58,251
Yeah. What's your name?

209
00:11:59,063 --> 00:11:59,718
Guilty.

210
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:01,819
Anna.

211
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,381
I thought you won't coming.

212
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,082
Got to have faith in your family.

213
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:09,942
Can you get my baseball cap in my room? I am getting a little toasted out here.

214
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,043
Yeah, sure.

215
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:19,344
Hey, here.

216
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:22,157
Don't eat too many candy bars. You would be driving last car in next year.

217
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:24,812
Hi, Jimmy Roemer.

218
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:26,113
Jarod Jones.

219
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:28,158
Jarod is driving number three car.

220
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,336
Good for you.

221
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,137
Win one for the whole team.

222
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:34,136
I'm just keeping your place warm until you get back.

223
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,121
How are you feeling?

224
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,922
Like a runner with a flat tyre.

225
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:40,458
Just take and slow.

226
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:41,537
It'll all come back to you.

227
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:47,192
I feel pretty stupid parking ... ride to the wall.

228
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:52,098
I mean, I know I blacked out, but I swear I was braking.

229
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,718
The engine just kept ... after I made contact.

230
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,042
Hey, accidents happen.

231
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,143
You remember my prom night?

232
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:04,077
Dad was peeled out!

233
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,438
I rocked my ... around a telephone pole.

234
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,941
Of course he didn't cost a hundred grand to have it fixed.

235
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,697
Fill me up, will you?

236
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:16,759
Are you okay?

237
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,560
Yeah.

238
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,679
Hard to believer I drive a race car, huh?

239
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,819
Like you say, accidents happen.

240
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,632
I am taking you out of here, Jacob.

241
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,833
To the cabin of the white cloud.

242
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,957
You used to love going to white cloud, remember?

243
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,542
Go that way. I will take the stairs.

244
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,634
Okay, drop the mop.

245
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,318
He can't understand you.

246
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,019
- Hey, Jarod.
- Hey, Mario

247
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,612
Nice run. I was watching you.

248
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:03,418
Just a little tip. Going for turn one, just keep it down a bit, be lower. Stay below the bumps.

249
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:04,634
I think you gonna like it.

250
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,519
- I love that tips.
- Take care.

251
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:14,714
Seventeen races, six months without podium finish! This, gentleman is unacceptable.

252
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:18,271
And that is why we are now going to be into race as eighteen.

253
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:18,772
Meaning?

254
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:22,816
Meaning you gonna do whatever it takes to get the number one car out front and keep it there.

255
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:24,092
What about me?

256
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:25,778
Me, me, me, there is no me.

257
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,979
It's a team sport now.

258
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:29,796
I want you and Jarod to let Nigel drive behind your cars,

259
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,795
block out the leaders so he can gain track position, okay?

260
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:33,796
Excuse me.

261
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,602
Blocking is ... offence.

262
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,078
- It's called racing.
- Yeah, so basically Jarod and I are just traffic cops.

263
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:45,172
You have any idea how much money it takes to support three cars?

264
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:46,073
Fine, dad, I just meant...

265
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,838
Sponsors want to see their product in victory lane.

266
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:52,157
otherwise they find another team.

267
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:55,102
And you go back to ...junk with monster trucks.

268
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:59,037
Which means driving smart, not like that lose kind of brother of yours.

269
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,238
Son of bitch.

270
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,639
Hey, hey, R.J.

271
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,952
Cool down.

272
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:06,095
Come on, Hawkes is right.

273
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,419
Jimmy had that business be in number two car, you know it.

274
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:11,392
Yeah, and check the race in last time, I should be top right.

275
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:12,393
Yeah, right.

276
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,454
Come on, Hawkes, I'll show you some in the front of ...

277
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,173
Someone should shot that son of bitch for good.

278
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:21,092
You see, that's the kind of Roemer spirit that I am looking for.

279
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,978
I just want to some of them on the track.

280
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,381
Some much for the home team.

281
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:53,982
Sydney.

282
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:57,983
Sydney.

283
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:03,437
Oh, god. You scared the hell out of me.

284
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,962
You are expecting to find two corpses, Miss Parker?

285
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,220
What did Raines promise you?

286
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,902
What are you talking about?

287
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,397
The sweeper team that showed up at the hospital.

288
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,697
You called Raines up, didn't you?

289
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:21,898
Admit it!

290
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,799
Let go of me, Sydney.

291
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,300
You are the only one who knows my brother is still alive.

292
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,074
Raines thinks I murdered Jacob.

293
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:32,453
If he knew he was still alive, I would be in more danger than anyone.

294
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,897
I suggest you just check your home phone for bugs.

295
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,756
And let go of me.

296
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:41,692
Has he said anything?

297
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:42,840
I need to reach him, Parker.

298
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,841
I need answers.

299
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:46,392
Answers?

300
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:48,915
About what I've done.

301
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,732
You did brake, Jimmy. But your engine kept running.

302
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,879
Jimmy used to walk the stands for every race.

303
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,819
He said that felt like being in church.

304
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,478
Thanks for getting R.J. to go to see Jimmy.

305
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,279
...his brother.

306
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:41,612
I thought I might help.

307
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:42,413
Yeah.

308
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:44,812
How is he doing?

309
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,278
...he feels like he failed.

310
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:48,518
Failed?

311
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,498
Me, R.J., mostly his dad.

312
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,501
Grant is pretty intense.

313
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,238
Yeah, he always encouraged them to compete against each other.

314
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,592
No wonder when Jimmy was seven,

315
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,597
Grant took him and R.J. out to a cabin,

316
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,182
made them each chop a quarter wood,

317
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:06,072
told them the winner get a brand new Odekirk fishing knife and fishing attachments.

318
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,592
I saw the photograph in the trailer.

319
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,093
Right, now there is no way a couple of kids can cut out that wood.

320
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,672
And Grant knew that.

321
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,838
But he left them out there alone in the cold.

322
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,296
What happened?

323
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,997
There is a lumber yard nearby.

324
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,813
So R.J. .. a tractor,

325
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,171
rides up the hill,

326
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,901
buys himself a fresh cut .. wood,

327
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:28,081
and wins the knife.

328
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,656
Sounds like the real prides was winning his father's approval.

329
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,602
And he would do anything to get it.

330
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,855
Something's never changed.

331
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:49,956
Sydney.

332
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:52,957
Sydney.

333
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,158
Catherine.

334
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:10,459
You remember my mother?

335
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:15,359
You look just like her.

336
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Yes.

337
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,973
But you remember her.

338
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,074
Jacob.

339
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,279
Please Jacob, try to remember.

340
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,680
Why can't you remember?

341
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:35,321
Because he is dying.

342
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,015
The same virus that will awaken Jacob

343
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:03,239
is also killing him.

344
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:07,456
He has less than twelve hours left.

345
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,421
I am sorry, Sydney.

346
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:17,296
What can we do?

347
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:22,611
Broots is bringing some my personal items.

348
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,676
Photos or movies.

349
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:32,821
If only I can help Jacob remember,

350
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:36,692
maybe he can tell us something about your mother.

351
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,039
Or about Jarod.

352
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:55,838
Or maybe he can simply die,

353
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:59,519
Knowing who he is.

354
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:14,952
It's okay.

355
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,555
Now there Andretti is racing ...

356
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:28,376
But stay low, avoid the bumps. You will be glad you did.

357
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:31,014
Something about that voice sounds kind of familiar.

358
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:31,815
But thanks.

359
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,000
- What's that?
- I came across it a throttle cable from Jimmy's crashed engine.

360
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:26,095
- Well, you are a car inspector now?
- I just want to know how things work.

361
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,153
I couldn't figure out what these scratches were.

362
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:30,017
Jimmy bent the cable plate.

363
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:31,677
And what happens when the cable plates bent?

364
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:33,855
You bent the cable plate, your throotle stick.

365
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:35,978
Is that what happened to Jimmy?

366
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,374
Look, I did a car inspection after the accident.

367
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,754
Jimmy's crash had nothing to do with a mechanic error.

368
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:42,192
Well, then how do you explain these marks?

369
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,332
Damage in the crash.

370
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,899
Come on, I am not a mechanic. But these marks are looked they were made by set of pliers.

371
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:50,535
You are right. You are not a mechanic.

372
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:58,494
Oh, well, this place is really nice.

373
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:00,295
Hey.

374
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:03,496
Here.

375
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,417
Hey, do you think maybe I can rent here for some weekend I can bring my daughter here?

376
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:09,500
- That's it?
- Yes, it's over.

377
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:10,659
You can leave now.

378
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,160
Okay.

379
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:16,881
Can, can I at least go to the bathroom first? Is it through here?

380
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,018
Broots, wait.

381
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:22,516
What's going on?

382
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,641
My Brother Jacob is quite ill.

383
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:34,418
You breed a word of this to anybody and to every diary case and America would be ... your face.

384
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:35,758
Got it?

385
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,259
Yeah.

386
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,838
Go back to the Center, if you notice anything unusual,

387
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:43,942
you call me. We need protection for at least for another ten hours.

388
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:44,778
Understood?

389
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:48,015
Yeah, as good as it never gone out.

390
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,316
Why would you want to kill your own brother, R.J.?

391
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,177
Yeah, I just come back.

392
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:41,931
No, it's quiet. Everything seems to be really cool.

393
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:43,476
Of course, I won't say anything.

394
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:44,377
Miss Parker.

395
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,641
Could you do me a favor?

396
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:50,813
Could you wish Sydney good luck...

397
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:53,314
Miss Parker?

398
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:55,315
Hello?

399
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,774
God, I hate her when she does that.

400
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,875
Mr. Raines.

401
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:12,518
Damn it!

402
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:15,418
I am sorry about that, man.

403
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:19,319
Hey!

404
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,154
So didn't that eat you up, R.J.?

405
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,597
Now I have to make some major buddy work.

406
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:30,575
You wouldn't happen to have a small screwdriver or a set of pliers, would you?

407
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:33,532
Someone broke the lock of garage and stole all the pliers last night.

408
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:36,132
Really? Can't trust anybody these days.

409
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,458
Hey, Jones, try this.

410
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:40,992
Odekirk.

411
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,921
It's very difficult to come by.

412
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:49,622
Where did you get this?

413
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:51,815
I won it about a year ago.

414
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,254
From whom?

415
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:57,952
From me.

416
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,254
Data hate the soon losers, right?

417
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,795
Did R.J. threaten to take your number one car, Brinkman?

418
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,702
Remember those tennis matches in Yale?

419
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:47,992
I still think you let me win so that I wouldn't feel so bad.

420
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:02,893
Jacob.

421
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:05,838
Listen to me.

422
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:10,713
There are things you know, Jacob.

423
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:13,499
Things that can help others.

424
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,657
Remember Jarod?

425
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,935
You signed him into the Center.

426
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,336
the night he was brought there.

427
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:25,121
Parker and I found files at SL twenty-seven.

428
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,076
Your signature was on Jarod's entrance report.

429
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:29,337
Think back.

430
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:33,617
where did he come from?

431
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:39,215
What was his real name?

432
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:45,941
His parents name?

433
00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:49,453
That is the least I can do for him.

434
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:56,872
Since your car accident, I've done things, Jacob,

435
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,114
Unspeakable things,

436
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:01,982
to protect Jarod,

437
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:03,636
to protect you.

438
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:07,773
I even tried to kill Dr. Raines.

439
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:10,073
But the bullet hit his oxygen tank and...

440
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,059
It's pretty ..., huh?

441
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:31,982
I rebuilt Jimmy's engine from the crash.

442
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:33,742
All by myself.

443
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:38,793
I did however have to replace

444
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,919
this damaged throttle cable.

445
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,101
Maybe I should be a car inspector.

446
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,213
What do you want?

447
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:48,534
Do you remember these markings?

448
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:52,994
It turns out they were indeed made by a pair of pliers.

449
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:54,939
Pliers from another Odekirk knife.

450
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,440
This Odekirk knife.

451
00:29:56,823 --> 00:29:58,156
Used to belong to R.J.,

452
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:02,079
but R.J. lost it in a bet to Nigel Brinkman.

453
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:05,071
What's this got to do with me?

454
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,521
I am glad you asked.

455
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:08,777
This is a videotape,

456
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,661
from the surveillance cameras in the garages of Milwaukee.

457
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,137
It's dated the day before Jimmy's crash.

458
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:18,714
It shows you letting Nigel Brinkman into the number two car garage.

459
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:21,820
Brinkman was worring that R.J. was going to take over the number one car.

460
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:25,375
How was he supposed to know that Jimmy was going to be behind that wheel that day?

461
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,482
Why would I want to hurt R.J.?

462
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,557
Because you wanted Nigel to replace this cruel boss.

463
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:31,997
I found resumes.

464
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:35,181
Resumes of people applying for your job.

465
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:38,582
Oh, god.

466
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:41,454
I am fifty-six years old.

467
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,679
I can't start over again.

468
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,698
I never want to hurt Jimmy.

469
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:49,333
What the hell was that kid doing in that car anyway?

470
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:51,078
He was covering for me.

471
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:58,134
Your hand.

472
00:30:58,735 --> 00:30:59,635
Yeah.

473
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:04,040
I started having spasms about six months ago.

474
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:07,453
Day of the race, I was so bad. I could barely hold the wheel.

475
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:08,974
That I asked Jimmy to cover for me.

476
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:11,431
I've seen cases like yours.

477
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:12,532
It's treatable.

478
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:13,775
Yeah, I will take care of it later.

479
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,437
It's time to think Jimmy.

480
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,676
I messed up, Jarod.

481
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:25,823
I let down my father and almost killed my little brother.

482
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,419
You didn't know that Brinkman messed with the engine.

483
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,422
I know now.

484
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,900
I am going to do everything I can to make it right.

485
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:37,319
We all will.

486
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,658
No, don't lie to me.

487
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:55,212
I tell you, I don't know anybody named Jacob.

488
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:57,175
Six hours, Mr. Broots.

489
00:31:57,463 --> 00:32:00,572
Is all this discomfort worth for protecting someone like Sydney?

490
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:06,493
I don't know what you are talking about.

491
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,652
Well then, maybe I can help drag your memory.

492
00:32:21,263 --> 00:32:23,497
Look, okay, I think I start to remember.

493
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,001
Hello, Anna. It is Jarod.

494
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,139
Jimmy would be able to come to the track tomorrow?

495
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:40,174
''Cart Headquarters''

496
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,672
Nigel, it's Jarod.

497
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:44,276
Hawkes thinks he made a break through on your set up.

498
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,235
Can you do a little testing in the morning?

499
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,212
Great. I'll see you then.

500
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:54,257
I tell you, I don't have enough courage in the bets.

501
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:55,258
Yeah.

502
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,659
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah.

503
00:32:57,103 --> 00:33:00,320
- Could you direct me the public address bead?
- There is a rack in the back.

504
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,618
That's what the problem is.

505
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:04,815
You only got five cameras out there, and I need twice that many.

506
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:13,958
Why don't you walk on the camera truck?

507
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:18,894
Television! I'd be out of my mind.

508
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:24,540
Can we at least get it on camera positions?

509
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:34,942
Only one and a half seconds

510
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:38,374
seperating the two cars in the front roads...

511
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,215
Nigel! Glad you made it here.

512
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,978
Hey, if you boys think you can get some more speed out this car, I am ready to go.

513
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,299
Where is Grant?

514
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,500
Considering what's on at last meeting,

515
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:51,718
Hawkes thought it would be wise if we kept this between us until we save the fence up.

516
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,258
Okay, let's go to run.

517
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:55,459
Here you go.

518
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:08,581
Alright, Nigel, have a good run!

519
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:10,982
Ready?

520
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:13,098
Go!

521
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:17,618
How did you feel?

522
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:18,631
So far so good.

523
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:23,541
I'm going to warm up then you'll see what you can do.

524
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:30,136
What the hell Brinkman is doing out there?

525
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:31,656
You should watch this.

526
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:33,257
And then we have to talk.

527
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,381
I'm going to roam up the next turn round.

528
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:00,356
How does it feel, Nigel?

529
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,918
Oh, man, there isn't any better than this.

530
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,560
Come on, Nigel, you can go faster than that.

531
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,935
Jarod, what are you doing out there?

532
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:24,617
I am just trying to find out what really happened to Jimmy's car before the crash.

533
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,938
I don't know what you are talking about.

534
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:28,378
Lies.

535
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,221
This is what I am talking about.

536
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:32,719
I don't know anything about Jimmy's accidental crash.

537
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
I am pulling in.

538
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:39,056
Not so fast, Nigel.

539
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:42,177
..game up. I have control on your car.

540
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,177
You are out of your mind.

541
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:44,339
Think so?

542
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,217
What the hell I can't..?

543
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:50,856
Now you know how it feels.

544
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:55,592
Careful, I really hate to see you crash.

545
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:56,777
What the hell is going on?

546
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,694
I want to know why you sabotage R.J.'s car.

547
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,577
Why you nearly killed Jimmy Roemer?

548
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,582
You are not making sense, Jarod. Now stop this car!

549
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,438
Stop it, Jarod.

550
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:10,196
...

551
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:13,418
Give you a information that I had your filled tank on top.

552
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,719
So you should be good for at least

553
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,139
seventy laps.

554
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:21,336
Bad news is I put on four old tyres.

555
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,200
My guess is one of them will blow any time now.

556
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:25,880
You know what that means.

557
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:27,637
I can't hold this any more.

558
00:36:28,023 --> 00:36:29,097
That's the idea.

559
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:32,638
Oh, right.

560
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,740
I ... R.J.'s car, but I didn't know that Jimmy's going to behind that wheel, I swear.

561
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,659
I cann't lose.

562
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:40,196
Now you know how Jimmy felt.

563
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:42,340
I'm getting to the wall. Jarod, Jarod.

564
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:47,852
You said it yourself, Nigel.

565
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:49,759
That's racing.

566
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:08,879
Nigel Brinkman? Come with us, please.

567
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:48,737
Please, Sydney.

568
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,552
I don't have much time.

569
00:37:58,053 --> 00:37:58,953
Sydney.

570
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,477
I am here, Jacob.

571
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:10,039
I want you to know that no matter what you did,

572
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:12,856
what we did,

573
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:15,437
I never blame you.

574
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:18,917
I think that together we rob Jarod of his life.

575
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:20,798
And for that we will be judged.

576
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,594
But I'm not allowed to be angry,

577
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,036
and to forgive.

578
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:27,833
And I only hope that,

579
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:29,734
one day,

580
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:36,058
Jarod can feel the same.

581
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:40,059
Gene.

582
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,160
Gene?

583
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:45,878
Gene who?

584
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,835
Here, try to write it down.

585
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,501
Is it Jarod's real name?

586
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,757
Or his father's?

587
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,452
Who is Gene?

588
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:26,443
Please Jacob, I need to know.

589
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,261
I am sorry, Sydney.

590
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,593
Jacob love this song.

591
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:52,436
And this place.

592
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:59,213
He came to finally find his rest here.

593
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:27,258
Where is he?

594
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:29,674
- Do you have any sevens?
- Got fish.

595
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:30,881
Check the bedroom.

596
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,792
Give you five?

597
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:35,719
You got to be cheating.

598
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:36,498
No one.

599
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,182
I know Jacob was here.

600
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:41,999
You are mistaken.

601
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,800
My brother is dead.

602
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:47,302
It's dangerous to deceive the Center.

603
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,222
I wouldn't push him.

604
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,492
A man with a temper to match his marksmanship.

605
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:57,815
Dangerous combo.

606
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:15,421
It's a beautiful place.

607
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:17,222
Jarod.

608
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:19,442
How did you know?

609
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:21,281
I called Broots.

610
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:25,097
He told me about Jacob.

611
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:31,253
He said you will be away from the Center for a few days, so I took a chance.

612
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:35,318
Hard to be alone on the world, do we?

613
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:43,378
I hope Jacob's passing was ... easy.

614
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:46,895
I believe it was.

615
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:50,836
Before he died,

616
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:53,134
my brother gave me this.

617
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:01,599
What does it mean?

618
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:03,622
Maybe your name,

619
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,223
maybe your parents'.

620
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:06,934
I wish I could be sure.

621
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:08,778
Anyway,

622
00:43:10,263 --> 00:43:13,499
I hope it'll help you find your own peace on the world.
