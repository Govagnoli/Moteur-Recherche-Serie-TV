1
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:26,222
I'll take that, Jarod.

2
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,635
Why have you been stealing these?

3
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,082
I've been making this.

4
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:42,838
A house?

5
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,319
A home.

6
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,540
This is where I grew up.

7
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,641
This is what I can remember.

8
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:51,976
What's home like, Sydney?

9
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:17,018
Seems window lab rats wear Hugo Boss.

10
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,061
It's like something out of GQ.

11
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:20,117
How would you know?

12
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:27,343
There must be twenty thousand dollars with the designer clothes here.

13
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:30,016
It appears that you have a fashion competitor, Miss Parker.

14
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:32,314
What's he up to, Syd?

15
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:36,439
A form of expression. Individuality, strength.

16
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,060
Showing off his colors the way of mating animals.

17
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,598
You might right about the mating part

18
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,676
The Kama Sutra of Love.

19
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:48,894
What's your boy learning from this?

20
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,574
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.

21
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:00,498
Jarod.

22
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:01,918
lsabella.

23
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:06,377
I've heard that superhero was dead.

24
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,933
Only slightly wounded.

25
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:14,499
Do you prefer to be called '' escort'' or ''gigolo''?

26
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:17,995
Well, why don't you give me one hour,

27
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:20,556
and you tell me.

28
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,657
There are pretenders among us.

29
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,352
I was taken from my family.

30
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:34,213
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent then any of our others.

31
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:37,421
How many people died because of what I thought up?

32
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,621
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

33
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:41,602
He is a pretender.

34
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:45,742
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

35
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,340
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

36
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:50,416
He defends the weak and abused.

37
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,397
Life is a gift.

38
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:55,398
THE PRETENDER

YTET PRESENTS

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

41
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:03,617
You are a doctor?

42
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,013
I am today.

43
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,519
Why leave all of this behind?

44
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:18,303
Jarod operates on the different level than other people.

45
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,652
The all must mean something, always does.

46
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,481
Hey, you guys come here to take a look at this.

47
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:32,712
''Follow me to the 1500 Hart Street.''

48
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:35,019
It seems pretty simple.

49
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:37,817
Let's find out.

50
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,018
Your cut.

51
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,293
Did the Kama Sutra come in handy?

52
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:00,574
- I lent my copy to a friend.
- Wow, you must memorize it.

53
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:02,541
A gift from lsabella.

54
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,542
What the hell did you do to that woman?

55
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,481
I just listened.

56
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,592
I can't decide who gets you next.

57
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,614
I hear Cynthia Sloan is lucky.

58
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:26,592
European countess to Detroit socializee?

59
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:31,172
Just because she is the only woman in Forbes fifty doesn't mean that I can't satisfy her.

60
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,075
Remember, Jarod.

61
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:37,232
They are paying for a fantasy, not paying for a man.

62
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:40,061
Do you think you can become someone else?

63
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:44,595
I'll do my best.

64
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:57,816
He splits up the terms and your employment for obvious reason, you've been hired as a...

65
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,682
Special consultant.

66
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,791
Everything you see and do

67
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:04,837
is strictly confidential.

68
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:06,834
Of course.

69
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:11,235
It's quite a house.

70
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:12,773
You should see the other six.

71
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:14,118
Seven.

72
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,519
Hello.

73
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:17,732
I am Jarod.

74
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:18,980
He signed?

75
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,161
It's a requirement of Frank's.

76
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:25,562
He oversees all my holdings and new ventures.

77
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,798
And which one am I?

78
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,538
You will be a little of both.

79
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:30,539
Well.

80
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,642
Let the games begin.

81
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:40,976
Let's lay the ground of you here for one reason.

82
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,052
Men have a tendency to hit on me,

83
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,953
you are going to save me there in convenience.

84
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:47,118
You are .. , Jarod, a piece of jewelry.

85
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,961
So that I have to shine.

86
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:52,022
Well, for five thousand dollars a week, I expect you to blind me.

87
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,438
You will be on call until the ribbon cutting on saturday.

88
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:57,498
For that?

89
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,099
Sloan towers.

90
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,060
The future of downtown Detroit.

91
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,517
Well, this is the future.

92
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,393
Then this, must be history.

93
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,781
Save our home!

94
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:22,382
Save our home! Save our home! Save our home! Save our..

95
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,393
What's like to have a home, Sydney?

96
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:37,394
Save our home! Save our home! Save our home!...

97
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:45,211
''Boy Plunges to Death''

98
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:22,256
Leave him alone.

99
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,332
He broke his wing.

100
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,135
I wish Michael was here.

101
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,157
Michael Edwards.

102
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:37,052
The boy that fell from the fire escape.

103
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:40,895
He.. the birds.

104
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:43,962
He gonna be veterinarian when he grow up.

105
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,220
I was a veterinarian once.

106
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:48,178
Can you make him fly again?

107
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:50,278
I don't know.

108
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,920
Tracy Johnson, you get off this roof, right now.

109
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:56,838
I gotta go.

110
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:00,133
Girl is going to get herself killed.

111
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:05,616
I run the neighbourhood watch program in this building. And your face doesn't look familiar.

112
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,060
I was just trying to help the bird.

113
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,299
I guess that Michael Edwards cared for them.

114
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,856
What do you know about Michael?

115
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,337
Just what I've read.

116
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:23,571
This is where it happened.

117
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,354
I told that boy a thousand times to stay off this roof.

118
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:30,220
My name is Jarod.

119
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:33,816
Alice Evans.

120
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,812
Nice to meet you, Alice Evans.

121
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:39,120
Three stories he fell straight down.

122
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:41,216
Then they condemn this place.

123
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:45,780
Now Cynthia Sloan can get her .. clause on the only raw property left in the city.

124
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,095
Throw hundreds of family out of their homes.

125
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:54,536
The fire escapes, they don't collapse under the weight of a eight-year-old boy.

126
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,540
The city said it was the wether.

127
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:59,681
You are not been living down in two-twelve for nearly forty years.

128
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:02,777
Suddenly, the bricks start crumbling like sodas.

129
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,135
I don't think so.

130
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,721
I only I wish I've been around to help him.

131
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:27,962
Look, I can't take on another client.

132
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,274
I am on Cynthia Sloan's back and call night and day.

133
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,855
Don't worry about that. This one sounds like a one shot deal.

134
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,881
But you are not going to getting away with talking this time.

135
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:38,982
This one is got the itch.

136
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,759
The itch?

137
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:43,751
Go scratch it.

138
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,052
Yes.

139
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,961
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.

140
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:18,862
What?

141
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:22,198
The service I mean.

142
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,863
Oh, the service, right.

143
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:24,578
That was quick.

144
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,902
Ah, may I come in?

145
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:33,359
Yes, please. Would you come in?

146
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,416
''Happy Valentine's Day''

147
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:48,956
Help yourself.

148
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:50,603
I made coffee.

149
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,204
It's French roast.

150
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:56,501
How do you know what's inside of it?

151
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:57,592
Oh, you don't.

152
00:10:57,893 --> 00:10:59,093
That's the fun part.

153
00:10:59,194 --> 00:10:59,894
Oh.

154
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,074
Who is Valentine?

155
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,276
You don't...They didn't say you will be handsome and funny.

156
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,095
The truth is, I've never¡­

157
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:21,998
done anything like this.

158
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:29,780
Now, do I make the cheque out to you personally,

159
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,042
Oops, or do I make it out to the service?

160
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,558
We can figure that out later.

161
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,875
Or make it out to cash.

162
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,016
I couldn't help noticing the man living over the garage.

163
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:43,194
Oh, that was Howard, my husband.

164
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:46,539
Your husband?

165
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,801
Soon to be ex, I mean. He is living about the garage until we settle things.

166
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,898
Oh, I must have forgot.

167
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,459
I bought a box from a drug store.

168
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:58,631
It was on special, so...

169
00:11:58,823 --> 00:11:59,856
The twelve pack.

170
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,862
Safety first.

171
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:03,695
I saw that on TV.

172
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,302
You seemed a little nervous, Joyce.

173
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:13,194
Nervous, no, no, not me.

174
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,592
I love a house with pictures.

175
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,093
It makes you feel like a home.

176
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,159
My son, my last went off to college this year. Oh, I miss him.

177
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:26,974
Can't say the same for Howard.

178
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,819
Was it another woman?

179
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,037
Oh, hardly.

180
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,838
You know what Howard bought me for my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.

181
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:37,598
A toaster.

182
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,759
I saved up and bought us tickets to Paris, kind of like second honeymoon.

183
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:43,776
Howard couldn't take off time from work.

184
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,675
So we cashed in the tickets and bought a big screen TV.

185
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,032
Fifty inches.

186
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:52,096
French roasts are all if I'll get to Paris.

187
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:54,197
Now.

188
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,799
I here that I get what I pay for.

189
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,900
So.

190
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,342
You must miss your children.

191
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:19,643
What?

192
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:21,079
Do they know?

193
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,480
Know?

194
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,091
That you hired a lover.

195
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,461
The accidental death of Michael Edwards

196
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,878
let the city to condemn Jefferson Heights.

197
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,741
These residents are protesting their invasion.

198
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,361
In four days, their homes will be demolished.

199
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,538
For some of them it is ...

200
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,317
They tried the same thing after the fire of seventy-seven.

201
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,600
The tenants fought in, and they won.

202
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:49,079
Back then the residents won renovation and set off demolition.

203
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,594
But they never had the deal with real estate noble Cynthia Sloan.

204
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,662
Miss Sloan, can we get a statement from you today?

205
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:56,713
My heart goes out to Michael Edwards and his family.

206
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,712
But Jefferson Heights is dangerous. I am doing the city and all the residents a favor.

207
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:04,991
Some said that after Michael Edwards died, you strong arm the city ... contract.

208
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,672
Sloan development won this big bet on square.

209
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,840
I make no excuses for being competitive.

210
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,574
You do what it takes to close the deal,

211
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:12,875
whatever it takes.

212
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,176
Miss Sloan. Miss Sloan.

213
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,361
whatever it takes.

214
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:56,212
Sulphur chloride.

215
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,559
What's all the sulphur chloride for?

216
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,695
It has been used in demolition.

217
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,280
The sulphur chloride can start to weaken the brick.

218
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,416
The whole building will come down like a house of cards.

219
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,117
Excuse me.

220
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,961
- One more question.
- Show.

221
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,420
Valentine's day.

222
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:22,502
Specifically Cupid.

223
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,103
Yeah.

224
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,739
A corpulant infant who happens to be an archer

225
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:30,015
goes around shooting arrows into people and suddenly they are in love?

226
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:36,480
- It's about it.
- And to show that love, people buy each other chocolates and other sweets.

227
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,851
Do they want to be fat like the infant?

228
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:43,442
What was you said you take for Miss Sloan?

229
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:46,817
Special consultant.

230
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,693
Sounds dangerous.

231
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:50,473
You have no idea.

232
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:51,974
Bye.

233
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:03,472
The address Jarod left on the candy is to an adult bookstore?

234
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,774
You have got to be kidding me.

235
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,321
Let's just get this over with.

236
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:13,732
What's wrong, Broots?

237
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:18,300
Oh, it's kind of embarrassing. I've never been into this kind of place before.

238
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,481
Right, and I am the presidents of the PTA.

239
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,741
It's all starting to come back to you, isn't it, Broots?

240
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,413
Jarod must have brought us here for a reason.

241
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,553
It's called humiliation.

242
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,994
Is there anybody here?

243
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:47,562
I'll be right with you.

244
00:16:51,663 --> 00:16:53,974
We would like to speak to the owner about a friend.

245
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,891
Rex is the owner. He is dead.

246
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,392
I'm Bucky la Fountain. I run the place.

247
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,211
You mentioned something about a friend?

248
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,233
He left these.

249
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,256
Why didn't you just say you were looking for Jarod in the first place?

250
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:10,319
Come on.

251
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,032
Come on back.

252
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,076
Anybody hungry?

253
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:24,353
Yeah, Jarod was a real emotional guy.

254
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:25,819
Smart though.

255
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,755
Invented this portable smoke cleaner.

256
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,762
Are you sure you don't want me to ... you a wing?

257
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,539
Positive.

258
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,976
Do you know where Jarod went?

259
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,279
Not a clue.

260
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:40,762
He just stopped comming in.

261
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:43,998
What did you say that he was interesting in the material you sell?

262
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,058
No way.

263
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:49,458
He wasn't in the sexuality part. He just wanted to talk about people.

264
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,713
About what makes us want each other.

265
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:55,662
You know between you and me, I don't think that work out much love growing up.

266
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:59,054
I think that's why he must be so proud of the book.

267
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:00,680
The book?

268
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,078
I run a small publishing company on the side.

269
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:04,540
Romance novels and such.

270
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:07,801
Are you seeing Jarod actually wrote one of these novel?

271
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:08,638
Yeah.

272
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:11,214
There.

273
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,713
''The Saddest Little Valentine''

274
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,614
He did the cover art, too.

275
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,918
That boy's definitely one of a kind.

276
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,356
One is enough.

277
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:29,518
This looks stunning one.

278
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:30,962
Have this ready for the night.

279
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,494
You are not very big in pictures, are you?

280
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,913
That you got a lot of awards. But only one photograph.

281
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,757
Photographs, that make a house a home.

282
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:56,559
Don't you think?

283
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:06,432
Is this you?

284
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:11,881
My father bred racehorses as a hobby.

285
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,512
That was painful.

286
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,139
My pride ...

287
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:18,852
I still have the scar.

288
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:23,222
It used to be much worse but the plastic surgeons keep withering a way in it.

289
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,761
So, where is your family?

290
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,057
You asked your clients so many questions?

291
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,695
Only the special ones.

292
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:37,235
Don't you get lonely here?

293
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,116
The City turned down the demolition plan.

294
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,517
I've called a meeting.

295
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:49,460
I don't have time to get lonely.

296
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,497
Don't be late tonight.

297
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,523
- Hello?
- Yes, I spoke with Joyce.

298
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,997
She said she was vaguely unfulfilled.

299
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,639
What's wrong with you? She's a housewife. ... she melts.

300
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:10,582
I don't know exactly what she wants.

301
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:14,052
Jarod, if you call a plumber, you want your pipes fixed. She called a gigolo...

302
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,853
I, I understand. But...

303
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:20,195
Fix her pipes and Jarod, I don't want to have this conversation again, right?

304
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,412
I just get it washed.

305
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:38,813
What do you think?

306
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:44,396
It is the car drives her crazy.

307
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:53,897
Joyce.

308
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:08,798
Hi, there.

309
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,958
Rumor has your feeling vaguely unfulfilled.

310
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:13,775
I've been waiting for you.

311
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,897
You do realize that your husband is out in the garden.

312
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:34,898
I know.

313
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,696
You won't regret this later?

314
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,455
The hell with regrets.

315
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:00,473
I know you are up there, Howard. Coming, I am calling the police.

316
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,498
The number is 911.

317
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:06,198
Oh, I am so sorry.

318
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:08,858
It is okay.

319
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,073
It's strange though.

320
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:12,874
Strange? What?

321
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:15,102
Well, you say your husband doesn't care about you any more.

322
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:17,761
Sure it doesn't look that way to me.

323
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:43,762
Hey.

324
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,563
Jarod.

325
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:49,980
I didn't mean to buy your head off, but I thought you were another one of those inspectors.

326
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:51,191
Inspector?

327
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,433
I don't think you'll be seeing anymore of those.

328
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,497
Your home is already condemned.

329
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,418
Are you kidding? These bureaucratics are all over this place.

330
00:22:58,743 --> 00:22:59,942
Even before Michael fell.

331
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:03,236
Somebody inspected the fire escape before it collapsed?

332
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,415
Yeah, he was independently wealthy like you.

333
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:07,599
Like me?

334
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:11,496
He had one of those fancy handsome metal on his wrist too.

335
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:13,939
Like this?

336
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:15,497
...diamonds.

337
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:22,132
Excuse me. I would like to propose a toast.

338
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:25,234
First of all, to this work of art,

339
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:26,620
that some people call the building,

340
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:29,097
the sign may says ''Sloan Tower'',

341
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:32,023
but this entire project was the dream of my right hand man,

342
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,536
of my right arm,

343
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:34,711
Frank Linden.

344
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,593
This is been his baby from the beginning, and if I don't give him promotion for this,

345
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,060
then I should fire myself.

346
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:45,119
When everyone said it couldn't be done, including me.

347
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:46,611
Frank found a way.

348
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,637
To ''Sloan Towers''.

349
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:51,133
Whatever it takes.

350
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:57,498
Whatever it takes.

351
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,454
''5/29/77 Jefferson Heights Protest''

352
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:32,022
Hey, how are you feeling today?

353
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,222
Would you like one of these?

354
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:35,579
They are very good.

355
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,452
Have you ever tried one of these?

356
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:49,761
It says: be mine.

357
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:51,973
Got one that says: You are fired.

358
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:54,174
Fired?

359
00:24:54,363 --> 00:24:57,996
I am tired of calls from this household Column. You're through with her.

360
00:24:58,343 --> 00:24:59,561
And with Cynthia Sloan.

361
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:00,962
I must sign in a replacement.

362
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:02,341
Just before the ribbon cutting?

363
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,157
You think that's smart?

364
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:06,613
Cynthia Sloan is one of your prides clients.

365
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:08,479
Fine.

366
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,855
You want to keep Cynthia? Then scratch the housewife's itch.

367
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:26,556
This is Sydney.

368
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:28,553
Why do people fall in love?

369
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:34,257
You might as well ask why the stars come out at night.

370
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:38,337
Everyone spends their whole life searching for that special someone.

371
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,316
The person to love.

372
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,260
But when they finally find them,

373
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:44,736
it all falls apart.

374
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:46,618
Paradox of man.

375
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:51,179
Try to believe it is better to have love and lost than never to have love at all.

376
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,553
So you believe that the love is worth fighting for,

377
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:57,811
and that's worth the pain and effort?

378
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:02,382
It's that what you're trying to say in the romance novel you left for Miss Parker?

379
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:04,899
The book speaks for itself, Sydney.

380
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:11,932
She felt consumed by a great void,

381
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:14,498
an dark and silent abyss,

382
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:17,839
as terrifying as the grand palace around her.

383
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:22,451
But somewhere in the chilling blackness she caught a glims of light.

384
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,315
She remembered the time,

385
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:28,498
the precautious of a little girl with a heart full of fire,

386
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,817
a soul flamed by passion,

387
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,838
and the smile that could melt the winter into spring.

388
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:38,056
But the light was gone, the flame had died.

389
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:41,858
Her past was taken from her beloved soldiers of the great palace.

390
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,493
She would continue searching,

391
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:46,643
hoping to rekindle the fire.

392
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:48,456
And to then,

393
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,581
she will always be,

394
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,138
the saddest little Valentine.

395
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,939
Hello, Joyce.

396
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,512
This is Jarod.

397
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:19,938
Come on in.

398
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,202
This is quite what I imagined.

399
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,762
Nothing ever is.

400
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:39,016
Can I pour you a drink?

401
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:44,217
Yes, sure.

402
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,619
Oh, that vibrates! Oh, my gosh.

403
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:56,278
We will get to that later.

404
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:02,492
Now it's just you,

405
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:04,278
and me.

406
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,121
No one can disturb us.

407
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:11,422
Especially, that annoying husband of yours.

408
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:19,572
What's with you, Joyce? It's what you're here for.

409
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,780
Don't tell me you think about Howard.

410
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:23,674
That husband doesn't deserve you.

411
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:29,332
I know how much polyester can one man wear anyway.

412
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,333
Poly, uh, what?

413
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:33,962
And the physique¡­

414
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,341
What is it? A body about a chili dog?

415
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,416
Well, you know Howard is a little chunky, he is.

416
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:42,973
The Santa Claus is chunky.

417
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:45,174
Howard is only violation.

418
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:47,736
Well, you know, Howard has his faults, but¡­

419
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:52,136
He is a kind and gentle human being.

420
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,977
He bought you a toaster for your anniversary.

421
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,697
He cashed in your tickets to Paris for a television set.

422
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,578
Well, fifty inches actually.

423
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,938
You know, that's just Howard.

424
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:07,298
Forget about him, forget about that whole night.

425
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:11,015
Well, you know, Jarod, you just don't forget about twenty-five years of marriage.

426
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,416
We've been through a lot. I mean we is the family.

427
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:15,097
- We uh...
- Made a home?

428
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:17,942
You are right.

429
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,441
You don't forget about twenty-five years of your marriage.

430
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:28,140
And you don't forget your home.

431
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:29,534
Some people,

432
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,535
they can go through their whole lives without ever having one.

433
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:44,736
Come on.

434
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,657
I'll take you home.

435
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:49,158
Thank you.

436
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,175
What's wrong, Jarod?

437
00:30:05,863 --> 00:30:08,957
You seem upset. You've been sitting here staring for hours.

438
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,417
Tell me what's wrong?

439
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,518
No, no....

440
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:22,675
- Jarod, why are you doing that?
- I don't have a home, Sydney. I can't remember anything.

441
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:25,981
I don't have a home. I don't have a home. I don't have a home.

442
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:40,474
Save our home! Save our home!....

443
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:42,179
So much anger.

444
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:45,852
Don't they realize that it's not safe to live there any more.

445
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,517
It is much easier for you to say.

446
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:51,061
If this place strated falling down, you have six others to choose from.

447
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:52,916
They don't have what you have.

448
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:57,403
Great education, rich parents, your own horses.

449
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,732
People change.

450
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,256
Some more than others.

451
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:05,057
Cynthia.

452
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:07,859
Cynthia, are you watching this?

453
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:09,493
They don't leave.

454
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:11,099
They can't.

455
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,536
I want you permission to call the police.

456
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:14,542
- Oh, that will be great ..
- Please.

457
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:21,879
Look, Cynthia. These people are breaking city ordinance now.

458
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,055
I can have Alderman Nance called the chief settle all the motion.

459
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,262
Go talk to them.

460
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,999
Tell them that their building is unsafe, explain it to them face to face.

461
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:33,700
They won't listen.

462
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:35,801
Then call the police.

463
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:37,937
Start a riot.

464
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:39,538
Whatever it takes.

465
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:50,895
We won't go. We won't go...

466
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:57,232
I've been expecting you.

467
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,933
- Hello, Jarod.
- Alice.

468
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,352
What is going on here?

469
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:10,053
Hi, Jarod.

470
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,038
This is Cynthia.

471
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:16,391
You are the lady who's going to take down my house?

472
00:32:23,203 --> 00:32:24,755
Jarod said you like horses.

473
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,735
I found this when we moved in.

474
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:34,359
It was in a secret hiding-place. Want to see?

475
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:47,393
How did you know?

476
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:52,818
That's you.

477
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:54,519
You are Cindy.

478
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,158
How did you know?

479
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,656
You can find just about anything.

480
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:15,854
If you know the right place to look for it.

481
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:27,812
Who are you?

482
00:33:28,763 --> 00:33:31,414
Someone who believes that everyone deserves to have a home.

483
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:33,882
Even Cindy Morgan.

484
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:38,492
I changed my name, Jarod, but I didn't hurt that little boy.

485
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,978
No, but you're partly responsible.

486
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:45,692
Why are you so determining to destroy this places where you grew up?

487
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:47,675
That was my past.

488
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:52,818
So you thought you could just get rid of it like you get rid of your name or you get rid of that scar on your arm?

489
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,538
Trust me,

490
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,838
you can't cut a scar out of here.

491
00:33:58,023 --> 00:33:58,878
I've tried.

492
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,838
With all the houses that I owned,

493
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:08,435
that little room is the only place that I've called home.

494
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,316
But now you are rich and you have this image to maintain.

495
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,953
When I was a kid, I won scholarships in very expensive shools.

496
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,612
I was around a lot of very wealthy people.

497
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,336
So to fit in,

498
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:27,292
you felt like you had to make up your life.

499
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:32,142
Trust me, I know the feeling.

500
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:38,158
First, it was that my father bred racehorses instead of what he really did,

501
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,942
which was drive rich tourists around downtown in his horse and buggy.

502
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:44,822
Then that was my name.

503
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:46,856
The lies just snowballed.

504
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:50,856
Now it's too late for the truth.

505
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,953
Cindy, it's never too late for the truth.

506
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,334
Two tickets for the ... please.

507
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:29,980
Hi, I am your wife's gigolo.

508
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,561
Your wife had a deal for you.

509
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:08,539
''Let's celebrate your promotion, Jefferson Heights Roof
Cynthia''

510
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Cynthia?

511
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:20,741
Cynthia?

512
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,342
This is great.

513
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:27,243
Cynthia?

514
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,358
Bad year for sulphur chloride.

515
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,017
What are you doing here?

516
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,042
I am celebrating, Frank.

517
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:02,813
Because today, you are fired.

518
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,814
What the hell are you...ah...

519
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,936
Hope you've brought your golden parachute.

520
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:13,337
Hold on, Frank.

521
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:15,541
You don't want to go down with your career.

522
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,338
Sulphur chloride.

523
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,912
Ideal for the demolishing of the building,

524
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:23,837
for murdering children.

525
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,199
God! Help me.

526
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:29,219
That you..down the public housing said it was the weather.

527
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,420
Right, Frank?

528
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:32,260
You killed a child,

529
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:35,342
just you could force people out of their homes,

530
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:37,543
just you could make more money.

531
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,178
You are crazy.

532
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:40,272
No, Frank.

533
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:42,257
You are.

534
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:47,136
This is about Michael Edwards down through to his death.

535
00:38:47,563 --> 00:38:49,281
Just like you are about to do.

536
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:51,282
Help Me, Jarod.

537
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,698
I can't hold on much longer.

538
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,481
Like you helped Michael Edwards?

539
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:57,078
I have money!

540
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:00,377
Well, I didn't tell you, Frank. But I am not really a gigolo.

541
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,481
So I can't be bought.

542
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:05,501
But I am curious, how much?

543
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:09,637
How much to throw hundreds of people out of their homes?

544
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:13,554
How much to murder a innocent little boy?

545
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,252
Alright, Jarod. I did it.

546
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:21,841
Okay, I did it. Now, please, help me.

547
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:34,578
Nice watch.

548
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,899
Don't waste your time with those.

549
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:47,032
Trust me.

550
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,637
You really don't have to show a lady a good time, Jarod.

551
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:53,752
You haven't seen enough yet.

552
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:54,753
Hey, you!

553
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:10,551
You think he'll fly?

554
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:11,998
We'll see.

555
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:15,878
I am going to chase him.

556
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:27,412
Is that allowed?

557
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:31,513
I don't want to go back to that huge house by myself.

558
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:33,555
It gets really lonely.

559
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:38,937
Time is up.

560
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:43,818
Hey, what's happen to you? We are going over these renovation plans or what?

561
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:48,837
Whatever it takes.

562
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:02,096
Oh, I am coming...

563
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:21,778
What?

564
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:26,574
They say it is better to love and lost than never to love at all.

565
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,275
Do you believe that's true?

566
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:30,798
If you are lonely, call the nine hundred number.

567
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:32,391
Did you read my book?

568
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:35,039
I skimed through it.

569
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:37,602
You painted a pretty sad picture.

570
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:40,715
I just write the way I see it.

571
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:43,113
How do we be like this?

572
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:44,477
Like what?

573
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:46,678
Alone.

574
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:49,292
Searching.

575
00:41:50,323 --> 00:41:52,856
It is ironic because we both want the same things.

576
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,535
Someone to care about.

577
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,096
Someone to care about us.

578
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:05,503
Do you think we'll ever find that kind of love in our lives?

579
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:09,398
What the hell do you want from me, Jarod?

580
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:16,552
Open the box.

581
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:46,092
''Be my valentine.''

582
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:07,093
''Gigolo Jarod''
End
