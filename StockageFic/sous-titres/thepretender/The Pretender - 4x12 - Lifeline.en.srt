00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,323
- Keep an eye on the prize, will ya?
- Oh. Sure, no problem.

He followed me to your daughter's
first Communion rehearsal at St. Charles.

178
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,381
He seems to be strong-arming
your father. Why?

179
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:03,325
Is he trying to get you to testify
against your fiance or something?

180
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:06,056
Look, I can protect you.

181
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,724
And I can help you
get your family back.

182
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,701
But you're going to
have to trust me.

183
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,172
You're wrong, Mr. Gray.
I can't trust anyone.

He was my date for the spring formal.

225
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:17,748
This all started when we traced
some guns back to one of Roland's shops.

00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,814
They'd been used
in a school shooting.

to take three months, tops.

00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:49,615

- Where are you?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

This Veritas thing Raines and Willie
were talking about.

360
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:11,442
It's an experimental
airborne toxin...

361

developed by the Centre
and shelved in the '80s.

362

- Raines is resurrecting it.
- Some people can't resist temptation.

- You know the one about 
"thou shall not covet"?
- Of course.

That's one commandment
you don't want to break.

- Just doing my job.

Just don't forget that the man
you're engaged to is a killer.

but he's no killer.

in the Basilica de Roma and cop a feel.

rejection lives inside you.
- Not true.

It is true, Parker.
You've rewritten history.

Create an enemy in your mind because
that's what you needed to survive.

is behind bars.

Roll, baby.

Stop! I'll do what you ask.

Just don't hurt my daughter.

- Don't go with him.
- Shut up! You back off.

No matter what he says, 
you can't believe him!
He's still going to kill your daughter!

You know what.
It's funny.

But I actually did fall in love with you,
in a strange way.

496
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:54,684
Then you had to tear my heart out.

Oh, she did.

499
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,859
You missed me!

500
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:08,903
You know, I heard this song once
that happiness was a warm gun.

501
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:10,909
Yes, it is.

502
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:13,639
You needa cooling-down period.

503
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:17,707
[Grunting]

504
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:38,497
Shooting an ex-cop.
Not a very smart idea.

505
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:41,199
Especially when he's put
blanks in your clip.

506
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:44,437
You see, there's this open case
over at the A. T.F..

507
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:48,174
Something about a gun supplier
found shot to death in the woods.

508
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:50,944
They never could make
a ballistics match.

509
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:54,248
Or find the killer.
Now they will.

510
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:57,017
[Jenna]
Want to know something funny?

511
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,753
I had feelings for you.
But you had to go...

512
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:03,125
and threaten my little girl.

513
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:05,892
Bad decision.

514
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:09,765
Karma. Ain't it a bitch?

515
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:17,601
- This is Alonzo. Over.
- [Jarod Over Radio] Alonzo.

516
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:21,636
-Jarod, you bastard,
what have you done with Jenna?
- She's safe and sound.

517
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:24,479
- Now, did you ever get the fat cat?
- We got him.

518
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:28,783
- But no Pritchard.
- Check the third alley off of 18th Street.

519
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:32,814
Oh, and, uh, I left a little present
for you under your seat.

520
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:45,664
[Broots] We tracked down some of the properties
of the gas that Raines was developing.

521
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:50,836
Veritas relaxes the lungs to the point
where they can no longer take in oxygen.

522
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,969
In small doses, it's not even lethal.

523
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:54,980
I'm sure Raines skipped that part.

524
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:58,745
Weak lungs is one of the theories
behind sudden infant death syndrome.

525
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,651
Oh, my God. The baby.

526
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:09,725
[Speaking Gibberish]

527
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:12,492
Stop!
Get away from him!

528
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,031
I know what you're up to
with the Veritas.

529
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:22,564
I don't think you do. 
A diluted version of Veritas gas 
helped me loosen baby Parker's lungs.

530
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:25,873
[Fussing]

531
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:31,945
He's free of this ball and chain.

532
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:35,419
I wish I could say
the same for myself.

533
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
I saw the testing room.

534
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:40,354
There are many villains
in the Centre, Miss Parker.

535
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:42,793
Iknow you need them to survive.

536
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:45,695
But I can't be your enemy anymore.

537
00:42:06,753 --> 00:42:10,712
[Priest] This is the Lamb of God
who takes awaythe sins of the world.

538
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,021
Happy are we who are called
to the Lord's Supper.

539
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:33,345
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl] Amen.

540
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:37,144
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #2] Amen.

541
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:39,151
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #3] Amen.

542
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:43,485
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.

543
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,324
- The Body of Christ.
- [Girl #4] Amen.

544
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:54,433
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father...

545
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,197
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

546
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:02,298
The mass has ended. Let us go in peace
to always love and serve the Lord.

547
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:13,345
Look at your mother.

548
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:17,412
- You got the bad guy?
- We got him. Now let's go home.
