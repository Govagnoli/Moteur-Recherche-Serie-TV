3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,896

4

<i>I would prefer a quiet service.</i>

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:19,299
Of course, Miss Will.
The deceased was your father?

6
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:21,242
<i>Is</i> my father.

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,803
If your father
is still alive, then why...

8
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,317
Just have a casket ready
Saturday morning.

9
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,615

"Top Hat Café pay phone.
January, weekend of the 15th...

I don't have a brother,
do I, Sydney?

30
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:24,486
That I don't know.

31
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:27,292
What we do know is the 15th
is this coming weekend...

32
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:30,925
and that note is distinctly
written in Jarod's hand.

33
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,835
- Cleanup team find this?
- In Jarod's last lair...

Mr. Broots
will be joining us.

<i>Well, she thinks that some details</i>
<i>are getting overlooked...</i>

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,833
that you and Sydney are maybe a little
too emotionally involved with Jarod.

43
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:10,032

<i>[Man] Never forget,</i>
<i>Mr. Bradley, that in this place...</i>

50
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,218
<i>we are dealing strictly with</i>
<i>a mentality of desperation.</i>

51
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,857
A desperation born from being
locked down in a 10-by-10 cell...

52
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:39,232
for 20, 30 years,
sometimes longer.

53
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:42,329
I would say that desperation
was a good word for that, sir.

54
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:46,536
A man's fiber, if he had any
to begin with, quickly frays.

<i>It's yourjob to keep</i>
<i>those frayed ends knotted.</i>

You're here because
of your experience under duress.

57
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,354
With the Carl Will execution on Saturday,
there promises to be plenty of that.

58
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:01,823
Sounds like he's got all the classic
symptoms of a career criminal.

59
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:06,727
Carl Will has a criminal record
dating back 30 years.

60
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:10,358
Car theft, armed robbery...

61
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:15,497
a dozen other felony violations leading to
the brutal murder of a fellow inmate.

62

You worked Folsom
during the '91 inmate riot.

I'm proud to say that we squelched
that one with extreme prejudice.

64

We don't wipe noses.

65
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:28,083
We don't lend shoulders to cry on.

66
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:32,452
We manage, Mr. Bradley, with,
as you say, extreme prejudice.

67
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:36,516
I'm sure the execution will send
a message to the entire population.

68
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:39,084
That's the idea.

71
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,937
Maybe we should stake him out.

have a weapon, did they?

73
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,242
No.

74

<i>[Man] So, Jarod, how many men</i>
<i>did they run on a shift at Folsom?</i>

77
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,928
Oh, we had a crew of 35 during the week,
slightly less on the weekends.

78
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:21,937
I hear Warden Harper's
a tough man.

- Right, Hopkins.
- Morris.

- And all points west.
- Tommy can show you around.

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,414
Uh, keep both eyes open.
The animals are getting restless.

Different zoo, same routine.

00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:55,637
Gotta make sure they don't kill each other
and herd 'em in at the bell.

89

90
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,239
Yeah, well, it'll ease up
after the, uh, the event.

91
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:05,509
- The event?
- Execution.

92
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:07,641
You get it up close and personal.

93
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,152
New guy gets death watch.

94
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,949
- Why me?
- <i>I don't know how it was at Folsom...</i>

95
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:19,052
but around here, it's considered bad luck
to get too close to a condemned man.

96
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,063
They make the new guy do it.

Is that the man
they're going to kill?

102
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,530
Yeah, that's him.

<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>What do you mean you're booked up?</i>

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,904
Who the hell would purposely stay...

105

at the Park Place Motel?

106
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:12,777
Well, we got a convention. The electric
company booked the entire facility.

107
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,216
- Do you know this man?
- Jarod.

108
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,219
Yeah, he comes through here
every now and then.

109
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,585
Matter of fact, he said something
about passing through this weekend.

110
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,886
Got a meeting or something.
I'll tell you what.

Burl Ives stayed here once.
We even had Mama Cass.

<i>and a daughter whose life</i>
<i>has been a fight to free him.</i>

142
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:22,669
Ten years ago, Carl Will,
a career criminal...

143
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,839
<i>was sentenced to five years</i>
<i>for car theft.</i>

144
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,715
<i>Only weeks away from parole,</i>
<i>he was involved in a bloody altercation...</i>

145
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:32,653
inside Oakfield Penitentiary, in which inmate
Anthony Lewis was stabbed to death.

146
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:35,920
<i>After a speedy trial conducted</i>
<i>by then state attorney...</i>

147

<i>and present governor</i>
<i>Charles Edwards...</i>

148
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,528
<i>Will was convicted</i>
<i>of first-degree murder...</i>

<i>and sentenced to die</i>
<i>in the gas chamber...</i>

150
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,300
<i>which is where the story</i>
<i>takes a most unusual turn.</i>

151
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,670
<i>At the time of Will's initial arrest,</i>
<i>his daughterJessica was a senior in high school.</i>

152

<i>Jessica's belief in her father fueled her</i>

<i>in college and law school, and every day</i>
<i>since, fighting to free her father.</i>

<i>But with the governor's denying</i>
<i>final appeal...</i>

<i>and the execution scheduled</i>
<i>for midnight Friday...</i>

How do you respond toJessica Will's
call for clemency from the governor?

160
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,335
The governor's refusal
is the only answer I need.

161
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,402
Miss Will calls the quick processing
of her father...

162
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:33,245
a political act by Governor Edwards based on
his reelection law and order platform.

- How do you answer that?
- No one doubts Miss Will's love
or devotion to her father...

00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,257

pounding in my ears.

00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,326
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>It's time to tell the truth.</i>

336
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:18,390
- I did.
- This is your last chance.

337
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,561
I did tell the truth.

338
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:24,129
You're about to die.
Clear your conscience.

339
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:27,199
It is clear.
I'm at peace.

340
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:33,372
Rosenberg was telling the truth, Sydney.
He didn't give the secrets away.

341
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,282
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

342
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:40,584
Aren't you?

343
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,493
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

344
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,223
<i>[Young Jarod]</i>
<i>But if they knew he was innocent...</i>

345
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:49,231
why did they execute him?

346
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:51,631
<i>[Young Sydney]</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

347
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:57,564
Because someone
had to be guilty.

348
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,609
[Cell Door Clattering]

349
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,805
Tighten it.

350
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:36,243
I don't want the prisoner to go
into spasm and break those straps.

351
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,761

- Why the hesitation?
- Mistake in communications, sir.

356
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:57,692

<i>[Warden]</i>
<i>Yeah, well, see that it doesn't.</i>

'Cause we're gonna have a roomful
of press back there for the real execution...

359
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,295

have to kill Carl Will twice.

360
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,672
- Get him out of there.
- <i>[Larson] Yes, sir.</i>

361
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:19,548
Thanks, Bradley.

362

Do you know what's wrong
with me or not?

363
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:43,529
I think you have an ulcer.

364
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:48,441
And from the way you were folded up
when I got here, it's a doozy.

- <i>For now, I'm going to prescribe...</i>

If you don't keep those feelings
aboutJarod in check...

381

She died three years ago.
Cancer.

00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:39,522
- I'm sorry.
- Pretty pathetic, huh?

400
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:42,028
No.

401
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:45,623
You lock a man away
long enough...

402
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,668
it bends him...

403
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,637
sometimes till he breaks.

404
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:57,702
Rita and me
were married 43 years.

405
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,713
You didn't know that, did you?

406
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:01,840
No, I didn't.

407
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:06,944
I broke the law, and I've paid every day
for the last 27 years.

408
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:09,649
But there's certain things
that a man...

409
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:13,091
can't allow
to be taken from him.

410
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:18,622
His pride, his dignity.

411
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,227
I understand rules.

412
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:27,172
But what Warden Michaels
did to me was wrong.

413
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:31,007
All I wanted
was to be there when...

414
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,140
my Rita was laid down.

415
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:39,846
I put her through a lot of pain.

416
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:43,118
And I just wanted to be able
to put flowers on her grave...

417
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:48,322
and feel her in my heart...

418
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:50,330
one more time.

419
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,856
He wouldn't give me a furlough.

420
00:31:53,935 --> 00:31:55,994
Hell, they...

421
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,336
they let cons out
for that kind of thing every day.

422
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:04,310
All I wanted to do
was say good-bye.

423
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,947
Is that why you planted
your garden?

424
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:12,485
Crazy, huh?

425
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:16,816
I keep praying maybe...

426
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:22,329
one day I'll actually get the chance
to show how much I loved her.

427
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:25,833
But Michaels,
he's set on making...

428
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,165
a statement with this place.

429
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:34,299
<i>I guess maybe</i>
<i>they were my statement.</i>

430
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,238
I just didn't want them
to think they broke me.

Something on your mind?

439
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,390
Carl Will.

440
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:04,592
- What about him?
- Well, I'm a little bit embarrassed to admit this...

441
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:08,362
but I'm not sure
I can handle this execution.

442
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:12,805
I know it's what we do,
but I've never seen a man die before.

443
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:16,002
I was hoping you could help me.

444
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:19,672
- Well, you're talking to the wrong man.
- Yeah.

445
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:23,508
I saw your face as we were
doing the walk-through.

446
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:28,317
It's pretty difficult for you
to imagine Carl Will strapped to that chair...

447
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,689
gas rising up,
choking the life out of him.

448
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:36,628
Why is that?

449
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:39,359
It just is, okay?

450
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:42,326
Hmm.

451
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,806
Did you ever notice
that these things are just like guilt?

452
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:54,545
You can move it
from one place to another...

453
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:57,209
but it always comes back.

454
00:34:58,286 --> 00:35:00,186
Who are you?

455
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:03,451
Someone who doesn't want
to see an innocent man die.

456
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:06,823
<i>Someone who thinks thatJessica Will</i>
<i>deserves to have her father...</i>

457
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:09,727
just as much as those kids
deserve to have theirs.

458
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:19,706
I've been walking
the yard for 20 years.

459
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:22,368
It's all I know.

460
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:25,241
It's too late
to start over, and...

461
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:29,613
I can't afford to cross
a guy like Clancy.

462
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:32,346
- You're afraid for your life.
- Yeah, well, you should be too.

463
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,823
You know how it is on the inside.
Things happen.

464
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:41,521
And I'm damn sure not gonna end up
like Anthony Lewis and the others.

465
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:44,963
Lewis was transferred in
from Joliet.

466
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,398
Just like all the other men
who died here.

467
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:50,028
I pulled the inmates' files
and I tracked them.

468
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,038
It's really interesting.

469
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:55,940
Each one of them belonged to
the same Chicago crime family.

470
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,242
My guess would be that somebody
paid to have them silenced.

471
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:02,748
Is that the way
the operation worked?

472
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,751
Yeah. Clancy's
brother-in-law...

473
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:10,780
is a pencil pusher atJoliet.

474
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:12,792
He made a deal
with a rival family.

475
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,851
They transferred targets
into Oakfield.

476
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,898
Clancy does the job.
They split the money.

477
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:20,433
Are you a part of it?

478
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:22,492
No, I wasn't.

479
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,505
I didn't find out until
after Anthony Lewis was killed.

480
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:27,905
And by then,
I was in too deep to say anything.

481
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:30,102
What about Carl Will?

482
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,081
Clancy was finishing up
on Lewis, and Will walked in.

483
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,084
I was supposed to make sure
the area was clear.

484
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:42,646
Hell, I thought he was just hitting
the guy up for cash.

485
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:45,283
- Is that when you knocked him out?
- Yeah, well, I had to.

486
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,624
Clancy would have killed
the guy right there.

487
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:51,961
Clancy planted
the shiv on him.

488
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,834
By the time Will came to...

489
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:58,963
it was over.

490
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:04,876
And now he's going to die...

491
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:07,244
for something he didn't do.

492
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:17,019
<i>[Broots] There's definitely</i>
<i>something wrong with this game.</i>

493
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,423
Maybe not all the pieces are there.

494
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:22,121
They're not, they're not,
but it's more than that.
