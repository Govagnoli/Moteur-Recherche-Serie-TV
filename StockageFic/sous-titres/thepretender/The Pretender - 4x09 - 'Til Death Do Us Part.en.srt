[Man]
Previously on The Pretender.

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,868
- Have we met?
- Thomas Gates. Friends call me Tommy.

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:05,962
I don't have any friends.

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,802
Everything that
I've ever done or felt...

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,865
it was wasted because
you weren't part of it.

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,069
Thomas?

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,272
- I find it hard to believe...
- Thomas?

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,339
that somebody breaks into your house,
shoots your lover point blank in the head.

9
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,818
- Oh, my God.
- At least I know how to protect 
the ones I love.

10
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,755
The man the police think killed Thomas Gates
died of a drug overdose in his cell.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,089
Daddy, this man was the last link
in proving who killed Thomas.

12
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,061
I don't want any trace
of Centre involvement.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,155
They killed them all.
And for what?

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:36,566
- What will you do now?
- Find out who did this and make them pay.

15
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,876
[Miss Parker]
Tell me about yourself.

16
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,174
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,875
[Gates]
Bridget seems like a nice person.

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,380
If it's making you this miserable, maybe
you should stop spending time with them.

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,448
- They're my family.
- Maybe you should think about 
starting a new one.

20
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,825
[Miss Parker] There are places
in me, Tommy. Dark places.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,299
If something is not right,
we'll deal with it. Together.

22
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,835
I'm a fix-it man, remember?

23
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,105
[Gates]
I will make you a deal.

24
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,108
When I die, I'll leave you all my shirts.

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,803
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,038
I'm not goin' anywhere.

27
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,104
Hmm?

00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,094
Tommy.

31
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,656
I love you, Parker.

35
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,420
Must be the 10th time
I got her phone machine.

36
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,116
[Sydney]
You left the address, didn't you?

37
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,126
Maybe Miss Parker will meet us here.

38
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,130
Syd, she hates anyone to enter
one of Jarod's lairs before she does.

39
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,496
[Sighs]
It doesn't make sense.

40
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,035
- Something's up.
- Think back one year, Broots.

41
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,706
- Thomas?
- Thomas?

42
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:59,211
Today? It's a year to the day that
she found Thomas murdered at her house?

43
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,077
I'm such an idiot.

44
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,209
I left all those phone messages on her machine
like it was just any other day.

45
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,277
It is just any other day.

I'm sorry, Miss Parker.

49
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,324
Thank you.

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,499
So, what's up with Jarod the jester?

51
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,567
Well, Syd and I have barely scratched
the surface, if you want to start diggin' in.

Have Clean-up crate everything.

54
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,851
If we can't figure out
what Jarod's up to...

55
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,621
we can donate this stuff to
a two-ring circus looking to add a third.

56
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,357
We did find one thing.

57
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,525
The celebrity clown of a local kiddie show,
Marco the Magnificent...

58
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,535
was arrested yesterday
on molestation charges.

59
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,071
Police found him
locked in a lion cage...

[Chuckles]
with raw beef strapped to his-

61
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,504

Ringmaster Jarod.

64
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,228
What is it?

65
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,230
It's-

66
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,631
It's Jarod's twisted little model...

67
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,499
of my first meeting with Thomas.

68
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,871
- Bastard.
- I'm sure there's an innocent reason 
Jarod left it.

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,376
Right.

70
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,969
And O.J. was just chipping golfballs.

71
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,679
All I'm saying is-

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,685
It's bad enough he knows
how Thomas and I met, but...

73
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,245
the fact that he left it for me
on this day is no mistake.

74
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:55,351
For once, admit he's tormenting me
just to torment me.

75
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,420
And wherever he is,
I just know he's laughing.

[Nose Squeaks]

77
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,148

[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

80
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,067
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

81
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,544
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

82
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,049
Since I broke out, I've spent 
every moment searching for my past.

83
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,312
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

84
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,150
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

85
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,213
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

86
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,192

He defends the weak and abused.

87
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,023
[Jarod]
Life's a gift.

88
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,573

- I am today.

- None of this is a laughing matter.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,857
No, you really caught me
in a mood today.

97
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,638
I'm real tempted to put a cap in you...

98
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:25,143
wipe the slate clean on my life
and take off without ever looking back.

99
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,807
Your gun won't work.
I took the firing pin out last night.

100
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,578
I sleep with this under my pillow.

101
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,644
And you drool out of
the left corner of your mouth.

102
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,095
What the hell are you
doing here, Jarod?

103
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,163
It's time to take care of
some unfinished business...

104
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,210
to find out who killed
the man you loved and why...

105
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,404
and to pay respects
to a man like Thomas Gates...

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,380
because he deserves it.

107
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:09,713
Just because you're a genius
doesn't mean you know what he deserves.

108
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,590
Why are you tormenting me, Jarod?

109
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,292
Why do you even c-care?

110
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,614
[Sydney]
Rumor5-8-2-5-9?

111
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,048
[Broots]
Yeah. Standard Centre coding logistics.

112
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,985
In this case, "rumor" would be
the code name of the operative in charge.

113
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,989
As far as the numbers,
I'll have to talk to Manny.

114
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,458
- You know the mute guy
down in Communications?
- He, the one without a tongue?

115
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,395
Yeah. I guess it'd be pretty pointless 
to play spin the bottle with a guy like that.

116
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,455
I mean, if I was a woman.

117
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,198
Anyhow, off hand I'd say
these numbers might be a code...

118
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,741
for a Centre audio phone tap file.

119
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,299
Find out from Manny
the marble mouth which one.

120
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,815
Well, given the climate around here, Miss Parker,
I don't think that's gonna be too easy.

121
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,749
- Why?
- Oh, you haven't heard?

122
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,946
Mutumbo's dead,
as in "Ding-dong, the wicked witch is."

123
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,991
Dead.

124
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,516
Triumvirate's crazy Zulu
appears to have been murdered.

125
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,587
- [Mr. Lyle] Two shots through the heart.
- Small target.

126
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,499
And whoever put the bullets in Mutumbo
also gouged out his eyes.

127
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,163
Like he saw something
he wasn't supposed to.

128
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,265
Speaking of which, when was the last time
you laid eyes on your father?

129
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,800
When is the last time
somebody checked for your pulse?

130
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,813
- [Giggling]
- [Clears Throat] Um-

131
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,815
Now, now.

132
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:49,287
I merely ask because family
is the most important thing in the world.

133
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,755
My family.
Your family.

134
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,815
The Centre family.

135
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,020
Care to translate
for Barney the dinosaur?

136
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,532
The gun that was used
to kill Mutumbo...

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,535
was traced to the highest level
of the Centre.

138
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,733
A level that includes you,
Mr. Lyle, and dear old dad...

139
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,608
who just happens to gain
the most from Mutumbo's sudden... erasure.

140
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,669
You think my father killed him?

141
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,049
Anyone could have.

142
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,076
After all, when we miss the ones we love
and survival's at stake...

143
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,145
we're capable of anything.

144
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,859
Tommy.

145
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,828
Talk to me, Parker.
There's something on your mind. I can tell.

146
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,592
Yes. I-

147
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,929
I-

148
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,028
It's okay.

149
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,068
In your own time.

150
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,236
Miss Parker.

151
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,247
The search for your father
has and will continue to intensify...

152
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,010
on my authority.

153
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,017
He will be found.

154
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,577
And when he is,
those allied with him...

155
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,456
could find themselves
endangered species.

156
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,426
He was as much as accusing you of-

157
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,474
hell, accusing me
of participating in a coup.

158
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,704
The least you could do
is pretend to listen. Parker?

159
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,013
Call me...

160
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,016
when you're back with the living.

161
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,412
[Miss Parker]
Do you believe in ghosts, Syd?

162
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,253
[Sydney]
I believe in an afterlife. Second chances.

163
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,658
I'm talking about Thomas.
His... presence is all around me.

164
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:41,496
Sometimes I hear
my mother's whisper of consolation...

165
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,501
my father's laughter.

166
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,970
Those we love...

167
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,473
are with us always...

168
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,476
in life and death.

169
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,842
It's more than that.

170
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,279
I see him.

Maybe he is.

to complete something...

- Better than anybody,
now that Mutumbo's, you know-
- You?

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,526

he'd be missin' more than his eyes.

doesn't mean his order to kill us is.

have been playing by-

00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:39,245
my indentured servitude to this house 
of horrors, you shaking your family tree-

274
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:42,251
you just throw those the hell out

Putting us together?

You're a liar.

00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:11,437
We had a chance meeting
in Blue Cove at a gas stat-

284
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,221
You didn't meet him after I did.

285
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,223
You knew him before?

286
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,226

had nothing to do with me.

Tell me about the Tommy you knew.

291

We met about a month before you did.

292
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:48,879
I was working construction
for one of his competitors-

293
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:52,581

cost a young man both his legs.

294
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:54,817

00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:58,088
- Thomas was big on doing the right thing.
- Yeah.

296
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:04,957
I... have to know who killed him, Jarod.

297
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:08,198
As soon as I find out anything,
you'll be my first stop.

298
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:12,401

says Rumor murdered Thomas.

00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:13,320
Oh! [Groaning]
Oh, my God!

339
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,187
[Screaming]

340
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,994
[Sighs]

341
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,996
Oh, that feels good.

342
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,999
So, Broots, what did you tell Cox?

343
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:27,434
I screamed and told him
that my hand was frying.

344
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,029
About Rumor!

345
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,006
Well, as it turns out...

346
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:35,010
Mr. Cox wasn't interested
in the Rumor file at all.

347
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:38,013
He just kept coming back
to your father.

348
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:41,482
His persistent interest in your father
points to one thing.

349
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:45,647
Yes. That Cox is the hitter
hired by Mutumbo to kill Daddy.

350
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:48,520
And Brigitte, maybe,
as well as the baby.

351
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,688
I'm running out of time.
So is Daddy.

352
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,731
Anything further on Rumor, Broots?

353
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,199
Well, I was able to reach
the end of the phone tap archive.

354
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,498
And?

355
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,301
Nothing but a text message telling me
the identity of Rumor is in a hard copy file.

356
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,774
- Let's find it.
- No, no. I-I'm working on it.

357
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:09,812
It's, uh-
The file's called a Z3 File.

358
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:12,040
- Z3?
- Yeah.

359
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:15,141
Designates contract killings for hire.

360
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:19,655
Makes it a lock. Thomas was murdered
by someone inside the Centre.

361
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:27,930
- [Miss Parker] Thanks for
lending me your car, Broots.
- No problem.

362
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,933
Do you want me to stick around and keep
you company for a while, Miss Parker?

363
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,935
Mmm, thanks...

364
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:35,563
but I don't feel alone.

365
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:39,097
It must be pretty
hard still, though, huh?

366
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:44,670
Why does somebody have to die for us to
realize all the things we never said to them?

367
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:47,906
Well...

368
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:56,184
I guess it's 'cause we kinda treat life
like a bug on the sidewalk.

369
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:59,695
All we see is a bug,
not a miracle.

370
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:02,630
And no matter how hard we try...

371
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:04,929
we usually end up steppin' on it...

372
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,204
instead of takin' it into our hand.

373
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,002
And the living are...

374
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:15,135
left with all the unfinished business.

375
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,940
Until we finish it, yeah.

376
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,641
You know, between Thomas...

377
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:22,810
and everything that's
happening with your father...

378
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,649
I just want you to know that...

379
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:27,720
I'm here for you, Miss Parker.

380
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,725
I-I mean, if you need someone.

381
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,556
I-I mean, a friend.

382
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:41,896
Miss Parker?

383
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:48,610
The Z3 Rumor file?
How did it get in here?

384
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:53,138
It's not how it got here that matters.
It's who it says is Thomas's killer.

385
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:55,275
Who?

386
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,914
Revenge? You should think
about this, Miss Parker.

387
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,014
Think about what?
Tommy was murdered.

388
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:04,959
And his killer's gonna pay.
Thinking completed.

389
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,922
Miss Parker.

390
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:39,120
God help us all.

391
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:41,989
Be careful, Parker.

392
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:44,363
Tommy.

393
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:16,857
Open up, Bridget!

394
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:19,868
[Groans]
Angel.

395
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,530
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- Where's Bridget?

396
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:26,405
- Oh, God, now where did she go?
- Don't try to cover for her! 
Where the hell is she?

397
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:29,411
She was here when I fell asleep.

398
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:33,210
We had to leave our last hiding place.
Decided to sleep in the car.

399
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:37,049
- How did you find us?
- The car has a tracking system. Damn it.

400
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,113
She's been actin' nuts the last couple of weeks,
disappearing for hours at a time.

401
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:43,955
Oh, my God, angel.
She could be havin' the baby.

402
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:47,656
- Angel, what's happened? Why are you here?
- Thomas.

403
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,062
Rumor 5-8-2-5-9.

404
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:54,128
Oh, God.
Brigitte's Rumor.

405
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:56,798
- You knew nothing about this?
- Of course not!

406
00:27:56,873 --> 00:27:59,774
She must have been
followin' Mutumbo's orders.

407
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,902
She killed Thomas.
I'm so sorry.

408
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,412
[Groans]
She's carrying my baby.

409
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,745
Daddy, think.
Where would she go?

410
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:09,250
Now that Mutumbo's dead,
she's not safe anywhere.

411
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,753
- No, everybody has a safe place. Think.
- What?

412
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:15,723
Well, there was a place.
Let's see, it was in the country, I think.

413
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:20,923
I never knew where. But she kept
a spare keyin her desk at the Centre.

414
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:23,431
I'll find it, and I'll find her.

415
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,991
Then what are you gonna do?

416
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,609
Think about my baby!

419
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:47,422
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Searching. Why?

420
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,616
Because you're not the only one.

421
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,932
With Triumvirate pressure,
Cox has cranked up his search for Dad.

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,935
And if they find
any link to Mutumbo's death...

423
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:02,870
Parker will not be the safest surname
to have around here.

424
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:05,874
So, when did your boy Cox turn on you?

425
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:08,604
Like I tried to tell you before...

426
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:11,044
any link between Cox and me is a lie.

427
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:14,106
I intend to stay out of his crosshairs.

428
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:17,175
And I suggest you do the same.

- Mr. Cox and a team of Sweepers are-
- I heard.

432
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:31,300
- I need you to find something for me. A key.
- A key?

433
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,892
Yeah. A piece of metal with teeth on it.

434
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,905
You know, those of us that have evolved
beyond fire and wheels use it to unlock doors.

435
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:38,702
- Where is it?
- Bridget's office.

- It was your eyes.

00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,589
What was?

440
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:56,591
Where Thomas felt at home.

441
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,992
- Did he tell you that?
- Yes, he did.

442
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,590
Do you think he ever knew
what I really did?

443
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:07,025
I don't know.

444
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:11,060
But he knew who you were.

445
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:13,072
And to him, that was love.

446
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,906
He said the first time he ever experienced
that feeling was when he looked into your eyes.

00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:25,549
There were so many times
I wanted to tell him, to say it to him.

450
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,553
But I-

451
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:29,213
Tell him what?

452
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:31,951
It's too late now anyway, Jarod.

453
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:36,052
Never underestimate the importance
of completing unfinished business.

454
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:40,998
Oh, don't you worry. Bridget will
know the importance of that real soon.

455

So, Brigitte is the one
that pulled the trigger.

456
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,198
Like you didn't read the Rumor file
you left in my home.

457
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:50,038
Miss Parker,
I didn't leave you any file.

458
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,477

- You found it!
- Yes. And what it opens, I think.

463
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:17,235
You see, I realized that if Brigitte
was intercepting Thomas's calls...

464
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:19,238
she had to have
them forwarded somewhere.

465
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,570
So I went to see Manny
to see if he could backtrack the calls.

466
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:23,666
He owes me a favor
'cause I loaned him my karaoke machine.

Follow the bouncing ball, Broots.

468
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:30,081
Well, all the calls were transferred
to a cabin less than 20 miles from here.

Here's the address.

Now, you have an opportunity

Now, if you choose not to
accept that opportunity...

For all the pain I caused you.

You never answered my question.

I don't know who.

But it wasn't the Triumvirate.

535
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:12,127
It came from inside the Centre.

you were losing your focus.

while I planned my return.

There's only one reason
for you being here, angel.

576
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:22,479
Did she admit to everything
in the Rumor file?

577
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:25,649
Damn lucky thing,
that file showin' up.

578
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:29,058
- She's gone.
- Mmm.

- Kill her? No.

What-

She was nothing more than a vessel
for the baby, for your legacy.

585
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:58,649
Did you leave the Rumor file
in my house?

586
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:01,660
Now, why would I
do a thing like that?

587
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:06,424
Let me guess.
The gun that killed Mutumbo.

588
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:10,060
Found on her body.
Just clears everyone of everything.

589
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:12,570
She planted it in my stuff!.

590
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:15,630
It was a setup.
Rumor was tryin' to ruin both of us.

they can't whip a Parker, huh?

- What?

Don't you even want to know?

Know what?

00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:36,762
If it's a boy or a girl.

597
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,993
I thought that getting revenge for Tommy's
death would somehow bring me peace.

598
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:20,301
But even if I had been able to,
I know now it wouldn't have.

[Jarod] That isn't the unfinished business
that needs finishing.

that you wish you had told him.

- Told him what?
- I never-

602
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,112
I never told Tommy that I loved him.

603
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:37,486
And now your heart and your mind
are raging a war against each other.

604
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:41,084
I would trade everything
for one minute with him.

605
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,764
Just to say those words
and have him hear them.

606
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:47,561
Tell him.

607
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,624
