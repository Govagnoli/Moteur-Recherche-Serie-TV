- Ah.

What if Lyle finds Jarod

173

- To her?

No. To us.

<i>You know, the state may say you've got</i>
<i>jurisdiction, but this is my neighborhood...</i>

177
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,735

178
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,500

183
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,613
Mike didn't want 'em
near his property.

184
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:56,088
His house is not
on the reservation.

185
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,652
<i>Just outside. His land was parceled</i>
<i>to his ancestors a hundred years ago.</i>

186
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:04,426
I have a picture of Mike
as a little boy.

Mm-mmm. Sorry.

192
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:24,085
Thank you.

193
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,289
You're not a bounty hunter.

194
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,524
Mike's dream catcher-You would've
had to kill him to take it off his neck.

195
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,465
So he must have
given it to you.

196

You know Mike?

197
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:44,005
He's part of my thesis
on indigenous rights.

198
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,131
Are you a descendant?

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,506
Not unless Tonto had a rabbi

<i>Here.</i>

201
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,379
Some of my research
on Mike and <i>A.C.M.</i>

202
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,382
- Might help you track him down.
- You think the company would try to kill him?

203
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,044
Well, it would shut up
their loudest protestor.

204
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:00,353
Thank you very much.

00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,321
Jarod, that picture-

- Who is the older guy?
- Pretty sure he's my father.

207
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:08,891
- Pretty sure?
- When I was a boy, l-

208
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,796
I was told that my parents
were killed in a plane crash.

209
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,326
It was a lie.

210
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,701
Man. Who'd make up
a lie like that?

211
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,368
The Centre has another project
for you, Jarod.

212
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,912
This technique hasn't
been used for decades.

213
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:27,881
How can you improve it?

214
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,184
By factoring in tissue depth
from living people...

215
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,381
I can re-create a face
more accurately.

216
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,687
By size and weight, l-
I would say he is a man.

00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,818
[Young Sydney]
Very good.

218
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,365
- Was he someone's father?
- Jarod.

219
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,730
Yesterday was a year, Sydney.

00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:50,066
- Since the crash.
- Focus... on the work.

221
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,231
This technique is promising.

222
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,276
I wish I could invent
a way to bring him back.

- He must have been waiting for me.

As soon as he started
shooting, I ran.
