1
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,773
''Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience during the delay...''

2
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:23,057
- ''We'll now begin boarding our airflight 105 San Diego.''
- Oh, man!

3
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,540
Is there a problem?

4
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,051
I got bumped.

5
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:28,331
I'm sure it was an accident.

6
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:31,332
With this many people it's bound to be on attendant physical contact.

7
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,415
No. I got bumped from the flight. They are overbooked.

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,116
Oh.

9
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,257
I may miss registration.

10
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:43,258
You know I became a freshman of Art in San Diego.

11
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:45,321
Next flight is in five hours.

12
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,714
By then, all the class I need will be closed.

13
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,553
Here, take my seat.

14
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:53,554
No, no.

15
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:54,812
Look, I am not in a hurry.

16
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,757
It's not like anybody's chasing me, today.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,758
Take it.

18
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:01,900
- Oh, man. Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

19
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,701
Thanks.

20
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:09,276
That's been real pleasure talking to you these last few hours.

21
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:11,816
You have a bright future ahead of you, Daniel.

22
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,017
Good luck.

23
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:15,453
Thanks Jarod. I hope you'll find your family.

24
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:17,354
Thank you.

25
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:22,132
Thanks, Jarod.

26
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,733
You really saved my life.

27
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,500
What happened to your finger?

28
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,194
Broke in my wrestling.

29
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,395
What did you do last night?

30
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,743
- Sorry to ask.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:45,944
Everything alright?

32
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:52,199
- Mr. Lyle's personal file?
- My father wants a list of anyone who might be Lyle's ally.

33
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:56,859
Ever since Lyle's death, my father has been lobbying the Triumvirate to take off his position.

34
00:01:57,823 --> 00:01:59,196
But he is running into blue blocks.

35
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:03,997
The allies of Mr' Lyle know that your father opposed him.

36
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:08,273
The fact that you killed him only increases their resistance to his promotion.

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,434
Even dead, Lyle is pinning the ass.

38
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,822
Something was, excuse me, something was just delivered.

39
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,223
I think you want to see.

40
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,018
This one.

41
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,758
- Lockers?
- Where the hell did these come from?

42
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:25,937
Jaord sent them.

43
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:35,175
Class of 1983, Douglas High School.

44
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:38,140
Townsend, Nebraska.

45
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,215
Why did Jarod send this yearbooks?

46
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,079
Page two.

47
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,216
There is a name tag in my book.

48
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,098
Who is Ricky Sanders?

49
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,121
Professor Tom Greer.

50
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:50,852
- Oh, god.
- Who did you get?

51
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:53,677
Mrs. Ricky Sanders.

52
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:59,096
- I always thought you'd make a nice couple.
- Yeah, when monkeys fly.

53
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:03,159
Jarod is expecting us to attend this reunion, Mrs. Sanders.

54
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:04,733
Brilliant inside, Syd.

55
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,678
But then it did make you the professor.

56
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:08,818
Look at this.

57
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:14,339
''Always stay the way you are, unless you want to survive.''

58
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,261
That's Jarod telling us for a danger.

59
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,293
Broots, I want to check all the ... in this book.

60
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,814
Until I have more information, I'm not ... in the Armpit Oklahoma.

61
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,033
It's Nebraska.

62
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,041
Hell is hell, Broots.

63
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,158
What's going on?

64
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,396
Flight 105 has crashed near San Diego.

65
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:03,223
What?

66
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,075
There were fatalities.

67
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,357
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.

68
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,334
There was a young man on board.

69
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:20,262
I gave him my seat. His name is Daniel Falk.

70
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,840
- I am sorry, sir. I can't just give out...
- please!

71
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:31,359
Daniel Falk's body was positively identified at the scene. I'm sorry.

72
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,972
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.

73
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,273
There are pretenders among us.

74
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:45,577
I was taken from my family.

75
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:49,472
Thitry-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

76
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:52,661
How many people died because of what I thought up?

77
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,696
Since I broke up, I spent very moment searching for my past.

78
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,262
He is a pretender.

79
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,742
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

80
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:03,500
- the Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

81
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:05,663
He defends the weak and abused.

82
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,557
Life is a gift.

83
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,558
THE PRETENDER

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

86
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,022
You are a doctor?

87
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,258
I am today.

88
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:36,562
Thanks for Lady, fuselage stayed intact.

89
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,342
Kept the body count down.

90
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:39,472
Clark Thomas.

91
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,433
Jarod Lindsay, NTSB Washington.

92
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,558
I am here to help with the investigation.

93
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,434
I can't get paper close up our request,

94
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,435
but an investigator I don't need that they send to me.

95
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:51,997
Well, if you like you could get Washington on the phone.

96
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,482
You could tell them yourself what incompetent managers they are.

97
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:58,362
Diane Post. I prefer able buddies to paper clips, welcome.

98
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,460
We just got these surveillance photos from the crash scene.

99
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:04,674
Any signs of mechanical problems?

100
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:07,133
No. The plane passed FA inspection last week.

101
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,434
We are focusing on pilot error.

102
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:09,872
Both pilots survived?

103
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,960
They've been ... to Centennial Memorial.

104
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,234
- Flight recorder?
- It'll come in a while.

105
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,439
I want to be there when it's opened.

106
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,699
Do I look anything like this Ricky Sanders guy?

107
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,116
If you swallow the blimp.

108
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:32,297
How did Jarod expect me to fool anyone to believe that I am him?

109
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,593
Just tell them you shut up with Jenny Craig before you married me.

110
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,933
That don't explain the hair.

111
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:39,834
It's a high school reunion, Broots.

112
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:42,921
The only thing more pervasive than love handles with smaller ...

113
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,416
What about Mrs. .., pig?

114
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:47,398
Oh, no photo.

115
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,299
You are not alumni.

116
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:52,662
Apparently Ricky met his wife overseas.

117
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:55,637
They both work as missionaries at a catholic charity in Africa.

118
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,132
This amuses you.

119
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:05,316
That Jarod wants people to believe that you are a missionary.

120
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:11,916
Broots, did you find anything about Professor Tom Greer?

121
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:14,438
He was only at the school for one semester in 83.

122
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,596
Taught obscure languages.

123
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,513
He died in Hawaii two years ago.

124
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,521
Rest of class's business is usual.

125
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:23,897
Oh, last page here there is a list of people under the words ''camera shy''.

126
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,855
Oh, yeah. They didn't have their photo taken.

127
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,598
I tracked them down. There is nothing special.

128
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,635
Except, well, two were dead.

129
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,522
A deader than Townsend, Nebraska.

130
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:37,978
Call the hotel and book some rooms for the shindig.

131
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,835
Oh, Jarod already did.

132
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,118
There are non-smoking rooms.

133
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,418
Perfect.

134
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,656
Mr. Larson, some questions!

135
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:51,543
Do you have anything to say to the families of the victims?

136
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,261
My heart goes out to everyone involved.

137
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:56,882
As a father who almost lost his son, I certainly share their pains.

138
00:07:58,183 --> 00:07:59,652
Can you tell us what happened?

139
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,961
He is not allowed to issue a statement until he talks to the NTSB.

140
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:06,383
But I would like to offer my prayers to those who lost loved ones.

141
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:09,655
Excuse us, please. I just want make sure my son gets little rest, okay?

142
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,756
Thank you, thank you very much.

143
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,172
First thing first.

144
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:15,419
Let us see what the pilot has to say.

145
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,078
She suffered blunt trauma to the temple lobe which affects memory acquisition.

146
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:22,653
The chances of recording details of the crash are extremely slim.

147
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,577
So there is really nothing you can tell us?

148
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,259
Like I said,

149
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,361
I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.

150
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,273
And I can remember the screams.

151
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:48,937
But besides that,

152
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:51,738
I am sorry.

153
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:55,937
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Wylie. We'll be in touch.

154
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,579
I'll be outside in a second.

155
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,615
You are going to be alright.

156
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:12,321
It's like somebody painted my mind black.

157
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:18,817
When I think about my passengers,

158
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,677
maybe it's better that I can't remember.

159
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,301
I want to make a difference of my life.

160
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,053
I read this quote once.

161
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,237
''We have but a rich moment in time.''

162
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:33,061
It made me realise we aren't here for so long.

163
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,421
Eleven people died.

164
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,202
But I lived.

165
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:42,174
What makes me so special?

166
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:08,322
I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.

167
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,498
And I can remember the screams.

168
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:24,281
Eleven people died.

169
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,356
But I lived.

170
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,252
What makes me so special?

171
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:47,615
Can you believe how friendly the Nebraskans are?

172
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:51,621
This isn't Nebraska, Broots. It's a halfway house for ...

173
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:54,361
Ricky, Ricky, is that you?

174
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,879
You have changed.

175
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,380
You lost a ton, son.

176
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,898
And this must be...

177
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,258
Nobody you want to know.

178
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:07,859
Well.

179
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:13,361
Maybe we'll see you and the Mrs later at the hill ride.

180
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,196
Yeah, the hill ride, okay.

181
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,236
A way to blend in.

182
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:21,978
All set.

183
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,141
Now this is mine. And 305 is for you two.

184
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:29,002
- You two?
- Small town, Mrs. Sanders.

185
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:33,461
The last thing we want is for people to wonder why you're not staying with your husband.

186
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,256
There'll better be booze in the courtesy bar, or someone is going to pay.

187
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:44,557
Hey.

188
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:48,177
I thought we've agreed that I would be here when we open these boxes.

189
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:52,112
We couldn't locate you and time isn't some we have a lot over around here.

190
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:56,614
Evidence from the flight data recorder indicates the elevators were set at a wrong angle for landing.

191
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,652
Giving the flight we do speed on descent,

192
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,316
fail of the elevators to provide proper lift led directly to the crash.

193
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,497
- Who set the elevators?
- We don't know.

194
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:15,335
- The cockpit voice recorder is still in lock.
- Malfunction. Never started recording on take off.

195
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,042
I've never heard of this happening before.

196
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:19,261
It is rare, but not without presence.

197
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,096
Hell that happened on the flight I piloted once.

198
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,696
At least now, with no mechanical malfunction,

199
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,416
we can focus on pilot error.

200
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,699
Which leaves the question.

201
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,751
Which pilot?

202
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,172
My dad tells me how to play.

203
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,022
You never play basketball with your dad?

204
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,256
I just want my parents proud.

205
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:33,841
You did, Daniel.

206
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,442
You did.

207
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,578
''Airista Crash Claims Eleven Lives''

208
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,414
''Pilot Error Questioned''

209
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:57,614
''Families Grieve''

210
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:11,119
I don't know if I'll ever be able to climb to the cockpit again.

211
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:14,519
You get no argument from me. You're gonna be far too busy in Airista.

212
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,378
Brandon is one day going to take over the organisation.

213
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,560
Sooner I get him behind the desk, the better.

214
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,982
Mr. Larson, we need to question Brandon alone.

215
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,902
Well, I am not here as the head of the airline, and here as Brandon's father.

216
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:27,916
We will appreciate that, sir, but this is standard procedure.

217
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:31,798
Fine, if you need me, I'll be in the waiting room.

218
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,299
Brandon.

219
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:41,098
The voice recorder on your flight aren't function.

220
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,296
We have no record of what happened in the cockpit.

221
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,522
Mrs. wylie suffered a head trauma. Therefore your memory of the event is critical.

222
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:51,153
We'd like you to carefully take ... of last few minutes before the crash.

223
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,594
We just received final approach instructions.

224
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:57,254
I was focused on my checklist.

225
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:58,533
Everything seemd calm.

226
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,234
And all the sudden, we stalled.

227
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,915
Angela was yelling about the mountain.

228
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,300
I looked down my window, just to see the wings slash into trees.

229
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,016
You seem to be very warm.

230
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,393
Would you like some water?

231
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,494
No, no.

232
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,520
No, it's this pain killers.

233
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:15,936
Made me a little fevers.

234
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:21,780
Anyway, I can only guess some of our gauges are malfunctional.

235
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,941
According to the flight data recorder, all systems were working fine.

236
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:29,036
It indicated the elevators were set at 0 instead of 20 degrees.

237
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,375
That's why the plane stalled on its descend.

238
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:35,576
Oh, god.

239
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:37,512
What is it?

240
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,497
- Is there something on your mind?
- This is really hard.

241
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,073
Angela is a good friend. We've logged over half million miles together.

242
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,013
But?

243
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:50,438
When I called out ''elevators 20 degrees'' on the checklist,

244
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:53,021
Angela gave me a positive.

245
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:56,340
I guess she just wasn't paying attention.

246
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:06,178
Look, Jarod, it was pilot error.

247
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,479
- And the pilot seems to be Angela Wylie.
- Maybe.

248
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,936
The guy tells exactly what happened and what do you need.

249
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:12,515
He said he was on pain killers.

250
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:16,195
Principal actions of those compounds are analgesics and sedation.

251
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,516
Wouldn't cause a fever.

252
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:19,702
Isn't that possible that guy's just nervous rack?

253
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:20,841
Pilots are human.

254
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:23,993
If I've just been in the plane crash, and I detained my friend,

255
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,294
I'll be sweating too.

256
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,138
Is that what you really belive, Diane?

257
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:37,099
You know, Miss Parker, if you look at this like a mini vacation from the Center,

258
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,292
you may actually enjoy yourself.

259
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:43,016
These people are dead from neck up and don't even know it.

260
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:43,981
Why?

261
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:49,082
Because the couple in the lobby were married for 14 years and they go to church on sunday,

262
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,037
and they coach little league?

263
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,934
I wish my exwife and I had been that lucky.

264
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:58,357
Just how hard did you fall on your head when you fall from the turnip truck?

265
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,238
Okay. What's so great about your life?

266
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,639
You're forced to stay at the Center until you catch a guy they stole from his parents.

267
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,537
You drown by the murder of your mother.

268
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:13,660
Competing for your father's attention with a ball headed lunatic dragging with oxygen tank then you...

269
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:14,398
Careful!

270
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:18,638
I am just saying,

271
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:23,523
I'd take a sunday sermon and a little league game any day with all that.

272
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:36,024
Hey.

273
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:38,114
Jarod sent us another yearbook,

274
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:40,715
marking down the page that list the students

275
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,016
who are absent for the graduation picture.

276
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,617
''Not every picture tells a story'', what does that mean?

277
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:50,478
He wants us to focus on the ''camera shy''.

278
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:53,938
Coming?

279
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:55,298
Dear?

280
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:02,957
The blood test on you and Brandon were negative.

281
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:05,658
So there will be felony charges but...

282
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,612
You will be charged with negligence.

283
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:11,291
I suggest you contact the pilot's union and arrange for legal council.

284
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:12,992
Oh, my god.

285
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:17,593
Angela.

286
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:19,979
The voice recorder malfunctioned.

287
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:23,436
The only thing we have to go on is Brandon's testimony.

288
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:26,358
If there is anything at all that you can remember.

289
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,422
I can't remember anything.

290
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,414
The voice recorder did not function?

291
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,358
The imprints are already demagnetized.

292
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:05,354
Hi. How are you doing? Hey.

293
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,895
Any look with the ''camera shy''?

294
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:15,294
I found two. Both are for village idiot of that year.

295
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,235
- You?
- I met one.

296
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,780
Farmer's wife, seven kids, wallet full of pictures.

297
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,797
And guess whom he's married to?

298
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,952
Zena. What's your secret?

299
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,855
You gonna ask her.

300
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,638
I've never met a missionary before.

301
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:42,678
There is a shocker.

302
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:46,856
And Ricky! Who ever thought he became a man of God.

303
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,601
You know, he and I dated a few times.

304
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,234
Has he ever mentioned me?

305
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,154
He often remind this about,

306
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:02,222
playing tongues on hockey with you in the barn after the saturday night hoot nannie.

307
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:09,723
Ladies and gentlemen,

308
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:14,221
Before we come to the end of this wonderful evening,

309
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,222
I'd like to take a moment to remember a couple of students who no longer with us

310
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,223
because the Lord ... to call them on home.

311
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:22,579
The first is,

312
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,621
- Diana Hydra.
- Oh, god. It's almost over.

313
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:29,339
And we're not close to knowing why Jarod sent us here.

314
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:30,778
And when we start.

315
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,023
If you may remember he died ... in the senior year.

316
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,658
So we don't have a graduation photo of Bobby Bowman.

317
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:41,237
But we were able to enlarge a picture from a group shot of the Farmers of Tomorrow club.

318
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:44,499
- I'm out of here.
- Miss Parker!

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,100
Oh, my god.

320
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:51,175
This resemblance is unmistakable.

321
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,915
Bobby Bowman is Mr. Lyle?

322
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,653
Are you sure this is Brandon Larson's file?

323
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,562
This lab has zero tolerance for error. The stakes were too high.

324
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,815
Something doesn't make sense.

325
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:10,161
Brandon Larson's last FAA physical macrostatic blood count was ten.

326
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:14,677
But in this test you took after the crash, the count is fifteen.

327
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,719
I thought macrostatic blood counts never vary.

328
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,753
They don't.

329
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:21,922
Who brought in these blood samples?

330
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,463
Your chief investigator, Clark Thomas.

331
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:34,213
Don't let Jarod's wild speculations confuse you.

332
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:35,493
And what about Brandon's sweating?

333
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,094
He said pain killers wouldn't do that.

334
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,182
Diane, listen that the evidence is very clear.

335
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:41,583
Just have that report ready to go in the morning.

336
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:02,833
One ... tried to give me illegal payoff.

337
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,796
But my dad was telling me you can never go wrong doing the right thing.

338
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,557
I turned him down.

339
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:14,077
What did your dad teach you, Clark?

340
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:25,371
You saved my life...

341
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:27,572
Thanks, Jarod, you really saved my life.

342
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:36,572
Sydney.

343
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:38,496
A young man died because of me.

344
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,497
I gave my seat on airplane.

345
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,678
The plane crashed.

346
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:47,221
I am sorry.

347
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:53,222
Jarod, we all want to believe that we can control the events in life.

348
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,994
But it's only an illusion.

349
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,493
He had everything to live for.

350
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:02,618
Family.

351
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,252
Future.

352
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,155
Now he is gone.

353
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,642
I am still here.

354
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:16,738
I am afraid you and I could spend the rest of this lifetime debating fate, Jarod.

355
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:18,358
Lifetime?

356
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:21,919
Is that how long this will hurt?

357
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:31,592
Anything?

358
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:38,501
- I found a police file on Bobby Bowman according to the Omaha's coroner's records ...
- Up here, Broots.

359
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:45,282
Omaha's coroner reported Bobby Bowman was murdered sixteen years ago.

360
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:46,800
By his father.

361
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:52,579
Mr. Lyle, Bobby Bowman it is, faked his own murder,

362
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:55,202
and framed his father?

363
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,016
And I thought my family was screwed up.

364
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:01,182
Bowman's body was found headless and in the bed of his father's pick-up truck.

365
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,332
But the body was so decomposed that they couldn't get the proper ID.

366
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,956
Have lost sound trace of dental records and of course,

367
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:11,077
decomposition would make fingerprint identification impossible.

368
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,777
So, if the body was not Mr. Lyle's, then,

369
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:16,977
whose body was it?

370
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:22,171
Broots, go back to the Blue Cove, see if you can find out Lyle's early years in the Center.

371
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:26,271
- And us?
- You and I are gonna pay a visit to Mamie Elkem.

372
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,473
Bobby was adopted, you know.

373
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:37,231
Bobby was a good little boy for the most part.

374
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:41,096
And then when he was around fifteen years old,

375
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:43,860
something just seemed to snap.

376
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:46,979
Okay, boys, come and get it.

377
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:51,997
One day, he was sweet sugar.

378
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:56,014
The next, mean as a snake, violent too.

379
00:24:56,783 --> 00:25:00,537
After a while, my husband just couldn't deal with him.

380
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:02,453
He felt Bobby need a discipline.

381
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:06,216
So he started to lock him in the shed out in the back.

382
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:09,138
I felt that was a little harsh.

383
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,021
But as my husband said,

384
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,381
the roof didn't leek and there was no vermin in it.

385
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:24,899
You two dogs stop that barking and get in here.

386
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,201
This's a friend of Bobby's?

387
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:37,694
Oh, Jimmy Radloff. But he died.

388
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,497
That was a sad day for Bobby.

389
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,518
How did Jimmy die?

390
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,778
Bobby and Jimmy went hiking one day.

391
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:53,121
They got separated.

392
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,303
Only Bobby came home.

393
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,022
Jimmy just disappeared without a trace.

394
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,358
Well, they looked all over for him but they never found his body.

395
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:05,779
I've heard enough!

396
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,371
Hey! You don't stop your howling...

397
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:13,536
Now we know whose body Lyle used to frame his dad.

398
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:19,982
Personally, I felt that Jimmy ran off and away.

399
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:22,375
He came from a terrible family.

400
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:25,455
His father was a drunkard and his mother, well,

401
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:29,177
Lyle and I always thought she was deaf ...

402
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,238
Lyle?

403
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,479
That's my husband's name.

404
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,161
Although he insisted Bobby called him mister.

405
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,921
Angela? They told me the hospital you've been released that...

406
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,677
May I come in?

407
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,382
It's kind of dark in here, don't you think?

408
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:08,256
That's not the answer.

409
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:14,376
All that I've ever wanted to do is be a pilot.

410
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:18,838
They were preliminaries findings.

411
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:20,617
Nothing has been decided.

412
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:22,634
No. They already told me to get an attorney.

413
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:24,641
That's standard procedure.

414
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,162
That will be civil sues.

415
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,838
I can't face those families.

416
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:40,893
Listen to me.

417
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:44,754
I don't believe that the crash was your fault.

418
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:47,271
Based on what?

419
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:52,532
Those people who had their lives taken from them, they had no choice.

420
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,661
Don't dishonour their memory by taking your own.

421
00:27:58,823 --> 00:28:00,759
Give me the chance to prove you are innocent.

422
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:22,802
Once Jimmy Radloff disappeared,

423
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:25,153
Bobby really got bad.

424
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:29,674
Though there was no control of him except lock him in the shed.

425
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:33,462
He hit his father with a shovel once.

426
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:40,913
I'm pretty sure that that was this ... push Lyle to kill Bobby.

427
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,455
And cut off his head?

428
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,341
Well, I did think that was a bit extreme.

429
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:50,276
Where is your husband now?

430
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:54,561
Solitary confinement, Topeka Penitentiary.

431
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,341
Lyle rubs people the wrong way.

432
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:01,683
I best get supper on...

433
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:06,557
The shed measures eight by ten.

434
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:08,919
Same as a prison cell.

435
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,572
If my father had locked me at a hole like this,

436
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:13,458
I wouldn't have framed him, I would've killed him.

437
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:18,412
Clearly Mr. Lyle was driven to influence slower functioned.

438
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:25,332
Unfortunately he didn't confine his need to just his father.

439
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,061
I am sorry to bother you, sir.

440
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,098
But I've received the rather disturbing tip.

441
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:44,776
That your son was using prescription drugs, not on the FAA authorize list.

442
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,619
- It is ridiculous.
- Maybe so.

443
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:50,254
But accusation is so serious that going to require an investigation.

444
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:53,652
I assure you if my son've done anything that foolish, I would know about it.

445
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:58,958
You have any idea how many flight truckies are barking for a seat in the cockpit for their major career?

446
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,859
I know some who had no trouble lieing to get pilot grounded, open up a slot...

447
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:03,912
I am sure that's true.

448
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:08,020
Why would he jeopardise his future by taking unauthorized drugs?

449
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:09,919
Besides, I wouldn't allow him to.

450
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:12,082
I have no choice on this matter.

451
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:13,877
You always have the choice.

452
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:17,043
Tell it to the victims of flight 105.

453
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:37,096
- Clark Thomas.
- Jarod Lindsay was just here.

454
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:43,199
He said he is going forward with an investigation to rumours that my son is using unauthorized prescription drugs.

455
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,797
- Where did he hear that?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter. What does matter,

456
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:48,813
is the fact that you promised to have this thing off, agree?

457
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:49,714
Yes, sir.

458
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:51,392
Then get on it.

459
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,976
''Reconstructing Data, Demagnetizing Cylinder''

460
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:20,052
My gilr-friend gave me this.

461
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,062
She is afraid I'm gonna forget her.

462
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:25,114
It is nice known to have somebody care so much about you.

463
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,721
Besides folks, you know I mean.

464
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:29,822
Yep.

465
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:35,492
''Data Reconstruction Complete''

466
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:53,101
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.

467
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:54,611
- We're not gonna clear that way...
- I'm sorry, Angela...

468
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:57,733
- Pull up, pull up.
- I am sorry, Angela! Oh, My God!

469
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,381
I told you to put two notches. We're not gonna clear that way.

470
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,099
Pull up, pull up.

471
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:15,301
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.

472
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,902
We're not gonna clear that way.

473
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:20,095
- Pull up, pull up.
- I am sorry, Angela! I forgot. I'm sorry, Oh, My God!

474
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:24,096
Our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches. We're not...

475
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,982
This's your idea of sick joke?

476
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,119
No.

477
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:35,479
My idea of a sick joke is lying to protect your career while destroying Angela Wylie's.

478
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,513
You are crazy.

479
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:37,718
Am I?

480
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:41,833
She didn't cause the crash.

481
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:43,634
You did.

482
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:46,212
It wasn't your blood that Clark Thomas took to the lab.

483
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:47,741
You were flying alright.

484
00:32:48,423 --> 00:32:50,275
And what? Speed?

485
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:53,519
Methamphetamines to sharpen your senses?

486
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:55,597
So why you're sweating so badly.

487
00:32:56,263 --> 00:32:57,119
That's not true.

488
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:59,476
Did you know that Angela was thinking of taking her own life,

489
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,477
because she couldn't deal with the guilt of killing eleven people?

490
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:03,878
Shall we let her?

491
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,058
Rounded up to a nice even dozen?

492
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:07,392
All because of you.

493
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:11,173
I'll see you can take a position at Airista and make your father happy.

494
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,002
There is no room for error with my father.

495
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,691
You have to be perfect.

496
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:20,520
And if you're not, he just bribe Clark's tongue to fix it, right?

497
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:25,214
He found about my drug intake after the crash.

498
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,534
And it's routine he's been control like he controls everything else.

499
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:32,752
He picked my schools, my girlfriends, my career.

500
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,803
So how much works does he have to get before you say no?

501
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:37,216
You don't understand.

502
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,120
Nobody says no to my father.

503
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:42,821
Not me, not Clark Thomas, no one.

504
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:46,617
Don't you think it's time that someone did?

505
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:00,996
So Mr. Bowman, tell us about your son, Bobby.

506
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:02,997
Bobby.

507
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,935
I hated that little bastard.

508
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,136
But I didn't kill him.

509
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:09,532
Who did?

510
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:12,375
If I knew that, I wouldn't be in here, would I?

511
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:18,815
If I'd bet I'd say it was probably that counselor that started coming around when Bobby was fifteen years old.

512
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:20,378
From the adoption agency.

513
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:24,052
Said he was checking up to see how Bobby was getting along.

514
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:26,911
But Bobby was getting along fine till he showed up.

515
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:28,894
They started spending time together.

516
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,222
Too much time.

517
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,942
Do you remember anything about this counselor?

518
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:38,214
Oh, my lawyer tried to find him ever after I was arrested.

519
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:40,153
But he never worked for the adoption agency.

520
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:42,054
Oh, I think no.

521
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,853
These padlock cutouts on the wall,

522
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,438
what do they signify, Mr. Bowman?

523
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:49,838
Somebody's idea of sick joke.

524
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:53,492
They've been showing up once a month ever since I got here.

525
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:56,682
I use them to keep track of time.

526
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,821
Except for the last month when they stopped coming.

527
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:04,133
That's because Mr. Lyle is dead.

528
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:25,434
Diane.

529
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,580
I want you to hear something.

530
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,232
Clark? It's Jarod.

531
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:47,679
There is something I want to see you about.

532
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,979
A jump plane? At least you can take me up a plane with a door.

533
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:03,191
What are you doing here?

534
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:09,372
Lindsay called, said he found something at the crash site you wanted me to see.

535
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:10,452
Oh, good.

536
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,696
Everyone is here.

537
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:13,597
Shall we?

538
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:16,862
I am sorry, Mr. Larson. There must be a misunderstanding.

539
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:18,501
Oh, there has been no misunderstanding.

540
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,932
I've uncovered some new evidence about what caused the crash.

541
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:23,717
What kind of new evidence?

542
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,539
The kind you have to see to believe.

543
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,840
Gentlemen.

544
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:35,902
- Why are we so low?
- Better to simulate the descent of flight 105.

545
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:43,881
Hey, will you take over for a minute?

546
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:45,182
I have to go in the back.

547
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:49,843
Why don't you take my seat? It'll get a better view.

548
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:04,093
What new evidence could he have found?

549
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:08,980
There was nothing left on that mountain. The head has already been examined.

550
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:13,099
Alright, what the hell is this all about?

551
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,900
Jarod?

552
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,601
Jarod.

553
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:21,013
He jumped!

554
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:22,153
What the hell is going on here?

555
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,256
Pull up, get out of the tour.

556
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,153
I can't. It's jammed.

557
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:31,376
The hydraulic is ...

558
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,418
Problem, boys?

559
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:37,539
Well, now you know how Angela Wylie felt when she realised she was going to crash.

560
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,217
Now there is a way for you to survive.

561
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,197
But it comes at a price.

562
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:44,712
What do you want?

563
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:45,936
Truth.

564
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:50,337
About how you bribed Clark Thomas to cover for the fact that was really your son,

565
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:52,596
that caused the crash of flight 105.

566
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,757
Speechless, ah?

567
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:57,382
Careful. The voice recorder is taking down everything you say.

568
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,631
Only Clark won't be able to demagnetize the voice cylinder.

569
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:01,733
70 seconds to impact.

570
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,715
If they find what's left in the plane,

571
00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:06,371
they will do toxicology test on your bodies.

572
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,158
Anything you got to hide, Mr. Larson?

573
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:09,612
Oh, it's too bad.

574
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:12,459
Because Clark won't be around to temper with the blood tests.

575
00:38:12,743 --> 00:38:13,400
50 seconds.

576
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:15,876
Damn it, Jarod!

577
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:19,277
Okay, I did it, I took the bribe.

578
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,919
Now unlock the slabs.

579
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,280
What about you, Mr. Larson?

580
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,759
Larson, tell him, damn it.

581
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:26,240
Is your reputation more important to you than your life?

582
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:27,441
Larson.

583
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:29,098
We are going to crash, tell him.

584
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:31,911
Alright, it's solved.

585
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:34,821
I bribed Clark Thomas to protect my son.

586
00:38:35,823 --> 00:38:38,573
Clark, there is a toggle switch underneath your seat.

587
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:39,657
Push it backward.

588
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:54,214
I was close. Just let you know,

589
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:57,094
there is only enough gas in your tank to get you back San Diego.

590
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,433
Oh, by the way, there is a police car waiting for you when you get there.

591
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:08,040
I am not buying your theory about Mr. Lyle's, Syd.

592
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:10,236
Please, Miss Parker, listen.

593
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:15,976
All I am saying is as if Lyle was able to fake his death as a teenager,

594
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:17,633
well, perhaps he has done it again.

595
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,254
And that's what Jarod has been trying to tell us all this time,

596
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:22,771
that Lyle is alive.

597
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,040
I shot the son of bitch myself, Sydney.

598
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:29,898
I saw him fall into the river, you and I were there together when they dragged his body from the water.

599
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:30,898
A headless body.

600
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:31,457
So?

601
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:36,182
- Exactly the way he faked his death the last time.
- There is no last time, the man is dead.

602
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:42,258
There is nothing on Lyle.

603
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:44,895
Except for date of employment and date of termination.

604
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:49,035
But I did find this under the name of Bobby Bowman.

605
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:53,957
It's a copy of adoption paper giving custody of Bobby, Mr. Lyle, to the Bowman's.

606
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:57,012
It's only one reason the Center would have records of Lyle's adoption.

607
00:39:57,203 --> 00:39:58,158
They arranged it.

608
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:05,376
- I'll get Lyle's body exhumed...
- Oh, no, no, you can't.

609
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,677
The Center had Lyle's body cremated.

610
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:42,018
''Plane Crashed Cover-up Revealed''

611
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,116
Thank you, Jarod.

612
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:49,341
You saved my life.

613
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,176
Can I help you?

614
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,081
Oh, Daniel.

615
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:33,657
My name is Jarod.

616
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:36,738
I met Daniel while we were waiting for the plane.

617
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:42,478
It was overbooked and he was going to get bumped.

618
00:41:43,563 --> 00:41:45,972
He was worried about missing his registration.

619
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,116
I don't understand.

620
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,457
I gave your son my seat on the flight.

621
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:02,976
I am so sorry.

622
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,821
I just thought you¡­

623
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:10,076
I should probably go.

624
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:12,193
Wait.

625
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:14,194
Jarod.

626
00:42:18,383 --> 00:42:21,475
Please, would you, would you come inside?

627
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:26,016
Tell us about your time with our son.

628
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:28,219
Thanks, Jarod.

629
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:29,702
You really saved my life.

630
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:06,103
