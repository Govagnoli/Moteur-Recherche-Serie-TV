to bring together...

people from the community
from all walks oflife.

131
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,512
Well, after support grew, that's
when we started receivin' threats.

132
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,451
- What kind of threats?
- Warnings.

133
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,353
- Tellin' us to call off the rally.
- And when you didn't?

134
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,881

of vandalism began...

aren't going away. Maybe-

138
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,268
Maybe what, Sheriff? Huh?

139
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,602
Maybe we should just give in, huh?
Give in and just call the whole thing off.

140
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,074
No, Sheriff.
That's exactly what they want.

141
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,873
Postpone it.
Think about your girls.

142
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,317
You know, Sheriff, when I was 13...

143
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,843
I saw a man beaten
and dragged behind a truck...

144
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,119
and nobody did nothin' to stop it.

145
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,628
Not even me.

146
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,761
That man lived for three days...

147
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,234
the whole time prayin' to die.

148
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,302
That man, Sheriff, was my big brother.

149
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,103
See, if you don't fix
this kind of hate...

150
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,910
it will destroy
everyone that it touches.

151
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,386
It's because of my daughters
I gotta do this.

152
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,820
So yes, sir.

153
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,256
Yes, I will be at that rally
tomorrow with my church...

154
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,260
and my family.

155
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,076
Any progress?

156
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,351
Angelo senses that someone
Jarod brought to justice...

157
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,619
is going to try to kill him.

158
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,560
We're trying to find out who
by letting him empath...

159
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,962
various items the Centre
recovered from past Pretends.

160
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm certainly not surprised someone
from Jarod's past wants to kill him.

161
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,334
In fact, that's a hell of a long line,
and it starts behind me.

162
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,343
Hey, look. That's the dress
the Black Widow was wearing.

163
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,542
The one that Jarod took down
for murdering her husband.

164
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,146
She certainly has enough reason.

165
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,620
And she did try to kill him once.

166
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,861
[Whispering]
Does he think it's her?

167
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,528
I want this to be over.

168
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,865
I know you do.

169
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,536

Jarod's in danger!
But not her. Not a woman.

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,973
Syd, does he even know
what he's doing?

173
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,979
Jarod doesn't know.

174
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,643
Angelo is systematically evaluating and
eliminating individuals in Jarod's past...

175
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,084
with the most intense
feelings of hatred for him.

176
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,782
Then we need to keep this
from Lyle and Raines.

177
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,984
They'll only interfere
with Angelo's progress.

178
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,291
Then we'd better move fast, because,
uh, secrets aren't kept long around here.

179
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,459
If Angelo can successfully isolate
the potential killer, he can take us to him.

180
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,594
- And to Jarod?
- Hopefully in time to save him.

181
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,400

Why do people hate other people
because of the color of their skin?

201
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,735
I don't know, Jarod.
It's called racism.

202
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,744
It's important that you learn
what's wrong in the world...

203
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,973
as well as what's right.

In some ways, yes.

207
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,689
Jarod, there is no simple
solution to racism.

208
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,058
But there is. Stop hating.

209
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,859

As well as a convicted

He certainly fits the profile.

And he's on record as having
sworn to get back at Jarod.

334

Jarod sure knows how to pick
his enemies, doesn't he?

Saunders!

338
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:13,611
Hates Jarod!

339
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,241
Wants to hurt Jarod!

340
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:19,650
Wants to hurt Jarod!

341
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,211
[Jarod] What's the matter, Saunders?
You look scared.

342
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,123
- Who's in here?
- Just demons in your mind.

343
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:27,957
Stevens, is that you?
Hey, this is crazy!

344
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:33,558
Well, gotta go now. Have fun
in your own private little... hell.

345
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:37,627
Don't leave! Come on!
Let me out! [Echoing]

[Screaming]

347
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:46,776
[Grunts] Saunders hates Jarod,
but... not him.

348
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,214
Someone else hates Jarod more.

349
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,150
It's hard to imagine
it could get much worse.

350

[Panting]
Broots! Hurry!

351
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:59,359
There's no time left for Jarod!

352
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,657
Angelo, calm down!
I've never seen him like this.

353
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:05,927
Can't calm down!
[Screaming]

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,299
Hates Jarod! Hates Jarod!

355

All right. He's here.

359
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:02,218
Jarod, get them damn

361

General, we're glad you're here.

362
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,012
General.

363
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,680
Sir.

364
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,020
Everything's ready for tomorrow, sir.
We're just waitin' on your word.

365
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:40,754
Just like you ordered,
none of us have left.

366
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:43,797
We're all here to help you
figure out who the traitor is, sir.

367
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:50,461
Well, that won't be necessary...

368
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,472
will it, Jarod?

369
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:57,073
[Screams]

370
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,011
What the hell is this? You gonna
stand there or cut me out of this?

371
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,606
I spent a long time making that thing.

372
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:06,050
- You cut me outta this now, 
or I'll blow you away.
- [Gun Clicking]

373
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,580
Guess your clip's empty. Gotta go.
Hurricane's comin'right through here.

374
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:13,092
You're dead! You're dead,
you son of a-

375
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,890
Matter of fact, we go back
a long way, don't we?

376
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:21,230
Last time we were together,
there was a hurricane blowin'.

377
00:27:21,302 --> 00:27:23,236
Let me tell you somethin'.

378
00:27:23,304 --> 00:27:27,240
That storm ain't got half the fury
that I got left in me right now.

- [Men Cheering]

- Traitor!

381

- Yeah, get him! Get him!
- [Men Cheering]

382
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,093
Gentlemen, we're back on schedule.

383
00:27:49,163 --> 00:27:53,031
Bartlett's the guy that
tried to kill Jarod... and you.

384
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,034
And almost succeeded.

385
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:57,468
I had tracked Jarod to
the middle of the Everglades...

386
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:00,234
where we were trapped
together in a hurricane.

387
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:03,037
So that's the net
Jarod used to capture him.

388
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,977
Took more than a net to hold
an animal like Bartlett.

389

Honey, I'm home.

392
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:24,188
Bartlett, Angelo. Is he the one
who's going to kill Jarod?

393
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,790
Bartlett. Must stop Bartlett.

394
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:29,529
Bartlett hates Jarod.
Hates everyone.

395
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:32,572
Bartlett wants to kill.
Wants to kill Jarod.

396
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,736
- Sydney, help Jarod now.
- Parker, we have to do something.

397
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,870
Broots, call the Florida Bureau of Prisons.

398
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,744
- Find out if Bartlett is still in custody.
- Okay.

399
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:46,185
Bartlett is a racist sleazebag...

400
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:49,552
who would kill his own mother.

401
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:51,557
Syd, we have to find him.

402
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,924
If Bartlett finds Jarod first,
he will kill him.

403
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,900
And ruin my chance.

404
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,898
[Gasps, Sighs]

405
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:08,237
Let's just pray we're not too late.

406
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:15,544
Jarod, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

407
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:17,709
See, you were his instrument
to have me thrown into jail...

408
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:20,583
where I could come to see
his purpose in my life.

409
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:23,885
And then through his divine
providence, I was set free...

410
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:27,018
so that I could unite my people
and cleanse this country.

411
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:29,619
And now here you are,
dropped right in my lap.

412
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:33,030
- Manna from heaven.
- You're sick, Bartlett.

413
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,867
You're so consumed with hate, you'll
destroy yourself and everyone around you.

414
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:42,073
- No, Jarod. I'm not sick.
- [Jarod Groans]

415
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:46,603
Misunderstood, yes. Persecuted like
the prophets of old, yes. But not sick.

416
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,616
- [Grunts, Groans]
- What do we do with him?

417
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:53,152
I'll take him out in the woods
and send him to his judgment.

418

[Whimpers]

419

[Grunting] You don't need
to dirty your hands with this.

420
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:03,827
Let me do it. It'd be my honor
to take this Judas to his justice.

A true apostle.

423
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:18,939
Do it down by the creek
and just leave his body there.

424
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:21,203
Dust to dust.

425
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,007
We have things to do for the
unity rally tomorrow, don't we?

426
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,447
There are gonna be a lot of people
singing the blues tomorrow.

427
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:31,817
- Get him outta here.
- Come on. Come on.

428
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,413

Well, I gotta check my pants.
But I'm still alive.

440
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,268
I'm undercover too.
Georgia State Police.

A.T.F., federal task force.

442
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,946
We've been after Bartlett
ever since his conviction for murder...

443
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:07,414
and civil rights violations
were overturned.

444
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:10,281
Some Fed popped him for those.
My guess is that was you.

445
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:12,287
Guilty.

446
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:15,586
I had no idea he'd been released.
Do you have a plan?

447
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:19,025
No, Bartlett's changing everything.
I'm completely cut off from the outside.

448
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:22,690
Look, we go back in there right now,
we can pop him for conspiracy.

449
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:26,223
No. We catch him in the act of setting those
explosives, we can put him away for life.

450
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:30,398
If we don't stop him, he's gonna kill
Pastor Jones's little girls.

451
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:50,053
Here. Here.
[Panting]

452
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:53,527
You go back in there.
You keep him company.

453
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:57,999
I'll think of something.
And, uh, good luck.

454
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,467
Good luck.

455
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:06,330

Takes some ofthe fun out ofit.

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,723
I should've known. Jarod
crossed the detonator wires.

This thing would've never gone off.

460

Well, look at that.
Ain't that pretty?

462

quite a little statement.

463
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,981
Yes, sir, it will.
I'll just run that into town.

464

You tell me where you
want me to place it.

465

No. This is my vision.
My calling.

466
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:56,287
- Then we'll do it together.
- I said it was my calling.

467

00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,885
You're a girl.

473
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,398
- Why did you save my life?
- Because...

474
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:41,267
I still remember the little girl
who gave me my first kiss.

475
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:00,448
I found out something on Bartlett.
He's been released from prison.

476
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:03,253
Let me guess. His conviction
was overturned on a technicality.

477
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:08,093
Exactly. But while he was in prison, he
started a violent white supremacist group.

478
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:10,098
- And?
- And rumor is he's in Georgia...

479
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:13,533
and he's organized a march
in opposition to a unity rally tomorrow.

480
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:15,901
- Then let's stop the son ofa bitch.
- Okay.

481
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:18,702
And get Jarod.

- Jarod?

- Now who's singing the blues?
- I'm so sick to death ofyou!

Think of it as your cross to bear.

burning crosses...

I thought it might be fun for you 
to experience terrorfor once.

504
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:19,186
Like you were going to do
to those two innocent little girls!

505
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:22,527
I wasn't gonna scare 'em.
I was gonna kill 'em! [Laughs]

506
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:27,368
Don't make me laugh.

507
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:30,269
Now, we've been through this
before, Jarod.

508
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,069
You're not gonna do anything.
[Laughing]

509
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:36,043
You ain't got the heart for it.

510
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:39,445
Now, that bitch you were with before-
She could do it.

511
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:43,581
Yeah.

512
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:48,716
Well, you see, it's not heart
that I need to burn you at the stake.

513
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,728
It's another part of my anatomy.

514
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:56,856
And let me tell ya, I got those.

515
00:37:56,932 --> 00:37:59,696
[Grunts] You'll never get away
with this! I got people out there.

516
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,738
Luke and the boys.
Luke! Luke!

517
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,739
[Laughs]
You know, something, Bartlett?

518
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,207
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

519
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:09,574
You had two infiltrators
in your group.

520
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:14,549
Luke was an undercover cop
with the Georgia State Police.

521
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:17,950
The rest of your apostles
should be in custody just about now.

522
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,480
- Damn you! Damn you!
- No! Damn you!

523
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:27,823
You can't do this! Please don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't!

524
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:30,593
Help! I don't wanna die!

525
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:34,727
No! No! No!

526
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:37,432
Don't burn me alive! Please!

527
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:40,998
Jarod, I'm sorry! Please!
I don't wanna die!

528
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:44,774
Jarod, I'm begging you!
Please, not like this!

529
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,081
God! No! No!
I don't wanna die!

530
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:53,587
I don't wanna die!
Someone help me!

531
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:57,558
Help! Help, Jarod, please!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

532
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:01,619
Dear God! Please! No!

533
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:07,192
[Sobbing]

534
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,931
You know something?
You're right.

535
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:15,977
I don't have the heart to kill.

536
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:18,809
- [Sirens Wailing]
- Or the hate.

537
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:22,044
- [Sirens Continue]
- Mmm.

538
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:27,914
Have fun... rotting in prison.

539
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,194

540
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:50,478
# [Singing Hymn]

541
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:54,949

# [Singing Continues]

543
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:36,117
You start speaking in tongues...

544
00:41:36,185 --> 00:41:39,382
and I'll send you on to the next life
right here and now.

545
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,356
[Chuckles] Sorry. It kinda reminds me
of goin' with my cousin Newt...

546
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:46,121
to the Slippery Rock Church
of the Great Redeemer when I was a kid.

# [Singing Continues]

548
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,133
Hi. Thanks for comin'.

549
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:55,796
- Sorry. Standin'room only.
- We're not here to worship, Reverend.

550
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,135
Pastor. I'm Pastor Jones.

551
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:01,370
Pastor Jones, we are looking
for this man. The name is Jarod.

552
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:05,470
We believe he's involved in a confrontation
with a racist named Bartlett.

553
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:11,315
I'm sorry.
Never seen him before.

554
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:19,020
Now, I do know about Bartlett. If you wanna
talk to him, try the State Penitentiary.

555
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:21,892
Good. I hope they
fry his ass this time.

556
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:23,898
Well, ma'am, it's my hope and prayer...

557
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:26,560
that one day Bartlett will
choose to end that life of hate.

558
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:29,502
- # [Singing Continues]
- And start the healin'...

559
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:33,008
that only love
and forgiveness will bring.

560
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:40,147
- Better pray for all of us.
- God bless you.

561
00:42:44,086 --> 00:42:46,054
Pastor Jones, thank you kindly.

562
00:42:46,121 --> 00:42:48,851
# [Singing Continues]

563
00:42:56,632 --> 00:43:00,762
We're outta here, Syd. Looks like
their guardian angel's come and gone.

564
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:05,398
