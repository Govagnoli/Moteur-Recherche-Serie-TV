- Jarod wants to make a deal.
- A deal.

170
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,357
He wants to find out the truth
or part of it.

<i>It is the humane thing to do.</i>

172

I just know it's right for me.

- Absolutely.

498
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:58,772
And to the best of your knowledge,
nothing slipped through the cracks?

499
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:02,578
- There are no cracks at Sloane and Associates.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

500
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:06,917
Would you explain your relationship
with Michael Metzger?

501
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:11,217
He's a client.

502
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:13,523
Were you aware that your client
was carrying on an affair...

503
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,189
with Audrey Price
at the time of the murder?

504
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:20,895
- Do you have any proof of that?
- Marcus Whittaker would gladly
testify to it under oath.

505
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,631
What's your point, Mr. Holmes?

506
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:26,697
Now you went through great pains
to establish the fact...

507
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:30,973
that Michael Metzger was a guest on your
boat at the time of the murder... is that correct?

508
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:34,777
I wouldn't call it "great pains."
He was there.

509
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,148
Do you remember what time
Audrey Price was killed?

510
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:42,953
- Between 9:00 and 9:15, if memory serves me.
- <i>Interesting.</i>

511
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:45,721
Then maybe you could tell me...

512
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:48,661
why Mr. Metzger made
a cell phone call to your boat...

513
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:54,396
at 9:20 the very same night
if he was with you.

514
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,836
May I see that, Mr. Holmes?

515
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:04,303
Proceed.

516
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:08,475
For the record, the D.A. has cataloged
this photo...

517
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,917
as a partial shoe print
from the murder scene.

518
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:15,684
Mr. Sloane, would you explain to the court
why the jury never saw this photograph?

519
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:18,954
<i>The police never made</i>
<i>a positive match.</i>

520
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:21,086
It proved nothing.

521
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:24,758
Well, perhaps I could help
the police out.

522
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,927
It's a size 11, deck shoe.

523
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:32,030
<i>You were on your boat that night,</i>
<i>weren't you, Mr. Sloane?</i>

524
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:35,702
- [Chuckles] So, now I'm the killer?
- <i>No.</i>

525
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:38,109
You were the janitor.

526
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,980
- We'll get to the killer.
- Your Honor, this is pointless harassment.

00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,177
- <i>[Judge] Mr. Holmes.</i>
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>

528
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,050
One moment, please.

- <i>[Annie] Mr. Sloane's on trial?</i>
- <i>Not officially.</i>

530
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,855
Not yet, anyway.

from Mr. Sloane's closet.

535
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:16,676
- Proves nothing.
- <i>No.</i>

536
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:18,743
But this certainly does.

537
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:24,556
The murder weapon.

538
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:26,753
<i>Stained with the victim's blood.</i>

539
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:29,388
Mr. Sloane, would you care
to explain to the court...

540
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:33,423
what the long-lost murder weapon
was doing on your boat?

541
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:35,902
[Scoffs]
This is ridiculous.

542
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:38,633
I don't think that
Michael Metzger thinks so.

543
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:42,837
You've been blackmailing him
with this since the murder trial.

544
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:46,837
Michael Metzger beat
Audrey Price to death.

545
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:50,248
<i>And then he called upon</i>
<i>Mr. Sloane to clean up the mess.</i>

546
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,278
<i>Only before you got there,</i>
<i>Mr. Whittaker arrived.</i>

547
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:58,351
He found the victim.
He panicked.

548
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:00,861
He ran away.

549
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:04,228
You allowed an innocent man
to go to jail.

<i>feel free tojump in.</i>

<i>a piece of evidence...</i>

presented here that a good
defense attorney couldn't shoot down.

553
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,908
Then I suggest
you find a very good one.
