[Broots] Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:14,011
Right here.
This is it.

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,280
Nice job, Broots.
Can you even spell "map"?

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,949
No, we're not lost, Miss Parker.
The G.P.S. coordinates Jarod gave us...

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,959
say it's right around here.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,930
About, uh, 25 yards...
that way!

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,866
This should be it.
This-This should be it, right here.

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,601
- This is it! This is it!
- All right!

10
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,475
I'm way past the point of losing patience
with Jarod's little games.

11
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,037
This is a waste of time.

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,811
If he brought us here,
there must be a reason.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,343
Yeah. To make us feel like asses
traipsing around Kansas all day.

14
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,983
Well, uh, actually, Miss Parker,
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,391
- What'd you say?
- Well, based on this map...

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,622
we just crossed the state line
right there.

17
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,960
No. Exactly what did you just say?

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,330
I said, "I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore."

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,673
What's that there?

20
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:30,081
A brick. Ayellow brick...
with an address on it.

21
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,989
- I get it. Follow the yellow brick road.
- Very good, Broots.

22
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,857
- I love that story.
- Either of you munchkins...

Let's go find out what our
little flying monkey is up to.

25
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,013
Well, I see that
the slop on a shingle...

26
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,106
seemed to work out all right after all.

27
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,619
I am sorry about the misunderstanding.
But with the name and all, well...

28
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,656
I thought it had something to do
with the biological function of a pig.

29
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,988
I'm just kinda glad that I didn't 
suggest the red-eyed gravy.

- For customers only.

33
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,934
I'll take a doughnut.

34
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:03,414
- Excuse me. Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Peachy.

35
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,044
- I mean, if there's something I can do?
- Damn it!

36
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,128
Thanks.

37
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,804
-It was just a kiss, sweetheart.
-Maybe I can help you.

38
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,612
- Getting out of the way would be a start.
- That guy didn't seem friendly.

39

You're a great kisser, but if you don't
shut the door, I'm gonna have to hurt you.

Shut the door!

There. It's shut.

Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

50
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,583
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?

51
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,095
Since I broke out, I've spent 
every moment searching for my past.

52
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,357
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

53
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,195
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

54
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,259
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

55
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,429

He defends the weak and abused.

56

- You a doctor?
- I am today.

58
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,660
You could have told me you were
on the run from the police.

59
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,700
I don't remember beggin' you
to get in the car.

60
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,736
I thought you needed help.

61
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,102
I appreciate the whole Dudley Do-Right thing,
but you're a little out of your league.

62

What are you?
Insurance, banker, what?

63
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,004
- Stock analyst. At least I was.
- Uh-huh.

64

is turn yourself in.

Look, you can relax, all right?
I'm not on the run from the cops.

68
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,484
I'm on the run from a cop.
Singular.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,052
That charming guy back at
the diner was Vince, my ex-boyfriend.

70
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,064
He's not takin' the breakup real well.

71
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,259
You're trying to tell me that
that cop was in love with you?

72

I'm a hell of a catch.

the wife if l drove up to your front door.

Well, I don't have a wife.
A home either, for that matter.

- Nowhere.

I already been somewhere.

Well, the address matches the brick.

I got a schedule here some place.

164
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,640
Twenty-one to Dispatch.

165
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,305
Possible on female A.P.B. out of
Warrington. Pennsylvania plates.

166
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,181
Edward-Baker-David-6233.

167
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,449
[Woman On Radio] Roger, 21. Suspect 
wanted for assault and armed robbery.

168
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,252
Apprehend with caution.

169
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,824
Howdy, ma'am.
License and registration, please.

170
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,163
[Zoe]
Yeah.

171
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,365
Well, you've either got
real good luck or real bad.

172
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,102
- The next westbound doesn't
get here till 7:45 tonight.
- [Zoe, Indistinct]

173
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:01,613
But if you're headed eastbound,
well, here comes the 1:30 right now.

174
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,943
[Man] Pretty little thing.
I wonder what she did to deserve that.

175
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,446
- Me too.
- [Car Door Closes]

176
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,016
- So, am I gonna sell you a ticket?
- [Engine Starts]

177
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,734
No. My plans have changed.

178
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,537
[Sighs]
Come on.

179
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,975
You're being jerked around.
I didn't steal anything from anyone.

180
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,377
Ma'am, we got an A.P.B.
on the police wire.

181
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,314
If it's a mistake, you can 
clear it up back in Warrington.

182
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,480
I won't get back to Warrington.
Haven't you heard anything I've just said?

183
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,491
- Your ride should be here any minute.
- It's, uh, here now.

184
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,427
Jarod Malloy, Warrington P.D.
Oh, I see you got my perp here.

185
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,624
Malloy? I was told an Officer Hudono
was comin' to get her.

186
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,031
Oh, yeah. Vince.
He smacked into...

187
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,262
the chief's brand new Lexus
on the way out of the parking lot.

188
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,567
- Ow.
- He's gonna be patchin' up 
his butt for a while...

189
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,630
so I'm, uh- I'm coverin' for him.

190
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,677
I just want to go home.
You got your PP-3 form?

191
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,770
Uh- Uh- Uh-

192
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,782
Damn it! No, I must have
left it in Vince's car.

193
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,614
We really can't release her
without it.

194
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,177
[Tires Screeching]

195
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,520
Can you help me out here? It's my
daughter's 10th birthday party tonight.

196
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,583
I really want
to get back in time for it.

197
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,027
Why don't you let me take my perp,
and then I'll fax you back the PP-3 form?

198
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,364
[Car Door Closes]

199
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,634
Yeah, well, allright. I don't want you
to miss your daughter's party.

200
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,073
Thanks.
I owe you one.

201
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,077
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I parked out back.

202
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,242
[Door Opens, Closes]

203
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,878
That is absolutely the most incredible
thing anyone's ever done for me.

204
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,979
Vince is coming through
the front door. Get in the car.

205
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,047
You have my car, my money. You could
have taken everything and disappeared.

206
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,150
How did you know I was telling
the truth about Vince?

207
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,923
I could've made that stuff up.
Jarod!

208
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,591
- How did you know?
- Because you told me.

209
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,788
Now get in the car.

210
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,663
You're a fugitive now.
Drive, cowboy!

211
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,444
Hey! Hey, Zoe!

212
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,648
Jarod, I think it's time
you tell me the truth.

213
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:36,059
- The truth about what?
- You're obviously not a stock analyst.

214
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,102
You make a pretty convincing cop,
but that's not it either.

215
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,297
So, who are you really?

216
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,671
I'm just someone who's looking for
a little happily ever after myself.

217
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:52,782
I'm searching for my family. I got
separated from them when I was a kid.

218
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:57,479
I'm separated from my family too.
By choice. I ran away when I was 1 6.

219
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:00,250
I can't imagine having a family
and not wanting to be with them.

220
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,918
- Don't you miss them?
- My grandmother, I do a lot.

221
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:05,553
She's the only one who
ever really understood me.

222
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,030
But the others?
I don't really think about them.

223
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:12,535
Except, of course, my sister Katie.

224
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,568
Let me tell you something
about identical twins.

225
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,575
They're not.
Katie got all the brains...

226
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,770
the talent, the sense ofhumor.

227
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:25,303
No one ever had any trouble
telling us apart.

228
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:30,579
There. That should keep Vince
off our backs.

229
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:34,021
The state line is about
an hour east ofhere.

230
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,252
After that, you'll be free and clear.

231
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,589
We're not gonna go east anymore.

232
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,791
A new plan.
We're goin' north.

233
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,935
- To where?
- I'm gonna teach you...

234
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:49,268
about another childhood staple
I'm pretty sure you missed out on.

235
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,273
- The road trip.
- The road trip?

236
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,935
Yeah. Distilled to
its most basic essence...

237
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,945
it is loading up on junk food...

238
00:16:56,013 --> 00:17:01,076
crankin' the radio and...
just drivin'.

[Miss Parker]
Okay, joke's over.

243
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,999
What the hell are we supposed
to be finding?

244
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,163
Maybe Jarod wants us to run
like rats in a maze.

245
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:57,536
Oh, yeah.
Or a fun house.

246
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,974
That would imply having fun.
What's that light down there?

247
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:11,510
Great. We go on
the yellow brick road death march...

248
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,988
and all we find is
this Goodwill reject?

249
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,048
Hey, that's G.I. Joe.

250
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,390
One of your "don't ask,
don't tell" buddies?

251
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:20,259
I had one just like this
when I was a kid.

252
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,094
He had the same jungle fatigues,
the same fake scar.

253
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,498
- Oh.
- [Sydney] What is it?

254
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,005
There's a letter "B" carved in the boot.
But mine had a "B."

255
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:31,006
I carved it with
Kenny Golletti's pocket knife.

256
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:36,171
- [Sydney] You're saying this is your doll?
- It couldn't be.

257
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:42,948
- Could it?
- We have entered the Jarod Zone.

258
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:47,948
G.I. Joe was my best friend.

259
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,151
When I was 12, I got the measles.

260
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:53,856
I spent all summer in the hospital.
I almost died.

261
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,989
You know, none of my friends
could visit me.

262
00:18:56,066 --> 00:19:00,628
And then my brother,
he snuck me in my G.I. Joe.

263
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:04,231
And it reminded me of home,
of my room...

264
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:09,069
where everything was so much better.

265
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:11,808
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy...

266
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:16,281
but this little guy
saved my life that summer.

267
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:20,784
You never mentioned this story
before, Broots.

268
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,791
Well, I never even thought of it before.

269
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,725
- Until-
- Till Jarod reminded you.

270
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:45,510
[Sighs] What do you think?
Too ick?

271
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,745
Not ick at all.
You look beautiful.

272
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,252
- Why the change?
- Mmm.

273
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,155
Would, uh, you bewilling
to pretend for me again?

274
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:04,291
Okay, okay. Anytime you want
to fill me in on what's going on here-

275
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:13,133
Zoe! Oh,
I can't believe it's you!

276
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,543
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, sweetie, it's so good to see you!

277
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:20,811
I can't tell you the time I've spent worrying
that somethin' might have happened to you.

278
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:23,717
Something has happened to me.
There's someone I want you to meet.

279
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,721
- This is Jarod.
- Hi.

280
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,280
- My husband. You're gonna love him, Grandma.
- [Laughing]

281
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:31,623
He's sweet and kind and spoils
me almost as much as you used to.

282
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:36,394
Oh, well, you picked a perfect
time to surprise me.

283
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,934
Your sister Linda
and her husband are here.

284
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,664
Come on in and share the good news.

285
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:45,538
Let's go share the good news, honey.

286
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,804
Linda, you'll never guess who's here.

287
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:51,678
Your baby sister, and she's a newlywed.

288
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:55,980
- Hey, Linda.
- Wow. Well, that's... great.

289
00:20:56,052 --> 00:21:00,318
Um, congratulations.

290
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,189
Uh- Uh, Linda is my sister.

291
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:07,424
And, uh, this is-

292
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,935
That's my husband, Greg.

293
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,767
Zoe should know that,
but since she couldn't be bothered...

294
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,672
to come to our wedding,
they've never met.

295
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:20,972

296
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,169
Who wants coffee?

297
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,943
[Linda]
I'm not sure if you care...

298
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,681
but Mom's still chairing
the ladies' group at the club...

299
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:34,952
and, uh, Mark and his wife
just had their second boy in June.

300
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,926
- Mark's our brother.
- I swear, he hasn't had a minute to rest.

301
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:40,394
He's taken over the firm from Dad.

302
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:44,126
It's been such a success.
They must have 20 partners now.

303
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,760
- So, what do you do, Jarod?
- Hmm?

304
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,805
Uh, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

305
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:57,904
Oh, don't be so modest, honey.

306
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:02,077
Jarod's an aerospace engineer.
He designs commercial jetliners.

307
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:06,552
Small world. I run the F.A.A.'s...

308
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,818
propulsion research facility
in Red Valley.

309
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:11,588
What do you make of these new 6250s
comin' out of Northum?

310
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:17,731
Well, they'll look a lot better 
after they sort out their preignition 
wire bus problems.

311
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:21,259
The S.Q. gyro platforms
tend to shimmy at high R.P.M.s...

312
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:23,329
which could throw off
the whole telemetry.

313
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:26,239
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:28,743
I hadn't heard anything about it.

315
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:32,976
- He's really something.
- Yeah, he sure is.

316
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,614
[Miss Parker]
He's a jerk, and this proves it.

317
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,690
I'm tellin' you right now,
if that thing starts playing...

318
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:51,359
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
I"m gonna blow it into a million pieces.

319
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,425
Now, don't. Wait.

321

It's a French song
from the early '40s.

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,839
- "Les Mots D"Amour."
- "The Language of Love."

00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,006
It was yours, huh, Syd?

324
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:14,817
# [Record]

325
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,520
When the Allies liberated our camp...

326
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:23,362
my brother Jacob and I had to make 
our way back home to Lyon.

327
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,596
- When we got home, the house
my father built by hand...
- # [Woman Singing In French]

328
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,934
was reduced to mere rubble.

329
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:35,840
But in the debris,
we found this record.

330
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:39,473
It was my mother's favorite song.

331
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:43,679
She would put it on and make
my father dance with her.

332
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:47,086
And my brother Jacob and I
would have to watch them.

333
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:51,088
I thought I had lost it years ago.

334
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:55,564
Sydney, what do you think Jarod
is trying to tell us with all of this?

335
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:59,625
I don't know.
But I'm glad he is.

336
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,276
Four children, 12 grandchildren
and 10 great-grandkids.

337
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:18,343
- I'd say I'm blessed, wouldn't you?
- I'd say.

338
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,515
Is this Zoe with Katie?

339
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,617
Oh, this is one of my favorites.

340
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:28,357
And this was taken just a few weeks
before, uh, Katie died.

341
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,696
It was almost like they both
died on the same day.

342
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:36,467
You know, it hit everybody pretty hard.
But Zoe, she was devastated.

343
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:41,203
I can imagine.
Her twin sister.

344
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:43,643
In time, the rest of
the family managed to go on.

345
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:47,308
But I think she resented them,
like they were forgetting about Katie.

346
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:51,945
Zoe just sort of spiraled
after that, pullin' away from the family.

347
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:55,252
- That's when Zoe ran away.
- Mm m.

348
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:58,385
I have a feeling now I can worry less.

349
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:06,060
- What are you two gossiping about?
- Oh, none of your business. Shh.

350
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:10,295
- You sleep tight.
- Good night.

351
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:13,274
And I'll see you in the morning.
[Chuckles]

352
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:17,579
We did it!
We pulled it off! [Laughs]

353
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,615
Oh, and, Jarod,
that whole airline engine thing?

354
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,912
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

355
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,647
Why is it so important that they think
your life is something that it's not?

356
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:28,054
You don't understand.
I have always been the family screwup.

357
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:30,786
No direction, no decent job.

358
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,727
Lousy relationships.

359
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:37,129
Look at my brothers and sisters.
All success stories.

360
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,896
- Well, who cares what they think?
- I don't.

361
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,960
But my grandmother-
I want her to think that...

362
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,031
I've turned my life around-
that I'm happy.

363
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,976
Even if it is a lie.
It'll be easier for her that way.

364
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:54,610
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.

365
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:02,520
Hey, I know how we can really
convince them that we're newlyweds.

366
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,054
[Meows]

367
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:09,390
Stick around.

368
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:41,024
- What is it?
- How long have you known you were sick?

369
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,373
- How'd you know I was sick?
- These prescriptions...

370
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:00,041
are all precursors for chemotherapy.

371
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:02,448
How long have you known?

372
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:07,280
I don't know.
Three weeks.

373
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:11,851
And you haven't filled
the prescriptions yet. Zoe-

374
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:14,863
- I haven't gotten around to it.
- This is serious.

375
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,161
Your carefree attitude
won't make it go away.

376
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,827
What do you want from me,
some scene out of Love Story?

377
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:21,893
Sorry. Drama queen's not my style.

378
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:24,633
- I'm going to the drugstore tomorrow.
- You don't have to do that.

379
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,437
- I want to.
- I don't want you to.

380
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,244
Jarod, I've seen people fight
this type of cancer before.

381
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:37,685
All the agony and sickness.
The cure's worse than the disease.

382
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:42,054
- Besides, most of them die anyway.
- There are new treatments-

383
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,026
advancements that could
give you a real chance.

384
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:48,860
- So now you're a doctor too?
- I'm just saying it doesn't
have to be a fatal condition.

385
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,195
Life is a fatal condition.

386
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:57,265
You get off the bus, suck all the juice
out of the years you have...

387
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,832
and it's... good night, Cleveland.

388
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,504
You've been a beautiful crowd.
Those are the rules.

389
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,706
Always have been.
I get it.

390
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:09,741
And I'm not gonna cry and plead for special
treatment just as the curtain's closing.

391
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:13,550
You know, it's weird, but in some ways,
it's been a good thing.

392
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,114
It made me realize I had 
to get away from Vince.

393
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:18,922
Brought me here to see
my grandmother again.

394
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:21,020
Even brought me to you.

395
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,959
You can't give up without a fight.

396
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,036
Yes, I can.
Jarod, don't say anything...

397
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,577
about this to anyone,
especially my grandmother.

398
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:38,205
- Zoe-
- Promise me?

399
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,819
- [Scoffs] I can't accept this.
- You have to. This is my life.

400
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:48,584
These are my decisions.

401
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:51,684
Besides, maybe I deserve it.

402
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,888
Jarod?

403
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:16,342
I vote we go back to the Munchkin and
shoot our way out of this madhouse.

404
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:20,287
This journey isn't over till we find
what Jarod left for you, Miss Parker.

405
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:22,586
And I think we just found it.

406
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:25,126
This looks like the basket
that Dorothy carried Toto in.

407
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:28,425
Well, if Jarod rustled up
my old dog Mr. Sheckle...

408
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:30,489
it ain't gonna be pretty.

409
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,809
- A thimble?
- [Broots] Miss Parker?

410
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,076
My family...

411
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,947
didn't spend a lot of time
together when I was growing up.

412
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:53,512
My father was always at the Centre.

413
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:56,786
If he was around, my mother
was off in an orphanage somewhere.

414
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:59,089
But one day...

415
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:02,230
there had been a bigstorm.

416
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:04,493
But the roads were all closed.

417
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,195
Everything was shut down.

418
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,070
[Chuckles]
Daddy, of course, was annoyed.

419
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,541
But I was elated,
because it was just the three ofus...

420
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,603
trapped together in the house.

421
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:26,051
So, you all just sewed something.

- We played Monopoly.
- Oh.

425
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,833
We played Monopoly all day
and into the night.

426
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:48,366
Daddy was the shoe,
my mother was the car, and I was...

427
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:53,081
the thimble.

428
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:56,812
[Clears Throat] So, why do you suppose
Jarod is doing this?

429
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:59,616
I mean, what do you-
What do you think he's trying to say?

430
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:04,251
- There's no place like home.
- There's no place like home.

the hell out ofhere.

Okay, let me hear it one more time!

433
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:14,929
- There's no place-
- We've said it three times already!

434
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,194
I know, but I gotta hear it
with the shoes clicking.

435

You're gonna hear it with the clicking
of my .9 millimeter...

440
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,920
- I really wish you weren't leavin' so soon.
- So do I.

441
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:44,985
But Jarod's speaking at
a big conference up north.

00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:47,623
And if we don't leave now,
well, he's gonna be late.

443

Well, don't you keep my little girl
away too long, Jarod.

444
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:53,065
I want to see her back here soon.

Oh, she'll be back before you know it.

Oh, one more thing, Gram.
I have something for you.

447

A, uh- A surprise birthday present.

448
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:14,849
- But my birthday isn't for two months.
- That's why it's a surprise.

Thank you, Jarod,
for keeping your promise.

454
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,777
I still think you should tell her.

455
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:41,876
Better she remember me like this.

if you'd be happy too.

I'll take that as a compliment.

471
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:38,000
There must be more than
the obvious interpretation.

472
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:40,670
Maybe some deeper meaning?

- I know all their secrets.
- Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

487
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,365
[Both Chuckling]

488
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:40,199
He gave us lucky number seven.

489
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,336
Where are you going now?

490
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:57,120
- Zoe?
- It's magical, Jarod.

491
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,782
Don't you feel like takin' a dip?

492
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:02,348
- Come on.
- Zoe, no.

493
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:05,328
Jarod, yes. Look at it.
It's calling us.

494
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,830
- I don't have a bathing suit.
- Neither do I.

495
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:11,300
- I don't know.
- Hey, I paid for the room.

496
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,963
- The least you can do is swim with me.
- [Sighs]

497
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:16,199
You've never skinny-dipped
before, have you?

498
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:18,208
Is- Is that what they call it?

499
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,006
Yeah. Jump in and I'll show you why.

500
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:28,613
- You're crazy, you know that?
- And you're stalling.

501
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:31,621
Just what does a naked woman
have to do to get you in here?

502
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,559
[Splashing]

503
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:44,829
- It's not so bad, is it?
- Nice.

504
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,132
It's pretty good.

505
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:59,282
Hi.

506
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,284
Hi.

507
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:49,733
Mmm. Zoe?

508
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:57,700
- [Chuckles] Okay, what are you doing?
- Last night was amazing.

509
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:00,903
- Mmm.
- The last 48 hours have been amazing.

510
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:13,619
Falling in love wasn't part of the plan.

511
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:18,890
- What plan?
- The one that says I have to go now, 
and it has to be alone.

512
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:21,932
What? What are you doing?

513
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,627
This isn't funny.
Unlock these cuffs.

514
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,671
- Unlock the cuffs! Give me the key!
- I can't.

515
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:29,933
Look, you're going to get well.
You'll beat this!

516
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,805
No, I won't!
I'm sure of that.

517
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:35,402
I need to end things my way.
Go out with a bang, right?

518
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:38,607
- Zoe, don't do this.
- Jarod, you're good at pretending.

519
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:41,675
- Just pretend you never met me.
- Zoe! Zoe-

520
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:45,813
- Zoe!
- [Door Closes]

521
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,160
[Grunting]

522
00:37:57,201 --> 00:38:00,329
Hi, honey.
Goin' somewhere?

523
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,044
- The game's over. It's time to go home.
- That's not my home anymore.

524
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:11,775
- I told you, you and I are over.
- If you didn't want me to find you...

525
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,977
then you wouldn't have
used your credit card to rent the room.

526
00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:17,452
- You haven't blown all that money?
- The money was mine!

527
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,546
- It was ours!
- Fine. You know what?

528
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:23,560
- You can have it, but you can't have me!
- You really wanna take me on?

529
00:38:23,628 --> 00:38:25,687
- Do you?
- I will if l have to.

530
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,288
- What the hell? You're with this guy?
- Come on, Zoe. It's all right.

531
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,994
- Hey!
- Look, she doesn't wanna be with you.

532
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,127
- Why can't you get that through your head?
- That's not her decision.

533
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:35,229
And it's not yours either.
Let's go.

534
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:38,742
- Oh, my God, Vince, no!
- You must've had some fun last night, huh?

535
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,903
I'll tell you what. Not like the fun
you and I are gonna have tonight.

536
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,576
[Grunting]

537
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,812
Vince, don't!

538
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,419
Son of a bitch!

539
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,924
You got some brass ones!
I'll give you that!

540
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,733
[Engine Starts]

541
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:15,005
- [Tires Screeching]
- Zoe! Zoe!

542
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,597
Zoe?

543
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:45,198
How'd you know?

544
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:48,939
I called your grandmother.
She said this is where your sister died.

545
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:54,941
- Please, I want to talk to you.
- Oh, no, you don't.

546
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:59,551
You want to stop me
from finishing my journey.

547
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:07,828
Zoe, what happened was terrible,
and it was very sad...

548
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:10,423
but it was an accident.

549
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:13,334
You have to stop
blaming yourself for it.

550
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:16,567
I'm the one who told her
to climb up here.

551
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,837
I only meant it as a joke, but Katie,
she never turned down a dare.

552
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:24,675
She was right about here
when she slipped.

553
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:31,116
Katie should have been the one
that lived. She was smarter, funnier.

554
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:35,249
So you think you deserve to die.
Is that it?

555
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:38,754
It's not like I've been
a big success in life.

556
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:40,956
Look at what I've done to mine.
I've made a mess of it.

557
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:43,932
Because you've been punishing yourself
for what happened to your sister...

558
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:48,165
and that's why you're
not fighting the cancer.

559
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,037
This isn't about living life
to the fullest...

560
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:53,736
or going out with a bang.

561
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:57,872
You're not fighting it because you
don't think you deserve to beat it.

562
00:40:57,948 --> 00:40:59,939
God, Jarod.

563
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:05,055
- I'm just so scared.
- I know you are.

564
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,352
And I'm going to help you.

565
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,518
But there's only one place to do it...

566
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:12,688
and that's with the people you love.

567
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:18,027
Why would Jarod bring us
all the way back here...

568
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:21,162
when nothing has changed?

569
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:25,504
Well, nothing except this.
It's not exactly ruby slippers.

570
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:29,876
I think Jarod fell asleep in
the magical poppies a little too long.

571
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:33,041
[Broots] A note from Jarod, Sydney?
What does it say?

572
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,681
- "There's no place like home."
- In case we didn't get it before?

573
00:41:39,757 --> 00:41:42,624
"Everyone deserves one.
So why don't you...

574
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:46,288
leave me alone
and let me find mine?"

575
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:58,232
[Kid Laughing, Chattering]

576
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:01,745
Hey-hey-hey!
[Chattering, Indistinct]

577
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:03,803
Areyou sure about this?

578
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:09,410
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You got a long fight ahead of you.

579
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:12,115
I don't want you to have to
go through it alone.

580
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:15,420
I'm not alone.
I've got them.

581
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:19,395
And I've got you.

582
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:25,394
- In here.
- I want to stay with you.

583
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:30,099
I know.
But you can't stay, can you?

584
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,974
I can see it in your eyes.

585
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:46,319
Thank you... for helping me
find my way back home.

586
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:49,792
Good-bye.

587
00:42:51,295 --> 00:42:53,286
You ever say that word again,
I'll kick your butt.

588
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:57,061
- Okay.
- Go.
