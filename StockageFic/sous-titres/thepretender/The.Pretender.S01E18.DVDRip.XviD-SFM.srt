You know I can't allow you

132
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:13,494
- Fine. Then I can't finish the simulation.
- Why not?

133
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,095
How am I supposed to pretend to do this
if I've never had a friend?

134
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:19,142

and stood up for him.

he saved Eugene from a lot worse.

Yeah. The one person that Eugene thought
that he could always trust and believe in...

228
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:19,363
turned him into a drug runner
and sold him out.

But to Eugene,
Jimmy was everything.

230

You ever think that maybe Eugene
was right aboutJimmy?

231
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:30,836
Jimmy Rayford jumped off that plane

everything on Eugene.
