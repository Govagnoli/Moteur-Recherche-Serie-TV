- Hmm. So, what does it mean?

of the simulation was.

- Yes!

22

- Horse liniment.

Tom Miles? I saw the picture
of the two of you in the hangar.

69
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:59,539
He, uh, made a jump about
200 miles out into the desert.

70
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,409
- Tom was always testing himself.
- Testing?

71
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:09,084
He took one canteen of water, a compass,
and a knife, and hiked back in.

72
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,458
It was this... yearly ritual.

73
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,961
Uh, something went wrong
and... he died.

74
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,198
So all I can do now
is make Tom's dream...

75
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:29,178
of turning Blue Desert into the best
skydiving school in Texas come true.

76

We're gonna get
a new jump plane, redo the hangar.

- Tom deserves that.

79

It's not much to look at, but, uh,
the A.C. works. There's a phone and VCR.

- Torture?
- Jarod's playing games.

113
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,355

- <i>Well, then why would Jarod lead us here?</i>

00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:29,233
<i>He didn't. The little red notebook</i>

to put on a few pounds.

Oh, you never know who might be
peeking over your transom.

00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:03,699
Uh, uh, uh. Setting back the bathroom
scale three pounds, that's cheating.

00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:07,004
- What do you want, Jarod?
- Same thing you do.

Well, sometimes that envelope's
a little thinner than it looks.

You know, the sad part is,
that was gonna be his last jump.

Isn't it a little difficult to run
a jump school if you don't jump?

Hey. This <i>school</i> has just
barely eked by for years.

Tom didn't care about any of that.
He was just a plain old simple guy.

why would a survival expert like Tom Miles

Oh, Sheriff,
one other quick question.

Was there an autopsy
done on the body?

284
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:31,098

Before Tom went off

for him to be a <i>good</i> father...

<i>to teach our son about life.</i>

<i>He used to say that</i>
<i>life was meant to be lived...</i>

and death wasn't
something to be afraid of.

313
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,720
Is that why he made
those jumps into the desert?

314

<i>his son know who his father was.</i>

- The things he cared about.
- Carol said that.

<i>She said that if the school closed,</i>
<i>then Tom's death would be meaningless.</i>

00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,895
- The history?
- Carol and Tom were together

- Compliments of Uncle Sam.
- Uncle who?

344
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,360
There was a question about a certain
piece of tribal land and who owned it.

345

352
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:59,191
I found the body of the man
who walks on clouds.

353
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,354
I thought Sheriff Kunkle
found Tom Miles's body.

354
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,898
It wouldn't be smart
for an Indian to ride into town...

355
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:08,197
with a white war hero strapped
across the grille of his motor home.

356
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,605
Why would a survival expert like
Tom Miles die of dehydration...

357
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,802
when all those yucca plants
were around him?

358
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:18,437

I knew what happened.

<i>According to the police report...</i>

360
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,316
the wounds on his face
were inflicted by an animal.

361
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:27,616
It was no animal.
It was his madness.

362
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,782
<i>I've seen it only</i>
<i>one time before in my life</i>...

363
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:32,087

364
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,752
Vision quest?

365

from the root of the belladonna plant...

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,664

going to the world beyond.

367
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:47,606

he could lose himself, go mad.

370

- He's a genius.
- I don't know about that.

376

That fella was always
askin' questions.

378

I didn't come here
to talk aboutJarod.

379
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,820
Well, that's funny. All he
wanted to talk about was you.

380
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:45,195
- Me?
- He said you two had grown up together.

381
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:48,565
Seemed disappointed

382
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:52,595
Guess your mother never
told you about this place.

383
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,507
No. She didn't.

384
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:59,171
She came here exactly
this time every year.

385
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:02,011
She loved the spring.

Excuse me?

389
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:16,553
She used to tell me
she was visiting her sister.

390
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:20,590
<i>Ah.</i>
<i>I'm sure she had her reasons.</i>

391
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:26,095
When your mother didn't
show up, I got worried.

394

But I do remember that
her death was, uh, sudden.

395
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:46,322
Is there anything of hers...

396
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:49,693
It would mean a lot to me
if I could see where she stayed.

She came out to the hangar the morning
of the jump, switched Tom's canteen.

00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:35,945
- About an hour, hour and a half.

What's wrong?

492
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,792
We're losing pressure.

493
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,734
I think it's the fuel pump.

494
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:56,408
<i>This terrain is much too</i>
<i>dangerous to land.</i>

495
00:37:56,476 --> 00:38:00,173
If the overflow of fuel should reach the
engine, the whole plane could explode.

496
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:03,115
We're going to have to jump.

497
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:04,980
- Jump?
- Jump.

498
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:11,055
Relax. We're skydiving
instructors, remember?

499
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,718
What the hell do you mean
he was polite?

500
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,125
You just give out confidential
crime scene files...

501
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,858
to anybody who walks in here
with a smile on their face?

502
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,991
He said he was with the I.R.S.

503
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,001
Damn it, Aida. I've
told you a million times.

510
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:44,446
You call the civil air patrol.
Dispatch Search and Rescue right now.

511
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:51,027

Ah, I think I broke my leg.

Hey.

- Don't worry. Somebody'll find us.
- [Grunts]

517
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,264
I'm not so sure.

518
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:02,267
What are you saying? There's a chance
that nobody knows we're out here?

519
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:07,102
I don't know. I don't know if
the Mayday transmission made it out.

520
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,336
[Sighs] Well, what the hell
do you suggest we do?

<i>[Jarod] There's about six or</i>
<i>seven hours left of sunlight.</i>

522

If you travel lightly, you can
make it to Fort Hancock by dark.

523
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:21,120
- Me? What if I don't make it?
- You'll make it.

- [Sighs]
- <i>Head due south.</i>

525
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,921
And here's a full
canteen of water.

526
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:31,463

I'll see you soon.

529
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,199

Tom felt those last moments.

<i>You took his canteen, and you</i>

541
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:43,787
<i>The harder the sun bore down, the more</i>
<i>delirious he became with every tainted drink.</i>

542
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:47,560
<i>And every minute that passed was</i>
<i>just another agonizing moment...</i>

543
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:51,331
when he realized he would never see
his baby that he wanted so much.

544
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:54,567
<i>It got so bad that</i>
<i>he wandered in circles.</i>

545
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:58,600
<i>He clawed at his own body to fight off</i>
<i>the madness that you created for him.</i>

[Breathing Heavily]
No.

548
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:10,678
It was a school
and a family.

552
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,031
So you left a widow behind and
a baby to be born fatherless.

Tom, I just wanted
what I deserved.

Something tells me you're
going to get just that.

Hello, Jarod.

With instincts like that,
you'll catch me yet.

Not if you keep throwing me
off the trail.

Oh, I didn't throw you off.
I just put you on a different one.

Is that all you do, Jarod?
Dig up the past?
