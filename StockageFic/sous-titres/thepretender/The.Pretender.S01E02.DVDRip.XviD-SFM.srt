Don't hang up.

166
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,569
I'm worried about you.

167
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,097
If you're so worried about me,
why don't you go to the authorities?

168
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:27,475
- You know I can't do that.
- Why?

169
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:30,037
Because you love me?

170
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,675
Or because you're afraid
of what I know?

171
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:36,949
Jarod, if those people from the beltway
find out what you have...

172
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:39,183
I won't be able to protect you.

173
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:42,352
If they find out what I have...

174
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,952
you won't be able
to protect yourselves.

175
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,658
Those D.S.A.'s contain my work.

176
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:51,464
No, Sydney.
They contain my life.

177
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:53,528

<i>Now this is very interesting.</i>

181
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,748
You mean somebody actually manufactures...

00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:13,484
imitation canine feces?

183
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,323
Yep. Only they couldn't
fit all that on the label...

184
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,659
so they just call it fake dog poop.

185
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,131
Oh.

186
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,897
And why exactly would
somebody want fake dog poop?

187
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,206
'Cause it's funny.

188
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,673
- Oh.
- No, I mean the white ones. Yeah.

189
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,739
<i>Thank you.</i>

190
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:44,422

191
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:56,561

Those were his favorites.

- <i>Yeah, that-that's him.</i>

Is that your wife?

212
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:10,095
Could've been.
Probably would've.

213
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:12,966
I never asked her.

214
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:19,702
Do you think the Dutchman
ever found his lost love?

215
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,508
<i>What?</i>

216
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,641
<i>The opera you were listening to.</i>
<i>Wagner's</i> Dutchman.

217
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,880
<i>That's the story.</i>
<i>I always wondered...</i>

218
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:31,115
if he ever searched for his love...

219
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:34,352
or spent the rest of his days
floating around on that ghost ship.

220
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:36,519
I never really gave it much thought.

221
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,224
It's not easy wondering
if someone you love is still out there.

222

Don't that uniform make it your job?

225
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,664
I'm just borrowing the uniform.

226
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,730
<i>I brought you some supplies from town.</i>

00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,606

230
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,178
Done. Thanks.

231
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:21,225

233
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,932
I like this one fine.
It's all I need.

234
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:30,437
I was allowed to listen to it
once when I was a child.

235
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:36,434
I'd close my eyes,
and in my mind...

236
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,104
I became an eagle.

237
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,618
I could go anywhere, do anything.

238
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:47,245
Nothing could stop me.

239
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:53,089
Maybe Mozart knew something
that Wagner didn't.

243
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:12,403
This is a helicopter, not a library.

244
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,678
Trying to orient myself to

245
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,742

I will buy you lunch...

246
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,686

about some of these old searches.

247
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:25,522

248
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,561
Great. I don't want
Commander Powell...

249
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,825
to tag me "Freshwater Boy"
on my rank review.

250
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:34,095
Wait a minute.

251
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:37,262
You've been here three days,
and you're getting a rank review?

252
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:42,941
Oh, great! All I need
is another guy in this operation...

253
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,446
- <i>elbowing for room on the ladder.</i>
- When are you due?

254
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,978
I should've made L.C. months ago...

255
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:51,882
but Commander Powell
keeps putting it off.

256
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:56,616
Not your promotion.
Your baby.

257
00:17:56,691 --> 00:18:02,220
I'd say from your nausea and your sore back,
you're about nine weeks.

258
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:08,363
My husband doesn't even know.
What are you, a part-time obstetrician?

259
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:11,030
No, but I was a midwife once.

260
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,039
You haven't told
the commander yet, have you?

261
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:16,838
Hell no! If Powell or anyone else
around here finds out about this...

262
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,209
I can kiss away
my chances at L.C.

263
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,511
Your secret's safe with me.

264
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,676
<i>Well, Broots, what happened?</i>

265
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,084
I'm backtracking his call
through the other phone.

266
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,748
All I know right now is that
they're all international landlines.

267
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,258
- I didn't even know that was possible.
- How long to trace it?

268
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:34,317
Uh, that's hard to say.

269
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:38,456
I mean, Jarod's method
is so basic, so simple.

270
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,126
Uh, 20... 24 hours.

271
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,193
You have 12.

272
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,702
I can do it in eight.

273
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:50,777
The King file?

274
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:53,211
You certainly picked a sensitive one.

275
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,510
It's all downhill after this.

276
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,108
You-You should talk to Bilson.
This was his baby.

277
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:00,881
- <i>How so?</i>
- Well, it happened during
his regular Tuesday night patrol.

278
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:03,389
So, Bilson was in charge.

279
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:07,518
It was a tough one too. No one
was sure how King's boat went down.

280
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:11,622
Never did find it.
This one was particularly sad.

281
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:16,864
Coroner said Tom King treaded water
a day and a half before he drowned.

282
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,462
<i>For an S.A.R. team</i>
<i>that's come up empty...</i>

283
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,474
that's the kind of news
that hurts the most.

284
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,976
This report says that
the search patterns were based...

285
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:27,741
on water current information
provided by directional buoys.

286
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:30,875
Yep.
I dropped them myself. Here.

287
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,885
Pilcher's Point.

288
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:35,148
That's the area Tom King
was known to have been fishing in.

289
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:39,056
So Bilson deployed standard grid searches
southeast of that point?

290
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:43,586
That's S.O.P. You seem to be
following this fine. What is the matter?

291
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:45,427
According to satellite monitoring...

292
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:50,232
the D.F. buoys indicated that
the current was moving southwest.

293
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,922
- You're doing it wrong.
- Hmm?

294
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,297
Didn't you ever
eat cookies as a kid?

295
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,826
They didn't have cookies
where I grew up.

296
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:26,930
Where'd you grow up... Mars?

297
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,702
Sort of.

298
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:35,647
First, you twist the cookie...

299
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:40,949
so the top comes off
like a little lid.

300
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,013
Then, you get all the white stuff off.

301
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,959
I pick it with my teeth,
but you can scrape it or lick it.

302
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:56,895
Then what do you do
with the brown part?

303
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:58,871
Grown-ups put it in ice cream.

304
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,032
Why don't they just sell
the white stuff?

305
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:03,406
It wouldn't be any fun.

306
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:05,468
Hmm.

307
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,352
Your mom works hard.

308
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,488
Since my dad died,
that's all she does.

309
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:25,594
He's with St. Andrew...
the one for fishermen.

310
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,727
I got my dad a statue
of him at church.

311
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:34,433
It was on his boat.
They never found that.

312
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:41,779
It's hard to lose a parent.
I know.

313
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,050
What part do you miss the most?

314
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:51,214
My mom's smile.

315
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,931
- <i>[Young Jarod] I can't figure it out.!</i>
- <i>[Sydney] You have to.</i>

316
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:06,632
How much oxygen is left?

317
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,766
Less than 48 hours.

318
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:11,470

<i>Well, what caused the explosion?</i>

319
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:14,810
- We don't know!
- Fuel.

320
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,280
Oxygen.

Wait! Wait! I've got it! I've got it!

326
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:48,373
I can use the gravitational pull
of the moon to help get us back.

327
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,956
Very good, Jarod. I knew
you would save them if you wanted to.

328
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:05,625
They didn't want to save Tom King.

329
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,860
They wanted him to die.

- [Sighs]

00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:35,090

00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:41,425
Cute. Not funny, but cute.

337
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:46,997
You're making house calls now.
I'm honored.

338
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:49,838
Well, I was feeling a little guilty
about my virtual phone game.

339
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,676
You know, I really should tape this
to replay at the Christmas party.

340
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,511
You'll be there, you know,
rest assured.

341
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,451
- I'm not resting much at all these days.
- Breaking my heart.

342
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:04,457
So, Jarod...

343
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,993
why the Y.M.C.A.?

344
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:10,758
I was watching retro night on VH1,
and they were doing the '70s...

345
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:12,992
which, as you know, I missed.

346
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:16,798
There was this singing group that was
extolling the virtues of staying at the "Y."

347
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,304
So, here I am.

348
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:22,342
Cute. Not funny, but cute.

349
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:27,312
Did you know that
they make fake dog poop?

350
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:31,181
It's amazing...
how it appears to be one thing...

351
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:33,651
- but it's really something completely different.
- <i>[Clatters On Table]</i>

352
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,281
And I should care because...

353
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:39,189
Well, this sort of thing could be
a real moneymaker for the Centre.

354
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:41,921
Besides, isn't it
the perfect metaphor...

355
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:45,487
for the way your father and the Centre
distort the truth?

356
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:51,471
- And what truth is that, Jarod?
- It's all in the note I sent you.

357
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:56,168
The truth about

360
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:18,961
I doubt the boys back at Katima Bay
are sittin' beach-side this time of year.

361
00:25:19,032 --> 00:25:23,992
Probably freezing their butts off
on some futile cape-hopping S.A.R.

362
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,210
So, um, beside the obvious,
why pull up stakes?

363
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,112
Well, I was feeling kind of
cooped up where I was living.

364
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:37,116
So I decided to head out west.

365
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:40,449
I interviewed at
the Channel Islands Station first...

366
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,012
but I decided that
this was the spot for me.

367
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,115
Well, you made the right decision.

368
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,854
The Channel Islands
is full of our rejects.

369
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:49,862
- That's funny.
- Here you go, sir.

370
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,524
They said that this group
was a bunch of renegades.

371
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,193
That's a crock.

372
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:58,727
They said guys who couldn't rescue
a fisherman from their own bay...

373
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,400
didn't deserve to wear the uniform.

374
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,443
Were they talking about
the King rescue?

375
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,104
Yes, I think that was the name they used.

376
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:11,143

00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:29,334
I guess she had to blame somebody,

- Okay.

395
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,044

Gotcha.

- Who the hell are you, huh?
- I don't really know.

419
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:15,336

why you come here so much...

420
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:17,604
why you feel so guilty...

421
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:20,442
and why you and Bilson
didn't save her father's life.

422
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,311
We searched for him for two days.

423
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:26,341
But you made sure that the search was in
areas that you knew he wouldn't be found.

424
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,786
You couldn't afford for him
to be found alive, could you?

425
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,880
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

426
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,155
I know you and Bilson make the same patrol
on the south sector every Tuesday night.

427
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,458
<i>And every Wednesday afternoon,</i>
<i>you make a rather sizable deposit...</i>

- Am I? The paint on the hull.

00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:29,215
I mean, it was foggy.
I just-just couldn't see it.

442

445
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,151
and I spotted him in the water.

446
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,398
He was still alive.

447
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:51,994

448
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:56,604

449
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,542
and all I can think was...

450
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,878
"What a small world," you know?

451
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:07,909
I used to see him with his daughter
and his wife at Mass...

452
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,252
and I think
he recognized me too.

453
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,985
And then he put
his hand up to me.

454
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,997
So I tried to pull him on board...

455
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,056
but Bilson stopped me.

456
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:25,496
He literally put a gun to my head
and told me to leave him.

457
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:28,268
- And if you saved him...
- That we'd go to jail.

00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:01,954
Excuse me.
Have either of you seen this man?

497
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:06,120
Well, that's great.
That's just great.

498
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:08,126
Purring like a damn kitten.

499
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:13,697
Robin 247 to <i>Santa Marca.</i>
Come in, <i>Santa Marca.</i>

500
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:33,818
Rescue 45, come in.
Is that you, Javi?

501
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:42,659
Rescue 45, you're on a direct course
to my craft. Veer off.

502
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:46,759
Rescue 45, veer off!

503
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:51,960
Rescue 45,
you're coming right at me!

504
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:55,132
Rescue 45, veer off!

505
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:08,850
Hey!

506
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,518
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell's wrong with you, man?

507
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:21,693
- You blind or somethin'? Come on! Toss me a line!
- I can't, sir.

508
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:25,101
- What?
- I'm sorry, but I can't rescue you.

509
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,264
You're bucking for
a court-martial, Lieutenant!

510
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,137
Well, that is serious, sir.

511
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:33,543
But, you see, a court-martial,
it won't exactly affect me.

512
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:37,606
<i>I'm not really a lieutenant.</i>
<i>The truth is...</i>

513
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:39,652
I'm not really in the Coast Guard.

514
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,448
You get me out of here!

515
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:44,046
Oh, don't worry.
You'll be okay.

516
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:47,355
Men have been known
to tread water for days.

517
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:51,989
- This isn't funny!
- <i>Oh, you're right. It's terrifying.</i>

518
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:54,329
You're all alone.

519
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:57,131
You can't see anything
but water...

520
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:59,865
and you start thinking about
what might be down there...

521
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:02,999
<i>whatjust bumped you</i>
<i>below the suryace.</i>

522
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:06,705
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>your nerves will settle down.</i>

523
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,546
<i>But, unfortunately,</i>
<i>that's when your body starts to ache...</i>

524
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:13,814
and the only way to stop the pain...

525
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,355
is to stop treading.

526
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:19,358
<i>But then you start to sink.</i>

527
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,520
<i>And in that instant</i>
<i>between life and death...</i>

528
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:26,531
<i>you think about all the people</i>
<i>and all the things you left behind.</i>

529
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,397
<i>So you start fighting your way</i>
<i>back to the suryace.</i>

530
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,869
You fight for your life.

531
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:34,668
- You can't leave me here!
- <i>Sure, I can.</i>

532
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,335
Just like you left Tom King.

533
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:41,376
<i>No.!</i>

534
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:48,216
No!
[Gasping]

535
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,353
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>
<i>There's something you have to see.</i>

536
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:58,291
What's this?

537
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,491
<i>[Javi]</i>
<i>It's the truth, sir.</i>

538
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:07,368
[Jarod]
Rescue Unit 45 to Base.

539
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,807
Requesting pickup near
D.F. buoy number 29.

540
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:15,974
But take your time getting there.
Just a little floating debris.

541
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:25,657
[Miss Parker]
There he is!

542
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:54,312
[Sydney]
Hello, Jarod!

543
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,514
Hello, Sydney!

544
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,023
[Miss Parker]
Give that to me!

545
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:00,957
There's nowhere to go this time!

546
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:05,487
Sydney raised me to believe
my mind can take me anywhere!

547
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:24,112
[Engines Stall]

548
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,994
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>He's out of fuel.</i>

549
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:40,897
Like I told you, Sydney.
The smart ones always do something stupid.

550
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,194
Get him.

551
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:56,907
- <i>[Sydney] He's not there?</i>
- <i>How?</i>

552
00:41:56,983 --> 00:42:01,283
I don't know.
But he left you this.

553
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:14,124
<i>[Opera]</i>

554
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:21,399
- Hiya, Roy!
- Jarod?

555
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:23,999
Nice day for a swim!

556
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:46,732
[Inaudible]

557
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:37,949
[Clattering]

558
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:39,814
- What's that, Sydney?
- I don't know.

559
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:43,652
[Woman] No! No!
[Screaming, Sobbing]

560
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:46,214
- They're trying to hurt her!
- Stay here, Jarod.

561
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,192
- No!
- [Man] Get her out of the elevator!

562
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:50,786
- <i>[Young Jarod] Stop it.!</i>
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>

563
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:52,888
- [Man] Get the kid out of here!
- Stop!

564
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:56,492
<i>[Gunfire]</i>

565
00:43:56,569 --> 00:44:00,562
- [Girl Screaming] Mama!
- No, keep her back! Keep her back!

566
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,007
- [Young Jarod] Leave me alone!
- <i>No.! Mama.!</i>

567
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,669
[Sobbing]

568
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,544
It's me.

569
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:47,814
I wanna know what
really happened to my mom.

570
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:02,324
- Thanks, Roy.
- It ain't nothin'.

571
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:08,135
Magdeline's out there somewhere.

572
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,141
What are you gonna do?

573
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,200
I think I'll take a walk.

574
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:23,215
Thank you.
How about you?

575
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,314
I think I'll take a drive.

576
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:28,551
<i>[Cheering]</i>

577
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:35,196
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.!</i>

578
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:40,071
Okay, Jarod, you're set.

579
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:12,465
