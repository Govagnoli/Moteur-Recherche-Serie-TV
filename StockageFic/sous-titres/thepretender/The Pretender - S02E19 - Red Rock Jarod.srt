1
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:46,136
How strong are you?

2
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,173
Test me.

3
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,212
You have mail.

4
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,013
''Refuge''

5
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:35,952
''Have urgent information concerning your past, present and future.
Please Meet me in DRY RIVER, ARIZONA.
Sydney''

6
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:46,653
''Welcome to
DRY RIVER
a friendly little town''

7
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:21,854
Morning.

8
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,419
I'm new in town and I was supposed to meet a friend.

9
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,655
I was wondering if you gentlemen might have seen him.

10
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,056
Look, I don't mean to interupt your game,

11
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:35,981
but it would be nice if you at least look at me.

12
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:39,298
They cannot hear you.

13
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:41,899
Excuse me?

14
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,717
Those are the Mitchell brothers.

15
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,118
They are deaf as posts.

16
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,013
- They said ...
- So it looks like it's going to be another hot day.

17
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:02,656
You speak sign language?

18
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,574
- Deputy Miller.
- Jarod...

19
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:14,494
Barber.

20
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:18,022
We don't get many visitors to Dry River, Mr. Barber.

21
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,096
What brings you to town?

22
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,214
Actually I'm here to meet a friend.

23
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,319
Maybe you've seen him.

24
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,420
He is fifty something, distinguished looking...

25
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:27,221
- Distinguished?
- Um.

26
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,662
I would remember him, wouldn't I?

27
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,531
I think I've probably taken up enough of your time, deputy.

28
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:44,259
- Have a nice day.
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stick around a little while longer.

29
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Excuse me.

30
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,092
You're goint to come with me, sir.

31
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:48,862
And why would I want to do that?

32
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:52,976
Because if you don't,

33
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm going to have to kill you.

34
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,041
There are pretenders among us.

35
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,252
I was taken from my family.

36
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:05,019
Thirty-Six Hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

37
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:08,217
How many people died because of what I thought up?

38
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:11,476
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

39
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:12,896
He is a pretender.

40
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:16,537
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

41
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:19,140
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

42
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,062
He defends the weak and the abused.

43
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,492
Life is a gift.

44
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,493
THE PRETENDER

Red Rock Jarod

46
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:32,095
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

47
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,577
You are a doctor?

48
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:35,818
I am, today.

49
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,419
''Dead End''

50
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,134
So much for anonymous tips about Jarod.

51
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,942
The guy said that we would find what we wanted right here.

52
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:54,422
If we were looking for a urban blight and the the overwhelming stench of urine,

53
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,176
he was right on the money.

54
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,821
You think we're being led astray?

55
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:00,582
Thank you, Sherlock.

56
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:04,132
The pink?

57
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,993
Oh, I let Debbie do the larudry.

58
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,392
She kind of got the colours mixed with the whites.

59
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,493
And I don¡¯t want to hurt her feelings.

60
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,898
Don¡¯t let her cut the grass.

61
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,035
I want a team to sweap the area.

62
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:18,473
I want everything within a fifty-foot radius brought back to the Centre.

63
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,674
Miss Parker.

64
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:22,858
There are something here you should see.

65
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,259
Miss Parker.

66
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,292
Parker, you alright?

67
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:44,654
Your mother¡¯s identification card,

68
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,332
and the expiration date has been changed.

69
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:51,536
It seems Jarod has cultivated a darker sense of humour since we last spoke.

70
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,812
Did I miss something?

71
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,900
The new expiration date.

72
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,823
That¡¯s the same day her mother was killed.

73
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,015
Everyone who¡¯s arrested has the privilege of making one phone call.

74
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,897
You¡¯re not under arrest. You¡¯re being detained for questioning.

75
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:12,013
About what?

76
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:15,693
Sheriff Delmont will explain it all to you when he gets back.

77
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,299
This is crazy.

78
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,732
Just go with the flow

79
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,741
and nobody will get hurt.

80
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:26,212
Miss Miller, come quick. It is J.R.

81
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,902
J.R.? What happened?

82
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:30,219
We were tossing around a football by the church and he just passed out.

83
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,978
- Well, go get Dr. Kraner.
- He¡¯s gone to Tucson for the day.

84
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,752
We got JR inside the church, but he¡¯s out cold.

85
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,296
I have some medical training.

86
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,139
This is my son we are talking about.

87
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,022
I can help.

88
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:52,723
J.R.

89
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,537
You kids get back. Get back.

90
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:55,858
J.R. honey!

91
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,735
Sweetie, can ou hear me?

92
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:58,998
- J.R.
- He is in shock.

93
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,934
- He¡¯s still breathing.
- He is hypoglycemic.

94
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:04,617
When was the last time he ate?

95
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:07,858
Oh, he had cereals for breakfast 3 or 4 hours ago.

96
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:09,019
Only water since he was here.

97
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,533
Is he going to be okay?

98
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,434
J.R.

99
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:13,892
Come on, honey!

100
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,476
What do you think you¡¯re doing? ?

101
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,092
I need to stabilize his blood sugar.

102
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,042
I¡¯ll stick this in your mouth. I want you to let it dissolve, okay?

103
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:26,300
Good boy.

104
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:34,801
Mum.

105
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,178
It's ok, honey.

106
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,779
It's ok.

107
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:43,013
Everything is going to be ok.

108
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,531
How is he feeling?

109
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:58,578
Better.

110
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:01,292
He has a heart condition.

111
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,783
I noticed the bluish tint to his fingertips and his lips.

112
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,558
I would say, by the looks of it, it¡¯s congenital.

113
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,422
You have a very sick boy.

114
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,618
Are you a doctor?

115
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,053
Not at the moment.

116
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:20,098
Why hasn¡¯t he had a heart transplant?

117
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,213
Because he's on the waiting list.

118
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:31,343
Because he has AB negative blood, which is very rare.

119
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,660
It only happens in certain families.

120
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,296
One in three hundred thousand.

121
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,338
I know.

122
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,536
I have it too.

123
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,417
This is the guy?

124
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:55,102
- ''Message received.
Will meet in DRY RIVER as requested. Hopes remain high.
Jarod''
- I may have found Jarod. I received this email from him today.

125
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,461
And you said you didn't send this ''refuge'' message to Jarod?

126
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,699
If I had, would I be showing it to you?

127
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:03,938
That's a good point.

128
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:07,856
What is this Dry River place, anyway?

129
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:11,692
According to the computer, there is a Dry River in Southwest Arizona.

130
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,473
This is Parker. Have the jet prepared.

131
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:23,099
Well, get it out of the Hangar.

132
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,818
- Forget it! Just book me a seat on the next commercial flight to...
- To Phoenix.

133
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,852
Phoenix, and I¡¯ll pick up the ticket at the gate.

134
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,377
Uh, you¡¯re going alone?

135
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:34,435
I'm a big girl, Broots.

136
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,536
Have this stuff analysed by Cousin It.

137
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,300
Angelo.

138
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:38,798
I don¡¯t like dead ends, Sydney,

139
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:40,799
especially when they concern my mother.

140
00:09:58,383 --> 00:09:59,213
Hold this.

141
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:03,239
Then he helped J.R. back to the squad car, and we brought him back here.

142
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:04,372
A touching story.

143
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:08,099
Sheriff, he had every opportunity to escape,

144
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,941
but he didn¡¯t even think about running.

145
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:13,216
- What's your point?
- He helped save my son.

146
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,494
Surely there is another way we can handle this.

147
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:17,540
There's not.

148
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,654
You did a decent thing for the boy and I¡¯m grateful.

149
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:36,574
But if you give me one second of trouble, I¡¯m going to shoot you dead.

150
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,218
You understand me?

151
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,099
Completely.

152
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,102
Well, let's go.

153
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:49,903
''Dry River''

154
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,574
It¡¯s a lucky thing I showed up here today.

155
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,882
Your deputy has a pretty sick boy on her hands.

156
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:57,936
He could have died.

157
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:04,493
It must be difficult, watching someone you love suffer like that.

158
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:08,675
What about you,sheriff?

159
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:11,338
You have any family?

160
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:14,456
I think it¡¯s going to be a whole lot easier if you and I don¡¯t get to know each other.

161
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,741
Get out. Let's go.

162
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:45,692
Go straight.

163
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,938
Move! Go right over there.

164
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:55,779
Stay there.

165
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,580
Let's go.

166
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,381
Go on.

167
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:32,780
- Somebody cut themselves?
- Sit down over there.

168
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,318
Look, it¡¯s pretty obvious by the way I¡¯ve been treated that something terrible has happened.

169
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:38,692
Why don¡¯t you tell me what it is?

170
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:40,211
- I cann't.
- Why not?

171
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,096
Because I won¡¯t let him.

172
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:46,860
Lyle.

173
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,821
Gone but not forgotten.

174
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:07,854
And so it begins.

175
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,694
This is all the stuff brought in from the dead end street.

176
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,060
You think he'll be able to help?

177
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,814
Empaths possess such fine-tuned instincts, Broots,

178
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,778
they can¡¯t be hurried.

179
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,779
Or discouraged.

180
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,178
Or grossed out apparently.

181
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:36,017
I think Jarod believes the initial refuge signal to be authentic.

182
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:39,097
Add to that the phoney tip on his recent whereabouts,

183
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,261
it becomes clear that someone has lured him to Arizona.

184
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:49,300
- Jarod could be in serious trouble.
- I believe yes.

185
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,091
The question is from whom?

186
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:54,941
Angelo, could you give it a rest already?

187
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:56,178
Wait.

188
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:09,572
He cann't pick it up.

189
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:10,978
Why?

190
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,333
The person Angelo is empathing

191
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,219
doesn't have a thumb.

192
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,898
How long have I been out?

193
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:35,452
A couple of hours.

194
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,815
Oh, that¡¯ll be a good one.

195
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:39,138
You sent the message.

196
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,061
You really are a genius.

197
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,496
How did you find out about refuge?

198
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,492
You forget. Before I found myself thumbless in the desert

199
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,774
I was head rat at the cheese factory.

200
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:52,862
You may have taken off with the DSAs,

201
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,340
but I had access to surveillance videos of every conversation you and Sydney ever had.

202
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,976
I wish you could have seen your face when you first saw me.

203
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,018
It was priceless.

204
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,616
Thumb looks pretty bad.

205
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:12,333
If you don¡¯t take care of it, you could lose the whole hand.

206
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,578
It¡¯ll be fine.

207
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:17,614
You seem to have captured loyal support from the locals.

208
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:19,018
Sheriff Delmont?

209
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:22,613
Afraid his involvement has less to do with loyalty than it does survival.

210
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:23,699
I don¡¯t follow.

211
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,941
My first acquisition after arriving in this little oasis

212
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:30,260
was securing some leverage in the form of Mrs. Delmont.

213
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:39,778
You kidnapped his wife?

214
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:43,140
And buried her in the desert.

215
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,539
She¡¯s currently being fed oxygen

216
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:49,383
supplied by a five horsepower gas generator,

217
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,939
which with an adapted fuel capacity of fifteen gallons

218
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,540
- should run for about...
- Sixteen hours

219
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,441
Sixteen...

220
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,098
Give or take a few minutes.

221
00:15:58,823 --> 00:15:59,812
When I check my watch,

222
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:04,619
she should have life support remaining in the area of seven hours and twenty minutes.

223
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,821
You¡¯ll appreciate this:

224
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,502
she¡¯s pregnant.

225
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,059
I guess about six months.

226
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:20,535
So you see, our good Sheriff is in no position to be anything but cooperative.

227
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:21,779
You are insane.

228
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:26,415
Psychological diagnosis can be really subjective.

229
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:29,938
- What do you want?
- Isn¡¯t it obvious?

230
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,142
I want everything.

231
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,836
- What?
- Lyle is alive.

232
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:54,112
- What did you say?
- Angelo had a severe reaction to one of the objects brought in from the dead end street.

233
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,818
I¡¯m certain Lyle is behind all of this.

234
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,034
We¡¯ve been over this, Sydney.

235
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,135
Lyle is dead. I shot him point blank in the chest.

236
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,902
Think about it.

237
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:03,603
Sydney.

238
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,839
You were there, do you remember?

239
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
When they pulled his body from the river?

240
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:11,259
It was never positively identified, Parker.

241
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,412
Lyle faked his death as a teenager.

242
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,013
He just did it again!

243
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:20,214
Parker?

244
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:24,415
Parker?

245
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:43,501
Look, you got what you wanted.

246
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:45,002
Let the woman go.

247
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:48,217
Not until I finalize negotiations.

248
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:49,418
Negotiations?

249
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:53,173
The Triumvirate is preparing to meet to choose my permanent replacement.

250
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:56,375
I intend to make that vote unnecessary.

251
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,775
Look, where¡¯s a clip-on tie when you need one?

252
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:04,454
You really think that the Centre¡¯s going to let you just walk right in there like nothing¡¯s happened?

253
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,416
I bring back their Golden Boy

254
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,295
and it¡¯s business as usual.

255
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,693
Cos there¡¯ll have to be changes made, obstacles removed.

256
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,052
Like Sydney and Miss Parker?

257
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:16,378
Among others.

258
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,095
How long do you think it¡¯s going to be before someone decides to remove you?

259
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:25,658
Nothing¡¯s forever.

260
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:29,581
However there is a way that we can assure our power base.

261
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:33,699
We?

262
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,619
With your brains and my leadership skills

263
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,820
there isn¡¯t anything we couldn¡¯t accomplish.

264
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,052
I could be your friend, Jarod.

265
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:46,096
Like you were my friend when you tried to stop my heart?

266
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:51,773
Why did you try to kill me?

267
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:56,774
Hey.

268
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:01,899
I just got a call from my deputy.

269
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,219
She says there¡¯s a tall, dark brunette woman

270
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:08,097
asking questions about someone named Jarod and a man with a missing thumb.

271
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,098
Parker.

272
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,341
And this was going so well.

273
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:12,419
Nothing is forever.

274
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:18,261
Well, if you ever want to see that wife of yours again, get rid of her.

275
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,058
Now.

276
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:25,300
I believe there are two very dangerous men here in Dry River.

277
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:26,757
You a cop?

278
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,692
I work for a private corporation.

279
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,496
We¡¯ve been tracking these men for some time.

280
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:31,962
Have you seen them?

281
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:38,775
Those people dead?

282
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,576
Murdered. Execution style.

283
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:45,256
And that one?

284
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:46,257
Jarod.

285
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,013
He has a history of mental illness.

286
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,622
I¡¯ve been instructed by his family to bring him home.

287
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:52,059
I haven¡¯t seen him.

288
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:54,195
Sheriff, my information is certain.

289
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,912
Dry River¡¯s a small town, Madam.

290
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,602
I¡¯m sorry but I can¡¯t help you.

291
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,696
Everything alright?

292
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:02,442
Oh, everything¡¯s fine, J.R.

293
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,843
- Hello.
- Hello.

294
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:06,094
How are you doing, buddy?

295
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:07,372
I¡¯m tired.

296
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:08,818
That¡¯s why you need to rest.

297
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,092
Come on, I¡¯ll make you something to eat.

298
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,698
Nice kid.

299
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,262
What¡¯s the matter with him anyway?

300
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:21,217
He¡¯s dying.

301
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:29,698
We have to call somebody.

302
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:31,257
- Who?
- The FBI, the State police...

303
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,898
To accomplish what? Have you seen this picture?!

304
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,981
The man is a cold-blooded killer! He¡¯s got my wife buried in the desert!

305
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:38,093
Yeah, but we can¡¯t just stand here...

306
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:40,692
He¡¯s a psycho. If he even thinks that I¡¯m crossing him,

307
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,575
Lyn and the baby are dead.

308
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,034
This really doesn¡¯t surprise me.

309
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:15,212
What¡¯s that?

310
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,871
This rising from the dead game you keep playing.

311
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,099
You pulled the same scam in high school.

312
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,853
Only back then you got really creative:

313
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:26,215
you murdered your best friend

314
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:29,059
and then you set your own father up to take the fall.

315
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:30,613
What do you know about my father?

316
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,814
I know that he¡¯s rotting in a jail cell,

317
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:35,412
serving a life sentence for a crime you committed.

318
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,012
He got what he deserved.

319
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:38,737
What about your mum?

320
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,419
Did she deserve what she got?

321
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,513
Did I tell you I went to visit her?

322
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,779
Very nice lady, only she seemed a touch confused.

323
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:51,500
Seemed she was trying to feed a couple of dogs that didn¡¯t really exist.

324
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:54,479
You should not have gone there.

325
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
She kept your bedroom just the way you left it.

326
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,380
It¡¯s all very cosy...

327
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,537
One more word and you die.

328
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:07,261
If you kill me here, you¡¯ll have nothing to bargain with.

329
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,258
Which brings us to step two of the process.

330
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:27,902
Look, I hate to throw a wrench in your plans,

331
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,172
but it¡¯s against the law to impersonate a doctor.

332
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:33,031
Now that¡¯s funny.

333
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:36,378
See I¡¯m going to need something more substantial than photographs

334
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,799
to demonstrate my resolve to the Triumvirate.

335
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,221
An offering, if you will.

336
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:41,922
Offering?

337
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,811
You should consider yourself fortunate.

338
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,775
You¡¯ll be asleep when I cut off your thumb.

339
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:52,576
No!

340
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:07,877
Miss Parker?

341
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:09,941
She¡¯s gone.

342
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:12,742
She showed me a picture of you with a bunch of murdered people.

343
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:14,292
Casualties of war.

344
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:20,971
- Is there something else?
- I want my wife back!

345
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,380
You said when you had what you wanted you¡¯d let her go.

346
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,718
Have you ever seen a human being suffocate?

347
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,233
It¡¯s not an easy way to die.

348
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:37,158
Now your family has slightly less than three hours of life remaining.

349
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,474
Unless of course you want to arrest me?

350
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,377
Miss Parker!

351
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,580
- She followed me.
- Get rid of her!

352
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,218
Now!

353
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,719
This is private property. Wow!

354
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,020
Sheriff.

355
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,821
I know they¡¯re here.

356
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:29,134
Like I said before, Miss Parker, I don¡¯t know what you¡¯re talking about.

357
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:31,573
Then how did you know my name? I never mentioned it.

358
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:35,852
I don¡¯t know what he¡¯s holding over your head Sheriff, but trust me.

359
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,974
It will not end well for anyone.

360
00:24:38,263 --> 00:24:40,493
I can help you, if you¡¯d just let me.

361
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:47,275
I wish I could do that.

362
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:49,822
You¡¯re under arrest for trespassing.

363
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:57,242
Hand over the weapon.

364
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:34,202
Please.

365
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:36,903
Don¡¯t do this.

366
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,914
Don¡¯t fight the medication.

367
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:48,316
There¡¯s nothing you can do to stop it now.

368
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:53,618
Please.

369
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,718
No.

370
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:14,733
- They said you were dead.
- Not hardly.

371
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:18,979
They said you were dead.

372
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:27,340
Not hardly, big brother.

373
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,618
Sydney, this was just delivered for you.

374
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:35,938
Who is it from?

375
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:37,859
Receiving. What is it?

376
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,217
What's this?

377
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,052
Who could have taken these?

378
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:51,753
I decide who lives or dies.

379
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,331
I decide who lives or dies...

380
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:05,232
I decide who lives or dies...

381
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,538
Kyle.

382
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,540
Jarod¡¯s brother¡¯s alive too?

383
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:11,000
Man, this is turning into the Night of the Living Dead.

384
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:11,816
Hi, this is Sydney.

385
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:15,217
I need seats on the next flight out to Arizona,

386
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:19,252
and get the Centre helicopter ready for immediate takeoff from Phoenix.

387
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:25,253
I decide who lives or dies!

388
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:28,854
I decide who lives or dies.

389
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,874
I thought you¡¯d never wake up.

390
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:56,675
Kyle?

391
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,582
I thought you were dead!

392
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:07,182
Yeah, that was the idea.

393
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,441
I saw you in the van.

394
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,342
I saw it explode.

395
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:19,058
You saw the van explode but I wasn¡¯t inside.

396
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:22,733
When you escaped I was able to crawl out

397
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,615
and fire a shot into the fuel tank.

398
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,815
My leg was injured so I made my way up to the highway and caught a ride out.

399
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:29,412
How did you find me?

400
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,856
I¡¯ve been following Parker and the others for months, hoping they would lead me back to you.

401
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:36,734
My thumb, and the rest of me, is glad you did.

402
00:28:37,623 --> 00:28:41,362
Jarod, have you learned anything else about our parents?

403
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:49,135
Sydney gave me this.

404
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,173
His brother gave it to him before he died.

405
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:54,298
Our father¡¯s name?

406
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,572
I don¡¯t know.

407
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,657
I can¡¯t believe... Where have you been?

408
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:01,278
In the shadows,

409
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:03,479
waiting,

410
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,880
watching.

411
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,213
Now that we¡¯re together again I can finish this.

412
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:10,199
Finish what?

413
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:15,400
I sent a package of photographs that¡¯ll bring the others here soon.

414
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:18,859
It¡¯s almost over, brother.

415
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:21,161
We¡¯ll start with Lyle.

416
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:29,317
Kyle, what happened to him?

417
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,259
He tripped and hit his head.

418
00:29:33,383 --> 00:29:34,577
We have less than an hour.

419
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,216
What are you talking about?

420
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:40,133
Lyle kidnapped a woman and buried her alive somewhere out in the desert.

421
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:42,334
We have less than an hour before her air supply runs out.

422
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:44,295
Jarod, we can¡¯t leave now.

423
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,699
This is our chance to end this once and for all.

424
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,157
We¡¯ll start with him.

425
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:49,718
Did you hear what I said?

426
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:53,415
There is a woman and her unborn baby buried alive somewhere out in the desert

427
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:55,341
and if we work together, we can save their lives.

428
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:57,718
Lyle and the others deserve to die.

429
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:01,434
And if they do? What chance do we ever have of finding our parents?

430
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:06,171
Look, I know you¡¯re angry, but there¡¯s more important things in life than vengeance.

431
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,340
Let me show you how good it feels to save a life

432
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,353
instead of trying to destroy one.

433
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:17,654
Kyle!

434
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,259
We¡¯ll need to know where they buried her, right?

435
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:23,658
Relax, brother.

436
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,555
This is what I do.

437
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:38,616
Hope you like meat loaf.

438
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:40,275
I live for it.

439
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,501
The sheriff said your son is sick.

440
00:30:49,463 --> 00:30:51,181
He has a heart condition, yes.

441
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:52,738
I am sorry.

442
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:55,854
He seemed like a really nice young man.

443
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:57,874
Yes, he is.

444
00:30:58,175 --> 00:30:59,175
You have to let me out.

445
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:02,017
I told you I can¡¯t do that.

446
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:07,696
You know my mother died when I was almost your son¡¯s age,

447
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:11,539
and I know how hard it is to lose someone that you care about.

448
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:17,421
That¡¯s why I promise you that the sheriff and anyone else Lyle has involved in this mess will die

449
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:20,202
unless I walk out of here.

450
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,421
- You don¡¯t understand.
- I understand perfectly, Deputy.

451
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:26,661
I think that you need to get out there and take another good look at those pictures

452
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:29,735
because that is exactly what will happen unless you prevent it.

453
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,493
- You don¡¯t know what he wants...
- What?!

454
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:37,394
What?

455
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:43,736
He¡¯s got the sheriff¡¯s wife buried alive out in the desert.

456
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:51,381
Then we don¡¯t have much time, do we?

457
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:07,337
We must be close to the place.

458
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:08,772
Kill the motors.

459
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,821
There¡¯s a generator.

460
00:32:17,063 --> 00:32:18,382
It¡¯s coming from just over that rise.

461
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:19,783
Come on!

462
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:23,453
Down there!

463
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:27,732
There it is!

464
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,061
It¡¯s out of fuel. Hurry!

465
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:31,937
Find the feeding tube.

466
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:33,418
Got it!

467
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:36,778
Dig!

468
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,497
- It¡¯s sealed tight.
- Watch it.

469
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,291
Hurry, there can¡¯t be much air left in there!

470
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,392
Ok, that's ok. It's ok.

471
00:33:28,063 --> 00:33:29,974
It¡¯s okay, you¡¯re safe now.

472
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:32,817
You¡¯re safe now.

473
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,994
Going somewhere, Lyle?

474
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:39,595
Miss Parker.

475
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:41,131
How nice to see you again.

476
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:42,956
I wish I could say the same.

477
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:44,557
What happened to you?

478
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,859
Jarod¡¯s little brother wanted some information.

479
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,057
Kyle is here?

480
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,294
We negotiated. I lost.

481
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,459
Doesn¡¯t anybody ever really die any more?

482
00:34:58,423 --> 00:34:59,981
You left that envelope on that sign.

483
00:35:00,943 --> 00:35:01,898
What gave me away?

484
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,978
Jarod¡¯s a pain in the ass but he¡¯s not heartless.

485
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:09,459
That¡¯s for my mother,

486
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:10,539
and this is for me.

487
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,653
God, you¡¯re beautiful when you¡¯re angry.

488
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,654
- Oh, my god.
- Oh Carl!

489
00:35:47,743 --> 00:35:48,858
Are you alright?

490
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:52,995
I was so scared.

491
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,722
- Where is he?
-We left him chained up at the compound.

492
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:05,502
I¡¯m going to sit you down.

493
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,460
It¡¯s going to be alright now, okay?

494
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:15,536
- What are you going to do?
- What do you think?

495
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:16,378
Sheriff wait.

496
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:17,979
Let us handle it.

497
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,580
The man almost killed my family.

498
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,292
Which is exactly why you need to get your wife and baby to a hospital

499
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,141
and make sure they¡¯re ok.

500
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:27,342
No.

501
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:33,532
Now you boys be careful.

502
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,812
Don¡¯t worry Sheriff. I¡¯m no hero.

503
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:49,538
The Sheriff said the Foundry¡¯s on the edge of town.

504
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:56,573
- He¡¯s not in the trailer.
- He¡¯s not anywhere in the building.

505
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,452
He¡¯s gone.

506
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,098
Which means he¡¯s out there.

507
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,138
Somewhere.

508
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:05,353
Let¡¯s head back to the hospital.

509
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:07,554
I want to see how the sheriff¡¯s wife is doing.

510
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:10,041
You were right, you know.

511
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:12,651
About what?

512
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,153
About how it feels to help someone.

513
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:19,179
When that woman grabbed me after I saved her life and thanked me,

514
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,934
it was like nothing I¡¯d ever felt before.

515
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:25,933
I¡¯ve been angry for so long, so full of rage and revenge

516
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:29,957
I¡¯d forgotten what it was like to care about someone.

517
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:33,278
That¡¯s all going to change.

518
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,379
Now that we¡¯re together.

519
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:37,598
And I promise.

520
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,299
Come on, let¡¯s go.

521
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,982
Oh, this is beautiful!

522
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,814
It¡¯s just one big happy family, isn¡¯t it?!

523
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,980
It¡¯s the end of the line, Lyle.

524
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,256
There¡¯s no place left for you to run.

525
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:49,518
I¡¯m disappointed in you, Jarod.

526
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:50,819
You know me better than that.

527
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:54,273
If there¡¯s one thing I don¡¯t do easy ¨C it¡¯s die.

528
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,018
Drop the cannon, Kid.

529
00:37:57,623 --> 00:37:59,375
- Shoot him you moron!
- Shut up!

530
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,454
Stay back,

531
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,859
or I put a very large hole in big brother.

532
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,760
Kyle.

533
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:11,172
Threats and pain

534
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:12,878
that¡¯s all you¡¯ve ever offered us.

535
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,579
You stole our lives and you killed our spirit, now you think you can threaten us with death?

536
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,142
It doesn¡¯t matter, Lyle.

537
00:38:19,743 --> 00:38:22,018
because we never made a difference anyway.

538
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:23,338
I¡¯ll kill him.

539
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:25,016
I swear I will.

540
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,577
And then I¡¯ll kill you.

541
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:33,582
Don¡¯t do this, Kyle.

542
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,058
By the way, Lyle,

543
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:41,618
how¡¯s that knife wound?

544
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:16,762
You stay with me little brother.

545
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:18,463
I¡¯m gonna get you to a hospital.

546
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:22,779
It's too late, Jarod.

547
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:24,980
Don¡¯t you say that.

548
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:27,358
Look at me!

549
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:31,577
Come on, just think...

550
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:34,418
think about all the good times we¡¯re going to have together.

551
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:39,096
I'm sorry, Jarod.

552
00:39:39,823 --> 00:39:40,697
For what?

553
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,941
For everything.

554
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:57,942
No.

555
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:36,781
It¡¯s time to come home now, Jarod.

556
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:40,339
Where is Lyle?

557
00:40:44,823 --> 00:40:45,778
We¡¯ll find him.

558
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:49,102
Right, nobody move!

559
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:57,340
Mister, I don¡¯t know who you are but I figure I owe you at least one

560
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,002
get-out-of-jail-free card.

561
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:00,116
There are two of us Sheriff.

562
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,417
What¡¯s to say we won¡¯t shoot you right now?

563
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:05,635
Well, mostly because this is a ten gauge pump action shotgun

564
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:08,020
that will pretty much cut anything in half that it¡¯s aimed at

565
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:09,531
and right now it¡¯s aimed at you lady!

566
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:06,832
Jaord.

567
00:42:09,943 --> 00:42:10,892
I¡¯m sorry.

568
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:13,017
Where will you be taking him?

569
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:18,417
Some place where he can make a difference.

00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:57,818
''Trauma team to ICU on six west...''

571
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:06,616

- Just fine.

572
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:09,892
The new heart is functioning on its own and barring complications

573
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:12,215
your boy should live a long and happy life.

574
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,816
Oh, thank you.

575
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:17,198
It was a stroke of luck really to find a donor to match your son¡¯s blood type.

576
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:22,656
Whoever that donor was, he¡¯s a Godsend.

577
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:26,299
I don¡¯t know about that, Doc, but he was a hero.

579
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:46,135

Good for you.
