00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,740
Previous scene on the pretender:

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,830
I tell you that all the weirdness around here is courtesy of Mr Skin Grafts himself.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,830
- The place has been different ever since¡­
- Since Raines was shot.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,870
- I'm no marksman.
- I didn't even want to take a gun, remember?

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,780
If I'd shot sterno head he would be snoring through dirt right now

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,290
instead of filling bed-pans in The Centre's burn unit.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,140
The Centre cut you out of the loop this time.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,990
Good thing they sent a replacement.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,070
-What are you talking about Jarod?
- I'm talking about the blonde.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,070
Any progress locating your missing father?

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,300
Who says he's missing?

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,060
It's time to come home Jarod.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,260
Take my hand.

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,540
I can't reach you Mum.

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,180
Try.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,950
You can do it.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,300
Mum!

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,870
Mum, don't go.

19
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,471
Mum, Mum

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,940
Don't go.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,540
This is where Jarod spent most of his time

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,320
while he stayed with us.

23
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,620
In a tepee?

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,230
Yeah. But no, this is a sensory deprivation tank.

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm surprised he'd get near one of these things again.

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,180
But Jarod enjoyed floating in the tank.

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,700
It gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved.

28
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,710
Most people go in the tank for an hour at a time.

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,990
Jarod, Jarod would stay in for days at a time.

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,280
And then he'd come out and go around hugging everyone he saw.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,510
I never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life.

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,620
Maybe if you showered once in a while the experience wouldn't be quite so unique.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,540
Did Jarod leave anything behind?

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,940
He said to give you this.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,820
Thank you.

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,220
I have a gun and I'll use it.

37
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,300
Cool!

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,900
Let's go find the wonder boy.

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,980
Living in a tepee, somebody help me.

40
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,980
Help! Someone please help me.

41
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,981
Help me, please.

42
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,182
Ah...

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm coming.

44
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,681
Just hang on.

45
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,380
Jarod. Wait for the basket.

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,500
There's no time. This rope's not going to hold.

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,430
Roger, call the chopper now.

48
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,831
Ah...

49
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,430
Just hang on. More line.

50
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,260
Jarod what the hell are you doing? I said wait for the basket.

51
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,350
Sit tight. I've got you.

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,980
It's a great day to be alive.

53
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:30,281
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

54
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,282
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

55
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:42,283
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 3
Over The Edge

56
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,820
The word from the hospital is your victim is going to be fine.

57
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,060
Well that's great news.

58
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,380
And the word around here is that you're a player.

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,230
You should have seen him.

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,780
Instant legend, man.

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,820
You'd better watch out Bobby. Looks like there's a new Spiderman in town.

62
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,620
Yeah well we'll see who has the web.

63
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,780
-Spider man?
- Yeah! Like in the comics.

64
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,060
Hey, guys. Look, interstate brochures from Denver. Looks like he's serious.

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,540
Are you thinking of transferring out?

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,100
Retiring. Denver is where my grandson is.

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,030
Come on you guys. This is a good thing.

68
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,420
Makes room for the young guys moving up.

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,500
Okay. Pack and stack. We're due at the tower in thirty.

70
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,060
Oh man.

71
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,070
This is the third drill this week.

72
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,110
Get used to it. When Bobby makes captain he'll drill us 24/7.

73
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,160
You've got that right.

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,620
Jarod, everybody kicks in.

75
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,390
It's SOP.

76
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,091
It's sort of a ritual.

77
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,980
Every time we come back safe from a run

78
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,681
we drop in a fiver for Chris.

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,890
- He's the guy who fell from the drill tower?
- Just come out of coma.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,580
I thought the department insurance plan covered accidents.

81
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,320
It does cover accidents. But, ah...

82
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,441
Chris tried to kill himself.

83
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,910
Where have you guys been?

84
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,380
We've been to our own little corner of heaven.

85
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,940
Got you something.

86
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,541
Thanks.

87
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,060
You wouldn't believe what's going on around here.

88
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,830
I rarely do.

89
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,180
Any word on my father?

90
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,980
No. Noone knows where he is.

91
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,350
There's Princess Tryhard now.

92
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,720
We don't want to make accusations you can't prove.

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh, Please. Sydney you know what do yourself a favour.

94
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,230
Take some steroids.

95
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,870
Ever since she and Mr Lyle showed up this whole place has gotten strange.

96
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,260
Well it's just about to get stranger. There he is?

97
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,580
That's the guy.

98
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,700
Oh God! They're coming this way.

99
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,701
Oh, Miss Parker. Sydney. Mr. Broots.

100
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,120
This is Dr Curtis.

101
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,740
He's consulting for Mr Lyle and me.

102
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,060
Nice to meet you.

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,700
I'm sure.

104
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,710
If he needs to speak with you

105
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,820
We'd appreciate it if you made yourself available.

106
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,740
Certainly.

107
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,670
Cheers. Shall we?

108
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,571
Dortor.

109
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,420
- Who is he?
- That's what I've been trying tell you.

110
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,140
He's some kind of criminal behaviourist.

111
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,140
They brought him here to find who shot Mr Raines.

112
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,540
Oh God this is bad, this is really, really bad.

113
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,980
Relax Broots.

114
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,780
They're looking for a shooter not a whiner.

115
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,300
Yeah well they're going to pin the shooting on someone

116
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,580
And the way I figure we're the ones walking around with the biggest targets on our backs.

117
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,460
If you're innocent you have nothing to worry about.

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,340
Sydney this is the Centre.

119
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,590
Maybe no one will miss you but I have a little daughter who loves her daddy.

120
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,820
We don't even know if he will want to talk to us.

121
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,060
Fat chance.

122
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,700
I hear Mr Raines is going to force everyone who was at the shooting to interview with this guy.

123
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,660
And I mean everyone.

124
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,180
Peachie.

125
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,700
Move it! Come on Jarod! Your victim's had time to take in a double feature.

126
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:22,301
Go, go, go, go...

127
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,100
-Move it!
-Two minutes...

128
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:31,801
-2'1'', 2'2'', 2'3'', 2'4'', 2'5'', 2'6''
-Move it, here now, hold the way

129
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,420
2'7'', not bad.

130
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,270
Not good either not for a simple up and over.

131
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,620
Hey, Keep it down over there.

132
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm trying to think over here.

133
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh God we woke up the monster.

134
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,260
Who's that?

135
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,430
He likes to be called Spenser.

136
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,100
All he does is complain about the noise and write poetry.

137
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,030
Don't get him going. You'll have to buy him something.

138
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,470
- Is this where Chris tried to kill himself?

139
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,640
Roger found him right here.

140
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,620
You know I thought Chris and I could tell each other everything.

141
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,540
I knew he was depressed but he never said anything about suicide.

142
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,780
Maybe it wasn't?

143
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,380
He left a note on his computer.

144
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,180
You know I saw this happen in Chicago.

145
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,020
This guy, he got really depressed about the job

146
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,420
All the pressure.

147
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,380
Nah! It wasn't the job. Chris loved Rescue.

148
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,740
Well if it wasn't the job maybe it was his family.

149
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,230
His mother left when he was really little. She just walked out.

150
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,460
After his dad died a couple of years ago Chris started looking for her.

151
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,120
-He didn't find her?
-No.

152
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,980
But he felt she was close by.

153
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,390
He ran personal ads in the paper, searched the net, did everything he could think of.

154
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,620
He probably thought he would never find her,

155
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,630
That he would always have that feeling of empty

156
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,420
I can't imagine what it would be like never knowing your mother.

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,900
"USAR Member Attempts Suicide at Training Facility"

158
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,460
"Mom, Please call me, Chris (509) 555-0154"

159
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,820
"Grace Welman Where are you? Call Chris (509) 555-0154"

160
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,620
Chris, Chris, You need to be calm.

161
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,321
Chris, Chris, You need to calm down.

162
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,380
Calm now. Please.

163
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,940
Calm now, Please! Chris

164
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm sorry

165
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,300
This is a really bad time for visitors.

166
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,301
Chris, No. Come on, it's okay.

167
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,860
Chris, Chris. Calm down.

168
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,910
- Please could you come back later?
- It's not unusual

169
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,250
For a post coma to lose sense of time and location.

170
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,070
He's afraid.

171
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,260
He needs human contact. He needs to know that he's loved.

172
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,620
Are you a therapist?

173
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,860
I know what it's like to be isolated from people.

174
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,140
Jo-Ellen, come here.

175
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,020
Hold him.

176
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,500
Go ahead. He's still your friend. Hold him.

177
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:29,901
Chris, Chris, It's Jo-Ellen. Sh, Sh, it's alright.

178
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,040
It's okay, it's alright.

179
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,940
Let's go over this again

180
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,060
Because I want to get it straight.

181
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,070
He was a spider and a man.

182
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:01,071
No.

183
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,380
He was a high school student bitten by a radioactive spider.

184
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,500
That must hurt.

185
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,350
Then he developed spider powers.

186
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,660
He could climb up walls, shoot webs

187
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,620
And he had spider sense.

188
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,780
Which is?

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,350
I don't know. His head would tingle and stuff.

190
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,790
Oh well I wasn't aware that arachnids had heads that tingled.

191
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,470
I don't know from arachnids but Spiderman's did.

192
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,500
This is fascinating.

193
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,420
I'll read them all.

194
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,821
GRACE WELMAN WHERE ARE YOU? CALL CHRIS (509) 555-0154

195
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,790
Mrs Welman.

196
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,460
My name is Jarod.

197
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,940
I'm a friend of Chris.

198
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,860
Hi, You have the wrong person. My name's Carter.

199
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,900
I know it was before you were married.

200
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,390
- What do you want?
- It's not what I want

201
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,180
But what Chris wants.

202
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,460
He's been trying to find you.

203
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,020
Mrs. Welman, your son needs you.

204
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,790
I didn't ask to be needed

205
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,820
And I sure as well didn't ask to be found.

206
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,460
Mum. I love you.

207
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:11,561
I love you, Mum.

208
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:16,862
Mum, I love you.

209
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,380
Don't leave me mum.

210
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,481
Mum.

211
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,660
Mum, don't go!

212
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,561
Mum. mum, don't go!

213
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,062
Sydney.

214
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,780
Did your mother ever hug you?

215
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:55,381
Jarod.

216
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,980
It's important that you get in the tank.

217
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,820
What was it like to be hugged by your mother?

218
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,460
How does it feel?

219
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,470
That's not relevant.

220
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,980
Jarod the tank relaxes you. You can focus on the simulation.

221
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,420
I want to know what it's like to be hugged.

222
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,300
I've forgotten what it feels like.

223
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,270
Jarod, listen to me.

224
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,540
You will never have that experience.

225
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,980
Your mother is . . .

226
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,060
It will be best if you just forgot about her.

227
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,620
No. I'll never forget her. Never.

228
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,621
Jarod.

229
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,990
Dwelling on your family will only get in the way of your work.

230
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,060
Finding my family is my work, Sydney.

231
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,910
We're only trying to find out who had the capacity to shoot Mr Raines.

232
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,950
And I'm only here to help.

233
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,550
Look I realise this is a difficult position for you.

234
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,340
But it's just a waste of both of our times.

235
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,230
You never married did you?

236
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,180
You don't expect me to answer rhetorical questions?

237
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,381
No.

238
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,540
Tell me about your relationship with Jarod.

239
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,940
Why don't you tell me.

240
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,180
Alright.

241
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,980
I think he's taken the role of the son you never had.

242
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,260
What are your feelings for him?

243
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,500
You're doing so well. Don't stop now.

244
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,900
I think you love Jarod very much

245
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,580
I think you would almost do anything to protect him.

246
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,540
But I'm curious, off the record.

247
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,860
How do you live with yourself

248
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,390
Knowing that you abducted a child from his family?

249
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,020
I was not involved in Jarod's abduction.

250
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,460
But after it happened you did nothing about it.

251
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,180
You had no problem

252
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,580
No twinge of conscience

253
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,100
About robbing him of a chance to live a normal life?

254
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,940
I didn't have a choice.

255
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,180
Didn't you?

256
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,660
I had to do what I was told.

257
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,900
By whom?

258
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,070
The same person who tells you what to do.

259
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,500
Exactly.

260
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,550
So we both know that you hold Mr Raines personally

261
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,740
Responsible for the destruction of Jarod's life

262
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,620
And we also know that killing Raines

263
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,380
Would give you a deep sense of satisfaction. It's only human nature.

264
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,340
I abhor violence.

265
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,950
Well, but that doesn't mean

266
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,880
given a strong enough motivation,

267
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,780
that you wouldn't stoop to it.

268
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,240
I think we're done, Doctor.

269
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,940
Don't look so sad.

270
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,580
It's a comic book, man.

271
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,980
You know, comic, fun?

272
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,780
This Spider man, he's a fascinating superhero.

273
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,740
Yet beneath all these heroics he's lead a very sad life.

274
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,700
He never knew his parents, He feels responsible for his uncle's death

275
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,310
people are always trying to kill him.

276
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,740
Curse of the superhero. It's tragic really.

277
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,420
Peter Parker didn't have a real problem.

278
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,660
Now She-Hawk her life was tragic.

279
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm glad you guys are here.

280
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,820
Check your speed scores.

281
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,940
The condemned move faster to the gallows.

282
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,300
Looks like we're going to be in for more drilling.

283
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,800
You've got that right

284
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,540
Now Jarod you work with Roger Saturday morning

285
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,180
Jo-Ellen you and Bobby hit the tower in the afternoon.

286
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,500
Let me switch with Jarod. I have plans for Saturday.

287
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,740
Change em. There's no one faster with the rope than Bobby

288
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,130
that's where you need improvement.

289
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,990
And just think, you can sleep in on Saturday and get some extra beauty sleep

290
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,100
not that you need it.

291
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,780
No I'm serious Captain. Let me switch.

292
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm serious too. No.

293
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,580
Now come on we've got more sunshine to spread.

294
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,780
See you later.

295
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,180
What's Chris working with?

296
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,140
A bungie cord. It helps strengthen his muscles.

297
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,780
Very clever. A rubber band with hooks.

298
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,660
That's the concept.

299
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,780
What are his chances for recovery?

300
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,260
Too soon to say. But I'm an optimist.

301
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,390
He could regain a good portion of his cognitive and motor skills.

302
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,060
Has he been able to communicate anything about his fall?

303
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,461
No.

304
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,480
There has been some improvement with his

305
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,510
pre- and post- traumatic amnesia but still,

306
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,260
no indication that he has any memory of the accident.

307
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,180
There must have been some damage to his frontal lobe.

308
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,460
More than likely he never had time to encode the event into his long time memory.

309
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,140
You don't know about bungie cords

310
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,460
But you know about Deerling's theory on shock trauma.

311
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,140
I used to moonlight as a psychological re-constructionist.

312
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,060
And I read his file.

313
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,230
It says here that Chris landed on his back.

314
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,540
That's right.

315
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,180
The haematoma on his twelfth thoracic vertebrae would indicate

316
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,110
that he fell on something.

317
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,700
Paramedics didn't note it.

318
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,820
I would have expected his injuries to be more severe

319
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,430
a fall from four stories. It's usually fatal.

320
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,700
Were you a triage surgeon too?

321
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,260
Only until I became a rodeo clown.

322
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,661
No.

323
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:39,762
No. No...

324
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,680
Hey. I wanna hear something that

325
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,180
loud I'll stick a gun in my mouth.

326
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,180
Hey I'm sorry. I just fell off a building.

327
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,310
Hey, wait, Wait up. I want to talk to you for a second.

328
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,900
Don't you have anything better to do at 3am?

329
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,380
-It's 7am.
-Yup.

330
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,100
The noise pollution gets worse every day.

331
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,190
If you're so concerned about the noise

332
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,140
why don't you move into a shelter?

333
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,660
Hey, hey, A poet needs freedom to create.

334
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,161
This is freedom. haha...

335
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,861
-Wow
-Yeah

336
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,220
The only drawback is the noise.

337
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,970
It's forcing me toward Haiku.

338
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,340
Were you here writing your poetry the day that the man fell from the building?

339
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:38,041
Uh, Yeah. Yeah. You see

340
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,350
I was flowing a rhyme

341
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,820
when all of a sudden I heard somebody screaming "No No No Don't!"

342
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,750
kinda like you were doing. And then

343
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,180
and then Boom.

344
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,420
After a little while all hell broke loose.

345
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,510
Sirens, ambulances, cops.

346
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,220
I tell you my creativity was shot for the day.

347
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,060
I've seen the police report. There's no mention that you ever told the police what you heard.

348
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,310
No. No see, I didn't tell the cops. I told one of you rescue guys.

349
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,540
- Who?
- I do not know.

350
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,430
I mean, this guy, he, he came up

351
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,420
and he said sorry about the noise

352
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,460
Gave me twenty bucks and told me to get a hot meal.

353
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,340
and that, my friend, it's poetic.

354
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,860
What did he look like?

355
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,900
golden, gear and helmets and everything

356
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,620
all you guys look the same.

357
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,260
Hey, hey. You know what?

358
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,140
He had some sort of fancy money chip.

359
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,460
It had sort of like a, ah, a spider web design right in the middle.

360
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,780
Water melon, right?

361
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,700
Yeah. That's what we call them here on earth. Tonight's dessert.

362
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,940
Why are you banging them?

363
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,180
I'm not banging, I'm clumping.

364
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,030
How do you tell when watermelon's ripe?

365
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,620
I don't know. I've never eaten one.

366
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,830
Well Starman, you're definitely in for a treat. We're all chipping in

367
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,020
so you owe me five bucks.

368
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,621
Five bucks huh?

369
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,020
Actually I don't have any cash on me.

370
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,140
Come on man. Hey! Nobody gets out of paying.

371
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,380
What's the matter? Mummy didn't give you any lunch money today?

372
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,200
-Something like that. Can you cover me?
-Yeah.

373
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,100
- You will pay me back, right?
- Of course I will.

374
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,500
If we can't trust each other who can we trust?

375
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,220
Right.

376
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,820
I got word that you ah . . .

377
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,820
Come in.

378
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,700
Sit!

379
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,740
Cute kids.

380
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,940
I've been looking over your file.

381
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,260
There's a letter in here

382
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,700
from a Mrs Mosely.

383
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,630
What, my fourth grade teacher?

384
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,030
- How far back does that thing go?
- The letter is addressed to your mother.

385
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,670
Apparently Mrs Mosely was concerned for your safety at school.

386
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,220
Why was that?

387
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,700
You know how kids are, you know. They like to pick on the egg head.

388
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,260
Do you remember what it felt like to be picked on?

389
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,890
Yes I guess so,

390
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,391
when I think about it.

391
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,780
You're next.

392
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,100
So did you ever attempt to defend yourself against those bullies.

393
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,870
The bullies. No.

394
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,820
actually no, I learned how to outsmart them.

395
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,790
What about today?

396
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,550
How do you respond to people who pick on you today.

397
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,330
-No one bullies me 
-Really

398
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,050
I was under the impression that Miss Parker often teased your task.

399
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,550
She likes to tease me. Friends do that.

400
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,060
Oh so you two are friends?

401
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,700
Well, ah no, wait a minute, not, ah,

402
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,790
not exactly.

403
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:01,391
Let's go.

404
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,060
How does Mr Raines treat you?

405
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,061
Mr. Raines.

406
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,780
Always Um has treated me fairly

407
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,380
with great respect.

408
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,470
That's very interesting

409
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,260
because it says in here that you have been overheard disparaging him on more than one occasion.

410
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,300
That's . . . that's a flat out lie.

411
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,500
Who said that? I would like to know who said that.

412
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,460
That would be ah Mr Raines.

413
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,030
It must eat you up knowing that people

414
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,420
have picked on you your whole life, and you've always had to take it,

415
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,020
never getting to even the score.

416
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,670
How long will you let people demean

417
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,300
and belittle you until you finally say

418
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,580
"enough, it ends here"

419
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,740
- How much humiliation can you take?
- I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get inside my head

420
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,580
stir it up a bit

421
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,450
Well it's not going to work.

422
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,180
You, Let's go.

423
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,500
I want to stay here.

424
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,110
Hey, Hey you. Leave her alone!

425
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,980
What are they going to do with her.

426
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,350
What do you think they're going to do to her? Are they going to hurt her?

427
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,820
The way Mr Raines implied that he would do to your daughter.

428
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,660
Do you want to know the truth.

429
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,260
I'll give you the truth. If anyone was ever to hurt my daughter,

430
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,780
even tried to hurt my daughter I'd kill them.

431
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,500
I don't care who.

432
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,220
I'd kill them.

433
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,190
-Sydney
-How's the book?

434
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,710
I'm not sure how Judge Teale is going to wrap this one up.

435
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,780
How did you know?

436
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,340
You always used to sit down at your desk at eight p.m. with a good book.

437
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,020
- Does it still relax you??
- You know me too well.

438
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,020
I can hear birds in the background. It must still be light where you are.

439
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,990
You're getting very good at this.

440
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,820
I can also hear sadness in your voice.

441
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,820
I guess you know me too well.

442
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,640
I've been thinking about my mother lately.

443
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,900
What it's going to be like when we finally meet.

444
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,900
Go on.

445
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,700
How to say, It's just that we've been separated for so long.

446
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,470
Will she . . .

447
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,310
never mind.

448
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,660
Everyone wants to believe that their mother's love is absolute.

449
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,900
Sadly that's not always the case.

450
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,340
Did your mother love you?

451
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes, I believe she did,

452
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,700
but know this. If the mother rejects her offspring

453
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,390
rarely does the blame fall upon the child.

454
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,220
It is usually an indication

455
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,500
that the woman does not love herself.

456
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,201
Thank you, Sydney.

457
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,940
Hey! I told you to leave me alone.

458
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,220
This will help when the methadone doesn't.

459
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,710
You were at the free clinic getting your daily dose

460
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,660
but methadone it doesn't stop the craving for heroin it only replaces it.

461
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,060
That's why you still keep getting the sweats. Your body is screaming for relief.

462
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,740
Are you a junkie?

463
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,850
No but I was a congressional adviser on drug policy for a while.

464
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,500
Scout's honour.

465
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,700
This is arginine root. It's an organic herb. It has a great calming affect.

466
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,580
Friends of mine, they harvest it in Oregon.

467
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,020
Trust me it works.

468
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:37,221
Oh, Damn it.

469
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,100
Is this Chris?

470
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,380
Yes when he was eleven years old.

471
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,220
His poppa sent it to me at a halfway house.

472
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,980
It's hard to be carrying around a picture of someone that you're trying to forget.

473
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,540
I'm not trying to forget. It would just be better if we don't see each other.

474
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,420
Is that why you went to the hospital?

475
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,900
I checked the sign in sheet at intensive care.

476
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,150
You didn't think people would recognise your maiden name.

477
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,070
They told me that Chris was in a coma. They didn't know if he was going to live or not.

478
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,760
I did what any mother would do. I went to see my son.

479
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,860
I didn't have the strength to open the door.

480
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,340
This is my mother.

481
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,380
I only remember seeing her once.

482
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,460
I don't know much about her

483
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,860
But I do know that I would give anything to feel her arms around me.

484
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,260
Listen if you're . . .

485
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,620
If you're gonna tell me that Chris needs me

486
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,380
and the past doesn't matter, save it.

487
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,580
I've always been a great addict but I'm worthless as a mother.

488
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,120
Grace you're a person with a disease.

489
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,121
A disease that controlled your life.

490
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,300
It kept you from the people that you love

491
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,540
but somewhere you found the courage to fight it.

492
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,040
Maybe if you look there again

493
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,441
you will find the way to make things right with your son.

494
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:16,342
Hey, Jo-Ellen.

495
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,870
Where is everybody?

496
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,900
Around somewhere.

497
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,970
Really.

498
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,700
It's funny because I only saw your car out there in the parking lot.

499
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,701
Yeah.

500
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,940
Please Bobby, I have work to do.

501
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,050
The Captain assignd that to you?

502
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes! And he wants it done before he comes in.

503
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,060
I guess that means that when I make Captain you'll do exactly what I say.

504
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:42,461
Don't.

505
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,220
I don't like games.

506
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,500
you'll never guess what I just found.

507
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,300
Hey Jarod I didn't see your car outside.

508
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,580
I took the bus.

509
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,540
A seedless watermelon.

510
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,520
Now, I wonder how they get them out.

511
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,421
Yeah.

512
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,940
I've got some work I got to do.

513
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,700
I'll talk to you later.

514
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,540
If I'm tired you must be exhausted.

515
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,980
- Why?
- Well not only do you have to work

516
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,440
train all day like the rest of us

517
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:27,641
but you have to put up with him.

518
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,700
What you mean?

519
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,140
Looking over your shoulder.

520
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,940
Constant wondering when he'll show up.

521
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,410
What he'll want.

522
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,711
The rage,

523
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,180
the powerlessness.

524
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,580
I know that it would eat at me until I wanted to scream.

525
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,980
At first it seemed liked harmless flirting.

526
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,070
I thought I could handle it. Handle Bobby.

527
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,700
But he's so aggressive.

528
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,550
He scares me.

529
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,630
Being the only woman you must have felt trapped.

530
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,660
Well I knew that if I complained to the Commander I would get nothing but flak.

531
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,070
Bobby would only deny it and I would become the black sheep of the squad,

532
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,980
if I wasn't fired.

533
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,900
Believe me it's hard enough being one of the boys around here.

534
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,780
So I just kept my mouth shut.

535
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,420
And then Chris found out?

536
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,940
One night Bo . . . Bobby touched me

537
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,270
and I was upset. Chris comforted me.

538
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,500
He was such a great guy, you know.

539
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,500
As if dealing with his own problems wasn't enough he wanted to take care of me too.

540
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,860
He was really angry with Bobby.

541
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,550
He even wrote up a report but, you know, I couldn't sign it.

542
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,660
Well you should've.

543
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,550
You're not the first woman to feel this way.

544
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,980
Bobby's done this before,

545
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,660
in Portland.

546
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,910
He almost lost his job.

547
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,910
His wife nearly left him

548
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,700
but he intimidated the victim until she dropped the charges.

549
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,190
I don't know.

550
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,630
He's connected Jarod. Bobby's about to become Captain.

551
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,060
Even if I take him on, he'll win.

552
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,060
Don't be so sure.

553
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,740
Thank you for coming, Miss Pakrer

554
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,020
I realise this interview is unpleasant.

555
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,820
Just know that my intention is

556
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,860
to eliminate people as possible suspects not incriminate them.

557
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,580
Considering I'm on record as having threatened to shoot Raines,

558
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,700
I'm would think that I'm your number one suspect.

559
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,420
And I suppose we're having this meeting in my father's former office

560
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,710
because Raines thinks that it will unnerve me.

561
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm not sure that I know what you mean.

562
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,040
My father has disappeared

563
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,310
and some Ralph Reed clone has replaced him.

564
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,500
Exactly what part of this is hard to grasp,

565
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,700
Doctor?

566
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,100
Let's move on.

567
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,060
Now you've known Jarod since you were a little girl.

568
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,110
What is your relationship with him now?

569
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,780
My relationship . . .

570
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,620
is to find him and bring him back . .

571
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,980
preferably alive but dead is becoming more acceptable.

572
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,700
So wouldn't it have bothered you if Mr Raines had shot Jarod?

573
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,820
Not at all.

574
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,880
Mind if I smoke?

575
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,270
You make no effort at all to conceal your hostility towards Mr Raines.

576
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,900
Is that because you felt

577
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,020
protected by your father?

578
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,430
I don't need Daddy to protect me from Scar man.

579
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,180
Would you care to expand on that?

580
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,260
I think he was involved in the death of my mother

581
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,940
and knows what happened to my father.

582
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,030
What makes you think that?

583
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,060
Woman's intuition.

584
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,150
So it is safe to say that it would give you great satisfaction to see him dead.

585
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,940
It would give me great satisfaction to perform his autopsy,

586
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,780
before he was dead.

587
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,540
Miss Parker. When you came in here I had no opinion one way or the other

588
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,300
as to your involvement in the shooting of Mr Raines.

589
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,190
However, you must admit your excessive candour . . .

590
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,620
If I'd shot you,

591
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,020
you son of a bitch,

592
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,900
you'd be dead.

593
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,430
Are we clear?

594
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,860
Hey Poet! Do you like watermelon?

595
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,660
-Yeah
-911

596
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,261
We've got a bridge worker stuck on a scaffold.

597
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,330
When are these morons going to learn?

598
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:35,931
Where is everybody?

599
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,740
- Just you and me.
- Let's do it!

600
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,660
Looks like a heart attack. I'm going over.

601
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:50,261
Not this time Spiderman. I'm in charge here.

602
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,900
I'm going over.

603
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,710
Okay. More line.

604
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,220
Nice and easy.

605
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:57,821
Nice and easy.

606
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,950
More line.

607
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:03,451
What are you doing?

608
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,660
I need more ropes.

609
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:07,661
Okay.

610
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,700
Are you crazy?

611
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,780
Just making sure that you're still high enough.

612
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,870
- For what?
- Your fall.

613
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,380
What the hell are you doing?

614
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,030
Yep. That'll work.

615
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,940
See you Bobby.

616
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:40,941
Jarod, Jarod. Ah...

617
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,550
What the hell are you doing?

618
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,180
What you did to Chris Welman

619
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,750
when he threatened to expose your sexual harassment of Jo-Ellen.

620
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,460
Hey what kind of sick joke is this?

621
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,580
Oh this is no joke Bobby.

622
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,900
At least I'm not laughing.

623
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,940
You don't know what you're talking about man.

624
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,980
You had to stop him. You had your promotion to lose.

625
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,181
No, man.

626
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,650
So you followed Chris Welman up to the training tower

627
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:09,351
and you cut his rappelling rope.

628
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,020
And then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.

629
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,740
That's a lie man. The man left a note.

630
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,830
Which you wrote on his computer.

631
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,060
Now if it makes you feel any better

632
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,750
I'll write one on yours.

633
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,351
No, please

634
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,540
Look alright, alright. I cut his rope.

635
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,060
I did it. Right.

636
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,910
Now please, pull me back up out of here man.

637
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,460
No way!

638
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,100
Now that was poetic. Ha ha ha.

639
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:53,501
Wow!

640
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,960
It's about time Dr Curtis.

641
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,480
-Have you reached a conclusion?
-Yes

642
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,550
And your determination?

643
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,310
Any one of them could have done it.

644
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,160
Not very satisfying doctor.

645
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,340
I'm very sorry Mr Raines.

646
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,940
That is the only conclusion I can come to

647
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,830
based on my evaluations.

648
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,980
Get out!

649
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,390
Perhaps Mr Parker knows who pulled the trigger.

650
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,140
Wherever he is.

651
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,340
I did what you wanted.

652
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,220
I told them it could have been any one of them.

653
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,020
This is who I believe actually shot him.

654
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,660
So, we're even.

655
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,380
For now.

656
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,310
"USAR Staffer Held In Attempted to Murder Of Crew Member"

657
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,940
Is there any progress?

658
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,520
It seems to vary with his mood.

659
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,921
If we could a way of keeping his spirits up

660
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,760
there's a good chance Chris could regain as much as

661
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,040
eighty percent of his cognitive and motor skills.

662
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,580
Mum!

663
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,340
Mum, I love you mum.

664
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,660
I love you too Jarod.
