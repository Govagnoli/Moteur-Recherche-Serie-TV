1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,000
Previously on the pretender,

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,001
I think Angelo was a sponge,

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:08,502
someone can absorb the emotional and intellectual traits about others.

4
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,003
He can help us found Jarod.

5
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:11,804
You have a company now, Mr. Broots.

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,305
My name is Bridget.

7
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,606
I am going to do my job.

8
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,707
I won't allow you to compromise the situation.

9
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:33,508
A strange phenomena has occured with Jarod.

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,209
He woke this morning with seemingly no knowledge of his own identity.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,310
We must begin, Jarod.

12
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,811
Why do you keep calling me that?

13
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:52,712
It's your name.

14
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:53,913
So you say!

15
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:56,114
I don't know even what I look like.

16
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,115
How is that make you feel?

17
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:04,616
I don't exist any more.

18
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,517
I want to know who I am.

19
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,518
No doubt,

20
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:22,619
the years of the pretender simulations has brought on this identity disorder.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,720
My concern,

22
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:31,021
if that continues withdrawing, we'll lose grasp of his true self permanently.

23
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,422
He is gone.

24
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,123
What the hell is this?

25
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:13,224
It seems that Jarod is taking an interest in classical art.

26
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,825
Aphrodite never had a buck of milk like this, Sydney.

27
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:21,026
Ask me, I think Mr. Peabody is going to late puberty.

28
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,427
Why also would he be sculpting woman?

29
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:29,128
Dr. Clay.

30
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,629
There was every opinion I paid for them.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,730
How did you become such an artist?

32
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,031
Practice makes perfect.

33
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:56,732
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

34
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,933
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

35
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:07,934
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 5
Nip and Tuck

36
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:13,935
YTET PRESENTS

37
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:20,936
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

38
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:34,334
Touch her face, tell me what you're feeling, Angelo.

39
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,135
Sadness.

40
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:40,736
Hurt.

41
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:43,837
Shame.

42
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:45,938
Who's hurt, Angelo?

43
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,039
Who's sadness and shame?

44
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,640
You're telling me that he cen feel the same emotions as when Jarod made these things.

45
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,441
He is still only beginning to understand.

46
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:00,542
Angelo's gift is an empath.

47
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:05,143
What he may be telling us what Jarod was pretending.

48
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,844
What the emotions arouse by the statues of the viewer.

49
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:12,845
Or the emotions of the worker who packaged the Clay Dough.

50
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,646
Hurt.

51
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:18,947
Sadness.

52
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:20,848
Shame.

53
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,949
A clue about my emotions, happiness isn't one of them.

54
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,950
Nice picture chuckles. How long did that take you?

55
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:33,551
My daughter Debbie drawed.

56
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:37,952
I wonder she could draw anything at all with all around this weekend.

57
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,053
Won't you ask what I'm talking about?

58
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:44,054
No.

59
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:50,355
Becuase if I have to hear one more time about your ex-wife and football team she's dating, I'll torse my toast.

60
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,356
It's not about my ex-wife.

61
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,657
What then?

62
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,458
How do I know I can trust you?

63
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,359
Um, I'm out here.

64
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,960
Someone is watching me.

65
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,361
This is the center.

66
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:08,162
Somebody is watching everybody.

67
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:10,663
No, no, no! Not in the center.

68
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:14,364
I had Debbie this weekend. Everywhere we went, I thought we were being spied on.

69
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:17,665
At the iceream parlor, at the zoo, even at home.

70
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:21,666
Sit.

71
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,167
I am telling you, someone is after me.

72
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:32,668
Broots, do you have any tangible evidence of the stalker?

73
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,669
No, it's little things, you know, foot steps behind us,

74
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,170
rustling in the trees.

75
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,771
When we got home last night, the light was out.

76
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,772
I...I always leave it on.

77
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:45,173
So it's dim bulb in your house, Broots. We always know now.

78
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:46,674
Hurt.

79
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,275
Hurt.

80
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,476
Sadness.

81
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:07,877
It's a shame.

82
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:09,078
Shame?

83
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,179
The mamma plastic you did.

84
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,680
Beautiful young girl like that you only gave a thirty-six inch bust.

85
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:15,581
Mat.

86
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,082
Oh I had to build her the code.

87
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,783
Any more than that she'll top in an earthquake.

88
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:21,884
Top? That's funny.

89
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,685
You gentlemen's serving dessert yet.

90
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,586
Ready to exciser the defect.

91
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,887
Your're running late. I got a rhytidectomy scheduled at ten.

92
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:37,088
No offence, Ray. But don't you have a promotion to get it passed over for something?

93
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,089
Rhytidectomy, at ten.

94
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,390
He seems a little irritable.

95
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:47,791
He lost our round at Santa Barbara clinic and he has been aggressive ever since.

96
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,592
Do you want to close?

97
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:51,693
Um, actually I would like to watch your technic.

98
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,994
They say you leave a scarring and then any surgeon cannot close.

99
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:56,595
I leave none.

100
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,196
What's your secret?

101
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:01,597
Sew's your pattern, nerve's steel.

102
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:06,398
And I think my old man laughed when I joined the macrame club.

103
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,799
Who's laughing now?

104
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes, Debbie, Daddy's fine.

105
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,001
Um, just, just busy.

106
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,302
I miss you too.

107
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,203
Listen, just stay with mummy a couple of more days,

108
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:23,804
And then you can come back, okay?

109
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:28,805
Good. And do me a favor, would you draw me another one of these wonderful pictures?

110
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,606
Yeah, I got it right here.

111
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:34,107
Um, I love it.

112
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,008
I love you too.

113
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,709
Okay, be good peanut. Bye.

114
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,510
Perfect alignment. Incision's barely ...

115
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:56,911
Nice assist.

116
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,212
Where did you say you trained?

117
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,413
Princeton med, postgraduate at Harvard.

118
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,014
And Clay Dough institute.

119
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,115
Clay Dough institute? That's funny too.

120
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,416
Well it isn't funny as ever see the picture I get.

121
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:12,717
I didn't become a plastic surgeon at Beverly Hills just sit at courtside and leek games.

122
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:16,018
Don't knock courtside. And trust me the money will flow.

123
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:22,819
When I'm treating a medicate patient.., L.A. is full of rich, vain people under a unrelenting sun.

124
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,120
It's gold.

125
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,821
I just brought a brand new Boxter.

126
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:27,922
Cash.

127
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:32,123
As far as the perks, do you remember the bikini girl on Hellraiser Two?

128
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,124
I am dating her.

129
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,425
In fact, I designed her butt.

130
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:41,426
Well, she must be twice as good as Hellraiser One girl.

131
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,027
You're not still bragging about the bimbo construction business, are you?

132
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:46,528
Dr. Brant.

133
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,729
Wade.

134
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,530
You must be Dr. Clay.

135
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,730
Christine Brant. ...staff.

136
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,131
It's nice to finally meet you.

137
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:57,532
You've trained ...facial trauma and the sculped fracture repair.

138
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,433
Of course.

139
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:02,834
Great. We got a NVA victim coming in with massive facial injuries. She's yours.

140
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:03,735
I am on my way.

141
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,036
And it's very nice...

142
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:06,237
Time is money, doctor.

143
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:09,738
Right.

144
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:19,639
Lose something, love?

145
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,940
I am sure it'll turn up somewhere.

146
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,641
Relax, Mr. Broots.

147
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,542
I am here to help.

148
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,343
With you Peeping Tom problem.

149
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,444
How did you know?

150
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:34,845
Not important.

151
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:40,646
What is, is that I believe you.

152
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,747
Questions?

153
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:47,348
Why your friends Parker and Sydney don't?

154
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,449
Oh, they, they don't believe me, just they, they...

155
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,550
They could possible think a man of your intelligence a fool.

156
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,851
Or is that they have something to hide?

157
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:05,152
We know how to treat a man of your caliber.

158
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,353
We can protect you.

159
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:14,554
Who's we?

160
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,755
The people you can trust.

161
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,356
Hope you find what you're looking for.

162
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:34,657
Afraid, Daddy afraid.

163
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,258
Daddy afraid.

164
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,659
That's one big ear, Jarod.

165
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,560
You weren't kidding, were you?

166
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,561
It's a remarkable substance, Clay Dough.

167
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,062
And the name would ... was for cooking.

168
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:02,663
But I find it useful in training for blepharoplasty.

169
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,964
Otoplasty ... surgery.

170
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,265
You my friend, need some serious nugget.

171
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,166
Nugget? Is that another Clay Dough product?

172
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,667
Not exactly.

173
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,668
Any complications on the NVA case?

174
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,469
Um, no. But I will keep my eye on until they folllow up.

175
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,070
It's a candy case. There is no follow up.

176
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,271
Candy cases are pro bono.

177
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,272
They should happy to get surgery at all.

178
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:28,273
Pro bono?

179
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:31,274
I spent seven years in medical school to operate for free.

180
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,475
Once a week. Brant's rule.

181
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,276
You know I'm beginning to wonder about this place.

182
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,477
Money, movie stars, so far I've not even seen one single starlet.

183
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,577
For now you won't.

184
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,578
Brant does most of surgery herself.

185
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,679
And we get stuck with free bees?

186
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,880
This hole helped the poor a bit, it's Brant big thing.

187
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:50,481
Hey, yous. Dr. Eubanks, if you want to stay at Surgicare.

188
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:51,482
Dr. Brant.

189
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,483
Get something straight, doctor.

190
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,784
Surgicare is not just about getting actors a part in their next movie.

191
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:07,185
We are the county's top provider of free reconstructive surgery.

192
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:13,186
If you want to share the flora, you do your share the ladder.

193
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,787
Ah, nice ear.

194
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:18,188
I should sew a belt to her neck.

195
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,389
''Tragic Car Wreck Leaves One Injured, One Dead''

196
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,490
''Injured, Scholaship Student Drops Out of School''

197
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:14,291
''I Am...''

198
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:18,292
Why are you doing that, Jarod?

199
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,593
Why do you keep calling me that?

200
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,094
I am nobody.

201
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,895
You can't hide from youself forever.

202
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,696
Jarod's resistance continues.

203
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:34,897
If he refuses about anticipating any simulation to interact, even to eat.

204
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,798
The self-impose isolation is a new pretender phenomena.

205
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,299
I am worried about his future.

206
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
Can I help you?

207
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:11,201
Hello, I am Dr. Clay, from Surgicare.

208
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:13,202
I am on duty to follow up on Tricia.

209
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:16,103
Nobody's ever checked on that child before.

210
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:17,804
That's why I am here.

211
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,805
The friend of her was driving the car.

212
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:26,906
God rest his soul, went straight through the windshield.

213
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:30,907
I told Tricia everyday, she is lucky to be alive.

214
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,208
...she can't see in that way.

215
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,009
Cos of the face, she won't leave the house, won't see her friends.

216
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,110
That child has a voice set down from heaven.

217
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:47,411
Cause of she had full music scholarship.

218
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,912
She is never going to use it now.

219
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,913
Never is a long time.

220
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,514
I see you like music too.

221
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,215
Oh, no. That's Tricia's.

222
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:04,116
One of the mystery gifts.

223
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:08,617
They started to come in the mail, about one month after the accident.

224
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:11,018
No calls, no return address.

225
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,919
God bless him.

226
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,420
Cos it's about the only thing makes that baby girl happy.

227
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,021
Can I see her?

228
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,022
Tricia? You have a visitor.

229
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,023
Hi.

230
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:39,924
You like blues.

231
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,725
It's my favorite too.

232
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,126
I am Dr. Clay.

233
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:46,627
Jarod.

234
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,728
Can you fix my face?

235
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,229
I don't know.

236
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,730
It's going to be very difficult to see through that.

237
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,031
I don't want to do this.

238
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:21,132
Tricia.

239
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,533
It's okay.

240
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,034
You know when I was at your age,

241
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,935
I never left the house either.

242
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:35,436
I stayed in for about thirty years.

243
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,037
It's a long story.

244
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:47,438
When I, got out, I realised, what I was missing.

245
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:54,539
Trees, fresh air, sunlight.

246
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,240
Life is a gift.

247
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:04,641
Nothing is worth missing out on it.

248
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,342
That's nice to meet you.

249
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:18,543
Wait.

250
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:38,644
You have beautiful eyes.

251
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,345
What color? Are they blue?

252
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:45,946
Violet.

253
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,847
Violet, my new favorite color.

254
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,348
Hello?

255
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:28,449
Hello!

256
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,050
Who's there?

257
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,351
Hello?

258
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:23,752
An..Angelo?

259
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,453
Daddy, you're afraid.

260
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,954
I need your expert advice.

261
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,577
- Medicine or woman?
- Both actually.

262
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,502
This belongs to a super model.

263
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,613
Model or super model?

264
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:17,779
A super.

265
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,178
The fore two fracture of mandible.

266
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,142
Now do you think you can do the procedure without causing any problem paralysis?

267
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,378
Is the pope catholic?

268
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,981
I believe that's mandatory.

269
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:33,579
Look, in tht hands of a master,

270
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,654
she will come up looking better than she did before.

271
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,059
The 7th cranial nerve is near the center of the fracture.

272
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:40,379
Absolutely positive you can avoid it?

273
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:43,097
The most difficult part would be getting those complements in the lab

274
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,499
come up the negative blood A which I need.

275
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,798
A super model?
Is she, she seeing anyone?

276
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:52,358
I don't believe she is.

277
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:55,901
As a matter of fact. I would be glad to introduce you.

278
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,759
Dr. Eubanks, it's Tricia Holmes.

279
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,860
Hi.

280
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,861
Hi.

281
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,821
I remember you.

282
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:14,256
The fore two fracture of the mandible.

283
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:17,902
Just like the super model.

284
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,738
And I am sure you remember the result.

285
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,712
The posterior around this mandible was damaged and

286
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,735
right facial nerve's been suffering.

287
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,236
What happened?

288
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,020
Why don't you tell me?

289
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,421
Were you late for a movie premier?

290
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,418
Did you have a hard date?

291
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:46,193
Maybe with the charity cases you just don't give them.

292
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:50,819
I'm might not be... but I give my patients one hundred percent.

293
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,120
Right, except in follow up.

294
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:57,092
Guilty. But only following surgicare's pro bono policy.

295
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:00,602
Look, I am a damn good surgeon.

296
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:03,603
And I'm sure as hell never would I have done that.

297
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,016
Did you stabilize her fracture?

298
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,417
Completely.

299
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,555
And when you closed her, the nerve was intact?

300
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:13,356
Yes.

301
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,692
The lacerations that she sustained weren't that deep.

302
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:20,098
Jarod, I didn't do that to her.

303
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,499
I swear to you.

304
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,398
Well if you didn't do it,

305
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:29,799
Who did?

306
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:38,135
...closes it.

307
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:40,602
It certainly does.

308
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:50,894
Broots, one last question.

309
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,082
Have you considered counciling?

310
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:58,133
I'm telling you, if it wasn't for Angelo, I would be dead now.

311
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:00,415
He saved my life. He is a hero.

312
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,978
So monkey boy got out of the zoo.

313
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,712
Question is how?

314
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:11,592
Oh, I found this top security access card in its pocket.

315
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:13,262
Who knows how he got it.

316
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:16,532
At least, he saved you from whoever is after you.

317
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,802
Why just you still don't believe me? And what about these pictures?

318
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,200
Use them for your Christmas cards.

319
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,214
He is passed his bed time.

320
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:32,315
Put him back into his space.

321
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,521
Sydney, you still don't believe me either?

322
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:44,692
I am not sure what to believe, Broots.

323
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,181
I found these by the trinity of your house.

324
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,183
Shell casings.

325
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:52,892
It's the 9 mm, this is standard Center issue.

326
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:53,693
Um.

327
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:56,796
And these,

328
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,417
were with them.

329
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:32,200
Miss Parker is after me.

330
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,278
We will protect you, love.

331
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:37,141
But nothing comes for free.

332
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:38,442
Okay,

333
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:42,938
What do you want?

334
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:47,739
Miss Parker?

335
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:51,103
I want to know every move she makes,

336
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,221
everyone she speaks to.

337
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,818
You need this.

338
00:24:57,303 --> 00:24:59,858
Oh, no. I don't know about that.

339
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:02,612
Survival of the fittest.

340
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,621
You know, choice is yours.

341
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:10,502
B...bless you.

342
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:17,931
Bless me!

343
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,601
Angelo, how did you get out?

344
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,095
Give me those. Give me that. That's mine.

345
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:27,196
It's my stuff.

346
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:35,361
It wasn't Miss Parker.

347
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,237
It Was Bridget.

348
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:38,872
What about the sneezy?

349
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,421
I've just passed through them all.

350
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:43,942
What are you doing with that?

351
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:46,943
Miss Parker.

352
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:50,999
Do you want me to hurt you?

353
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,100
No.

354
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,237
These were found outside of my house.

355
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:57,902
Your shell casings,

356
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,296
And your cigarette butts.

357
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:02,379
All planted by Bridget.

358
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,580
She is the one following me.

359
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:14,781
Angelo.

360
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,434
Who's access card, Angelo?

361
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:25,496
Amateurs!

362
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,493
Jarod, Jarod, where are you?

363
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:34,694
Jarod.

364
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,376
My God.

365
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,012
What are you doing?

366
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,559
Searching Sydney, for me.

367
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:53,938
Your name is Jarod.

368
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:56,995
And you have a tremendous gift to offer the world.

369
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,152
A gift that can help people.

370
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:05,082
You just need to believe in youself,

371
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:07,182
again.

372
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,551
I want to know what I look like.

373
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:13,214
I want to know who I am.

374
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,256
Ancient history.

375
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,895
That's me, in the drama club.

376
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,253
I got the breed in the screen musical Grease.

377
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,873
I don't think they wore leather jacket in ancient Greece?

378
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,383
Oh, that's me in the choir.

379
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:51,257
Let me guess, soprano soloist?

380
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,558
Um.

381
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:54,100
Was there anything you didn't do?

382
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,380
Um, maybe football team.

383
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:00,935
That you can't wait to get back to school to start all your activities.

384
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:09,336
Who is going to see a performer looks like this?

385
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,694
Unless she can fix me,

386
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,231
I am dead with school.

387
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,032
Tricia,

388
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

389
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,618
The nerve damage is irreparable.

390
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,595
What did I do?

391
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:40,333
What did I do to deserve this?

392
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:47,621
You don't know what it's like being left out.

393
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,142
Knowing people point you like you are a freak?

394
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,735
I know what it's like to be at the outside.

395
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:00,234
And I know that I am stronger because of it.

396
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:07,282
I don't want to be stronger. I just want to be who I am.

397
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:11,337
I just, want to be who I am again.

398
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:14,676
She is gone.

399
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:17,652
Forever.

400
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:21,361
Her gift isn't.

401
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:26,423
I look around your room and I see all the things your passionate about

402
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:29,474
and I know that your face is just a small part of who you are.

403
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:35,021
Only you hold the key to your future.

404
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:40,455
I know that the life is a weird journey.

405
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,033
But to live it,

406
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,579
you have to be out there.

407
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,980
Hello, doctor.

408
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:17,096
How is my baby?

409
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,897
Making progress. I hope.

410
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:21,395
This arrived.

411
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:24,119
Oh, could you open that please?

412
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,620
My arthritis is just not getting me down today.

413
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,597
All gifts from the mystery friend.

414
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:35,194
Tess, did all the gifts have the same postmark?

415
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,857
All from the Santa Barbara.

416
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:42,603
- Mr. Hoffman.
- Dr. Clay.

417
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,759
I am sorry about the urgency of this meeting.

418
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,573
But Dr. Brant was avid that this will be dealt immediately.

419
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:50,058
Well, You know your phone call was a little vague.

420
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,222
Is there a problem?

421
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:56,859
Someone has the information about Tricia Holmes.

422
00:30:58,143 --> 00:31:00,434
I am not here to pass the blame or to play games.

423
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:02,875
Dr. Brant wants you clear that if you don't cooperate,

424
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,776
all this can go away.

425
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:07,573
I don't remember every patients.

426
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:09,052
It is a good answer,

427
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:11,012
for the medical board.

428
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:12,213
Medical board?

429
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,139
Um, they're starting an investigation.

430
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:17,800
I didn't tell anyone I swear.

431
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,423
We need a statement that you signed nothing unusual that night.

432
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:22,556
That will give the board off our backs.

433
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:24,851
And Tricia Holmes,

434
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,922
She can go back and hide her disfigured face in the shadows,

435
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:31,660
while you and Dr. Brant enjoy all of these.

436
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,382
Do we have a deal?

437
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,083
No.

438
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:43,384
No?

439
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,361
I won't lie for her any more.

440
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:51,738
It's two a.m. when Tricia Holmes was brought back ...

441
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:56,916
Dr. Eubanks... did an excellent job on her.

442
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,294
She was resting in calm. Everything was calm.

443
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,075
Then Dr. Brant came in.

444
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:02,876
She was freaked.

445
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,761
She was in the middle of chin implant on some movie star,

446
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:08,952
and the bone grafts needed for the procedure had been damaged.

447
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,462
Brant needed a donor, she needed one quick.

448
00:32:12,183 --> 00:32:13,775
She checked out Tricia's chart.

449
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:17,280
Without a blinking, she grabed the scalpel.

450
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,599
My God, she didn't even bring that poor girl back in the surgery.

451
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:23,862
She reopened Tricia's face

452
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,597
and she harvested the bone and put it into a movie star client.

453
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,758
In a haste, she severed Tricia's facial nerve.

454
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:37,113
Brant gave me the promotion to keep quiet.

455
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,620
I've been trapped, ever since.

456
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:46,382
Ask Tricia Holmes about feeling trapped.

457
00:32:57,903 --> 00:32:59,502
Long day,Bridget.

458
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:08,302
You know they say: woman's working all that.

459
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,837
You looked tired.

460
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:16,019
But then I guess stalking can be tough on the young thing.

461
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:19,554
The late nights, the long hours.

462
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:24,433
You know you Americans have a whole other English.

463
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:27,553
Sorry love, don't follow.

464
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:32,376
Now that my father is back.

465
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:36,021
You'd never get approval.

466
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,055
So there must be independent move.

467
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,902
You shot Broots, did't you?

468
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:50,232
If I shot Broots, he would be dead.

469
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,354
Now scaring him was the intention.

470
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,678
So who ordered it?

471
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:58,093
Your guess is as good as mine.

472
00:33:58,803 --> 00:33:59,799
Raines.

473
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,641
It's just his style.

474
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,118
It'll make sense to go after the weakest link.

475
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,079
It was a very tough code.

476
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:14,080
Get something straight.

477
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:19,783
Broots may be an idiot, but he is my idiot.

478
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:22,502
The only one who terrorizes him, it is me.

479
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:24,801
You put a gun on me, no big deal.

480
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:28,078
Cos I know you don't have the rocks to put the trigger,

481
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,379
but the next time you miss with one of my team,

482
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,180
I'll put a bullet right on your blonde bonnet.

483
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:40,401
They said you weren't a bitch.

484
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,437
They were being kind.

485
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,496
For what it worth,

486
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:54,251
I did shoot at Mr. Broots.

487
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,059
However I've never took the pictures.

488
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:43,776
What's the occasion, Jarod?

489
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,172
Oh, let's just say it's my little way of saying thank you

490
00:35:47,463 --> 00:35:50,075
for giving me the best job that money can't buy.

491
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,820
Well, you are the best hire I've ever made.

492
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,193
No offence.

493
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:03,173
You've been rolling those charity cases at our record pace.

494
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,458
Give the rest of us opportunities to focus on other priorities.

495
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,501
Like weekends ...,

496
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:13,217
... the beachhouse renovations.

497
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:14,499
Guilty.

498
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,496
Are you okay, Christine?

499
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,376
Ah, just um...

500
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:30,377
I haven't, haven't eaten.

501
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:35,374
Oh, I think you had one too many

502
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:37,792
If Wade would be so kind to lent me his car,

503
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,093
I will give you a ride home.

504
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:42,116
A chauffeur, too?

505
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:44,778
I really did hire the right guy.

506
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,041
What kind of champagne was that?

507
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:52,681
A very special year.

508
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:55,242
If you're keeping the engine like that,

509
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:57,143
you gonna ruin it.

510
00:36:57,743 --> 00:36:59,932
Eubanks says his car can do one hundred and forty.

511
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,120
Let's see if he's telling the truth.

512
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:19,121
Jarod, Jarod, Jarod!

513
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:28,593
Dr. Brant? Dr. Brant?

514
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,477
Can you hear me?

515
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:37,059
There's been a terrible accident.

516
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,132
Am I okay?

517
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,715
Just a liitle blood.

518
00:37:45,216 --> 00:37:47,216
-Oh God.
-No, no, no.

519
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,572
Never mind that.

520
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:52,454
There is no deep trauma. It's only cosmetic.

521
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,337
My face?

522
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,692
Is it bad?

523
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:58,823
Don't worry. The damage isn't severe.

524
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:00,424
I can repair you.

525
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:02,912
Thank God.

526
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,341
There's been one slight complication, however.

527
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:08,342
Complication, what...

528
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:11,915
Oh, we have a high profile client to the next operating room.

529
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,413
A super model.

530
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:15,914
She had terrible reaction to a chemical peel.

531
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:18,657
She needs massive skin grafts.

532
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,761
Luckily, we have the perfect donor.

533
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:24,974
You.

534
00:38:25,643 --> 00:38:26,573
Me?

535
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,603
I am not donating grafts.

536
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,282
It would ruin my face.

537
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,838
I am sorry.

538
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,658
But, there is no other way.

539
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:37,778
What, you are insane?

540
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:39,879
You cannot do that to me!

541
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:41,378
Sure I can.

542
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:44,835
Just like you did to Tricia Holmes.

543
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,136
Look on the bright side.

544
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,598
At least I am going tell you that I'm going to harvest

545
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,103
part of your body for someone else.

546
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:53,961
That was what you did to her, isn't it?

547
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:55,362
Jarod, please.

548
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:57,114
You cut a piece of her jaw,

549
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,783
to save your important client's little chin implant.

550
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:02,702
And you severed her facial nerve in your haste, didn't you?

551
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,422
Yes,I did that!

552
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,674
Now please let me go!

553
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:09,175
Sorry.

554
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:11,298
I cannot do that.

555
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:18,218
But I promise, I'll try to be more careful with you, than you were with her.

556
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:26,719
No, no, no, Jarod, please.

557
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:36,196
Oh, try not panic.

558
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,579
Your face is still anaesthetized.

559
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,296
What's left of it.

560
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,536
You are insane.

561
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:44,973
No, I resent that, doctor.

562
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:47,194
I did the very best I could,

563
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,951
considering I am not really a plastic surgeon.

564
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:53,152
What a...

565
00:39:56,253 --> 00:40:00,253
No, no.

566
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:01,754
Oops.

''Doctor Arrested In Cosmetic Surgery Malpractice''

568
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,836
I don't think she is coming.

569
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:17,821
You need to have more faith.

570
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:32,422
Oh, baby.

571
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,582
You look beautiful.

572
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:37,883
Thanks.

573
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:45,598
Can I give you a ride?

574
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:48,853
Thanks, but, life is a so weird journey.

575
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:52,458
and it's about time I get back out there.

576
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:38,459
Jarod, Jarod.

577
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,075
This is what you look like.

578
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,696
This is who you are.

579
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:13,972
Bridget did the shooting, but she is not the photographer.

580
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:17,056
We know. This is came this morning.

581
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:27,342
What the hell is going on here?

582
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,993
Someone is trying to terrorize us.

583
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:31,194
Who?

584
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,251
Well, we are working on that one.

585
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,332
Angelo?

586
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,338
Angry.

587
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:52,458
Feel confused.

588
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:55,798
Angry.

589
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,199
Angelo.

590
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:03,459
Who is angry? Who?

591
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,460
Angelo.

592
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,599
This is a waste of time.

593
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,058
I decide who lives or dies.

594
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,759
I decide who lives or dies.

595
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,060
I decide who lives or dies.
