1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
It's not working.

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:08,201
The white duck isn't accepting the mallards as part of his family.

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:09,902
Conclusion?

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:13,203
The family bond is primarily in bloods.

5
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:14,804
It's unbreakable.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:16,305
Very good, Jarod.

7
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:20,806
My family is gone, Sydney.

8
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,407
If I ever left here, would anybody want me?

9
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:38,408
What is this place?

10
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,609
I get your back, Miss Parker.

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,010
Looks like monkey boy has some time on his hands.

12
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:12,311
Ah, Urban Combat Basics, The Best Vietminh Neutralisation Hand to Hand Combat, and you

13
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,112
Our ..has turned into a .. weekend warrior.

14
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,413
You shot me.

15
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:20,414
In the head.

16
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:21,615
You never looked better.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,416
Something you want to share with us, Syd?

18
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:26,917
Syd.

19
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:30,218
Syd, are you alright?

20
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:32,719
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,120
All cleared.

22
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,221
What is this? Testosterone headquarters?

23
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:52,222
What do you think all this means?

24
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:58,123
Well, looks like Jarod is preparing to go to a war.

25
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,024
Better hope .. shows us the ransom.

26
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:06,925
Quiet.

27
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:09,926
See anything?

28
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:11,927
I have seen nothing.

29
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:12,728
No cops?

30
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,629
Just hostlers and cracked.

31
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,730
We'll .be okay.

32
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,231
- Check the bedroom.
- Go, go..

33
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:24,432
Police! Freeze!

34
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,633
Come against the wall.

35
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:28,734
Check the whole place.

36
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,335
My name is Jarod.

37
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,136
You're going to be just fine.

38
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:44,037
There are pretenders among us.

39
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,338
I was taken from my family.

40
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,039
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
How many people died because of what I thought up?

42
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,641
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

43
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:57,442
He is a pretender.

44
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,643
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

45
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:04,244
- The center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

46
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,445
He defends the weak and abused.

47
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,446
Life is a gift.

48
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,447

00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:19,347
You are a doctor?

52
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:20,948
I am, today.

53
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:32,749
Jarod.

54
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,950
Nice work last night, partner.

55
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,851
No shots, no casualties.

56
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,952
That's what love picture shows up.

57
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,453
That's a pleasure to be here, Sergeant Stevens.

58
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,554
It's an honor to be part of the T-14 Squad.

59
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,155
Although I am still trying to figure out what the T stands for.

60
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,656
Tend to life, if you ask the losers on city-locker.

61
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:50,957
Turbo..achieve.

62
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:52,558
- Turbo Squad.
- Turbo Squad.

63
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,159
We are well oiled machine.

64
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,360
- Based on your moves last night, you fit in just fine.
- Hey, man.

65
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,161
I heard about the shooting incident.

66
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:05,362
Lieutenant Lang is going to be a tough fact to follow.

67
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,563
Dan was ... guy.

68
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:07,964
He's gonna be missed.

69
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,865
That cop-killer better hope I don't find his worthless ass. That's all I got to say.

70
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:16,566
Is a precinct picnic used to be all kinds of fun, for all these bitches and morons.

71
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,667
Tracking another ... , Detective?

72
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:22,868
You guys are making Lang up to be some sort of hero. Truth is he was a fool.

73
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,069
Why don't you take some place else, loser?

74
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,070
- Truth hurts, Sergeant Stevens?
- No, this does.

75
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,671
Come on, Detective. Are you alright?

76
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:30,872
Why do you keep defending this guy?

77
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:34,073
He threw himself in between a shooter and his partner. He was a good cop.

78
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,374
... alright? And it got him killed.

79
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,575
Right in front of Lang's kids. That was nice.

80
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:44,676
That was really nice.

81
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:45,777
I didn't know.

82
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,378
''S.W.A.T. Officer Killed, Unknown Assailant''

85
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:38,481
Jet'aime, Michelle.

86
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:42,182
I love you too.

87
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,283
Hey, Sydney.

88
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:55,084
Routine scans from last week.

89
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,285
Are you okay, Sydney?

90
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,286
Broots, can I trust you?

91
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:07,187
Absolutely.

92
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,888
I told you about the dream I keep having about Miss Parker, didn't I?

93
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,689
I need your help to find a person.

94
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,990
Her name is Michelle Lucca.

95
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:17,691
Okay.

96
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:22,792
This is every thing I remember about her.

97
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,893
Broots, this is important to me.

98
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,694
Please be secretive.

99
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:28,695
Okay, Sydney.

100
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,196
You know you can count on me.

101
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,697
Hate to break up the coffee clutch.

102
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:34,898
But Broots is needed on sublevel five right away.

103
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,298
Oh, okay. Do the course.

104
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,199
Everything okay, Syd?

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Fine, Miss Parker, fine.

106
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,501
In a hurry, Broots?

107
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:04,602
Oh, hi.

108
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:08,903
What?

109
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,104
I want the paper Sydney gave you.

110
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,254
- You're listening at the door?
- It was an accident.

111
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,976
Call the cop. The paper!

112
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,477
Michelle Lucca.

113
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:31,872
Dr. Pavlov has been drooling ever since he found that note from Jarod.

114
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:34,757
Do exactly what's Sydney asked.

115
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,158
Okay.

116
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:42,621
If Sydney's protecting Jarod for some reason, I need to know about it. You got it?

117
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:44,522
Yeah.

118
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,123
Oh, and Broots.

119
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,332
I can't wait to hear about that dream of yours.

120
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,217
And we are clear.

121
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,917
What did the hell you shoot that, Mooney? Cleveland?

122
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:27,658
Are you okay?

123
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,159
Yeah.

124
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:34,602
I need some air.

125
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:42,522
What's with him?

126
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,517
I don't know.

127
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,573
Nice choice of simulation scenario, Jarod.

128
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:50,458
Well, Simulation is sort of my speciality.

129
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,237
You and Cook, you show some ... shooting.

130
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,402
Just back up the team.

131
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:23,253
What's up?

132
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,454
I really drop the ball back there.

133
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,755
Maybe the simulation was a little too close the home.

134
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:30,513
Maybe it reminded you the day you got shot.

135
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,182
The day Dan Lang was killed.

136
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:35,192
It's only been two weeks.

137
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:36,793
I was like I was living that again.

138
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,879
... was going off.

139
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,993
Dan screaming, pain cutting into my leg.

140
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,001
Classic syndromes of post-traumatic stress.

141
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,102
Have you talked to someone?

142
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,175
I am doing mandatory search since the department shrink.

143
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,839
I just can't get it out of my head.

144
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,098
Stress can be triggered by a number of factors.

145
00:09:58,383 --> 00:09:59,018
Anger.

146
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:00,476
Fear.

147
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,377
Guilty.

148
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:04,478
Guilty?

149
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,840
About how Dan Lang died to save your life.

150
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,196
Look, Your physical wounds are healing.

151
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:12,997
Maybe it's time to start dealing with your emotional ones.

152
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,638
It will heal when I catch the man that murdered my partner.

153
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,357
We run the simulations to hold our technical skills.

154
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,654
Same thing can work for healing emotions.

155
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:26,255
Well, we got a call about butch bank robbery.

156
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:28,618
The suspect drove three blocks and abandoned his car

157
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:30,182
and broke into a roller rink.

158
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,636
Lang and I made entry there.

159
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,398
Just behind those lockers.

160
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:38,157
We moved to our breaches but we were pinned by gunfire coming from the box.

161
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,298
Up there.

162
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,282
I had Lang's ... then I was hit in the leg and went down.

163
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:49,056
Dan stood between me and the shooter just kept firing.

164
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,491
It sounded like we were in the middle of a war.

165
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,820
Stevens and Cook were taking a cover position over there.

166
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:58,960
You could see them?

167
00:10:59,361 --> 00:10:59,961
I didn't have to.

168
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,462
It's standard technical procedure.

169
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:06,137
Anyway, the next thing I knew, Lang was shot and went down.

170
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:10,202
That's when I saw the shooter.

171
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:11,796
He stood open to the light.

172
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,813
White man, six feet, ..build,

173
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,061
goatee and in a baseball cap.

174
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,592
Son of the bitch knew what he was doing too.

175
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,181
They found powder of M1-32 shell casings.

176
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,981
Armor-piercing rounds

177
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:35,942
Cop killers.

178
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,879
Tore off Lang's vest like paper.

179
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,212
They call us the Turbo Squad.

180
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,339
Pistons in the same engine.

181
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:48,775
If we don't fire at the right time,

182
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,215
that engine breaks down.

183
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,352
People die.

184
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,692
- Anything on this Michelle Lucca?
- No on Michelle Lucca.

185
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,432
Yes on Michelle Stamatis.

186
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,733
Married and living in New York state.

187
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,297
But that's not the screwy part.

188
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:11,951
- What is that surprised me?
- Well, there is absolutely no record of Michelle Lucca ever have existed before moving to Albany in 1974.

189
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:16,195
No drivers licences, no birth certificate, nothing.

190
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:16,796
Broots.

191
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:18,736
Look deeper.

192
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,999
Then you can give Sydney her address but nothing else.

193
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,543
We need to find that note Jarod left Sydney in the cabin.

194
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:27,033
I am sure he hid it pretty well.

195
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:34,501
You haven't seen it, have you? Broots?

196
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:35,798
No way, no.

197
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:41,381
Miss Parker, this woman obviously means a lot to Sydney.

198
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:41,859
Your point?

199
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,734
Whatever happens with respecting someone's privacy?

200
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,342
Look, I know how much you care about Sydney.

201
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,479
How the old goat's even going on me a little.

202
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,194
But this might have something to do with Jarod.

203
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,136
And that, is what's important.

204
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:03,941
This is central dispatched T-14.

205
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:06,921
Suspects invaded a roller rink in 21B shore road.

206
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,695
He is armed and dangerous, over.

207
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,133
This is Lang. Officer Mooney and I abandoned the building.

208
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,401
Officer Stevens and Cook have taken flank positions. Over.

209
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,322
Copy entry, keep this channel 11 of T14, over.

210
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,778
Request immediately backup, officer down.

211
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:23,512
Repeat T14?

212
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:25,897
Lang was hit!

213
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,200
Officer down...

214
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:32,012
Copy officer down. Backup in road, over.

215
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,641
Response, T14, over.

216
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:40,401
Officer Lang, please respond. Officer Lang, this is dispatch, please respond.

217
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:43,874
This is Lang. I can't, I can't feel my legs.

218
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,533
Daniel, talk to me. Stay with me. The ambulance is on the way.

219
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,232
This's so cold. I am so cold.

220
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,236
Daniel, stay with me.

221
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:53,936
Please tell my boys,

222
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,056
tell Jordan and Cody, daddy loves them.

223
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,396
You can tell them that yourself, Daniel. Just hang on.

224
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,342
Daniel? Oh, My God!

225
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,871
Daniel, stay with me.

226
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,576
Please tell my boys,

227
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:43,655
tell Jordan and Cody, daddy loves them.

228
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:02,162
Ceramics figurines with vegetation for hair.

229
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:05,239
Chia pets.

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,240
Pets?

231
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:11,719
Yeah. I never have much for green thumb and animals hate me.

232
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:13,456
It seems like a logical solution.

233
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:16,659
I am Jarod.

234
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,962
Dan Lang's replacement.

235
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,963
I don't think it's possible to replace a man like lieutenant Lang.

236
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:25,264
No.

237
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,572
You were working dispatch on the night lieutenant Lang was killed.

238
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:32,479
I was the last person speak to him.

239
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,416
It must be very difficult for you.

240
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:37,977
Considering how you and Dan felt about each other.

241
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:40,778
What?

242
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:41,978
You two were in love.

243
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:44,795
I heard the dispatch tape.

244
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,819
I could hear it in your voice, the way you spoke to each other.

245
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,958
It must be very comforting for Dan.

246
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,722
To have you there until the end.

247
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:06,158
Daniel lost his wife just a year ago.

248
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,418
Since then, it's just been him and the boys.

249
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:12,681
You were close to his sons?

250
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:14,896
Yeah, very.

251
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,995
The only family they have left, are Daniel's parents in Seattle.

252
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:26,042
I have been tried to contact them about taking custody of Jordan and Cody.

253
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,436
Trouble is they've been travelling in Europe for over a month.

254
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,800
I am really gonna miss those kids.

255
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:32,982
It's difficult,

256
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,839
losing people that we love.

257
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,240
Yeah.

258
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,098
I haven't even cleaned out his locker yet.

259
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:43,295
It sounds silly.

260
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,082
It makes he seems a final.

261
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:48,937
So real.

262
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:52,693
I don't want to forget him.

263
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:56,899
I want to do something, you know, make a difference.

264
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,392
At least I want to get this cop killer bullet off the street.

265
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,178
Did Dan happen to mention anyone,

266
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:08,361
who might be supplying that type of ammunition in street?

267
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:13,538
He did mention a man named Petrovka.

268
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:35,653
Vladimir Petrovka, a local Russian connected to the Moscow Maffia.

269
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,198
Interpol thinks he might be responsible for smuggling cop killer ammunitions in States.

270
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,278
Among other things.

271
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:47,121
That's definitely him. I remember hearing his name a lot just before Daniel made up his mind to leave the team.

272
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,781
Daniel was planning to leave Turbo Squad?

273
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:51,441
Yeah, it was strange.

274
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:54,342
The last few weeks before the shooting,

275
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:58,902
he became so distant as if he knew something was gonna happen.

276
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:01,258
That is strange.

277
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,900
He said he was leaving Turbo because he was burnt out.

278
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,781
But, I think it was because of the boys.

279
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,280
Jordan and Cody were the world of him.

280
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:13,442
Now they may not have anybody.

281
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:19,543
Michelle Lucca, the more I look, the less I find.

282
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,934
I access ClA,FBl and...

283
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,292
He is not there.

284
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:25,972
Interpol files.

285
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:29,539
None of them have any record of her having ever existed prior to 1974.

286
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:30,861
so, I got the thinking,

287
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:35,161
who else could wipe out a person's past so efficiently?

288
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,378
- She worked for the Center.
- Got information, Miss Parker.

289
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:43,957
She was the clinical psychologist to work very closely with Sydney on the pretender project.

290
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,275
She is beautiful, isn't she?

291
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,315
Figure out how this connects to that note Jarod left.

292
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,741
I'll get on this right away, then.

293
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,375
You are hiding something, Broots.

294
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,276
What?

295
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,271
I think you heard me.

296
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,340
I promised Sydney he can trust me.

297
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,002
- And you feel like you're lying to him, right?
- Yes.

298
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,379
So, by giving me the rest of what you know,

299
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:09,500
it doesn't make you any more despicable than you are really are.

300
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,578
Right?

301
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,279
Right.

302
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,216
Let's go in my office.

303
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,658
Jordan and Cody remain with ..., but ... respective considering they lost their father.

304
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,073
I understand that. The boys' grandparents might take custody.

305
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,596
And apparently they are out of the country. We're still trying to make a contact.

306
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,217
What happens if they'are unable to take custody?

307
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,118
What happens to Jordan and Cody then?

308
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,881
Statistically older children particularly ones with emotional scars are very difficult to place.

309
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,321
If I ever left here, would anybody want me?

310
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:08,442
Let's ...

311
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,262
You must be good at this game.

312
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,063
Would you like to play?

313
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:13,452
Whatever.

314
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:16,338
You are a S.W.A.T.

315
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,459
Yes, I am.

316
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,058
So, did you know our dad?

317
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:21,972
No, but I hear he was a great guy.

318
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:29,037
Do you guys remember anything strange happening before your father's accident?

319
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:30,493
He yelled one night.

320
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,736
- Yelled?
- At the men.

321
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:35,143
Me and Cody've gone to bed and we woke up when we heard them fighting.

322
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:38,899
- Did you see these men?
- No, but we can hear them.

323
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:40,577
Dad was real mad.

324
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:44,915
He kept telling them that he didn't want to be involved and that they should leave.

325
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,495
It was a few nights before...you know.

326
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:03,977
Are you okay?

327
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,518
Everyday before he went to work,

328
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,119
he said nothing would happen to him.

329
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:11,882
He promised.

330
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:18,400
Cody, Your father died of saving another police officer.

331
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,351
There is nothing more heroic than that.

332
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,072
This is so wrong.

333
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,093
Sydney should be entitled to a private life.

334
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:32,916
Keep looking.

335
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,572
He was poped around here when I was here before him.

336
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:39,591
I got it.

337
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:41,492
What?

338
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:42,438
Oh God!

339
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,339
Oh, Miss Parker.

340
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:49,759
- Sydney, we were just...
- Just looking for you because I need your report on the surveillance scans.

341
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,599
- I'll put them on your desk.
- Thank you.

342
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:54,838
- Any news, Broots?
- Almost.

343
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,175
Give me that!

344
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:13,692
It is a birth certificate.

345
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:18,492
Michelle Lucca is named as the mother but there is no one here as the father.

346
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,093
Sydney.

347
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:41,472
I was in the cover position near the back breaches with officer Cook when we heard gunfire.

348
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,091
We immediately returned the fire.

349
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:44,602
I was hit almost immediately.

350
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:48,274
That's when Dan, I mean Officer Lang began to return fire.

351
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:49,982
The next thing I knew he was down.

352
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:53,674
And I can see the shooter, the guy with goatee and baseball cap looking right at me.

353
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:56,176
Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes.

354
00:22:56,563 --> 00:23:03,816
When we stop firing, we heard another weapon, sounded like one of our MP5 nine mm coming from the breaches in front of us.

355
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:09,119
Felt like the fire fight lasted twenty minutes.

356
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,620
Felt like the fire fight lasted ...

357
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:13,121
Felt like the fire fight...

358
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:14,122
Felt like the fire fight ...

359
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:30,198
I can't believe that buddy reopened the roller rink that haven't fixed the damage.

360
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:34,660
Liz, what kind of weapons were Mooney and Lang carrying the day of shooting?

361
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:38,275
9 mm hand guns.

362
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:40,542
Stevens and Cook?

363
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:45,621
- M16 assault rifles, standard team issue.
- Right.

364
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,538
Going to fire...

365
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:54,498
I can't feel my legs.

366
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:57,273
Daniel, oh my god.

367
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:58,677
I am sorry.

368
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,135
I shouldn't have brought you here.

369
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,223
Why did you ask about the weapons?

370
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:10,061
Because maybe Mooney and Lang didn't have a back up after at all.

371
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:13,541
What are you talking about? Stevens and Cook were right behind them.

372
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,459
Were they?

373
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:18,616
Cook said there was a fire fight.

374
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:20,302
Yeah, so?

375
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,858
So there were such a vicious exchange of gun fire,

376
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,694
why there aren't more bullet holes.

377
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:28,612
And why are all these bullet holes exact same size?

378
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,058
You lost me.

379
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:34,293
An M16 slot leaves slightly smaller bullet hole than 9 mm.

380
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,722
It's not something you would notice unless you're looking for it.

381
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:39,673
And none of these bullet holes come from the assault weapon.

382
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,512
Stevens and Cook are expert marksman.

383
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:45,062
I've seen them shoot.

384
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:47,898
That box is only thirty yards away.

385
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,899
Yet they miss their target.

386
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:51,759
Why is that?

387
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:53,559
You're saying that they never fired at the shooter.

388
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:54,617
I am saying that maybe,

389
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:58,318
just maybe, who's never shooting in the first place.

390
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,238
Then who killed Daniel?

391
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:03,758
Maybe¡­

392
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:05,821
Stevens and Cook.

393
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:20,091
The birth certificate is from 1974 for a boy named Nicholas.

394
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:23,521
He was born about eight months after Michelle Lucca left the Center.

395
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,077
... thinking what to do with that part of his enemy.

396
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:29,096
Now he gets a son out there.

397
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:30,632
That's just why we should leave him alone.

398
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,779
Give the moral ..., Broots.

399
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:35,735
I wouldn't want anyone from the Center getting involved my daughter's life.

400
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,215
We have to back off, Miss Parker.

401
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:41,958
For Sydney show some testosterone ... you.

402
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:44,475
Must be ... water.

403
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:47,201
Would you put that away?

404
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:56,303
The Center made Michelle disappeared. Don't, don't you think they've done enough to Sydney?

405
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:59,315
I told you this isn't about Sydney. It's about Jarod.

406
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,636
If you say that, I just wonder if you believe it.

407
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:40,037
''Night Vision''

408
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,899
A voice from beyond the grave.

409
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:48,421
This lieutenant Daniel B. Lang. Badge number 44562.

410
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,477
The date is March 4.

411
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,102
The time is eleven eighteen PM.

412
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,743
My location is 570 Franklin Avenue.

413
00:27:57,263 --> 00:28:02,200
I am currently on observations of Officer Stevens, Cooke and Mooney with one fled from here, Petrovka.

414
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,358
the known criminal with ties to the Russian Maffia.

415
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:06,823
And convictions on weapons and drug charges.

416
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:11,053
This is the second meeting which I have witnessed the exchange of money.

417
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:16,496
I plan to turn this surveillance tape over to the District Attorney's office as soon as I collect enough evidence.

418
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,201
I just hope I can stop this before anybody concerned.

419
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:28,793
You may have been too late, Dan.

420
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:31,715
But I won't be.

421
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,216
Nick, you're...

422
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:58,077
When I returned to the Center, your desk has been cleared out, your project reassigned, and your apartment was empty.

423
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,592
You left without a trace.

424
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:02,596
I had only this.

425
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:05,297
Jet'aime.

426
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:10,896
Michelle, if you loved me,

427
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,581
how could you leave without saying goodbye?

428
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:15,696
Because I loved you.

429
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:26,138
I received a copy of a birth certificate.

430
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,479
A boy named Nicholas,

431
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:31,597
born eight months after you left.

432
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:33,760
No father listed.

433
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:35,761
Michelle.

434
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:39,435
Am I the father?

435
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,736
Sydney.

436
00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:44,902
Well, am I?

437
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:54,241
Do you remember that Easter weekend we spent at the cabin?

438
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,780
After a few weeks I got up one morning, I wasn't feeling very well.

439
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:03,282
So I made an appointment with my doctor.

440
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,122
You were pregnant.

441
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,720
I was so excited.

442
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:11,314
For me, for us.

443
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:15,313
I rushed to Blue Cove to tell you. When I got to the Center,

444
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:18,458
I was stopped.

445
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:19,417
By whom?

446
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,255
By a man that I've never even seen before.

447
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,539
I don't know how. But somehow he knew about our child.

448
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,193
He gave me a choice, Sydney.

449
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:39,798
The Center would relocate me,

450
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:43,674
set up a substantial trust fund for Nicholas if¡­

451
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:47,972
I promise never to see you, speak with you again.

452
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:52,515
And if you refused?

453
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,555
He said you would be in a terrible accident.

454
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:59,377
He said the Center couldn't take a chance that you're becoming distracted.

455
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:04,116
compromising your objectivity towards the pretender project.

456
00:31:06,703 --> 00:31:07,982
Sydney, I was afraid.

457
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:19,615
After I left and Nicholas was born.

458
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:23,340
I met someone.

459
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,141
And got married.

460
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,498
He raised our child as his own.

461
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,780
We chose never to tell him the truth.

462
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,201
We can tell him now.

463
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,601
At what cost?

464
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:49,280
He is such a bright, splendid young man with a great future.

465
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:52,281
He is going to be a teacher like you.

466
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:56,841
And he is going to be back in any minute now. I have to go.

467
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:01,772
I hope you understand, Sydney.

468
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:06,820
At least this time, we can say goodbye.

469
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,721
Sydney.

470
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:25,835
The inscription on the watch,

471
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:28,277
I meant it.

472
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:30,902
Forever.

473
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:13,273
I found this in a box full of case files.

474
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,416
Vladimir Petrovka.

475
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:19,939
- He was arrested two years ago by¡­
- Stevens, Cook and Mooney?

476
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:23,382
That's when Petrovka began his relationship with the Turbo Squad.

477
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:25,757
This is before Daniel joined the team.

478
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:28,698
Petrovka got off on a technicality.

479
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:34,840
Now Stevens and the others get paid to tip the Petrovka off about raids.

480
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:39,157
Their father found out and confronted them.

481
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,281
That must the fight the boys overheard.

482
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,718
He was going to turn them in.

483
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,661
So they killed him.

484
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:48,832
It's not over, Liz.

485
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:52,317
Not yet.

486
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,413
Going somewhere?

487
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:56,815
I saw the birth certificate, Sydney.

488
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:05,718
Michelle said the Center threatened to have me killed if I ever found out about my son.

489
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:09,492
She was told to leave. They stole my life, Parker.

490
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:12,181
Just like they stole Jarod's.

491
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:14,135
- And Angelo's and¡­
- Mine?

492
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:20,392
If you leave now,

493
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,993
then you'll never find out who did this.

494
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,756
You're not really gonna leave, are you, Sydney?

495
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,472
Apparently not.

496
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:40,839
If you knew about the birth certificate, why didn't you confront me?

497
00:35:42,503 --> 00:35:43,892
Everyone deserves a life.

498
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:47,997
Even you.

499
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:57,996
So what the hell couldn't you hit the 45?

500
00:35:58,183 --> 00:35:59,502
Get out of here. I don't want you to talk about my target.

501
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,672
- I was talking about your target.
- Oh, no, man.

502
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:03,256
I was talking about your 45, too.

503
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,057
Alright, we'll meet at technical region in the morning.

504
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:06,517
- We'll just have to prove it.
- Yeah.

505
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:09,532
T-14, we have confirmed sighting of ...

506
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:13,153
male matches the description of suspect wanted in the murder of lieutenant Daniel Lang.

507
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:16,058
21B Shore Road, shots happen and fires.

508
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,162
That's the roller rink.

509
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:20,399
Dispatch, dispatch, this is Sergeant Stevens.

510
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,480
- Have I reached you correctly?
- Affirmative.

511
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,415
You have done the same request and ... immediately.

512
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:26,798
Oh, come on. Let's move.

513
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:43,772
Blood.

514
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:46,399
Looks like the cop killer is back.

515
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,041
Alright, we go in together this time.

516
00:36:50,063 --> 00:36:51,596
Jarod, you wait for my call.

517
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:53,441
- What the hell is he doing?
- Forget it. Let's move.

518
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:55,860
Cook, stay with me at point. Mooney, cover our flank.

519
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,560
Yes, sir.

520
00:36:58,523 --> 00:37:00,917
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I. Let's go.

521
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,135
Ready? Go.

522
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:13,916
Jarod, this is Stevens. Respond.

523
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:16,122
Respond, damn it. That's an order!

524
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,040
- Where did he go?
- I'll take care of him later.

525
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,131
Keep your eyes open.

526
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:26,074
Move on.

527
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:38,453
Hold your fire.

528
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:39,854
It's a damn target.

529
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:43,612
What is this?

530
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,481
He is not going down.

531
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,282
I am shooting straight at him

532
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:59,918
Blanks. They are blanks. Somebody switched the armor.

533
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:04,559
Who the hell are you?

534
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:05,260
You know me.

535
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:08,161
I am the man each of you created.

536
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:10,520
The shooter in a baseball cap with a goatee.

537
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:14,514
The man you made up to cover for the murder of Dan Lang.

538
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,180
What are you talking about?

539
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,673
Lieutenant Lange found about your little pay offs from Petrovka.

540
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:27,421
When he confronted you, you killed him with armor piercing shells.

541
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:28,536
Cop killers.

542
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:32,217
It just so happens, I brought some with me tonight.

543
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:37,699
- Stop.
- You set up Lang, didn't you?

544
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,593
- It was Stevens idea.
- Shut up, Mooney.

545
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:42,092
You left two boys without a father, for what?

546
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:43,032
For money?

547
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:56,739
Better hope you don't miss. We'll blow you away just like we did to Lang.

548
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:00,001
Did you get all that, Liz?

549
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:03,012
Every last word.

550
00:39:09,543 --> 00:39:11,392
You got the switch ... this one, didn't you?

551
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,779
What are you gonna do, Jarod? Shoot me?

552
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:19,315
If I go, you go.

553
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,202
It is over, Stevens.

554
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:31,396
He, he is right.

555
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,300
It's gonna enough killing, Stevens.

556
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:54,211
- I'm glad they finally got the hold of Dan's parents.
- Yeah.

557
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:55,973
They'll take the boys back to Seattle.

558
00:39:57,783 --> 00:39:59,394
They seem like very nice people.

559
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:02,631
Jordan and Cody are going to miss you.

560
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,202
The Lang said I can visit anytime I want it.

561
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:10,140
I just wish they are living closer.

562
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,737
Got a lot of ... tell them about their father.

563
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:16,057
You could always move there.

564
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:18,581
And do what?

565
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:22,282
It's not like they need another dispatcher in Seattle.

566
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,956
Oh, it's funny you should mention that.

567
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,457
Because I put a call into the Seattle PD,

568
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:31,234
and just so happen they're looking for a good person to fill a recently vacated switchboard position.

569
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:33,214
So if you want the job,

570
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:35,138
starting in two weeks.

571
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:39,118
Thank you.

572
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:42,477
Oh, no. Thank you.

573
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:44,512
For what?

574
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:49,639
Making sure those kids knew that someone cares about them.

575
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:58,217
- Are you here going home?
- Grandpa and grandma have a farm.

576
00:40:58,503 --> 00:40:59,597
With real horses.

577
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:01,096
Real horses, wow.

578
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:03,838
Listen¡­

579
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:06,275
- Will you make me a promise?
- What?

580
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,658
No matter how busy you are, how crazy your life is getting in the future,

581
00:41:10,223 --> 00:41:11,176
always remember,

582
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:13,040
that your dad loved you very much.

583
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,157
You promise?

584
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:17,858
Promise.

585
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:18,959
Promise.

586
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:41,255
Where is Syd? I haven't seen him all the morning.

587
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:43,438
He said he had something important to do at Albany.

588
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:47,761
Hey, look, Miss Parker.

589
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:50,938
Don't.

590
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:53,118
Back off.

591
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,619
Hey, look.

592
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:03,156
It's chia me.

593
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:05,754
Little less hair than I am used to.

594
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:15,694
Well, like I said before, you never look better.

595
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:23,361
Nice job. See you next time, okay?

596
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:28,213
Erica, I was gonna talk to you about the ... principles.

597
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:31,536
I think you essays could be a little bit more in depth.

598
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,633
Maybe you could look at the third chapter, okay?

599
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:37,603
There is no job more important than teaching.

600
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:41,276
That's what they keep telling me.

601
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:43,560
Enjoy your life.

602
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,561
It passes so quickly.

603
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,942
I'm sorry. Do I know you from somewhere?

604
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:53,882
I am afraid you don't.

605
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,232
This is Sydney.

606
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:09,696
Did you find your son?

607
00:43:10,597 --> 00:43:11,797
Yes, I did.

608
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,679
Did you remember a long time ago, I asked you

609
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:17,013
if a family would ever want me?

610
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:18,679
I do.

611
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,417
I thought it took blood to bond people.

612
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:25,332
But I've learned it also takes something else.

613
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:32,955
It takes love.

614
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:47,179
I hope you are right, Jarod.

615
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,080
''Bulletproof''
