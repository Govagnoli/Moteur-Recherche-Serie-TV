[Man]
Previously on The Pretender.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,396
You people only understand one thing- power.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,635
- Daddy, get back!
- Shoot him!

4
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,957
Welcome back to the Centre, Jarod.

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,925
Settle down or I'll bash you again!

6
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,278
[Sniffs, Sighs]
He still stinks,

7
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,611
On the way to the shower, he freaked.
Thought he was gonna chew my heart out.

8
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,173
It took a little swipe 
from the motivator to calm him down,

9
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,277
[Grunts]

10
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,313
If you don't want to go to the showers,
I'll bring the showers to you.

11
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,827
[Spits]

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,597
[Grunting]

13
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,210
Enough!

14
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,353
We don't want him dead,
just less odiferous,

15
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,879
Clean the filth off yourself,
then do the walls.

16
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,219
- You clean it.
- [Chuckling]

17
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,801
The world is changing.

18
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,135
Mr, Parker is gone,
Mr, Raines is gone,

19
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,802
Miss Parker is...
God only knows where.

20
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,009
But you and I are here...

21
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,015
and I'm in charge.

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,449
[Crackling]

23
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,423
[Gasping]

24
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,429
Like I said, the world's changing.

25
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,957
No! No! No! You bastards!

26
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,401
No! No! No!

27
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,496
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us,

28
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,974
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family,

29
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,240
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others,

30
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,714
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

31
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,219
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

32
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,481
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,854
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be,

34
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,120
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

35
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,355
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused,

36
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,193
[Jarod]
Life's a gift,

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,400
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

38
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,082
No! No! You bastards!

39
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:19,181
That was three weeks ago, Since then we've
been working on making him more manageable,

40
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,227
Why haven't I been allowed to see him?

41
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,728
- Look at him, He was out of control,
- Was?

42
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,892
The world is changing,
and so is Boy Wonder.

43
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,060
[Screaming]

44
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,594
Listen to me, Lyle.
You're a sick man.

45
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,801
I'm a persuasive man.

46
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,371
Jarod? I have a project
that I'd like you to do for me,

47
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,714
Anything you want, Mr. Lyle.

48
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,254
[Sydney]
Brainwashing's not possible with Jarod,

49
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,688
Oh, we all have an Achilles' heel.

50
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,318
In Jarod's case, it's family.

51
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,726
The one he so desperately
wants back,

52
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,459
If you wanna hear about
Mommy and Daddy, just trust me.

53
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,331
[Jarod Crying]

54
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,938
- I love that part.
- Lyle, please let me go to him.

55
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,240
Sydney, if it were up to me, you two
could go on a father-son picnic...

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,511
but the isolation orders come from
the Triumvirate - Big Mutumbo,

57
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,949
I got here as quickly as I could.

58
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,863
Sydney, if you'll excuse me.

59
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,093
We haven't finished talking about Jarod!

60
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,832
Jarod is no longer the most important thing
in the world, and tomorrow he leaves forever.

61
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,933
He's Mutumbo's property, and I, for one,
am not gonna cross that crazy Zulu.

62
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,003
Did you see the look on his face
when he took Raines and my father away?

63
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,110
Just, uh, take in a movie.

64
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,120
Get a massage,

65
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,123
Check out the amputee dwarves
down in SL 6.

66
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,125
Just forget about Jarod.

67
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,958
[Broots]
Yous tole a D.S.A. from Lyle?

68
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,365
Ever since Mutumbo's put
that thumbless maniac in charge...

69
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,461
more bodies have been droppin' around here
than St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

70
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,200
Did he tell you where
Miss Parker's hospitalized?

71
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,300
- No, He played dumb on that too,
- Who's the albino?

72
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,972
Someone more important than Jarod.

73
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,141
[Broots]
Who could be more important than Jarod?

74
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,209
I don't know. Maybe the world
really is changing.

75
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,024
[Man Screaming]

76
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,323
[Man]
Stop the voices!

77
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,933
Nurse, uh, I'm looking for my daughter.

78
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,834
At the end of the hall.

79
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,076
Oh! Oh, my! Oh, my angel!

80
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,141
- [Grunts]
- Daddy?

81
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,277
Where-

82
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,427
Oh! Oh, thank you, Lord.

83
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,089
- My angel, I am so sorry.
- [Monitor Beeping]

84
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,623
- It wasn't your fault.
- It is all my fault.

85
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,104
- Are you okay?
- They kept me drugged in I.C.U. 
for three weeks.

86
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,165
You're the first visitor I've seen.

87
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,472
Yeah. I noticed.

88
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,412
Yeah, it's a damn good thing, angel, huh?

89
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,642
Those bastards don't know where I am.

90
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,207
They don't know I'm here,
and we're gonna keep it that way.

91
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,380
- Where have you been?
- Equatorial Africa.

92
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,118
The Triumvirate must be happy
they got Jarod back.

93
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,126
Oh, yeah, you'd think so.

94
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,027
Instead, they threw
one right nasty soiree...

95
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,587
for me and that wheezing bastard Raines.

96
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,625
- I'm beginning to wonder about his loyalty.
- Beginning to-

97
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:55,436
The bullet in my back was meant for you.

98
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,306
[Chuckling]
Can't kill a Parker. Never.

99
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,710
I got Brigitte out already.
Gotta keep that baby.

100
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,976
Gotta have that baby, especially alive.

101
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,518
Daddy, what the hell's going on?

102
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,488
Same as usual-Jarod.
He's the key to our survival- all of us.

103
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,617
- Oh, can't talk. Not here. Not now.
- You're scaring me.

104
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,754
Oh, we can't have that. I mean,
that's what they want. Can't have that.

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,821
Can't give them the edge.

106
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,459
- [Clears Throat]
- She's not supposed to have visitors.

107
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,595
- I was just leaving.
- Me too. I'm discharging myself.

108
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,504
- Only your psychiatrist can discharge you.
- The psychiatrist?

109
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,508
I was shot!

110
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,342
Since when do headshrinkers
use scalpels?

111
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,574
[Man]
I want my mommy!

112
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,482
Oh, she probably went to call somebody.

113
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,521
I hope I can trust you
not to tell anybody I was here.

114
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,886
Daddy, don't leave me.

115
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,482
I'll come back when I can explain. Huh?

116
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,553
Oh, who was that, uh, playwright
with the white beard?

117
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,065
Your mother used to read him
all the time-with all that punctuation.

118
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,227
- Shaw?
- Yeah, well, whatever.

119
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,737
Listen, there's a quote
I want you to remember.

120
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,137
"A family is a tyranny...

121
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,201
ruled over by its weakest member,"

122
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,214
Its weakest member.
Don't forget that.

123
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,513
Oh, Daddy.

124
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,214
Daddy, Daddy,

125
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,724
# Kri kra toad's foot #

126
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,525
# Geese walk barefoot #

127
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,932
So what's in store tonight?
Another date with Mr. Lyle's jumper cable?

128
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,163
Different game this time, Jarod,

129
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,071
- Are we taking another trip?
- This time it's not so dependable,

130
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,907
Vaccines.
Hepatitis "A," malaria, typhoid.

131
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,548
- Africa.
- You are as smart as they say.

132
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,176
- Lot of good it's done me lately.
- Arm.

133
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,555
[Grunts]

134
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,387
# Kri kra toad's foot #

135
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,950
[Sydney]
Tell me where Jarod is, Angelo,

136
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,019
Find him for me,

137
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,075
Hey. What's goin' on?

138
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:15,944
I'm using Angelo's empathetic abilities to try
and determine where Jarod is being kept.

139
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,416
How does the, uh, freak
with the Flowbee fit in?

140
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,454
In case of suspicions, I wanted
the lab to be business as usual,

141
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,512
Ah. Usual.

142
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,294
- Sydney. Scared.
- Yes, Angelo.

143
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,354
Sydney is scared
that he'll never see Jarod again.

144
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,094
Empath Jarod. Tell me where
they're holding him,

145
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,762
- [Broots] Any luck?
- Not yet. You?

146
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,398
I found some bread crumbs
that may lead us to Miss Parker.

147
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,274
A short call comes in at the exact same time
from a hospital 50 miles west of here,

148
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,107
- Patient update.
- Exactly,

149
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,946
Before I could track where the calls went to,
Lyle's albino came blustering in.

150
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,009
Something about
a priority communication,

151
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,281
Something called Si- Silence.

152
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,289
Silence, huh?

153
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,129
[Angelo]
Angelo happy. Find Jarod.

154
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,364
If you wanna hear about
Mommy and Daddy, just trust me.

155
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,286
[Whispering]
Jarod. Jarod.

156
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,348
- Sydney.
- Are you okay?

157
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,561
Is it true?

158
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,622
- Is it true that they captured
my father and the boy?
- Did Lyle tell you that?

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,296
He said only one of them survived,
and I'd find out which one in Africa...

160
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,362
if I cooperate.

161
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,136
- You trust Lyle?
- Don't you?

162
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,040
[Door Opens]

163
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,739
Well, don't you, Sydney?

164
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,977
I see even you found this needle
in our little haystack,

165
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,041
I wonder how.

166
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,847
I never liked you.

167
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,051
I 'm not even sure
what the hell you are.

168
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,356
Come on, Jarod. Time to go.

169
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,765
No injections this time, Jarod.

170
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,429
- [Pills Rattling]
- Sedatives.

171
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,665
- Jarod.
- It's okay, Sydney.

172
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,408
- I prefer to sleep through this.
- Jarod, don't!

173
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,947
Lyle, I won't allow this!

174
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,415
Deny it as sweet sorrow
if you want, Sydney...

175
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,113
but you two are parting,
so be a man.

176
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,178
Say adios.

177
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,594
Good-bye, Sydney.

178
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,758
Tongue? That-a-boy.

179
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,201
Uh, Sydney? Put him away.

180
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,611
Jarod's soul is clouded,

181
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,452
His mind is still sharp.

182
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,927
Good night, sweet prince,

183
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,399
We're good to go.

184
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,801
The tower called, We have a priority
passenger to be dropped off,

185
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,896
Level "A" project called Silence.

186
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,909
Until we cross the Atlantic,
we're not stoppin' anywhere for anyone.

187
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,911
[Man]
Mr, Lyle says we are,

188
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,279
I'll tell you where we're going
when we get in the air.

189
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,968
Yes, Mr, Lyle, I have the blueprints
and everything I need,

190
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,104
Tell our clients at Raylor that as soon
as our inside person gets the E.T.A...

191
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,172
Silence will go down flawlessly this time.

192
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,846
Well, the C-4 will catalyze the on-site
accelerant and burn white hot,

193
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,856
Even if someone could dig
through the debris...

194
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,654
our corporate customers
can rest assured...

195
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,322
there'll be no trace of even 
the timing device that survives.

196
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:29,066
Oh, I guarantee you- there'll be
no trace left of the Nash family...

197
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,498
or anyone else
who happens to be in that building.

198
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:37,268
Any residual fallout will just help to mask
the I.D.'s of our intended targets,

199
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,976
I'll contact you when I'm in place.

200
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:51,684
- Haven't you people destroyed enough lives?
- What the hell's goin' on?

201
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:55,020
If a bullet penetrates the jet's skin,
it can explode,

202
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,325
Not if something plugs the hole.

203
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:11,430
[Alarm Beeping]

204
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,137
Come on! Come on!

205
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:39,435
- [Gasps]
- Good morning, sweet prince.

206
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,904
Fortunately, I was able to land 
the plane in almost one piece,

207
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,873
My lucky day.

208
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,073
Where's Mr. White?

209
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:53,640
He disappeared. Any idea where
he might have disappeared to?

210
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,651
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

211
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:08,654
[Lyle] Yes, Mutumbo, I understand clearly
every word that you are saying...

212
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:12,065
and I assure you that the irony
of Jarod's escape is not lost on me either.

213
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,966
[Mutumbo On Phone]
Sir, are you being facetious?

214
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:17,302
Facetious? No. No.
Of course I'm not being facetious, sir.

215
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,638
[Mutumbo]
You understand?

216
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,837
Yes, I understand the importance of
reacquiring Jarod as it relates 
to Silence, sir...

217
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,939
but, as you know,
we have an inside person,

218
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:30,419
So, our friends at Raylor can rest assured
that the project will not be compromised.

219
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:33,752
- [Mutumbo] It better not be.
- Yes, sir, You have my word,

220
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:38,021
- All right.
- It seems like the world 
hasn't changed so much.

221
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,028
Okay, Sydney,
you were right, and I was wrong.

222
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:42,963
But I would rather be alive and wrong
than dead right.

223
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,297
And if we don't get Jarod back...

224
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:48,132
I'm not the only one Mutumbo's
gonna personally reeducate.

225
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,309
- Oh. Oh, sorry for bursting in.
- What?

226
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:56,607
You won't believe who I just saw
walkin' around the hallways alive as day.

227
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,242
I mean, rumor has it he's supposed
to be dead, but he's, uh, not.

228
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,944
[Wheezing]

229
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,216
Glad to disappoint you.

230
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,350
Huh.
[Gasps]

231
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:14,295
It's good to be back
in the bosom of the Centre.

232
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:16,696
God bless you all!

233
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,493
Now, let's go catch Jarod.

234
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,504
Amen.

235
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:39,380
A Ph.D. in nuclearphysics from M.I.T. and a
doctorate in radio isotopic design from USC,

236
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,447
That's a pretty impressive sheepskin.

237
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:45,187
You see what they look like on the Internet,
press print, and you're somebody else.

238
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,628
Oh, uh, Jeanie,
this is Dr. Jarod Hickum.

239
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:50,393
Helped design the propulsion system
on the Cassini probe for NASA.

240
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,958
- Nice to meet you.
- Weren't those Russian-made reactors?

241
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,163
I believe that you're thinking
of the TOPAZ II.

242
00:17:55,238 --> 00:18:00,039
The Cassini's reactors were Chandon designed,
with 72 pounds of 238 at the core.

243
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,102
Well, I hope your expertise can help us
with the Neptune probe.

244
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,170
We're, um, three months
behind schedule.

245
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:07,876
And we've lost our two
best researchers.

246
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,419
[Jarod]
Well, I'm here to do everything I can,

247
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:15,186
[Monitor Beeping]

248
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:18,250
Sydney,

249
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,956
Miss Parker.

250
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:24,262
Miss Parker, we've been searching
everywhere for you.

251
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,529
- Thank God you're-
- Alive? Hardly.

252
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:30,471
And these morons in here
won't let me out,

253
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,067
Oh, I get my strength back,
I swear I'm going postal.

254
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,078
That's what they're afraid of.

255
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:39,138
According to this chart,
you were admitted under a suicide watch.

256
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:42,116
Suicide? I was shot in the back!

257
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:45,120
- Only your next of kin can okay your discharge.
- Next of kin.

258
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:47,554
Parker, have you heard
from your father?

259
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:54,821
- No.
- Well, somebody sure wants 
to keep you in here.

260
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:58,994
- Yeah, the wheezing sack of bones Raines.
- I'm not certain that's right.

261
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,663
Raines may have spent some time
on Mutumbo's side of the street...

262
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:04,263
but he's acting more like he's been
in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.

263
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,276
- He found religion- or it was given to him.
- I don't buy it.

264
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:10,006
There's somethin' goin' down at the Centre,
and they don't want me around.

265
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,948
Lyle keeps saying, "The world is changing."
Besides Raines's rebirth, Jarod has escaped.

266
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:18,147
Lyle has some albino running
a priority project called Silence,

267
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:20,519
I gotta get outta here.
[Groans]

268
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,753
You still need rest.
At least another 24 hours.

269
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:27,991
Twenty-four hours, and then
I'm blowin' this CAT scan stand.

270
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:31,966
I want you to find out everything you can
about the albino and Silence.

271
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:35,004
They may have me down,
but I'll be damned if I'm out. Go!

272
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,036
[Chattering]

273
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:11,897
- Jarod, What are you doing here?
- Jeanie. Hi.

274
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:15,308
I was trying to get a leg up on things and I
thought I would go straight to the source.

275
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:18,176
What part of the project
were the Nashes working on?

276
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,842
They were heading up the research
for Raylor Corporation's propulsion system.

277
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,751
They made some incredible discoveries
with multiple applications,

278
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:27,312
But most of their work
was sealed after the accident.

279
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,157
- Accident?
- Yeah, a freak thing.

280
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:35,254
Their sailboat blew up while in port
in the Caribbean. A gas leak or something.

281
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,663
- I can't believe they're dead.
- Maybe they're not.

282
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,701
Who sealed the data?

283
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:47,265
The word was it all went to
the Department of Energy office in Albany.

284
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,174
- [Phone Ringing]
- This is Sydney,

285
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:59,654
I hear silence is golden,
especially at the Centre,

286
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:04,056
There is a project called Silence,
but God only knows what it is.

287
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,561
- Is that Mr. Broots I hear?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

288
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:09,462
Deviated septum. Right nostril.

289
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,729
Well, I did get beaned with
an Etch A Sketch when I was seven-

290
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:15,100
What can you tell me about Silence?

291
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:18,572
Just that Lyle and some weird-looking
albino guy were talkin' about it.

292
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,632
[Jarod]
Ah, yes, The white-haired man,

293
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,543
He and I shared
some frequent-flyermiles,

294
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:27,572
I can't talk to you about this. We're-
We're supposed to be tryin' to catch you.

295
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,982
I know where you live, Mr. Broots.

296
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,385
Even if we did find something out
about Silence-

297
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,548
You don't know
what's going on around here.

298
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:37,559
I mean, they turned Mr. Raines
into Pat Robertson.

299
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:41,222
Silence is about the Centre killing
a man, woman and their child,

300
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:44,164
Now, Lyle and the albino have
an inside person helping them,

301
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,828
My guess is someone
within the Department of Energy,

302
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,838
- I need help finding out who.
- We'll do our best.

303
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:52,670
Well, you'd better,
because if you don't...

304
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,733
an innocent family is going to die.

305
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,346
[Beeps]

306
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,610
[Siren Blaring]

307
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:07,713
So, who's this new hot shot
joining the Nash detail, Inspector?

308
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,282
His name is Jarod Watts,
but he is hardly a hotshot.

309
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:14,421
Bottom third in college,
barely squeak-by I.Q

310
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:17,466
This guy has been bounced around from
one mediocre assignment to the next,

311
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:21,436
- But he has one thing
on his resume that none of us have.
- [Woman] What's that?

312
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,768
- The same last name as the undersecretary.
- Son?

313
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,308
- Nephew.
- Oh.

314
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:28,708
I'm sorry I'm, uh, late.

315
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,974
So-

316
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:35,814
Sorry. Uh, Jarod Watts.

317
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:39,321
The reason I'm late is I was doing
a little boning up on that Nash thing,

318
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:44,383
The "Nash thing" is a P-1
Witness Protection transfer, Watts,

319
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,328
- Please don't forget that.
- Uh, yes, sir.

320
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:50,525
- Now then-
- [Loud Clattering]

321
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:56,466
Agent Timson will continue to be point
on the Clare Nash protection team...

322
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,804
up until she is reunited
with husband and daughter.

323
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:02,868
I'll be maintaining a Code 3
security status on the Nash woman.

324
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:05,744
Excuse me,
Uh, isn't a Code 3 a little bit thin?

325
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:08,079
That's the idea, Watts,

326
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:12,417
You see, a Code 3 provides protection
without drawing undue attention...

327
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:15,548
to the location
said witness is being held,

328
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,992
- It's really quite effective.
- Yes, sir. Code 3.

329
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:21,428
[Chuckling]
Agent Carlson.

330
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:25,558
Please, try to bring Watts up
to speed on the "Nash thing,"

331
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,728
I'll tolerate no mistakes,

332
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:30,102
That's lunch.

333
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:48,251
Angel, it's Daddy. I looked for you
at the hospital, but you're gone.

334
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:51,418
You can't keep a Parker underwraps.
No, sirree.

335
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:53,962
Uh, what I need to tell you
has to be said face-to-face,

336
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,692
I'll be at your place tonight at 9:00,

337
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:59,462
Now, you be alone, Erase this tape,

338
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:02,003
I wouldn't want
the wrong people showin'up,

339
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:05,472
Wrong people. Raines.

340
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,104
[Carlson] The Nashes'nuclear research
for the Raylor Corporation...

341
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,513
was supposed to be strictly
for space propulsion applications.

342
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:17,985
But when they suspected Raylor was sellin'
their work for weapons applications...

343
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:20,386
they decided to blow the whistle
to the D.O.E.

344
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,289
- That's when someone
tried to kill them on the boat.
- Are there any leads?

345
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,350
None. Completely professional job.

346
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,760
- It turned out to be almost 
as good as killing them.
- How's that?

347
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,857
Well, the Nashes got separated in the mayhem,
and it drove them underground.

348
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,926
Until the D.O.E. found Jason Nash
and his daughter living in the Caribbean.

349
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,995
They were placed in protective custody,

350
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:41,772
Jason Nash said he'd testify if his wife was
found and they were reunited as a family.

351
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:44,472
We just recently found Clare,

352
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,141
Tomorrow at 3:00 we bring them all back
together at the Atomic Research Lab.

353
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,741
Family reunited, family talks.

354
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:58,926
Family talks, family dies.

355
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:06,662
My work here is my life, I've spent years
here doing the work of the Lord,

356
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:10,934
Raines, it's time for you
to pay for killing my mother,

357
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:13,032
Say your prayers, you son of a bitch.

358
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:16,977
Miss Parker, I'd like to introduce
Father Connelley.

359
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:20,015
- He was a friend of your mother's,
- How do you do?

360
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:26,815
I look forward to you continuing
with your good work, Mr. Raines.

361
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,055
What's your good work?

362
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:35,120
Free exorcisms for the whack jobs
in Renewal?

363
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,892
Do you believe in miracles, Miss Parker?

364
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:47,435
I believe in revenge.

365
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,379
Now tell me,
why did you try and kill Daddy?

366
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:57,648
A selfish, misguided act.

367
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:02,847
But it came from above,
as God is my witness.

368
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,257
This kindness crap
may slay 'em at the parish potluck...

369
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:11,095
but it ain't cuttin' it with me.

370
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,328
Then I'll turn the other cheek.

371
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:22,405
Miss Parker,
those miracles I mentioned-

372
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:27,872
they begin with... love.

373
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:35,719
When I find out what you're up to...

374
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:40,024
it's gonna take a hell of a lot more
than a prayer to save your sorry ass.

375
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,298
Thank you, but I'm not hungry,

376
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,468
Mrs. Nash won't eat?

377
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,340
- She's a little freaked out,
- Let me try.

378
00:26:55,978 --> 00:27:00,540
I know it's not gourmet,
but you really should eat.

379
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:02,982
- It will help you keep your strength up.
- No.

380
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:05,879
- Thank you though,
- I understand.

381
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,914
When I was a kid...

382
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:14,289
in the place I grew up in,
I never wanted to eat either.

383
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,555
Why was that, Agent Watts?

384
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:20,621
Because it wasn't my body
that needed nourishing.

385
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,361
It was my heart.

386
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:27,804
There wasn't a meal satisfying enough
or a room safe enough...

387
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:32,242
to help me stop missing the family
that I wanted to be with so badly.

388
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,302
Well, where's your family now?

389
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,780
I don't know.

390
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:41,149
It's the not knowing, the waiting,
that's the hardest part,

391
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,951
But while you wait,
maybe this can help,

392
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,824
C-Courtney gave me this
for Mother's Day.

393
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,991
I thought I lost it forever.

394
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,934
Tomorrow you'll be back together
with the real thing.

395
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:00,801
I promise you.

396
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:12,681
I miss the days
when the people I couldn't trust...

397
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:16,953
were the people I couldn't trust.

398
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:19,889
You've obviously met
the new Mr. Raines, Miss Parker.

399
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,950
Now meet Mr. White.
He reports to Lyle.

400
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:25,690
Since when does anybody
report to my brother?

401
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:28,790
Since the Triumvirate gave him
his own covert team a few years ago.

402
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,461
His latest project is called Silence.

403
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:34,370
It's a corporate-sponsored Centre hit
on a couple research scientists.

404
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,240
Jarod was on that plane with White
when it went down.

405
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,838
He knows those innocent people will die
if he doesn't stop him. You know he'll try.

406
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:45,679
- If Jarod's going, then so am I.
- Hmm.

407
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:50,085
Miss Parker's gonna want to off herself
when she hears this one,

408
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:52,385
- Can anybody spare a noose?
- Miss Parker!

409
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:56,394
- Is your nose whistling?
- I have a deviated septum.

410
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,521
You know, Mr. Parker couldn't
have been the next ofkin...

411
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,067
to have you committed in that hospital
on that suicide watch.

412
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:06,901
The dates don't square, Mutumbo
had already siphoned away Mr, Parker,

413
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:10,567
So, the next of kin
would had to have been-

414
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:14,373
Lyle. Lyle trapped me there.

415
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:21,711
Daddy?

416
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:23,721
Daddy!

417
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:42,132
I'm sorry I can't be there to talk to you
face-to-face, but, uh, plans change, huh?

418
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:46,371
After all, it is the Centre, right?

419
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:50,575
Now, I don't have a whole hell
of a lot of time, so pay attention.

420
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,285
The world is changing.

421
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:57,288
The Centre is changing.
I am changing.

422
00:29:57,356 --> 00:30:01,486
And you? You have to ride
all this crazy stuff out, see?

423
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,461
Just, uh, ride her out.
Don't try to find us.

424
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,489
And above all else, angel,
watch out for yourself.

425
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:11,934
Don't forget-
"A family is a tyranny"-

426
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:13,938
"Ruled over by its weakest member."

427
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:16,736
Thank God you're safe.
You had me worried.

428
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:20,505
About what? That suicidal sis might
play a little game of razor roulette?

429
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,843
The suicide watch was
for your own protection.

430
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:25,577
- Oh.
- Not perfect, but it was all I could think of.

431
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:28,950
The more the others thought you were
a non factor, the safer you'd be.

432
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,717
- Others?
- The same ones that got to Raines...

433
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,781
that put the scare into our father.

434
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,327
Which conveniently put you in charge.

435
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:39,330
Mutumbo snaps, I jump. Guilty.

436
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:44,392
You and your team-
I know all about your covert division.

437
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:47,529
Mr. White. Silence.

438
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:49,665
Good, because I need your help.

439
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:53,074
Look, I'm being straight here.

440
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,613
Silence is a Level "A" contract.

441
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:58,946
The last thing I needed was for Jarod
to escape and make this his cause.

442
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:00,814
Careful. You're sweating.

443
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,946
Well, with Jarod hovering,
I'd be stupid not to.

444
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:07,685
You botch a Level "A,"
and you'll need my prayers, not my help.

445
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:10,821
I need my sister.

446
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,887
I've always been a survivor, Parker...

447
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,957
but in the past year
since I found my father and you...

448
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:20,061
I- I've realized it's not just me
against the world.

449
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,436
I hear the world's changing.

450
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,203
One look into Dad's eyes confirms it.

451
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:28,576
Despite that, the Centre's
always been about Parkers,

452
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:31,707
And like it or not, you and I are it.

453
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:34,581
Let's fight for it, for us-

454
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,147
for him.

455
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:18,458
[Chiming]

456
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,472
Timson,

457
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:40,212
Timson!

458
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:48,759
- [Grunts]
- Where is she? Where's Clare now?

459
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:52,126
Jarod! Gone. She's been taken out
to go meet her husband and daughter.

460
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:54,927
- You weren't told about the schedule change?
- No, I wasn't.

461
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,525
Out of the blue, the transfer orders
were moved up to noon.

462
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,593
- Timson.
- Yeah. They were his orders.

463
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:02,401
When I asked for details,
he said it was "need to know only."

464
00:33:02,474 --> 00:33:05,466
Guess Timson doesn't think
you and I need to.

465
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,875
Glad to see you've decided
to take up the fight.

466
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:18,753
I didn't come to help you.
I came to recapture Jarod.

467
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:25,047
[Beeping]

468
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,617
- It won't be long now, Mrs. Nash.
- Thank you.

469
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,525
[Man On Radio]
Agent Blaine,

470
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,860
- We're in position.
- Roger that,

471
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:37,834
- Sir, "B" Team has Mr. Nash
and their little girl in position.
- Very good.

472
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:43,099
[Door Opens]

473
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:49,077
Well, this is an honor.

474
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:51,672
Murderers have no honor.

475
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,981
No, no, no. Meeting you.

476
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,078
I mean, my God, you're Jarod.

477
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:02,084
Didn't have much chance
to talk on the plane,

478
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,720
By the way, I owe you
for some great, great flying.

479
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:07,594
- Thought I was toast,
- Where's the bomb?

480
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:10,863
You know where the bomb is,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

481
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,268
Now, that said, I'm leaving,

482
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:16,569
- I don't live, I don't get paid.
- You're not going anywhere.

483
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:19,906
Was it good seeing your dad again?

484
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:23,141
I mean, you just beat me to him.

485
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:25,274
But, hey, he's now out there again...

486
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,444
and it kind of keeps me in business,
you know what I mean?

487
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,181
Business?

488
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,917
I'm a finder. Missing families
are kind of my niche.

489
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:35,619
And yours is a full-time job, brother.

490
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:39,754
What are you getting at?

491
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:42,595
Well, just that occasionally Mr. Lyle...

492
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:47,195
will, uh, pay me for special projects,

493
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:53,840
Take your sister, Emily, for example,

494
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:55,903
What do you know about my sister?

495
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:59,382
That she adores yellow tulips,
she hates cruelty to animals...

496
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,181
she's smart, she's funny...

497
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:05,417
she's tortured
by the tragedies of her family,,,

498
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,483
and that she has the cutest
little tattoo just above her-

499
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:12,428
Uh-uh-uh!
Her last known address is in here.

500
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:15,830
There might even be some tidbits
about dear old Mom too,

501
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,892
Shame to see it all go poof,

502
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,802
There may be time for you
to save that family upstairs...

503
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:23,864
maybe even time for you
to save this family in here.

504
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:27,343
But you do not get me in the package.

505
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,437
I'll see you on down the road,

506
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:31,607
No, No!

507
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:33,617
[Grunts]

508
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:44,517
We'll have a better chance
of catching Jarod if we split up,

509
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,463
You three take the interior,
and I'll cover outside.

510
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,830
Fine.

511
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,379
Can I see my husband
and daughter now?

512
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,045
Soon. Very soon, ma'am.
Very soon, ma'am.

513
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,783
- [Rings]
- Oh, excuse me. This is Timson.

514
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,825
Yes, sir, Absolutely, sir,

515
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:17,623
If I'm not back in, uh, five minutes...

516
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,960
go ahead and bring in
Nash and the girl.

517
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,965
- It won't be long now, ma'am.
- Thanks.

518
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,127
- Sure.
- Oh, there you are.

519
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,137
What the hell are you doing here?

520
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:30,504
I just came from
Inspector Wocheck's office.

521
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:33,305
He suspects there's a contract out
on Mrs. Nash's life...

522
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,869
and they think the hitter
might be within the D.O.E.

523
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:38,313
Ah. Uh, Blaine,
you and Jarod here keep watch.

524
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,874
I'm going out to the mobile unit
to contact the inspector,

525
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:43,113
- I can save you that trip, sir.
- No, I gotta go.

526
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:46,316
I nspector Wocheck is gonna call me
on this cell phone at 12:00 sharp.

527
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:50,521
- That's only a few minutes away.
- I have to review the placement
of my agent perimeters.

528
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:52,825
- You can use my walkie, sir,
- I don't want to use your damn walkie!

529
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,024
Speak when you're spoken to, Agent,
Excuse me,

530
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,068
Is there something the matter?

531
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,899
- No.
- You seem like you're
in a hurry to get somewhere.

532
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:02,667
- What the hell's wrong with this thing?
- Nothing.

533
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,676
It's just, uh-
Well, it's, uh-it's locked,

534
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,872
- Open it.
- What's the rush?

535
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:11,541
Open the damn door! Now!

536
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:14,517
I-I don't understand. I-
What's the problem?

537
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:20,256
The problem is, if you don't open the door,
we're gonna blow up, you idiot!

538
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:26,093
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, you mean this thing I found is a bomb?

539
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,530
- [Beeping]
- Do something!

540
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,763
- Kaboom!
- [Screams]

541
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:35,636
I find it interesting that you knew
there was a bomb in the building...

542
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:37,766
but you didn't bother to tell anybody.

543
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:41,073
You were going to allow
an innocent family to die-

544
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,979
and your own men- in an explosion.

545
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,415
And for what?

546
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:50,477
Agent Blaine?
Get him out of here.

547
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:52,716
It would be my pleasure, Jarod.

548
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:06,426
I think you're here
to see some special people.

549
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:08,802
Yeah.

550
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:10,864
[Gasps]
Oh, my baby!

551
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:13,172
[Jarod]
There's a brown sedan in the parking lot,

552
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:16,304
Here's all the information you need
to start your new life.

553
00:39:16,381 --> 00:39:19,509
You'll be safe. I promise you.

554
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:23,076
- But- But who are you?
- No, it's all right. We can trust him.

555
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:29,622
Oh, Jarod, I hope that one day you
and your family can feel this moment too.

556
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,185
[Kisses, Chuckles]

557
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,696
- Good luck.
- Bye.

558
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:06,620
- Parker.
- Our work's done here.

559
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,962
What, he got away? How?

560
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:12,726
You shouldn't underestimate Jarod.
Mm-mmm.

561
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:16,763
And you should never
underestimate me.

562
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:20,333
And the next time that you send me
into a building that's gonna explode...

563
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,402
it had better blow...

564
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
because if it doesn't,
it's gonna be your gray matter...

565
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:28,517
they'll be mopping up
with a toothbrush.

566
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:30,747
By the way,
Jarod left you something.

567
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,128
[Mr, Parker On Answering Machine]
Oh, my angel,

568
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,897
God, I'm sorry I missed you.
I wanted to hear your voice. Needed to.

569
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,461
Now, if you don't hear from me,
don't you worry,

570
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,600
Brigitte and I are safe,
At least I think I am,

571
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:54,907
It's always when you think you are,
that's when you're the most vulnerable,

572
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:57,209
Now, don't you make
the same mistake I did,

573
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:01,048
Now, don't expose the soft underbelly,
They target that,

574
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,954
No, no, no, You catch Jarod
and never, ever let him go,

575
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:09,687
Damn it! He's the key,
He's the only key, Always has been,

576
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,924
And there's one last thing-
[Sighs]

577
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:16,091
'Cause I know you're tough,
I'm not worried,

578
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,158
You watch your back at the Centre,

579
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,227
Nobody's what they seem to be,

580
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:25,607
There's no soul in that place-
not one- that you can trust...

581
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:28,840
with the possible exception
of your brother,

582
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:38,045
[Chattering]

583
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:47,463
Who the hell are you?

584
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:51,491
My name is Jarod.
Have you seen this woman?

585
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:56,233
- Like I said, who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother.

586
00:41:56,307 --> 00:42:00,266
Damn, She's gonna be sorry
she missed you, but she just left today,

587
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:06,011
She wouldn't say where. Sort of like 
she thought someone was followin' her. 
Sweet girl.

588
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:08,416
- Was she alone?
- Yeah, but she didn't want to be.

589
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:11,580
She was searchin' for her family.
Said she was determined to find them.

590
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,920
Like I said...

591
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,654
she'd be sorry
if she knew she missed you.

592
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:18,662
Yeah.

593
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:26,493
[Electricity Crackling]

594
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:32,399
[Rings]

595
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,112
What?

596
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,671
At least we put
one family back together.

597
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,844
- While mine got ripped apart again.
- I know the feeling.

598
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,913
You know, Jarod, maybe Lyle's right.
Maybe the world is changing.

599
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,481
It doesn't seem to matter
how much it changes.

600
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,187
It's still the same for us.

601
00:42:52,764 --> 00:42:54,755
We're still alone in it.

9999
