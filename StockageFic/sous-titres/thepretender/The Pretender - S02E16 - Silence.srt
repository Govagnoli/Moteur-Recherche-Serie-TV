1
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,818
Jarod, you've done this a dozen time before.

2
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,971
Choose a photo and become the person.

3
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:19,699
Jarod has been uncommunicable before, but never ... in such a routine exercise.

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:21,939
And never in such severe results.

5
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,018
Your merchandise is...

6
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:41,419
fascinating.

7
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:42,920
That's the word Jarod used.

8
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,821
It was blown away by all the stuff we made.

9
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,582
He even tried us to hang his mirrors.

10
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,457
wood base, ..., the shattered ... especially.

11
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:50,892
Ah, this is weird.

12
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:54,374
That is twisted.

13
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,178
You think that is twisted, come and see this.

14
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,374
Jarod's own house of mirrors.

15
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:06,896
Jarod would stay here for hours, just staring at themselves and working.

16
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,092
Check this out!

17
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,243
Jarod made that.

18
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,044
He said it'll give him another look into his soul.

19
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:24,695
The child development,

20
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:27,622
mirror stages where he was born.

21
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,776
Child realizes it's distinct from his mother.

22
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:33,418
- Identity begins.
- What's it mean?

23
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:39,499
Jarod's attempting to reconstruct a shattered personality

24
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:41,376
A shattered life.

25
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:50,818
Is everything ok in here?

26
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:52,899
Fine.

27
00:01:58,543 --> 00:01:59,462
Hi, Nickie!

28
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,611
Nickie, get down!

29
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:14,282
It's ok. It's ok, Nickie. It's ok.

30
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:21,532
It's ok.

31
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:22,533
Hey, baby.

32
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,434
There are pretenders among us.

33
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,622
I was taken from my family.

34
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:33,260
Thirty-Six Hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

35
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,856
How many people died because of what I thought up?

36
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:39,973
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

37
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,742
He is a pretender.

38
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,982
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

39
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,614
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

40
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:49,662
He defends the weak and the abused.

41
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:51,137
Life is a gift.

You are a doctor?

46
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:04,498
I am, today.

00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,282
Dr. Leary.

50
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:34,736
Actually, it's agent Leary.

51
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,771
Special Agent Roger Bingham.

52
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,291
This is Andrew Stess.

53
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,572
Ah, it's nice to meet you, agent Stess.

54
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,093
I heard you're on here 30 seconds before the bullet started flying,

55
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,055
and you were the one that jumped on the kid.

56
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:46,612
Lucky time, I guess.

57
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:48,495
I guess you gonna won a medal.

58
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:50,456
Actually I was just doing my job.

59
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,017
Meaning we weren't?

60
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:58,015
Listen, Freud, it's bad enough Davis thinks someone in the department is leaking safe house location.

61
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:01,454
We don't need him riding us because some outsider did our job.

62
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,741
You wanna be a hero? Go and do it on somebody else's watch.

63
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,780
- Jarod, what are you still doing here?
- Mr. Davis.

64
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,893
Starting to sigh which word comes with worse: the ambush last night or Bingham and Stess.

65
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:17,678
Look, we're all under a lot of pressure.

66
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:21,994
Unless that crab-louse testifies what he saw because drug dealer will sell the rest drugs away.

67
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:23,219
What's all these?

68
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,202
Nickie was traumatized by what he witnessed.

69
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:28,016
These can help open him up and bring him out of silence.

70
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:32,558
The kid watch Emilio Vasquez execute one of our best DEA agents and detectives.

71
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,918
Men of Vasquez hit him and tried to kill him.

72
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,419
And you think a damn slinky is gonna help him talk?

73
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,073
Well, it's not that simplistic.

74
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:41,474
You see studies have shown if you take a child which has been¡­

75
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,222
Listen, not personal. Doc. But between you and me,

76
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,539
give you damn about your studies.

77
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,736
You've got two days to make the kid talk,

78
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,456
after that I'll do it in my way.

79
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,658
Angelo has been moved.

80
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:17,175
Do you know anything about that, Miss Parker?

81
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,018
Are you talking to me?

82
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,180
Exactly one hour after he was moved,

83
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:24,136
I was notified I'm under Tower review.

84
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:30,652
As we speak, they've set cleaners scour in my personal files, my office, everything.

85
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,538
I'm crying on the inside.

86
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,462
If you sessions don't happen without a directive.

87
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,301
If I find out you are behind this...

88
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,936
You'll what?

89
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,934
Throw me in front of another T-board?

90
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,221
What secrets are you protecting, Dr. Raines?

91
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,138
The same ones as my mother found?

92
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,654
The ones that got her killed?

93
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:58,055
Maybe they'll get Angelo to talk.

94
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:00,140
Or is it Timmy?

95
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,541
Nickie, I think we will be safe in here.

96
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,542
Thanks.

97
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,243
Hi, Carla.

98
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,244
Hi.

99
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:20,545
Hi, Nikkie.

100
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,682
Wow, these are great toys.

101
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,193
This, my friend, is my own personal special toys.

102
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,714
You certain can play with whatever you want.

103
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:34,339
I've got a Mr. Potato Head,

104
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:36,376
a Magic 8-ball...

105
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:39,253
And this is my personal favorite.

106
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:48,259
You know, I've never seen a shrink wear a gun before.

107
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,599
Well, by definition I am a psychological reconstructionist.

108
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,981
I use memory and emotion to unlock the truth

109
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,658
when somebody is suffering from post traumatic stress.

110
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,302
Can you give me back my son?

111
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:05,762
That's the idea.

112
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,932
Carla, in order for me to rebuild his memories,

113
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,858
I have to reconstruct the events of what happened that day.

114
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:13,759
Yeah.

115
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,494
I worked as a nurse.

116
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,778
I had a few hours before my shift started so

117
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,697
I decided to take Nickie and Charlie to the Laundromat.

118
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:23,938
Charlie?

119
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,052
It's Nickie's cat.

120
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,992
I put Nickie in the chair,

121
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,051
gave him some chocolate milk.

122
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,581
I turned to load the machine,

123
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,360
and I started talking to another woman.

124
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,415
I lost track of time.

125
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:44,656
And later I heard this poping sound that was coming from behind the building.

126
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,378
I turned around.

127
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,496
Nickie was gone.

128
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,131
What happened next?

129
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:52,959
I paniced.

130
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:57,217
And I ran outside behind the Laundromat.

131
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:00,982
and I saw a man...

132
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,100
lying there in the alley.

133
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,697
Where was Nickie?

134
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,052
He was gone.

135
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:10,771
I have looked everywhere for him,

136
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,338
while the other woman, she called the police.

137
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,012
I warned Nickie never to go out by himself.

138
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:20,055
But it's cat Charlie...

139
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,695
that was going out.

140
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:24,411
And he went to find him.

141
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:28,056
I was talking to one of the cops...

142
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,141
That's where we found him.

143
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:46,942
Nickie.

144
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,695
Oh, little guy.

145
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,298
He had been trapped under the body for a long time.

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,216
And he hasn't said a word since then.

147
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,461
Can you imagine that kind of fear?

148
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,981
It must have been terrible.

149
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:35,182
Willie.

150
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:39,982
Einnad, no.

151
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:51,783
Hey.

152
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,417
''Corrupt DEA Agent Killed in Drug Deal Gone Bad''

153
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:23,294
I don't think the kid is telling us that Emilio Vasquez shot Agent Cruz.

154
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,538
It takes time.

155
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,939
Sometimes it takes good swat in the ass.

156
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:29,339
I'll bet Bingham can match the 6 in the next lottery

157
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,459
than this kid ... Vasquez is the shooter.

158
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,821
Don't jink me. The lottery is of the thirty million.

159
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,532
You are ruining Washington as you boys started that Cruz was dirty

160
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,901
that he wasn't trying to bust Vasquez,

161
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,339
he was selling to him

162
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:45,396
and then he was using the seizure warehouse as one personal drug store.

163
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,677
Rumors are just rumors.

164
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,978
That little boy here is the only one that knows the truth.

165
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:52,021
And hopefully before Vasquez find his silence for good,

166
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:55,056
you'll start playing with all your little toys in here and get him to speak.

167
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,679
And what would you suggest I do?

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,880
An interrogation?

169
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:02,180
Something scared the kid silent. I'm damn sure we can scare him to talk.

170
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,381
Hey, Nickie.

171
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,636
I've got a treat for you.

172
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:26,237
Chocolate milk.

173
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,535
Now, I've heard about this powder.

174
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:38,895
It's somehow dramatic ... composition of milk, right?

175
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:40,696
You've never had chocolate milk?

176
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:43,420
It wasn't allowed where I grew up.

177
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,618
Wow, can you believe that, Nickie?

178
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,019
Nickie, Can I try?

179
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:14,722
Jarod, I have been shot!

180
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,532
Don't you worry, Carla. I'll take care of Nickie.

181
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,218
I want the leak sealed.

182
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:28,739
If that means every agent takes a polygraph, then do it.

183
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,180
I don't trust anybody around here.

184
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:41,400
Nickie.

185
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,501
Your mum is going to be fine,

186
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,492
as soon as the doctor takes a look at it.

187
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:53,342
In the meantime, would you like to go with me to check out your new place?

188
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,613
Do you think maybe she needs a safe place?

189
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:30,614
You can trust me, Nickie.

190
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,340
Would you mind if I put something in here too?

191
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:49,971
She is my mum.

192
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,262
I always keep her close.

193
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,933
Will you take care of her for me?

194
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,034
There.

195
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:12,835
And Nickie.

196
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:15,500
After a while, it won'e be so bad.

197
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,342
and you will feel strong enough

198
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,693
to put the hurt in the safe place.

199
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,219
This house sits on a myth of tunnels.

200
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,520
There is just oneway in or out.

201
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,458
Why would anybody build something like this?

202
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:52,778
Paranoia.

203
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:56,580
People with everything always is afraid somebody is going to take it away.

204
00:14:57,823 --> 00:14:59,051
You must be right.

205
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,171
Listen up, people.

206
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:05,023
And this house has been built on series of tunnels.

207
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:08,181
Each tunnel connects four sections of this estate,

208
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:09,816
with entries and exits,

209
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:14,178
both within the house, and underground like these drainage vent here in the driveway.

210
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,279
I want every access point secured.

211
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:17,618
Let's get to work!

212
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:30,014
Get me a real doctor.

213
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,053
Who attacked you?

214
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,336
I don't know.

215
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,301
I'm trying to help you here.

216
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,378
Willie, Let's go.

217
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:42,858
No problem, Mr. Raines.

218
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,538
He's hiding something.

219
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:52,140
... delirious from the anaesthesia,

220
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:55,098
he kept repeating the same thing over and over.

221
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:58,132
Name Einnad mean anything to either of you?

222
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:01,415
Einnad? A disgruntled ex-employee?

223
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:04,536
Possible but those injuries aren't random.

224
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:07,781
The attacker slashed this into Raines' arm.

225
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:08,939
One fifty-five...

226
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:12,700
That's the room at SL-27 where Raines used to run his experiments.

227
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,822
Judging from the violence,

228
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,697
Einnad may have been one of those experiments.

229
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,781
Do you think my mother was trying to save Einnad too?

230
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,817
I know she's dying trying to stop Raines.

231
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,338
Possible.

232
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:26,974
What the hell was he trying to make out of him?

233
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,138
Blake? Jackson? Where the hell are you?

234
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,139
Nickie.

235
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,252
Nickie, where are you?

236
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:00,457
Nickie, I know you were scared.

237
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:03,373
I'm not buying your little silent acting.

238
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,453
You look at me when I talk to you!

239
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,541
Tell me what you saw!

240
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:09,342
Stess.

241
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,178
Not now.

242
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,382
I need to show you something.

243
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,283
Hey.

244
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,412
Wait in your room, I'll be there in a second.

245
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,500
... the little boy the wrong way again

246
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,933
his mother won't be only in the hospital!

247
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,051
Your way isn't working.

248
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,379
It just isn't your assignment to deal with.

249
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,176
Vasquez is personal.

250
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:37,335
The way I see you another bully by nature.

251
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,052
I don't think it's innocent little boy's silence is eating you alive.

252
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,135
You shrink.

253
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,337
What the hell is going on here?

254
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,135
Just a free therapy session.

255
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,543
No reference to Einnad in the mainfraim.

256
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:55,644
But I found out it's a Welsh name.

257
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:57,854
It means ''life'' or ''spirit''.

258
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,801
That's useful.

259
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,602
I need to know who Einnad is.

260
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:02,782
And why he attacked Raines.

261
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,497
Are you sure you want to look ... with Raines?

262
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,774
This tactic ... against your mother.

263
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:10,062
I am not my mother.

264
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:11,063
Broots.

265
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,657
Oh, please don't ask me to search Raines' office again, right...

266
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:16,013
Relax your back side. (Loosen the buttocks.)

267
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,015
I have a better idea.

268
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:36,416
Hi.

269
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:38,862
What're you doing?

270
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,780
Which isn't looked too good.

271
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:46,741
Maybe I can fix her.

272
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,418
Want me to try?

273
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:07,138
Here. Now she's all better.

274
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:11,219
Can I play?

275
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:16,093
Come here! Oh, I missed you so much!

276
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,981
I missed you, too.

277
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,536
You spoke!

278
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:26,137
He spoke.

279
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:27,932
I heard it.

280
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,051
''DEA Special Agent Decorated in Drug Bust''

281
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,218
''DEA Agent's Brother Dies of Overdose''

282
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,779
''Drugs Tied to Vasquez Cartel''

283
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,336
Well, you surprised me, agent Stess.

284
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,092
How's that?

285
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,817
I never would guess you would be a decorated officer.

286
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,702
What the hell are you doing with my file?

287
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:31,981
Oh, let's see. Decorated in 93.

288
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:35,656
But every year since then, you have been on disciplinary review.

289
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:39,811
Access of force, questionable investigated techniques.

290
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:44,778
In clinical terms, agent Stess, you're losing it.

291
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:50,221
- I've ventured about enough of you.
- Your brother worshiped you, didn't he?

292
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:52,501
But unfortunately, his addiction got the best of him.

293
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:55,054
And maybe he was just trying to live up to you.

294
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,574
Or maybe he was just overdid on purpose

295
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,098
for the attention.

296
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:00,658
I could kill you!

297
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,013
Save your anger for Vasquez.

298
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:06,819
It was his operation that sold your little brother the heroine that killed him.

299
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,693
Look, I know, you miss your little brother.

300
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:13,259
You're so hurt and you're so angry that you can't see straight.

301
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:30,495
I need your help.

302
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,651
Help me bring down Cruz's killer.

303
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:39,057
Help me save that little boy's life.

304
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,293
What's Marmaduke up to this week?

305
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,021
Ah, Oh, I haven't got to Marmaduke.

306
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:28,502
That was a quick butt.

307
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,653
Since when does Willie smoke?

308
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,736
I got it. I got it!

309
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:49,142
It was gasoline everywhere.

310
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:50,643
He was trying to torch this place.

311
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:53,821
- Question is why?
- He was trying to cover Raines' tracks.

312
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:57,695
- What tracks?
- It is written all over the walls.

313
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,059
Einnad.

314
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:00,578
Look at this!

315
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:04,942
It belonged to a Daniel Hilton Minor, Davidson Psychiatric Hospital.

316
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,822
That's a surprise!

317
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,222
Another fun house.

318
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,781
Where are the mirrors, Syd?

319
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:15,082
Miss Parker.

320
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:19,862
All of these prescribed in D. H. Minor by Dr. Williams.

321
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,940
Some of these go back 20 years.

322
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,420
Williams...As in William Raines.

323
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:31,459
How about this wallpaper though?

324
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:32,454
Excessive.

325
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:34,941
- Methodical.
- And raw.

326
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,419
Strange way of spelling Einnad, wouldn't you say?

327
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:41,259
But it's not what he's writing.

328
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,536
The answer's in the mirror.

329
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:50,021
D.A.N.N.I.E.

330
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:54,222
Dannie.

331
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,171
Who is Dannie?

332
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:07,872
Hey.

333
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:10,298
Check this out.

334
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,414
So the mass banking account of Cruz is going to check out?

335
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,621
Look at the last transaction.

336
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:18,060
Five hundred thousand on April 9.

337
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,699
The day after Cruz was murdered.

338
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,372
How much heroin did you say was missing from the seizure warehouse?

339
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,651
Half a million.

340
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,422
There is no name on the account.

341
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,615
Just a reference number.

342
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,897
Hey, how did you get out of your...

343
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:41,697
You couldn't sleep, huh?

344
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:46,933
Is everything safe in there?

345
00:24:58,934 --> 00:24:59,634
Nickie.

346
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:04,939
Do you remember this man?

347
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,538
Is this the man from the alley?

348
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:10,639
Nickie.

349
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:16,023
It's ok. I want you go back to bed.

350
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:29,661
If Vasquez is the murderer, how come his photograph didn'r traumatize Nickie.

351
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,457
You know, maybe all your slinky stuff is working.

352
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:36,261
Maybe we are just not seeing the whole picture.

353
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,739
Jarod has been silent for thirty-six hours.

354
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:52,979
However he is showing signs of illucidity.

355
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:55,413
Attempting to sketch an image over and over.

356
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,659
This woman without a face.

357
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,614
I have decided to intervene.

358
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,139
Can you tell me who she is?

359
00:26:07,823 --> 00:26:08,722
I cannot see her.

360
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:11,158
Who, Jarod?

361
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:14,555
I cannot remember.

362
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,041
I cannot remember any more.

363
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,538
is this your mother?

364
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,076
I cannot remember.

365
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:26,838
She's gone.

366
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:29,739
She's gone, Sydney.

367
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:34,842
She's gone.

368
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:40,777
Our boy Einnad is actually Daniel Hilton Minor,

369
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,772
One of the Center study groups in the late sixties.

370
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,673
His file ends in 1982.

371
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,293
- Right after the fire in SL 27.
- That's right.

372
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,858
Once Raines lost in 155, he has no place to work.

373
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:51,371
So he took it elsewhere.

374
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:54,461
Preliminary diagnosis: Mild Depression.

375
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:55,772
What a crock!

376
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:58,452
A mild depression can always be amplified.

377
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,596
- Brainwave manipulation?
- Um, hum.

378
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,498
Whatever Dannie's initial treatment,

379
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:08,460
the outcome warrant drugs prescribed in increasing dosages.

380
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:12,416
Let's talk to Raines: You got a headache, lobotomies.

381
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:17,018
And the perfectly treatable ... becomes the society identity disorder.

382
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:19,095
Multiple personalities.

383
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:22,012
Two of them we've known: Dannie and Einnad.

384
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,656
Looking in the mirror can be comforting to someone's suffering from the ID.

385
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:33,213
The mirror reflects the image of a unified self.

386
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:36,779
My mother couldn't save him.

387
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:41,338
She tried it, Miss Parker. She tried it.

388
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:43,780
But Raines got in the way.

389
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:09,681
Charlie.

390
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,613
Look what I've found.

391
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:31,059
Do you know what this is?

392
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,319
That's a very very nice hat.

393
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,820
And who are you?

394
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:48,939
Mummy!

395
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,052
Oh, hello, mummy.

396
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:54,612
It's ok.

397
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,700
I'm here to help you and Nickie.

398
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:58,941
You have a cat, don't you?

399
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:00,298
Charlie.

400
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:04,399
Charlie.

401
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:08,034
I bet Charlie loved to play in the alley.

402
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,174
It that what happened the day in the laundromat?

403
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,299
I found him.

404
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,700
Ok, you found him.

405
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:24,318
And then a man came up, right?

406
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,499
Two men?

407
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,481
I was in the boxes. No one can see me.

408
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:48,096
But you can see them.

409
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:51,579
These men...

410
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,940
Did they look like they came from Mexico?

411
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,379
One of the men?

412
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,252
And the other man?

413
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:27,293
Jackpot!

414
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:36,175
Mr. Jackpot was with the other man?

415
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:42,775
They both had suitcases?

416
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,861
And then they swithed them.

417
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:49,896
And that's when that happened.

418
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:52,981
Another man came.

419
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:55,562
Agent Cruz.

420
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:58,854
What happened next, Nickie?

421
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,879
They got really mad and Mr. Jackpot pulled out a gun.

422
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:06,261
He shot the other man!

423
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:10,391
Then he felt on me.

424
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:13,213
And I was scared, I couldn't move.

425
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:17,214
Jarod.

426
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:21,615
Bingham.

427
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:28,016
Then the policemen came and your mummy came, and you are ok?

428
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,011
Can't you remember, honey?

429
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:35,575
Agent Bingham came with the others when mummy was talking to the police,

430
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,776
and he was talking to you.

431
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:43,855
He took me away.

432
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:47,356
Kid.

433
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:51,341
You tell anyone...

434
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:55,436
this is your mummy.

435
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:09,452
Any progress?

436
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:13,132
Nothing.

437
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:16,892
The transfer's gonna happen tomorrow at eight thirty.

438
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:18,698
Why?

439
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:21,055
Dr. Shrink's time's up.

440
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,556
They want the kid over to official headquarters.

441
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,338
What have we got?

442
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:49,342
Social divided identity disorder with both personalities

443
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:52,217
are compelled to cover at living space,

444
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:54,699
even if it's within the same home.

445
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:57,736
So far, we've only found Einnad's space.

446
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,899
We didn't find Dannie's.

447
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:10,579
Anyone ever tell you you are not a duck?

448
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:12,338
Duck?

449
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,742
Alticationly.

450
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,075
Hey, we are running out of time.

451
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:37,276
Nail this kid.

452
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:41,902
And 5 Kg will be waiting in the alley, south Columbia Avenue.

453
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:44,182
Run heroin from the locker.

454
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,501
And they are going to transport the kid tomorrow night.

455
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,899
They'll come in van. Here is the address.

456
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:53,334
I want you to make sure that transport never leave ...

457
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:54,817
No problem.

458
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,940
This better be primo junk,

459
00:33:57,423 --> 00:34:00,779
or I swear you'll end up like Cruz.

460
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,255
I checked all the doors.

461
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:17,932
There are nothing.

462
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:37,059
It's not doors, it's walls.

463
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:24,735
Make him stop.

464
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:30,816
Kill, Kill me, please!

465
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,174
Kill me and he'll stop.

466
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:42,651
I am not there to hurt you, Dannie.

467
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,072
Manhole cover

468
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,702
It's time to move.

469
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:43,972
Good luck.

470
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:45,218
Thanks.

471
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:08,180
I don't know about you, but it's going to be cold damn June before we'll see the kid again!

472
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,098
I'll call...

473
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:26,613
I'll take a drive around the perimeter.

474
00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:35,658
- Are you ok?
- Good as paranoia!

475
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,982
What will we do now?

476
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:40,376
We get the bad guy.

477
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:11,477
Jarod.

478
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,175
Don't look so shocked.

479
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:17,373
I couldn't resist about the explosion.

480
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,502
I had to see what a little boy's life was worth to you.

481
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:23,094
What is it? Five kg?

482
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:24,618
Ten?

483
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,912
These guys, they think Nickie is dead.

484
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:31,012
And Vasquez is going to want his heroin pronto.

485
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:33,417
I'm going to have to kill you.

486
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:35,336
Like you killed Cruz?

487
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:36,983
But before you pull the trigger, right,

488
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:40,374
strongly suggest you to check out your primo junk.

489
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,618
Chocolate.

490
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,659
Somehow I don't think these guys are the chocolate milk type.

491
00:38:58,023 --> 00:38:58,978
What is the matter, Roger?

492
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:00,439
Cat got your tongue?

493
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,040
Imagine how Nickie felt.

494
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,896
He witnessed a brutal murder,

495
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,697
as a dead body fell on top of him.

496
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,100
Do you have any idea what that kind of fear can do to a child?

497
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:15,893
And then when it's all over, you threaten to kill his mother if he talks.

498
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,822
Well, he's talking now.

499
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,776
He's telling Davis all about how you deal drugs,

500
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,811
how you killed Cruz.

501
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:25,253
- You've got nothing on me.
- Come on, Roger.

502
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:27,012
Admit it.

503
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:28,902
I can stop these guys.

504
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:30,861
I have got the real stuff right here.

505
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:34,576
Ok, I killed Cruz.

506
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:37,663
- Give me the case.
- At your service.

507
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:41,698
You got milk?

508
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,215
Do you feel nicely?

509
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:17,333
Where did you get that?

510
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,572
Handball.

511
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:25,181
The Tower review has been given new evidence.

512
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:30,978
Something about my extracurricular activities.

513
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,134
You should hire better people.

514
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,859
- Smoke?
- No.

515
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,779
You remind me of someone I used to know...

516
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,896
Someone who looked exactly like you.

517
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:48,457
I am not my mother.

518
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:51,416
Do not make the mistake of forgetting that.

519
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:56,613
We should all be careful of the mistakes we make,

520
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,781
shouldn't we?

521
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,294
I've just spoke with the hospital.

522
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,098
Dannie has been transferred.

523
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,899
He's now my patient.

524
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:21,101
Why would Raines have created something like him?

525
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:22,903
Maybe he was trying to make his own little assassin,

526
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:24,859
but he backfired.

527
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,576
Only God knows.

528
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:28,137
God and the Center.

529
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:32,817
When Dannie attacked me, my instinct was to kill him.

530
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:37,061
But when I looked at him,

531
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:39,775
he's begging me to shoot him.

532
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:42,943
I saw someone who might have had a chance,

533
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,937
if The Centre hadn't gotten its claws into him.

534
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,459
You saw yourself.

535
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:06,576
Looks like Vasquez and Bingham will be going away for a long time.

536
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,734
Think you know a guy and find out you don't really know him at all.

537
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:18,342
Tell me about it!

538
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:21,643
Hey.

539
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,255
Thank you for keeping her safe.

540
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,336
I have something for you too.

541
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,581
Charlie, you came home!

542
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:50,542
So did you, Nickie.

543
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,043
So did you.

544
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:03,977
This is Sydney.

545
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,818
Do you think it's possible to forget all the terrible things

546
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:08,582
that happen to us when we were young?

547
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:10,933
Forget? Oh, no.

548
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:15,413
But I believe we can make use of them to make ourselves stronger.

549
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:19,095
I try to be strong.

550
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:23,652
But sometimes all I see is darkness,

551
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:27,179
fragments of who I am.

552
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,574
Will I ever feel whole?

553
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:33,055
I do not know, Jarod.

554
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:35,658
I hope so.

555
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:42,172
Me too.

556
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:01,173
''Silence''
End

557
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:05,174
