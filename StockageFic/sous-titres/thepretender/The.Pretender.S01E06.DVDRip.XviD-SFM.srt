00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,852
She ran an empty county ambulance
off the road...

00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,784
Geez, I don't want to hurt anybody.

330
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:08,547
This sounds more like an unsolved homicide
than an I.A. investigation.

Forensics went over that store
with a fine-tooth comb.

I looked up his military file.

338
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,443
He tested in the lowest
five percent of his unit...

339
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:36,007
spent 10 years in uniform
and never busted corporal.

340
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,315
Not exactly a criminal mastermind.

341
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:41,448
<i>We're talking about a young man</i>
<i>whojust found out who he was...</i>

342
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:43,515
<i>where he came from.</i>

343
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:46,426
He had $2,000 in his bank account.
His bills were paid.

344
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:49,226
You want to tell me he'd throw
all that away for a fast score?

345
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,632
So if you don't think
that Kembrook was involved...

346
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:55,296
and the accomplice was fictitious...

347
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:57,305
who did it?

348
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,864
There was one piece of hard evidence
left at the scene...

349
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:02,433
the slug they dug out
of Marvin Kembrook's chest.

350
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:05,572
Find the gun that fired that bullet,
and you find the real killer.

351
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:11,446
- Oh, man!
- <i>[Toilet Flushing]</i>

What, you're late again, huh?

353
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:17,456
The desk sarge is gonna have my butt
in a sling if she catches me.

354
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,518
- Can you do me a favor?
- What's up?

355
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:22,120
My transfer papers got sent
to my house by mistake.

356
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:25,429
Would you give them to her,
after I'm gone?

357
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:27,492
- No problem.
- Thanks.

358
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,505
Hey, listen. You know, I'm kind of new
around here and don't know many people.

359
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,565
I was thinking maybe I could take you
and your partner to lunch one day.

360
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:35,440
- My treat.
- Yeah, sure. How 'bout tomorrow?

361
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:38,071
- Great. I look forward to it.
- All right, man.

362
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:54,989
- Hey, partner. How's it going?
- All right, bro.

363
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:59,558
Read this. I think we found
the guy we've been looking for.

364
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,626

My friends, they all say,
"You should let it go."

372

But, I mean,
how do you deny yourself?

373
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:39,364

<i>I think it's the little things</i>
<i>that we miss the most.</i>

The way we see ourselves

387
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:40,201
- [Voices Overlapping]
- The way he sat in a chair.

388
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,703
His laugh.

389
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:49,202
The way he stirred his coffee.

No, you're blind, lady.

Well, I wanna tell you.
You just better have a little respect!

398
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:31,419
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Feeble Knievel here almost
cut me in half with her tricycle.

00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:35,116
- You little punk!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. That is enough.

- Is that it?
- Yeah.

404

It's nothing that a little sandpaper
and touch-up paint won't cure.

405
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:55,404
- You do have insurance?
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna let that old bag get away.

406
00:27:55,478 --> 00:27:57,412
She almost wasted me, man.

What have we here?

408
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>An expired license plate.</i>

409
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,743
That's gonna cost you about
a hundred bucks in fines.

410
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,119
And I could, of course,
search your van.

411
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,318
- Sandpaper and touch-up paint on...
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,388
Have a nice day.

<i>She walks in, she packs her bags,</i>
<i>and then she splits.</i>

- Ouch.
- You gotta be kidding me.

419
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:35,216
- Why would I make up a story like that?
- They are so unbelievable.

420
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:38,651
It's incredible. Next time I talked to her,
we were in some lawyer's office, 100 bucks per.

421
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:41,212
- Sounds like my last wife.
- Oh, no.

422
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,520
- Marriage number three?
- No. Four.

423
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,323
Four? Geez!
What, you got, like, a thousand kids?

424
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,829
- No, six. Six real good kids.
- And they don't look like him.

425
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:50,627
Shut up, Frank.

426
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,726
Must be tough making ends meet,
with all those obligations.

427
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,033
I make sure everybody's
well taken care of.

428

Still, you know,
there's gotta be a better way.

00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:04,308
- What, like Chicago?
- Chicago?

430
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,406
Yeah, we know about the investigation...

<i>from the dealers on the South Side.</i>

- New guy comes in, we check him out.

433
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:16,157
You'd do the same thing.

434
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:19,217
You had no right to read my file.

435
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:22,423
Besides, they never proved anything.

436
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:26,525
It proves that you can cover your tracks,
so take it easy.

- Isn't that right, Frank?
- That's right.

439
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,672
Takes a special kind of cop
to do what we do.

440
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:39,237
We think you're that cop.
That's all.

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,948
I'm sorry, sir.
Your credit card came back invalid.

442

<i>this deadbeat out before he pulls his gun...</i>

447
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:12,327

- 'Cause we had problems the last time out.

They're not gonna suspect us of a crime.
They'll think we're responding to one.

- Then we take 'em down.
