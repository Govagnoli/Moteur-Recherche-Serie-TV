1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,670
[Broots] Raines's estranged wife
escaped that mental hospital...

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,104
just to tell you about
your mother and Mirage? Why?

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,904
[Miss Parker] Edna Raines said 
Mirage was my mother's work.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,911
Work I'm supposed to finish.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:17,006
Well, no one seems to remember
any Centre project by that name.

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,314
- Could it be one of her delusions?
- You didn't see her eyes.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,254
Syd, in that moment,
she was as sane as you and I.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,624
[Scoffs]

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,321
Broots, you been
downloading porn again?

10
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,591
My e-mail server is whacked.

11
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,795
[Sighs] Someone around here has
heard of Mirage. You can bet on it.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,772
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm here
to collect burn bags for incineration.

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,314
I... knew her.

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,783
- Excuse me?
- Catherine.

15
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,149
- She was a special person.
- You knew my mother?

16
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,321
And she always seemed like
a bright and shining spirit...

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,990
even in the darkest hours.

18
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,601
Sorry for the interruption.

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,840
Maybe we could... talk again.

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,506
If you- If you
wouldn't mind, Mr., um-

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,516
Name's Leonard.
And it would be my pleasure.

22
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,178
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,545
- Everything burns.
- Miss Parker'll want to see this.

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,413
I said everything burns.

25
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,646
Miss Parker must see this.

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,711
Big mistake, you dumb-

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,053
- [Grunts]
- [Gun Cocking]

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,923
I have to talk to Miss Parker.

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,858
[Woman] Details are sketchy,
but after the robbery, the five suspects...

30
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,495
posing as janitorial staff,
fled MAGNA Technologies in a brown van.

31
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,735
A hazmat team has been dispatched, and
the warehouse district has been quarantined.

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,040
We'll keep you updated
as the story unfolds.

33
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:30,173
Reporting live from the warehouse district,
now back to you in the studio.

34
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,119
[Man Screaming]
Let me outta here! Let me out!

35
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:38,749
[People Coughing]

36
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,350
My throat is on fire.
I can't breathe.

37
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,691
Something is very wrong here.

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,891
Oh, it's this.
It's what we stole.

39
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:52,370
- [Hissing]
- [Coughing Continues]

40
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,202
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,142
Hey, science guy.
You're making me nervous. What is it?

42
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,906
- [Sirens Wail]
- Soman nerve gas.

43
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,970
- That stuff could kill us, couldn't it?
- It already is.

44
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,779
- What do you mean, is?
- Is. Is!

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,551
Barring some miracle, we're all going 
to be dead in less than six hours.

46
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,123
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

47
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,133
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,762
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

49
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,238
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

50
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,744
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

51
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,006
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,844
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

53
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,646
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

54
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,654
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.

55
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,902
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

56
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,176
- [Broots] Miss Parker.
- Good night, Broots.

57
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,237
That guy went postal down in SL 26.
Started shooting up the place.

58
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,475
- That guy?
- Leonard, the clerk!

59
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,916
The burn bag guy
that knew your mother!

60
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,925
[Broots]
God.

61
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,600
We tried to negotiate with him.

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,536
- He wasn't interested.
- So you traded the olive branch for an Uzi.

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,541
Is that your Christian way, Raines?

64
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,578
He was armed and out of control.
He tried to kill one of my men.

65
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,409
There must have been another way.

66
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,110
I will not tolerate unstable
behavior from Centre employees.

67
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,846
I thought that was a job requirement.

68
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,852
Broots.

69
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:01,857
I want the surveillance footage
of what just happened here. Quick.

70
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,267
[Man] Ain't bad enough there's cops
searchin' for us everywhere.

71
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,034
Now you're tellin'us
we got six hours to live?

72
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,235
Who the hell are you to be
pronouncing us dead on arrival?

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,077
I don't have to, Mr. Job.
You can already feel it, can't you?

74
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,446
You all can.
It's on your skin.

75
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,748
It's in your lungs.
And it only gets worse.

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,483
- [Coughing]
- Elijah never said anything
about stealing nerve gas.

77
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,822
Poindexter here's probably
talking out his ass.

78
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:32,092
I mean, us, we know each other, right?
But him? Who the hell is he?

79
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,431
For all we know, he's some out of work
pharmacist. I think we should call Elijah.

80
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,993
Eve's right. We were supposed 
to steal computer chips.

81
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,597
Yeah, not to mention
100,000 each for our efforts.

82
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,336
Thank you very much.
I say we call him.

83
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,743
Elijah said the target was a box.
That's all he said.

84
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,443
What difference does it make?
He owes us anyway, right?

85
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,347
- Screw it. I'm gonna call Elijah.
- No. Elijah calls us!

86
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,822
Always has, he always will!

87
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,860
[Eve] I don't know about you, but I'm not
just gonna sit here and wait to die.

88
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,989
There must be something
we can do about this Soman gas.

89
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,260
It affects the chemical
structure of the brain.

90
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,498
It's only a matter of time before
our paranoia turns into psychosis.

91
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,132
- Wait. What do you mean? We all go crazy?
- Exactly.

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,201
It breaks down our tissues. First we'll
feel nauseous, then the tremors...

93
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:23,772
and then, our internal organs will liquefy.

94
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,344
Our insides will look something
like, well, something like that.

95
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,023
Then your nose will start to bleed, 
and it just won't-

96
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,856
No, stop. Okay? I just-
Make him stop.

97
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,227
All right, I can't-
[Gags, Coughs]

98
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,098
Look. Look.
It's-It's Elijah's laptop.

99
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,330
- He's gonna help us.
- [Eve] And what?

100
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,897
We wait for his call and-and
then surf the Web, Mr. Job?

101
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,409
I hear bleedout.com has
some real interesting graphics.

102
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,968
You're really turning into 
one sarcastic bitch, you know that?

103
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,038
Ooh, you really do
have issues with women.

104
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,141
What was it?
Trauma with training pants?

105
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,709
Or did Mommy have Stoli
with her cornflakes every morning?

106
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,585
- Shut up!
- Or what?

107
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,023
- You want to smack me around a little, hmm?
- Okay. That's enough.

108
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,688
As sick as we're going to get,
we need to stick together.

109
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,698
- [Hard Typing]
- This is Elijah's laptop.

110
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,996
The question is why hasn't
he tried to contact us?

111
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,901
He used us as guinea pigs is why.

112
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,201
Look. Are we really gonna-
Are we gonna die?

113
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,936
No, brother. We're not gonna die.
I promise you that, okay?

114
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,242
I'm gonna take care of you. Don't I always
take care of you? I don't know about you.

115
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,010
Me and my brother, we're gettin'
the hell out of here. Come on. Let's go.

116
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,246
- And exactly where do you think you're going?
- To a hospital.

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,686
Use your brains, Mr. Cain.
What's left of them.

118
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,384
The way the black-and-white's
are circling around outside...

119
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,623
you and your brother won't get
a block before they pick you up.

120
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:49,396
Abraham's right. Our best chance is if we
stick together and wait for Elijah to contact us.

121
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,107
All right.

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,372
But if things get out of hand...

123
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:04,041
the last rational thought I'm gonna have is
putting a.38 slug in the back of your head.

124
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,745
If this gets out of hand,
I will consider that a favor.

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,947
[Coughing]

126
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,894
[Job]
Hey, I'm gettin' somethin'.

127
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,591
[Woman] The robbery occurred
in Dallas's industrial district.

128
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,429
Now, for unknown reasons,
the area's been cordoned off.

129
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,335
And an emergency
evacuation order has gone out...

130
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,601
to clear the area
of all non emergency personnel.

131
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,837
Evacuation. Cops already
know what we stole.

132
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,438
- If they know, then Elijah knows.
- Yeah, well, Elijah's gonna want his stuff, right?

133
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,006
So he's gonna come down and-and
get us out ofhere, right?

134
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,576
Right. Maybe he'll send a flock
off lying monkeys, moron.

135
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,146
- Hey, leave him alone. Now.
- [Job] Ease up, Tarzan.

136
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,819
You know, I knew
I should have cut and run...

137
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,625
when I realized you thought Groundhog Day
was a national holiday.

138
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,194
I'm not saying it's a major holiday.

139
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,032
I'm just saying it's right up there
with, uh, Secretary's Day.

140
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,368
Secretary's Day isn't
a national holiday either, Job.

141
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,339
And like you've ever
had a secretary anyway.

142
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,467
I had a secretary once.

143
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,708
And then lunch was over, we put our clothes
back on. She went back to her typing.

144
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,511
[Laughs]

145
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,859
Eh, speakin' of secretaries, hotshot,
what are you, some kind of a entry expert?

146
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,385
The name Mr. Elijah
gave me is Mr. Abraham.

147
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,729
And, yes, breaking and entry
is one of my specialties.

148
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,066
I'll bet you robbed a girl of her virginity
once, which I find impressive.

149
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:36,541
- Well, you should. She was your sister.
- Ahh! [Laughing]

150
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,045
What the hell are you laughin' at,
half-wit? Your mama is your sister.

151
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,912
- Hey.
- How did you people pull off
20 scores in three years?

152
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,918
I'll tell you how. We don't know
a damn thing about each other.

153
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,149
- Rule number one in the book of Mr. Elijah.
- [Electronic Ringing]

154
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:54,488
[Electronic Female Voice]
You have a video phone call.

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,690
Good morning, campers. I assume you've
all met and bonded with Mr. Abraham here.

156
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,698
He's a strong addition to our team.

157
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,428
He's an expert in many areas,
mostly the sciences.

158
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,029
- What? Like we're mopes or something?
- Good to see you again too, Job.

159
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,768
I gotta agree with Job on this one.
We've done fine on our own, Mr. E.

160
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,073
Have we? I'm putting Mr. Abraham
in charge of this one.

161
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,911
What? I gotta take orders
from science guy here?

162
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,180
You know, we made a lot of scratch
for you in the past few years, pal.

163
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,584
I don't have to sit here
and take this crap.

164
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,681
Well, then I guess the others will have 
to split up your hundred thousand.

165
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,057
- We get a hundred grand each?
- [Elijah] It's big.

166
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,188
But let's see if we can do this one
without any blood on it. Deal?

167
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,029
What deal doesn't have blood on it?

168
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,666
[Coughing]

169
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,953
Isn't this cute?

170
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,020
[Jarod]
What is it?

171
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,163
Brittany Tate?
Who's Brittany Tate?

172
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,767
Last job we did, three months ago,
a kid was murdered.

173
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,073
[Job Coughing]

174
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,810
"Brittany Tate, age nine,
was smothered to death...

175
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,252
"during a robbery
at a Westbrook estate.

176
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,153
"Only evidence found at the scene
was a pillow used in the suffocation...

177
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:38,185
a spilled bottle of perfume
and a broken music box."

178
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,631
Well, I guess that's what Elijah meant
when he said, "one without blood."

179
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,836
Which one of you geniuses did her?

180
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,963
[Job]
None of us knows.

181
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,269
Nobody's talkin'.

182
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,636
Mr. Cain's gone strangely silent.

183
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,111
- So?
- So, you killed that little girl.

184
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,712
[Chortles] Lady, your brain's
already beginning to melt.

185
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,684
What difference
does it make who did it?

186
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,718
- It's done.
- [Electronic Ringing]

187
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,321
- [Eve Coughing]
- You have a video phone call.

188
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,957
- Tough evening, eh?
- [Job] Tough?

189
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,969
We've all been exposed to nerve gas!

190
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,006
Which means you've accomplished
your mission. Well done.

191
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,668
You set us up? You knew
what we were stealing was deadly!

192
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,712
Would you have taken
the assignment otherwise?

193
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,974
Assignment?
We're dying in here!

194
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,915
One of the canisters leaked.
We've all been exposed to the gas.

195
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,715
I realized that that might be a possibility.
Check the dispatcher's office.

196
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,552
I've left materials there for you
to work a little chemistry, Abraham.

197
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,889
Now, I'm sending a couple of my men over
to pick up the canisters.

198
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,327
They should be at your location
within the next few hours.

199
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,559
And just know the contingency
plans are being implemented.

200
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,193
Forget about contingency.
What about currency?

201
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,760
Patience, Job. Patience.

202
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,772
- My men are on the way.
- [Job] No, no, wait.

203
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,469
Wait. Damn it!

204
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,910
Oh, God.
He's-He's leavin' us here to die.

205
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,005
Shut him up, or I will.

206
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,016
[Coughing]

207
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,279
Elijah will not leave us
high and dry, okay?

208
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,687
What's this stuff?

209
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,385
Elijah left me everything
I might need to create an antidote.

210
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,123
- You think you can save us?
- Now don't you wish you'd been nicer to me?

211
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,834
- Hey, how long?
- Five hours. Maybe less.

212
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,066
How-How do we know
that you can do this?

213
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,177
I was an army medic in Desert Storm.
I know a few things about chemical weapons.

214
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,438
I'm gonna need a blood sample
from each one of you.

215
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,377
Hey, screw this.

216
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,881
This guy could be a wacko
for all we know.

217
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,387
I agree with Cain. I'm gonna take
my chances with the hospital.

218
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:48,892
You won't make it. And even if you did,
they won't have the antidote you need.

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,793
You've got all the answers, don't you?

220
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:54,965
I'm outta here.

221
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,001
- [Metal Clicks]
- Someone's coming.

222
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,637
[Job]
Cops.

[Radio Chatter]

224
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:20,147
Hey, come on.
It's empty. Let's keep moving.

225
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,690
[Man On Radio]
Thirteen, Sergeant, One and Central.

226
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:30,156
- [Door Closes]
- They're gone. We're clear.

227
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:33,204
[Light Coughing]

228
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,768
We have to do this
before it's too late.

229
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,793
[No Audio]

230
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:04,695
- Leonard didn't kill anyone.
- God, they just mowed them down.

231
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,737
Rewind, Broots.

232
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:08,738
Before they get shot.

233
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,313
Who's he calling?

234
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,246
Can't tell.
The image is too small.

235
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,717
Maybe if I enhance the video,
isolate his hands and match the motion.

236
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,152
- You can do that?
- Well, yeah. It would take about an hour.

237
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:27,282
[Sighs]
Clock's ticking.

of when Mom used to sing it.

00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,315
Signal's comin' back.

243
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,053
The latest report is that
the security guard, a father of six...

244
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:07,393
was found nearly strangled to death in
the robbery at MAGNA Technologies, Limited.

245
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,593
His condition is considered
to be life-threatening.

246
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,136
Police are still combing
the area forthe suspects.

247
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:15,104
Who did it?

248
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:18,441
Which one of you idiots
strangled the guard?

249
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,469
- What difference does it make?
- It might make a big difference, if we survive.

250
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:26,813
The question is, which one of you
has the itchy trigger finger?

Tell me something. What does
Elijah see in that one?

254
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:50,465
It's like a horse race entry.
You want Cain, you get Abel.

[Coughing Hard]

256
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,514
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get out. I gotta-

257
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,516
- Hey, calm down.
- No, I gotta get outta here.

258
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,916
- Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.
- Please!

259
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:05,319
You know something? I thought I was a really
good judge of people. Guess I was wrong.

260
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,324
What's that supposed to mean?

261
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:10,020
Thought I was working with professionals. 
You snuff out a little girl.

262
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,528
Now a rent-a-cop.
Did you do it?

263
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,225
- What about you, Mr. Job?
- [Laughs]

264
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,597
Yeah, he's got the guts.

265
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:21,399
Oh, yeah. Killin' a little girl,
that takes a lot of guts.

266
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,940
Face it, you know.
It could've been any one of us.

267
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,203
- Speak for yourself.
- Look, it wasn't me.

268
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:29,542
Well, one guilty, all guilty.
I'll tell you one thing.

269
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:34,551
Mr. Sparky and his 2,200 bolts of death,
he doesn't much care.

270
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,553
- What about you, huh?
- Yeah?

271
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,112
You could've popped that guard
just as easy as any one of us.

272
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,957
Yeah. We all know each other. We've been
doing this a while. You? We don't even know you.

273
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,155
No. You don't.

274
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,927
Job will access the main security panel
and break the various door codes...

275
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,561
and control panels
to the security cameras.

276
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,730
Eve, Cain and I will take
the upper floor...

277
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:58,572
with Eve manning the infrared thermal
sensor, and me securing the target.

278
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,577
You sure the target's
on the upper floor?

279
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:03,842
It's supposed to be. What I do know
is that it's kept in coldstorage.

280
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,679
That's where the infrared
thermal grid comes in.

281
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:10,778
- What about him?
- We walk in past the security guard.

282
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,789
The janitor uniforms are already set.

Hey, a guy like me is gonna be
hard-pressed to pass for a bucket jockey.

285
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,594
- You have a better idea, Mr.Job?
- Yeah. I do.

286
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,500
I, for one, want to know
who the hell you are, Mr. Peabody.

287
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,701
You know Elijah's rule. Total anonymity.
No names, no pasts, nothing.

288
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,710
- I already broke that rule.
- What? What are you talkin' about?

289
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:38,044
I swiped your glass from the coffee shop
last week. I had a friend of mine run the prints.

290
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:41,482
There ain't squat on you out there.
You know what I'm sayin'?

291
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:45,386
I mean, hell, every decent criminal
I know has got some kind of sheet.

292
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:48,118
What's the matter?
You never broke the law before?

293
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,353
I broke plenty.

294
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,362
I am just too damn smart,
too damn good...

295
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,058
and like my freedom too damn much
to ever get caught.

296
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:58,829
But, you, Mr.Job, on the other hand-
[Chuckles]

297
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,338
What's so funny?

298
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:05,534
Well, let's just say that I ran
a little fingerprint check on you as well.

299
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,276
Do you mind telling me exactly what
determines a lewd act... at a kennel?

Hey, Simple Simon, fini.

00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:33,193
Why is, uh, this guy so much
worse than the rest of us?

303
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,369
Each one of us is different.
[Sighs]

304
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,171
We'll all unravel
at our own genetic pace.

00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:45,443
Oh. Well, he's definitely
bringing up the rear.

00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:53,446
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Abel

Well, six, if you count the green bean.
[Grunts]

308
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:58,855
Leave him alone.

00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:04,160

311
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,602
- Don't do that!
- I gotta clean this up.

312
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:12,575
Come on. Get outta there.
Mom's dead!

313
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,634
You idiot! You stupid idiot!

314
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:18,546
She's dead! Has been for 10 years!
Wake up!

315
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,153
I'm gonna kill the next person
who says a word.

316
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,012
How's it coming already, huh?

317
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,914
- I'm workin' on it.
- Yeah? Well, hurry.

318
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,750
You should sit down. It will
slow the effects of the toxin.

[Coughing, Gasping]

320

00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:13,969
I didn't give you my blood before
because I was worried.

322
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,131
About what?

323
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:21,269
I'm pregnant.

324
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:24,143
Four months.

325
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:28,341
Do they know?

326
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:31,286
Yeah, sure.

327
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:34,950
They'd give me a perfect little
baby shower, don't you think?

328
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,356
So what's this gas
gonna do to my baby?

329
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,732
Airbornes-They can't pass
through a placenta.

330
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,239
Actually, your baby's
safer than you are.

331
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,405
Okay.
Y-You can take my blood.

332
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,708
As-As long as it's safe for the baby.

333
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,715
I promise.

334
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:04,081
- Got it?
- Got it.

335
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:08,990
Butyou're not gonna like it.
He's dialing 2725.

336
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,994
[Miss Parker]
My extension.

337
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,257
My God.

338
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,762
[Beeps, Rewinds]

339
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:22,272
Miss Parker, this is Leonard.
I saw something I probably shouldn't have.

340
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,240
Something meant to be burned. 
Memo B437.

341
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,278
It's something about an e-mail file
intercepted from your computer.

342
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:30,404
Miss Parker, you should see this.

343
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,915
- [Gunfire]
- [Leonard Grunts]

344
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,615
Someone broke into your computer.
That's why your e-mail wasn't working.

345
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,623
Doesn't the Centre's system keep, uh...

346
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,091
duplicates of-of all incoming
and outgoing e-mails?

347
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,788
Yeah, in the file allocation dump.
None of us have clearance there.

348
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:49,390
Get me that e-mail, Broots. Or someone
might find all of us in the dump.

349
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,062
Now I'm gonna die
'cause of Mark Beyer's bike.

350
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:56,072
Come again.

351
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,698
First thing I ever stole.

352
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:01,709
You know, it had this speed shifter
and this banana seat.

353
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,646
It was the most beautiful thing
I ever saw.

354
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:09,982
It was almost worth the cops chasing me just
so I could ride that thing down Arlington Hill.

355
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,750
Where did Elijah recruit these two?
The Boy Scouts?

356
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,787
Hey, look at this.

357
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,496
That Brittany girl, her body...

358
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,900
was found stuffed in a toy chest
just like this, wasn't it?

359
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,632
What the hell is going on?

360
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:33,473
I mean, the paper is one thing,
but this? This is Elijah!

361
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:36,809
- He's messing with our minds!
- What difference does it make?

362
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,946
We need to keep our minds in the here and
the now. Who cares what happened months ago?

363
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,250
I agree! The here and now!

364
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:48,985
Like-Like how I want
my hundred grand. Here and now.

365
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,857
Where's the pay? Huh? Where?

366
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,160
We did the job!
We did the damn job!

367
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,659

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,739

- Ready to loop signal on security camera one.
- [Beeps]

370
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:53,823
- Clear.
- Go.

[Beeping]

373
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,534
You're clear.

374
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:18,743
[Eve]
I have infrared readings.

375
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:22,547
I'm getting extreme temperature drop
in room 2108. That one.

376
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,919
Security camera-

377
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:33,587
Clear. Security door code is 61684.

378
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:52,807
You're in the clean room.

379
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:03,593
The cold room chamber door code is...

380
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:08,928
202018.

381

[Bang]

383
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:22,272
- Next time, knock.
- Your limo awaits.

384
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:31,616
Job, are we clear?
Job, are we clear to come out? Job?

385
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:35,147
- [Jarod] Come on.
- Wait. Job, are we clear?

386
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,817
The hell with it! Come on!

387
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,464
There's no guard.
Where's the guard?

388
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,557
My communication pieces
shorted out. Sorry.

389
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:46,432
Don't you ever leave me hanging out
like that again. You understand?

390
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:49,370
- [Alarm Beeping]
- Come on, move! Let's get outta here! Move!

392
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:57,571
[Groans]
Myinsides are starting to boil.

393
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,741
- Come on. It won't be long now.
- [Groaning]

394
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,751
I don't want to lose my baby.

395
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:06,882
- You won't. Not-Not if I can help it.
- [Crying]

396
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:12,395
Thank you. There's not a lot of
love in this room, you know?

397
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,897

Oh, my- It's her stuff.

400
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,912
- [Job] Whose stuff?
- [Abel] Brittany Tate.

401
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,919
- The dead girl's stuff. It's her stuff.
- What?

402
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,251
- Her stuff.
- What are you babblin' about?

403
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:44,227
Nothin' in there.

404
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:46,626
No. No.

405
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:51,828
No. I saw a doll, and a pillow,
a picture, a music box.

406
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,870
Listen, I smelled perfume.
[Coughs]

407
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:56,963
The guy's startin'to lose it here.

408
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,737
I don't want to die. I don't
want to die. Not like this. [Gasping]

409
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,278
[Eve]
Oh, my skin's on fire.

410
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,678
Come on, science guy.
What's takin' so long?

411
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,780
Freeze!

412
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:21,228
Elijah's not gonna like it
if you execute his messengers.

413
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:23,425
- Elijah?
- Sent us to pick up the gas.

414
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,900
[Cain] Dirty cops as messenger boys?
Typical Elijah.

415
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:28,938
Hey, man, you got our money?

416
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:40,310
- What is this? A joke?
- What? What is it?

417
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:44,582
- There's like 10 grand here.
- Hey, the deal was one hundred grand each.

418
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,555
Mr. Elijah is less than satisfied
with the way the job went down.

419
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:52,455
He'll be in touch. Until then, if you just
give us the canisters, we'll be on our way.

420
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:57,122
- Not for 10 large.
- [Electronic Ringing]

421
00:28:57,197 --> 00:29:00,394
- Get over there. Move!
- You have a video phone call.

422
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,992
Where's the damn money
you promised us?

423
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,836
It's going to be much harder to sell now
that it's become such a sought after commodity.

424
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:10,809
Somebody's going to have to pay for that.
That somebody is you people.

425
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:15,144
You're scum! You know that?
I'm gonna find you, pal. I will!

426
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:18,378
Even if you knew where I was, Mr. Job,
you'd never have the nerve.

427
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:20,420
Well, maybe not him, Elijah...

428
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:25,247
but you forgot about me.

429
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:32,999
Now, I'm going to send
your healthy messenger back for our money.

430
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:37,766
If he isn't here in two hours,
the police get the canisters. Is that clear?

431
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:41,535
Clear enough. I just hope
you all live long enough.

432
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:45,170
Oh, by the way, this now ends
your broadcast day.

[Beeping]

434
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:59,724
Wait a minute. Mirage.

435
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,522
The e-mail was from Edna Raines.

436
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:09,869
That's impossible.
She can barely speak.

437
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:12,599
It seems she's had another
moment of clarity.

438
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,005
That's not all.
It's Mr. Raines who stole it.

439
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,373
How would Mr. Raines know
what was in my e-mail?

440
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:21,744
Looks like they've been monitoring
your m-mailbox since last Tuesday, Miss Parker.

441
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:25,808
Tuesday? That's the very day Edna
escaped from the institution.

442
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:30,084
- He must have anticipated her contacting you.
- What was in the e-mail?

443
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:33,888
Well, the text field was empty.
But there was a video file attached.

444
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,724
- [Typing]
- Play it.

445
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:38,697
- [Beeps]
- Uh-uh.

446
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:42,896
The only way to access the actual file is
from the computer it was transferred to.

447
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,371
Mr. Raines's office.

448
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,238
Then what are we waiting for?

449
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:52,707
I'm bleeding to death.

450
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,681
- Like any of you care.
- [Coughing]

451
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:02,017
Shouldn't have killed that little girl.

452
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:04,785
That's what made Elijah so angry.

453
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:07,918
Now there's the guard.

454
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:10,293
Which one of you dirtbags
is into suffocation, huh?

455
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:12,264
Was it you?

456
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,104

00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,481
A huge estate in Westbrook.

460
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:37,888
Inside were intelligence documents.

[Scoffs]
Worth a fortune.

462
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:44,826
Elijah hired us to get 'em.

463
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:49,232
Whoever found them was supposed
to bring them back to the van.

464
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:51,669
But somebody got greedy...

465
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,941
decided to take a little
side trip into the guesthouse.

466
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,706
Caretaker's daughter
wasn't supposed to be there.

467
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:29,775
I think Cain did her.

468
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:32,778
- Shut up!
- All for a few extra bucks.

I could smell it when
she'd tuck me in bed at night.

00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:01,826
[Scoffs]
Maybe that's a lie.

488
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:09,199

490
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:16,105
The ingredients in perfume,
they're known as notes, did you know that?

491
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:22,883
The perfumer, he acts as composer.

492
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:27,385
Now, me, I always went for the heart.

493
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:30,453
Some people, they could
only smell the top notes.

494
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,988
I went deeper to search for the soul.

The medical report just handed to me states
that the MAGNA Technologies Limited...

501

security guard has died from
injuries sustained during the robbery.

502
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,833
Well, that was smart.

503
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:11,359
He's dead! Didn't you hear that?
He's dead!

[Jarod]
He ain't the only one.

[Eve] Great. That's one more
corpse on our hands.

506

Oh, my God.
I'm bleeding. Oh, my God.

507
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:33,885
You've gotta finish the stuff. I'm gonna die.
You've gotta finish that stuff!.

508
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,725
I'm finishing it now.

Oh, no.
Oh, God, it's her.

511
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:04,089
It's her. It's the Tate kid.

512
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:08,025
So what? It's her. So what?

513
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:11,792
- She's dead! Just like we're gonna be.
- I didn't kill her. All right?

514
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,857
- I didn't say you did!
- It's not even her picture.

515
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:18,166
I didn't kill her.

516
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:21,230
Oh, damn it!

517
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:28,776
Now there's only enough
antidote f- for four of us.

518
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:34,950
[Eve]
So what does that mean?

519
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:38,082
[Jarod] I guess that means that
one of is going to die.

520
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:42,860
The question is, who?

[Helicopter Whirs In Distance]

522
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:52,037
[Eve] So how do we decide
who gets the antidote?

523
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:54,403
[Jarod] We'll leave out the one
who killed Brittany Tate.

524
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:56,999
Only problem is we don't
know who the killer is.

525
00:36:57,077 --> 00:36:59,477
- Well, we do.
- What are you talking about?

526
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,709
Process of elimination. I mean, it couldn't have
been me because I wasn't there, right?

527
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:06,082
I didn't kill her. I swear.
I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.

528
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:09,247
No. I know you didn't.

529
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,924
And I know you didn't.

530
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:21,494
And I know...

531
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:26,603
you didn't.

532
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:31,076
[Gasps] What's going on?
Give me the antidote.

533
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:35,012
- You don't deserve it.
- What? But why?

534
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:40,213
Because... you killed Brittany Tate.

535
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:49,091
Mr. Abraham, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

536
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:53,064
Am I? For starters, you're not
really pregnant, are you?

537
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:57,297
That was just a fabrication so no one would
believe you could ever possibly murder a child.

538
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,136
And I checked your blood for the pregnancy
hormone, H.C.G. [Imitates Buzzer]

- Thanks for playin'.
- The gas is making you crazy.

540
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,709
The most convincing
evidence was Brittany herself.

541
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:09,749
No one saw her that night
except for the killer.

542
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:11,909
Her picture wasn't in the papers. 
It wasn't on the news.

543
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:15,318
You were the only one who recognized
that photograph as a fake.

544
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:18,721
Because you remember what she
looked like the night you killed her.

- [Job] Whoa! Hey.
- Put your gun down. Put your gun down.

Look, if she killed the kid, then she's
the ticket to our money from Elijah.

But you were gonna get killed
by the gas too.

573
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:13,171
There was no Soman gas.
It was just a 12 hour intestinal virus...

574
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,107
with a little kicker to weaken
the sinus cavity and constrict breathing.

575

Not to mention a mild
herbal hallucinogen.

It was all a hoax.

Mr. Elijah cut a little deal to help us.

582
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:54,747
And to shorten his stay in prison.

doesn't look crazy there.
