You know, when people say, "all due respect,"
they generally don't have it.

111
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,299
Sir, it-it's just that I think that
your profile of the perp...

112
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,635
is exactly who
he wants us to think he is.

113
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:07,734
I think that his grudge against the city

He's trying to lead us
down a high-tech path...

121
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:29,264
but I believe that we can snag him
with a low-tech solution.

122
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,392
He's right-handed...

123
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,663
but he wants us
to believe he's a lefty.

124
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,331
The verticals and the horizontals
are all jagged...

125
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:40,240

writing with his subdominant hand.

- Uh, no, sir, but I was a palm reader once.

about your future here?

128
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:51,714
Sir, I believe
that our bomber...

129
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:55,690

necessarily disgruntled.

130
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,421
He's enjoying
watching us run around...

131
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:02,727

setting off explosions.

00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,713
as sort of a high-tech
Mr. Potato Head.

165
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,878
- Mister who?
- Potato Head.

166
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,981
<i>Oh. Now,</i>
<i>this is interesting.</i>

167
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:11,687
You call him Mr. Potato Head,
yet his head is his whole body?

168
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,559
Yeah.
Cool, huh?

169
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,655
He comes with little
interchangeable ears...

170
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,859
eyes and little hats.

171
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:21,734
Old Spud Man is the original
master of disguise.

172
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:24,569
You know, this would make
a wonderful toy for children.

173
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,139
Hey, Nobel, crank file
just turned up a hot one. Let's run.

174
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,340
- Hmm.
- <i>[Doorbell Ringing]</i>

175
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,315
Oh, God.
What'd he do?

176
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:41,050
Curtis! They finally
came to arrest you!

177
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:46,027
- Curtis!
- <i>Busy, Ma.!</i>

178
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:49,190
Mrs. Haring,
we're not here to arrest your son.

179
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:52,360
I knew someday the cops would
show up and take him away.

180
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:56,702
- <i>Curtis.!</i>
- <i>I said, get off my back.!</i>

181
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:00,140
- Ma'am, we just wanted to...
- Thirty years old, and he still lives in my basement.

182
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,940
Day in and day out,
writing his little letters.

183
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,277
I should've bought
stock in Bic.

184
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:08,875
Don't say nothing, Ma. This is all
going on tape somewhere. I know it.

185
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:12,251
Listen to that. Do you know
what it's done to my social life...

186
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:14,256
<i>having him</i>
<i>down there?</i>

187
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:18,192
- You're not gettin' nothin' out of me.
- I'm in the prime of my life.

188
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:22,095
I should go out, get myself some
nice shoes and find myself a man.

189
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:26,158
- Ma!
- Sir...

190
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:28,295
did you write these letters
to the utilities commission?

191
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:31,465
And I'll write a hundred more
till they give me back my workman's comp.

192
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,840
<i>I got an inoperable hernia</i>
<i>working for this city...</i>

193
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,539
and they threw me
to the wolves.

194
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:40,310
How'd you get that letter?
What's your name?

195
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,476
I'm Carlson.
This is, uh, Nobel.

196
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,952
Hold still, man.
I can't see your badge number.

197
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:49,082
<i>He don't have no hernia. Hejust don't</i>
<i>wanna move out of the basement.</i>

198
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,993
Shut up, Ma! You know how my legs
tingle every time I sit for too long.

199
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,031
Yeah, and I know
where you're sittin'!

200
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:58,590
Sir, we're not here to talk
about your workman's comp.

201
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:01,330
We want to ask you some questions
about your whereabouts.

202
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:04,669
Hey, if you think you got something on me,
you come back with a warrant.

203
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,710
Till then, me and my mother's got nothing
to say to you miscreants.

204
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:11,306
<i>I should've married</i>
<i>a dentist.</i>

205
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,282
- At least then his teeth'd be better.
- Ma!

206
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,114
This guy's classic
bomber material.

207
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,850
Former city worker,
domineering mother...

208
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:25,020
basement workshop,
a little antisocial behavior.

209
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,290
- <i>I'm not convinced.</i>
- Huh?

210
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:30,458
He's written 253 letters
to the city and counting.

211
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,798
If he's crossed the threshold
into planting bombs...

212
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,996
don't you think he would have given up
the correspondence?

213
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:38,199
- Did you notice what he called us in there?
- Miscreants.

214
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,302
- Right. Nobody uses that word
except for that guy and...
- The Fax Bomber.

215
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,576
I'm gonna get under this guy's skin
before he hurts someone else.

216
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:10,338
<i>[Electronic Squawking]</i>

217
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:14,503

Good morning!

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,705
<i>... five, six...</i>

nine, ten...

221
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,982
- You can stop counting. You're here.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

222
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:29,389
You must have stepped into the room.
It's 11 steps to the door.

223
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,053
I did.
That's very good.

224
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:35,564
It's funny, Dr. Jarod.
I used to hate math in school.

225
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:38,567
Now my entire life
is basic arithmetic.

226
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:40,728
Nine steps from my bed
to the bathroom...

227
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:44,331
14 steps to the hallway,
seven steps to the chair.

228
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,706
Just be happy
it's not long division.

229
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,245
It's a beautiful day.
Why don't we go outside?

230
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:53,373
Oh, no. l... l-I think
I'd rather stay here.

231
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,113
Rachel...

232
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,485
you have to go outside
sometime.

233
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:04,849
I was supposed to work
in my studio...

234
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:09,120
but it was such a nice day,
I decided to go on the rooftop at city hall.

235
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,957
That's what happened
the last time I went outside.

236
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:15,692
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

237
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:19,293
But that is not your fault.

238
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:22,099
You can't stop living your life
because of it.

239
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,273
I hear he set off
another bomb.

240
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,302
Yes, he did.
Thankfully, nobody else was hurt.

241
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,841
You know, when I had
my eyes behind a camera...

242
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,182
I could see things
no one else could see.

243
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>I could take</i>
<i>a thousand shots...</i>

244
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,119
<i>and tell you which one was peryect</i>
<i>before it was even developed.</i>

245
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:47,355
I can remember details of nearly
every picture I ever took.

246
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:50,229
<i>That's ironic.</i>

247
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,360
They tell me
he was there that day.

248
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:57,669
That I must have seen the man who did this
to me as he was setting his bomb.

249
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,511
<i>But as hard I try,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

250
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,362
I can't believe
they think one of us...

251
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,767
is leaking
information toJarod.

252
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:32,673
[Sighs] Oh, I wish I hadn't eaten
that poppy seed muffin.

253
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,337
They're giving us
a polygraph, you idiot...

254
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,744
not a urine test.

255
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,748
I thought it was both.

256
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:42,614
It should be,
for you.

257
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,348
What-What is that
supposed to mean?

258
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,687
You're the one who handles
the information around here.

259
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,489
I'm sorry. I'm in a filthy mood.
Let's not accuse each other.

260
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:55,498
Oh, that means a lot
coming from Jarod's teddy bear.

261
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,702
Miss Parker.

262
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,707
To calibrate the machine...

263
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,403
please answer the following
question untruthfully.

264
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,877
- Are you Eleanor Roosevelt?
- Yes.

00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,816
<i>Have you pursued Jarod</i>

<i>Tell me if she is lying.</i>

Yes.

Did you attempt to provide him

280
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:31,985
Yes, but with a view
to bringing him home.

281
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:36,624
- <i>Have you ever secretly met with Jarod?</i>
- Mm-mmm.

282
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,192
No.

283
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:45,204

<i>Did you leak the information</i>

00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,713
[Gasping]

293
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:40,259
He's the leak,
isn't he, Angelo?

294
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:39,455
So, you've decided to put in
a transfer to Forensics, hmm?

295
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,957
I've just been sifting though
all the Fax Bomber debris.

296
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:45,085
You went over three thousand
pieces of evidence here?

297
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,222
Three thousand
and twenty-five.

298
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,324
- I've specifically been studying the wires.
- No, no, no.

299
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:54,131
The feds, they covered every
centimeter of that copper.

300
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:57,503
I know. I've been studying
the encasements.

301
00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:00,509
<i>There's no pattern.</i>
<i>This guy is random...</i>

302
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:03,842
except for
the detonator connectors.

303
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:06,280
He's very sensitive
about them.

304
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,476
He wants to be sure.

305
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:11,749
That's why they all have exactly
the same parallel cut pattern.

306
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,813
Come on.
Exactly the same?

307
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,025
Exactly.

308
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:24,226
<i>Notice the angle of the grooves</i>
<i>on the parallels.</i>

309
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:27,600
<i>Gives us something to run down</i>
<i>with the knife manufacturers.</i>

310
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,299
- And the cut contours confirm that he's...
- Right-handed.

One hundred and seventy-nine.
I have a project for you.

<i>if you could age her</i>
<i>30 years.</i>

- <i>[Pager Beeping]</i>

- I'll make it worth your while.
- Hey, I'll see what I can do.

325
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,541
- Thanks.

00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:59,762
Well, I spent all morning on the phone
with a lawyer. He dropped my case.

488
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,196
Hmm.

489
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,291
I'm sorry to hear that.

490
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:07,633
Mmm.
Are you, Miss Parker?

491
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:11,505
Thanks to you, my daughter
hasn't stopped crying since last night.

492
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:14,544
Tomorrow, I have to send her back to her
mother, which is a place she doesn't want to go.

493
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,807
None of that has anything
to do with the Centre.

494
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:18,872
I work here.

495
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:23,749
I sold my soul to be in this place.
I'm not selling her.

496
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:27,757
So don't mess with her.
And don't mess with me.

497
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:19,975
Hey, Lamont,
what are you doing tonight?

498
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,577
- Hey, Carlson.
- What?

499
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:58,808
You'd better take
a look at this.

500
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,613
What?

501
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,157
Ugh. This is
some kind of hoax.

502
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:13,094
Now, we know the-the Fax Bomber
is in a hospital bed.

503
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,256
Well, I guess he
checked himself out.

504
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,493
Let's go.

505
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:24,205
- Main elevator banks.
- Right over there.

506
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:29,710
- Come on!
- Maybe we should wait for backup.

507
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,611
And miss our chance
to be heroes?

508
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,616
<i>Come on.</i>

509
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,288
Whoa.
Another Bad Betty.

510
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:47,887
Oh, God.

511
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,861
Let's not rush
into anything here.

512
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:56,934
Oh, look.
He left a note.

513
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:01,137
<i>Careful. Slow.</i>

514
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,548
"This time it's real."

515
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,815
Hmm. See?

516
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:13,322
- No!
- <i>[Bell Dings]</i>

517
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:19,394
<i>Forget it, Carlson.</i>

518
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:23,263
This is the express.
It won't stop for 60 floors.

519
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:26,565
<i>Oh-oh.</i>
<i>Sixty floors if we're lucky.</i>

520
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:31,074
- What are you talking about?
- Barometric detonator.

521
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:34,235
Designed to detonate
at altitudes 600 or 700 feet.

522
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:38,179
<i>My guess is we're good</i>
<i>for 45, 50 floors, tops.</i>

523
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:46,149
- We gotta get out of here!
- No, we've gotta defuse this bomb.

524
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:49,090
- No, there's no time!
- <i>Oh, there's plenty of time.</i>

525
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,787
<i>It should be easy for you.</i>

526
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:54,660
It's just like all the other bombs
you used to make.

527
00:40:54,732 --> 00:40:56,461

<i>just like your big brother was?</i>
- Who the hell are you?

530
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:08,538
Just your average,
everyday miscreant.

531
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:11,809
<i>And someone who doesn't think that</i>
<i>Rachel Newton should have lost her eyesight...</i>

532
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:13,816
so that you could be
put in the limelight.

533
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:17,285
Now, listen to meJarod.
I did not expect anybody to get hurt.

534
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:20,687
Tell that to Curtis Haring.
He was the guy you tried to blow up...

535
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:22,282
so you could
cover your tracks.

536
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,691
All right! That's enough!
Now, come on! Defuse this thing!

537
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:27,560
Not so cool under pressure
when it's not your own bomb.

<i>But you see, people that plant bombs,</i>
<i>they're cowards at heart.</i>

539
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:36,699
And since I planted this one, I don't
want to stick around to watch it blow.

Twentieth floor.
Better get to work.

542
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:52,746

which wire to snip.
