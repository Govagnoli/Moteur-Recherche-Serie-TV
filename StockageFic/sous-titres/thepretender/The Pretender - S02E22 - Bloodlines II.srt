1
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:02,896
Previously on the pretender:

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,338
I am glad to be part of the Nugenesis family.

3
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:07,541
Family is all those fertility clinics all about.

4
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:09,957
If you want help, I'll help you.

5
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,220
- Why should I trust you?
- Because you mother did.

6
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:16,574
What did you mean by Prodigy? What answers are in the red files?

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,075
It's working, Parker.

8
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,319
Angelo's mind is working again.

9
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:22,517
Why didn't you tell me I had a twin?

10
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,353
We buried him, but not to pain.

11
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:26,036
He was alive.

12
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:27,738
I have a brother.

13
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,442
He can't be doing it again.

14
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:30,938
They're going to take another child.

15
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:32,895
The Center's going to make another pretender.

16
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:35,196
There are pretenders among us.

17
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:37,638
I was taken from my family.

18
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:41,359
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

19
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,796
How many people died because of what I thought up?

20
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:47,958
Since I broke up, I've spent every moment searching for my past.

21
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,456
He is a pretender.

22
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,937
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

23
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,414
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

24
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:57,702
He defends the weak and abused.

25
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:58,777
Life is a gift.

DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

29
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:10,796
You are a doctor?

30
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:12,238
I am today.

31
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:19,062
Where is he?

32
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:20,381
Who?

33
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,682
The child.

34
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:23,480
Prodigy.

35
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:25,342
They must have set up a relay.

36
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:27,953
A safehouse before the boy arrives here.

37
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:30,080
I am not going to lose him, Sydney.

38
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:31,213
What are you going to do?

39
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:33,453
I have doors on my own to open.

40
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:45,662
How are you, angel?

41
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,053
Sweetheart?

42
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,711
Tell me about my brother.

43
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:03,279
- I thought we already dealt with that.
- He didn't die at birth.

44
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,437
What were you saying? Why are you doing this?

45
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,700
What's wrong with him? Tell me what's wrong with him?

46
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:16,513
Sorry, Catherine, the second child is stillborn.

47
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:25,182
The male baby is ready for transportation to Nugenesis.

48
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:34,418
Daddy?

49
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,821
You didn't know about this?

50
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,019
How can you even ask me that?

51
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:48,998
Raines.

52
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,654
I'll take care of this.

53
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:56,956
Are you alright?

54
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,319
I will be when we find my brother.

55
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:01,062
In a way,

56
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:03,496
it's a gift.

57
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:05,597
Gift?

58
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,681
I have a son.

59
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:26,760
Sun feels good.

60
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:29,272
Warm.

61
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:31,558
Free.

62
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:36,494
When I first escaped the Center,

63
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,856
I used to take a long walk in the sunshine.

64
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,740
I couldn't breath deep enough to feel my lungs.

65
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,134
I remember, when I was small,

66
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,077
before they locked me away under the world,

67
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,676
I remember,

68
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,853
- What do you remember?
- Music.

69
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:34,554
Angelo.

70
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:40,741
Do you remember anything about where you were taken before they locked you under the world?

71
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,336
I can't remember.

72
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:52,232
Time for medicine.

73
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:54,972
Two more treatments.

74
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:56,881
Maybe this will help you remember.

75
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,112
We have to remember.

76
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,158
For the boy.

77
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:02,958
For the boy.

78
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:09,116
Nothing on the mainframe about a safehouse.

79
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,893
- Fenigor's red files.
- All seven.

80
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,591
I found them in my father's office.

81
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:21,560
You stole those from Mr. Parker?

82
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,182
Is that a problem?

83
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,013
Not for you.

84
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,113
Fenigor said the answers are in these files.

85
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,698
That does ignite by code numbers only.

86
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,883
Do you think one of these files could have something to do with Jarod?

87
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:37,293
What are you getting at?

88
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,336
No one knows how old Jarod is.

89
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,901
And if your twin was taken to Nugenesis,

90
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,652
do you think maybe Jarod could be your brother?

91
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,919
The answer is in Nugenesis.

92
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,542
I want to see the boy.

93
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,121
He is upstairs sleeping. You can see him on the monitor.

94
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:26,995
Neuro-pathway stimulation in progress.

95
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,401
And progressing smoothly.

96
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,480
Should we get him back to the Center?

97
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,521
He can't be moved yet.

98
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,260
This treatment is predicated on a straight timetable.

99
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,637
By morning he will be ready for transport.

100
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,772
Where am I?

101
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:53,559
The ten digit number is under the expediter. They're the same of all seven files.

102
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,614
Try running ... ID number.

103
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,215
Oh, man.

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,238
What is it?

105
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:02,415
You were right, Syd.

106
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:07,098
The number is identification code for the expediter who brought the children to the Center.

107
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:07,838
And?

108
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,794
And you will not gonna believe who it is.

109
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:13,618
Fenigor?

110
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:14,919
Fenigor?

111
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:16,692
Fenigor, wake up, man.

112
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:19,932
I need to know about Prodigy.

113
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,441
Red files.

114
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,175
The children.

115
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,453
Catherine, we could not save them.

116
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:34,317
I have to know where the children were taken before being brought to SL27.

117
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,016
Charleston.

118
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:39,753
Charleston, South Carolina.

119
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,714
Blue box inception.

120
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:45,591
Inception, that's the room in SL27.

121
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:48,162
Are there more computer files there?

122
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,416
Answer, red files.

123
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:57,099
Eighth file.

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Eighth file?

125
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,359
Sydney, there is only supposed to be seven files.

126
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:22,918
It's beautiful.

127
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,994
People where I grew up play that,

128
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:27,982
when I was little.

129
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,882
I need you to remember when you were taken.

130
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:34,652
I know it's hard.

131
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,732
There is a little boy out there in danger.

132
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:41,959
Like I was?

133
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,311
Just like you.

134
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:50,956
They were men.

135
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,018
Where did they take you?

136
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:02,538
A house.

137
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,454
A glass house.

138
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,001
Tell me about this house.

139
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:16,012
Big.

140
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:19,478
Dark.

141
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,021
What else do you see?

142
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,017
A statue.

143
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,192
What kind of statue?

144
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:34,362
A lady.

145
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,158
An angel.

146
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:41,758
- The sign said: Angel Manor.
- Angel Manor?

147
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:45,158
Thank you.

148
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:46,859
Thank you.

149
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,260
Yes.

150
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:55,015
Charleston, South Carolina. All I know.

151
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,592
Thank you,Sydney.

152
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,121
The first treatment is almost done.

153
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:09,153
What exactly are you doing with the boy?

154
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,073
Helping to prepare for his future.

155
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:13,982
As what?

156
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,516
The pretender has the bloodline show the gift.

157
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,338
I am helping to focus his potential.

158
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:21,782
Like you did to Angelo?

159
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,180
Angelo was a mistake. Trial and error.

160
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:32,799
With the new technology I'll be able to focus the neuro stimulation to the parts of his brain I want to hyper develop.

161
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,959
Is that what you did to create Jarod?

162
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,615
No, Jarod was a natural pretender.

163
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,895
I'm merely trying to recreate him.

164
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,962
What was that? Willie.

165
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,142
- Where is it?
- Over there.

166
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,654
Angelo crawled into the storm drain.

167
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,062
Get the generator on now.

168
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,282
Mr. Raines, power is out.

169
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:42,094
Get back to the boy now.

170
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,793
Jarod.

171
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:19,859
How is he?

172
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,534
They hurt him like they did me.

173
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:26,281
Like they did me.

174
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:38,855
Tell me how long he has.

175
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:45,075
Basically motor skills has diminished and he's been unresponsive to external stimuli for hours.

176
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:47,174
What did you see at the Angel Manor?

177
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,242
Neuro-receptors.

178
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,636
That's the very same process Raines used on Angelo.

179
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:54,176
Well, there is one ray of hope.

180
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,276
Angelo's treatment seems to work.

181
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,492
Is he with you?

182
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:00,716
Yes. And I'm hoping the same treatment can be used on Davy.

183
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,082
It could.

184
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,532
But Raines's new process would be much harder to reverse,

185
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:08,236
if possible ...

186
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:11,592
The brain is a non-forgiving area, Jarod.

187
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,642
Time is against you.

188
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,617
So you're saying that if we don't counteract Raines's treatment,

189
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,576
Davy's degeneration could be irreversible.

190
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:20,491
It will be.

191
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:24,573
You have three hours or less to synthesize the new serum.

192
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,255
I won't let him do it again.

193
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:31,001
Jarod, there is something else you should know.

194
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:34,182
It's about you, you and Miss Parker.

195
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:35,778
''Inception''

196
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:39,655
You think it's true that Jarod is Miss Parker's brother?

197
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:42,683
If Fenigor is right, the answer is under here.

198
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:56,516
Well, maybe we would find blue box in the junk somewhere.

199
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,597
Hello, nurse.

200
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:02,662
Here it is, Syd.

201
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:09,220
I got it. You know this is one blue ex cube I don't know if I want to solve.

202
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:12,293
Maybe if I don't decrypt the information on it,

203
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,413
I might even be able to sleep in nights.

204
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:46,614
Syd.

205
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:49,198
I found it.

206
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,699
''Records Lab''

207
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,432
How much longer?

208
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:58,751
Ten minutes.

209
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,673
- Thank you for getting me in here.
- Save it until I get you out.

210
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:20,102
I know you can hear me.

211
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:23,233
I've been where you are, Davy.

212
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,062
I've been you.

213
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,238
Jarod is going to make everything alright.

214
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,202
Jarod's gonna make it alright.

215
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:35,454
You are sure that stuff's gonna help that boy?

216
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,491
If he gets it in time.

217
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,979
I can't believe that all these happened again.

218
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,216
This isn't your fault.

219
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:47,961
But you were, Jarod.

220
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,375
And all these years, I've been asking God for forgiveness.

221
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:56,740
Well, I don't know about God's. But you have mine.

222
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,741
''Dr. Jarod Spock''

223
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,042
''Oakview 555-6507''

224
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,155
Hello, Oakview Lodge.

225
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,302
It's clear. Come on.

226
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:53,175
Thank you for giving me a little piece of my past.

227
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,913
And thank you for giving me a peace of mind.

228
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:00,518
Good luck.

229
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:06,458
Where is the boy?

230
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:11,173
He's safe.

231
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:12,357
Unlike you.

232
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:26,833
Sorry.

233
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:30,360
Get up.

234
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,359
Let him go.

235
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,219
Go, Jarod.

236
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,574
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.

237
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,596
This is my chance to make it right.

238
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:44,659
Go.

239
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:45,732
For the boy.

240
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,733
No.

241
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:00,934
Damn it.

242
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:10,335
Oh, man.

243
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:14,113
All seven red files, plus the eighth, just like Fenigor said.

244
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,355
Does it say if they are brother and sister?

245
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:18,733
Oh, you are not gonna believe what it says.

246
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:25,734
Angelo.

247
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:28,635
Angelo.

248
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,212
I've got it.

249
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,134
It's not the kid you need to worry about.

250
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:40,037
Well, it's good to see you again.

251
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,719
Sis.

252
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,882
How do you know I have a brother?

253
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,753
You've got the red files too?

254
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:10,501
Mr. Fenigor was right about Prodigy.

255
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,413
Our bloodlines and the lies the Center fed us.

256
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:20,196
- What are you saying that you're my ...
- There were eight red files.

257
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:21,101
Eight?

258
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:25,802
Each of these files represents one of the children the Center isolated as a potential pretender.

259
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:29,473
There were seven children that your mother tried to save.

260
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:31,994
But the secret to your past,

261
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,152
is in the 8th file.

262
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:36,982
The 8th child.

263
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:38,918
You got my attention.

264
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,994
Nugenesis monitored these eight children for the Center.

265
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,198
They screened them.

266
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:47,272
You see there is a special anomaly in our blood,

267
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:48,836
in our genetics.

268
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,593
They predisposes us with a gift.

269
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:53,840
What is the big secret of number eight?

270
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,176
Number eight,

271
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,039
it's you.

272
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,871
My blood was tested?

273
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:09,582
Yours and your ... twin brother who supposedly died at birth.

274
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,911
Instead he was wasted off to Nugenesis.

275
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:18,154
I've narrowed your brother's identity down to these two files.

276
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:24,396
One of these belong to you?

277
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:35,897
No.

278
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,435
I am not your brother.

279
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:41,836
But one of these files does belong to him.

280
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:45,258
Him?

281
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:48,500
And the other two of the boy named Bobby.

282
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,079
But you know him better as,

283
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:52,892
Mr. Lyle.

284
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,355
So you are telling me,

285
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:04,237
that my brother is either a psychotic killer or a mush head.

286
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:05,817
It's unmistakable.

287
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:10,156
I need a drink.

288
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:14,532
Big one.

289
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,313
That him?

290
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:20,502
His name is Davy.

291
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,098
Raines's new pretender.

292
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,637
As you can see, Raines already has a jump on it.

293
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:28,422
Now Davy's only hopeful recovery is an injection of serotonin.

294
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:31,639
And if I don't give it to him now, his condition becomes irreversible.

295
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:38,361
No one's doing anything until I figure out what the hell is going on.

296
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,092
If you want to shoot me, then go ahead and do it.

297
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,102
False bravado.

298
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:51,500
Never cared for that in a man.

299
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,572
Help us!

300
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:01,982
Your mum,

301
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,475
may be my mum.

302
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:11,223
died trying to save children like Davy.

303
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:15,617
Do it for her.

304
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:35,620
Do it.

305
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:01,295
I heard shots. Are you alright?

306
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:11,696
Oh, god.

307
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:15,294
What can we do?

308
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:21,958
Nothing.

309
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:30,292
It's over.

310
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,338
No, it's not.

311
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,239
Angelo.

312
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:48,302
That's your last treatment.

313
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,672
- Without it you¡­
- He is a boy.

314
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,356
Let him be a boy.

315
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:07,357
Please.

316
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:45,858
Sydney.

317
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:47,762
This is more than I can take.

318
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:51,579
Stolen kids, stillborn babies that aren't, Miss Parker's brother.

319
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,456
Re-activating SL27.

320
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:56,038
It is my fault.

321
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,916
I should have stopped this years ago.

322
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:00,861
Come on, Sydney, what could you've done?

323
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:02,298
I could have tried.

324
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:04,055
Catherine Parker tried.

325
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,099
Fenigor tried.

326
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:09,033
She is dead and he soon will be.

327
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:14,198
Now deader than I'll feel inside if I don't try out.

328
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,541
What? Syd, I mean what could you possibly do?

329
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:22,542
Syd, Syd.

330
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:24,098
Wait a minute.

331
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:59,334
That lady with the legs, she's threw a wicked right hook.

332
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,975
It's difficult to distinguish between her bite and her bark.

333
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:05,973
I read it so. Look at this.

334
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,061
I found this dash away in my parents belongings.

335
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,196
It's a young one of you.

336
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:14,155
I remember your dad taking it.

337
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:16,658
It's on the morning just like today.

338
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,338
Do you know if I was their child?

339
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,476
or if I was adopted?

340
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:29,077
No.

341
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,452
I just know they loved you.

342
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:36,952
Very much.

343
00:29:58,823 --> 00:29:59,578
Where am I?

344
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:06,951
You are safe.

345
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:10,080
Are you the substitute teacher?

346
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,381
Yeah.

347
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:14,912
Yes, I am.

348
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:17,713
Yes, I am.

349
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,639
And you are going to be home.

350
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:22,178
Soon.

351
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:31,275
I like this song.

352
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:35,212
Me too.

353
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,735
Is it possible?

354
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,492
Maybe.

355
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,514
I wish I could've known you, the real you.

356
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:21,075
I wish I could've known the real you.

357
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,735
Mum loved that song.

358
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:26,155
She played it for me.

359
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:30,653
Tell me about her.

360
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:38,754
Well.

361
00:31:40,863 --> 00:31:44,594
They say she looked,

362
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,822
Just like you.

363
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:53,023
Yeah.

364
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:58,153
Her smile made me feel safe.

365
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,211
Her compassion,

366
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,501
I can only dream of duplicating.

367
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,358
She loved to read to me,

368
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,694
take long walks with me.

369
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:14,222
She loved me.

370
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:17,381
And I loved her.

371
00:32:20,143 --> 00:32:21,654
I miss her everyday.

372
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:26,572
You see her everyday.

373
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:39,502
I know, you don't have much time, but,

374
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,381
do you remember something,

375
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:45,877
anything that could tell me who killed her?

376
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:51,261
Who killed mum?

377
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:55,980
I know it's there.

378
00:32:57,503 --> 00:32:58,258
Somewhere.

379
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:05,640
I saw, I,

380
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:08,041
I,

381
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:10,542
watched.

382
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:17,838
A man.

383
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:18,872
What man?

384
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:33,482
What man?

385
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:37,952
Leave me alone.

386
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:45,099
A man in a dark suit.

387
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:46,878
Who?

388
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,502
I don't know.

389
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:58,976
Fenigor knows.

390
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:02,377
Yes.

391
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:09,781
But I hope you did too.

392
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:15,815
She played it for you.

393
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:19,982
I play it for you.

394
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,801
That was beautiful.

395
00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,302
''Danger Explosives''

396
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:13,532
I want a twenty-four-hour lockdown on all personnel

397
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,736
for security checks and final test runs.

398
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:20,998
No one in or out. Is that clear?

399
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:28,499
Raines.

400
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:31,180
This is Gar. I am in Nugenesis.

401
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:33,056
I know where they are.

402
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:37,531
And, who is with them.

403
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,519
Then work back in business.

404
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:51,432
In twelve hours, I'm putting you out of business.

405
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,000
He is okay to travel now.

406
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:40,836
We have to move.

407
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,758
I can't let you leave, Jarod, you know that.

408
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:48,651
Is this what your mother would've done?

409
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:02,442
It's time to go home.

410
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:23,562
Where are you taking me?

411
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,259
It doesn't have to be this way.

412
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:40,179
New blood for the Center, your mother would be so proud of you.

413
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:40,820
Save it.

414
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:44,054
I saw your face when Angelo gave up his last treatment for Davy.

415
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:46,019
Let's go.

416
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,820
Angelo.

417
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:49,992
Are you alright?

418
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:53,700
What's wrong with him?

419
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:04,322
Off me.

420
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:07,223
Jarod.

421
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,224
Jarod.

422
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,438
Save Davy.

423
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:13,439
Angelo.

424
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:28,301
Guess your gun jammed, huh?

425
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:35,122
Davy free.

426
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:38,973
Miss Parker's still in hell.

427
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:01,218
We can't accept this.

428
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:04,241
Mr. Brewster, creating a whole new life doesn't come cheap.

429
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:07,535
Believe me. That's you cover everything at Davy, you,

430
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,493
your new family's going to ever need.

431
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:12,773
If you don't want to do this, I understand.

432
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,136
If what you've told us is true,

433
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:18,801
Davy is gonna need all the love we can get.

434
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:23,262
Is that your family?

435
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:27,852
It will be.

436
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:30,378
Some day.

437
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,839
His regression is complete.

438
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:38,975
And irreversible.

439
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:41,318
I am sorry.

440
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:45,740
Will he remember anything?

441
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,262
Well, he'll remember all that's important.

442
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:56,153
Where are you going?

443
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:58,481
Unfinished business.

444
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:08,382
Mr. Fenigor.

445
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:10,383
Mr. Fenigor.

446
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,684
Catherine.

447
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:14,785
No.

448
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:16,582
I am her daughter.

449
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:21,331
My mother isn't here.

450
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:23,902
She is.

451
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:25,752
In spirit.

452
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:28,876
How did you get back into the Center?

453
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,377
The same way I am going to get out.

454
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:34,415
If you get out, why did you come?

455
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:36,940
I want to know who I am.

456
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:40,295
And I'd rather die trying to find out than live not knowing.

457
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:45,556
He is sleeping in and out.

458
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:48,398
My parents.

459
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,299
- Tell me about my parents.
- Who killed my mother?

460
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,854
A man in a dark suit.

461
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,755
A man in a dark suit.

462
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,742
Who is the man in a dark suit?

463
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:03,117
The man who killed your mother.

464
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:04,578
Who is he?

465
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:08,794
Jarod's father.

466
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,095
Jarod.

467
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:50,871
What's that, Broots?

468
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:52,655
It's security alarm.

469
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,532
It's in SL27.

470
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:56,942
SL27?

471
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,117
It would be no one down there.

472
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:01,953
Well, the surveillance camera says there is.

473
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:04,698
It's Jarod.

474
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:11,101
- Mr. Raines, securities just reported a breach in SL27.
- What kind of breach?

475
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,102
Well, according to surveillance, it's Jarod.

476
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:14,133
Jarod is back.

477
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:20,634
Jarod.

478
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,738
It's like another dead end.

479
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,916
I know all I need to know.

480
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,098
Do you?

481
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:32,857
Have all the deceit, and all the betrayal we both experienced, how do you know what the truth is?

482
00:42:32,943 --> 00:42:34,362
Fenigor had no reason to lie.

483
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:37,938
Then you're going to have to shoot me, because I am going to find out the truth.

484
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:41,240
But we want you alive, Jarod.

485
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,812
I...., angel.

486
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:47,413
Jarod.

487
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:50,539
Jarod, get out. There is a bomb.

488
00:42:52,983 --> 00:42:53,713
Forgive me.

489
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,714
