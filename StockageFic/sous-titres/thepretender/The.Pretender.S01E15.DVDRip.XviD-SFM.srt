<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod was a real even-tempered man.</i>

2

Stayed here for about a week,
then he was gone.

3
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:43,825
I sort of act as
building manager here...

4

is acupuncture.

5

<i>Jarod really got into it too.</i>

6
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,674
You stuck needles into him?

7
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:55,041
<i>Actually, I taught him</i>
<i>how to do it himself.</i>

8
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:57,273
- For what purpose?
- Stress reduction.

9
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,307
I'm very good at reducing
tensions in the body.

10
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,843
Funny. I'm very good
at causing them.

11
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:09,188
Jarod wanted the needles placed
along the brachial plexus.

12

<i>Brachial plexus?</i>
<i>Nerve center for the upper extremities?</i>

17
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:31,646
- When did he leave?
- Two days ago.

18
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:36,379

You know, Jarod, if my instincts

somewhere near the New York City area.

331

Excuse me? What business is it of yours
what my clearance level is?

- I've been trying to contact Sydney.
- Join the party.

338

He and Miss Parker went looking for you two
days ago. We haven't heard from them since.

339

She's too persistent for her own good.
You're going to have to find them.

You don't know how peaceful
it's been here without her.

341
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:23,172
Would it be more peaceful
working for Raines?

342
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,973
- Mr. Raines? No.
- Take down this address.

Stop torturing yourself.

I know it wasn't suicide.

350
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,804
Was she murdered because
of the rescued children?

351
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:12,174
- I don't know.
- Was it my father?

352
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:20,245
Miss Parker, I know about your mother's life,
not about her death.

353
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,292
<i>She was a kind woman...</i>

354
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,888
a driving force at the Centre in those days
when it was still involved in...

355
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:31,757

356
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:38,871
I can't believe the Centre
was ever involved with anything positive.

357
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:44,778

democracies during the cold war.

Well, I never actually knew my mother,

I'm looking for a D-Mac.

- You gonna put him on TV?
- Quite possibly, yes.

- Tell me what happened.
- <i>A man hits my cell phone.</i>

391
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:08,686
He must've paid somebody
off to get the number. Sounded white.

392
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:12,495
Tells me he wants to talk about
the turf wars. Sounded cool to me.

393
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:16,561
This white man that called you,
is that unusual?

394
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,232
You really didn't have
no mother, did you?

395
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:27,515

Why else would Phil have been wearing a
bulletproof vest the night that Ken was shot?
