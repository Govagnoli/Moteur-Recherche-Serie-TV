Ok, we're losing him.

- Call the radiology to get a head CT stand.

Patrick.

34
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,179
So that's how you look without the beard.

What do you want?

36
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:26,976

39

I'll give you whatever you want.

40
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:39,137
Please, don't hurt my son.

41
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,638
There are pretenders among us.

42
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:45,778
I was taken from my family.

Thirty-Six Hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

How many people died because of what I thought up?

45
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:56,136
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

46
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,976
He is a pretender.

47
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,256
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

48
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:03,894
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

49
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,015
He defends the weak and the abused.

50
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:07,452

It makes a very popular anti-depressant, called Panalex.

00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,333
Jarod was an employee there for three weeks.

85

- Who did he help?
- Nobody.

86

00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:46,979
It is a sound lead.

93
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:51,097
It means nothing until we find Jarod's emotional purpose.

94
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:54,455
Jarod's purpose is to harass the Center.

95
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:55,971
He's after my stock.

96
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:58,333
If he were after your stock, you'd be broke.

97
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:02,860
Jarod is driven by altruism.

98
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:06,533
You want him out there trying to help the Little Guy?

99
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,620
The answer is the Little Guy.

100
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:12,691
If you want to find Jarod, find the person he's trying to help.

101
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,900
I want my dad...

102
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:56,856
Is he going to make it?

103
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:58,940
It's too soon to tell.

104
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,422
But he's going to be there about for at least two more weeks.

105
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:06,691
Look, Doc, I was a little rough on you back there, but...

106
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,656
You want Patrick back just as much as his father does.

107
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:11,422
I understand.

108
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:14,822
You said the kidnapper left a cell phone for you.

109
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,691
- From now on, I occupy myself some.
- Mr. Alambar.

110
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,775
He saw me.

111
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:23,619
By becoming George Harper, I brought the boy one more day of life.

112
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,939
I want you to tell me how that happened.

113
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,895
Mr. Harper got a note after three.

114
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,253
He called me, said to meet at the phone booth.

115
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:40,101
A limo drops off Patrick every morning to school,

116
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,055
picks him up in the afternoon.

117
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,298
Today,

118
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,295
the driver found only this.

119
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:49,181
Did you talk to this limo driver?

120
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,658
He found the backpack where Patrick usually waits.

121
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,138
We've known this guy for years, he's been with us for a long time.

122
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,778
But I've been running new backfround check on him just in case.

123
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,931
Mr. Harper is ready to pay off this bastard.

124
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,501
But I know how these people think.

125
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:07,415
I'm a ex FBl, worked a few abductions.

126
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,862
More than likely,

127
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:14,533
they'll probably kill Patrick just he won't ID them.

128
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,654
He is a professional.

129
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:22,176
He wants us to feel a total loss of control,

130
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,853
so he can fulfill his fantasy of power.

131
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:27,493
What do you know about kidnappers, doctor?

132
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,175
When I was a boy,

133
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:32,461
I was stolen from my parents.

134
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,694
I can help you get Patrick back.

135
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,974
But you'are going to have to trust me.

136
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,493
Otherwise by this time tomorrow, Patrick could be dead.

137
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,055
Keep the phone.

138
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:51,578

You will be starting special school soon, Jarod.

142
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:08,382
It's that why those teachers came to see me yesterday.

143
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:11,780
Yes, it is. They say you have a gift.

144
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,213
Of course I already knew ...

145
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,422
You are gonna love it, Jarod.

Oh, this is quite an honor. I am Judith Peck.

Heavenhurst is a much better place since your scholarship funds...

153
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:12,295
You opened the school to a member of disadvantaged students.

154
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:16,261
- I'm sorry if I seemed a little surprised to see you.
- I understand.

155
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,099
I am here about my son.

156

This is Martin Benton. He oversees security for this school.

157

I am so sorry about this, Mr. Harper.

158
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,937
Nothing like this has ever happened here, sir.

159
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:29,901
I am shocked.

160
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,102
I stongly urge to call the police.

161
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,139
I cannot.

162
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,340
It is one of the kidnapper's demands.

163
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,538
If I could just find something, anything that would help...

164
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,661
He was in session after school.

165
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,158
- Reading studies, I think.
- Reading studies?

166
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:45,473
- For the dyslexia?
- Right, he gets off around three.

167
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:48,340
They were special led kids, most of the others' gone by two.

168
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,253
He doesn't want to be single out.

169
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,492
He hates being special.

170
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,593
Right, he just wants to be a regular kid.

171
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,253
That's why he always reads his comic books in class.

172
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,476
This is where he usually waits for his ride.

173
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,077
- In there, right, Judith?
- Right.

174
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,655
Is there anything we can do, Mr. Harper?

175
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,934
Yes, Nothing.

176
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,259
Do not contact the police or the media.

- Patrick's life depends on it.
- Of course.

179
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:19,619
I was stolen.

180
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,900
Taken from my home in middle of the night.

181
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,696
It's all coming back to me, Sydney.

182
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,974
Repressed memories.

183
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:33,733
They often resurface during traumatic events, Jarod.

184
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:39,493
But those memories themselves, they are not as important as how you face them.

185
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,421
How do you face yours?

186
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,694
How do you live with what happened to me?

187
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:51,693
Jarod, nothing can justify what happened to you.

188
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:57,695
But what've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years

189
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:02,819
tells me something right...

190
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,822
It came out of something very very wrong.

191
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:09,218
It's like a nightmare.

192
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,775
Now it keeps coming back in pieces.

193
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,093
First, the fear.

194
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,538
And then, the panic.

195
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:23,931
Shooting to your nerves that night

196
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm a child again.

197
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,662
It's dark,

198
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,820
and I'm alone.

199
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,901
All I can think about is seeing my family again.

200
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,338
I want my world to be like it was.

201
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,501
When can I see my daddy?

202
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:03,012
Harper will pay, and you will get your cut.

203
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:05,260
Tomorrow.

204
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:10,771
Um, the kid is having his last meal right now.

205
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:32,532
You are late.

206
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:37,855
Clarkston Pharmaceuticals...

207
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:42,056
Jarod was a national rep in ... in Sunnyvale, California.

208
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,618
You've found any evidence of child abduction?

209
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:46,652
Why would he, Syd?

210
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,176
A hunch.

211
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,211
Play the tape, Mr. Broots.

212
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,054
Sydney, they made me do this.

213
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,334
How do you live with what happened to me?

214
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:07,615
Jarod, nothing can justify what happened to you.

215
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:11,521
But what've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years

216
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,722
- tells me something right...
- It came out of...

217
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:20,318
And for two years I have been saying you personal connection with Jarod has hindered this pursuit.

218
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,119
This is proof.

219
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:26,739
My conversations with Jarod are nothing new.

220
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,775
They keep us from him.

221
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,981
They keep him from disappearing.

222
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,014
Sydney...

223
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,497
He's right.

224
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:01,021
Two million.

225
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,801
I got what I could from Patrick's room like you asked.

226
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,333
But I still don't see how it helps.

227
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,482
I'm going to be George Harper.

228
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,533
I have to understand his life and the son's.

229
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:17,974
I don't want the kidnapper to catch me on the lie.

230
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,094
The limo driver is clean.

231
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,056
I checked his past business associated with possible motives.

232
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,253
Nothing.

233
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,172
FBl files show no kidnappers with a simple ...

234
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,499
At least, not the last five years.

235
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:34,933
All we can do is hoping bastard keep his word and let Patrick back tomorrow.

236
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,502
This is Patrick's mother?

237
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,260
Chloe. A great lady.

238
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,139
Passed away in 96.

239
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,854
Patrick loves puzzles.

240
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,731
They help him to think.

241
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,854
That's what he always says.

242
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:56,894
I bought him this one.

243
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,493
Sometimes Mr. Harper's working late, I help Patrick out.

244
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:04,176
Yeah, well, kind of kids ... faster than me.

245
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,622
Are you ok?

246
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,061
Dozen abductions I worked for the bureau...

247
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:21,301
I think some of these guys do to those kids just a...

248
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,341
We'll get him back.

249
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,742
''Patrick''

250
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,022
Patrick.

251
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:02,023
Patrick.

252
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,023
Jarod.

253
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,375
He's waking up.

254
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:14,656
Mr. Harper, my name is Jarod.

255
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,616
He's going to help us, Mr. Harper.

256
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,138
Is Patrick here?

257
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,239
No, sir.

258
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,092
He is not.

259
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:27,661
But he's going to be just fine.

260
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:29,462
I promise you.

261
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:37,613
Syd, we've been ordered to Sunnyvale.

262
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:38,714
Broots found this.

263
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,652
Could be Jarod's attended work. We'll leave in an hour.

264
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:45,420
Raines' sending Willie with us to keep us honest about what he doesn't know,

265
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,573
that Sam is already on his way.

266
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,736
I will be ready.

267
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:56,782
I hate myself for siding with Raines,

268
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,781
but the Creep's got a point.

269
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:02,214
The emotional umbilical you have with Jarod is ...

270
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,575
becoming a problem.

271
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,581
In your eyes.

272
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,021
Jarod is doing your work out there, isn't he?

273
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:11,693
- I could say the same about you.
- Um.

274
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:14,499
His mind games don't work on me any more.

275
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,296
You cann't make that claim.

276
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,935
Like you said,

277
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,578
we've been ordered to Sunnyvale.

278
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,451
Has the kidnapper called? Where is my boy?

279
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:35,696
He'll be back by the end of the day, sir.

280
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,817
When he was a new born,

281
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:43,937
I was going to his room in the night to check on him.

282
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:46,574
I standed over him,

283
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:49,059
until my eyes were adjusted to the dark.

284
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:52,540
When I saw him breath, I knew he was ok.

285
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:55,257
New parents, they must be very nervous.

286
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:56,213
New?

287
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,214
I still check on Patrick every night.

288
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:04,333
But what could it do? I should have been there.

289
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:08,592
If you had been there, you would've found the backpack not your driver.

290
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:09,702
That's all.

291
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:14,276
Yes, since Chloe died, it's just Patrick and me.

292
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,497
I lost her in a room just like this.

293
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:23,539
I promised to her we'll be a strong family.

294
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Jarod.

295
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,080
I'll get him back.

296
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,737
Need some help?

297
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:21,702
I am sorry.

298
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:25,303
I was just trying to put myself into Patrick shoes.

299
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,795
Well, you are in the right place. He always read his comic books right here.

300
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:36,782
You must be lost.

301
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,053
The kidnapper calls in less than 2 hours.

302
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:43,499
I went to see Harper. You weren't there.

303
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,392
- What are you doing here?
- I am following you.

304
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,775
- Why weren't you at the hospital?
- I have two hours left.

305
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,520
- There is still some time.
- Time for what?

306
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:02,134
For this.

307
00:25:03,623 --> 00:25:04,559
He was here.

308
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,678
He was buying comic books here. The kidnapper grabbed him over here.

309
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:11,891
He emptied out the backpack,

310
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:15,952
put a note inside and he left it across the street for the driver to find.

311
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:18,042
And nobody saw a thing.

312
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:23,740
Almost nobody.

313
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:44,197
So that's how your doctors do a sugar rush.

314
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:50,098
There, Patrick.

315
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:15,118
No plates!

316
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:17,118
The tape is useless.

317
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,319
This kidnappers coverd his face.

318
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:22,696
We are down to the wire.

319
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:32,720
Got it.

320
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:37,536
I want to check up on Harper before we get the call.

321
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:42,356
I almost butt your little blow up back there.

322
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,541
That was my office on the phone.

323
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,378
And when I ran a background check on the driver, I ran one on you too.

324
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:51,321
You're a tough man to track, Dr. Pearce.

325
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,322
Maybe that's cos you died in 1979.

326
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:57,454
You didn't pretend to be Harper in that phone booth,

327
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,313
you made a deal with the kidnapper.

328
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:01,252
How much is he paying you?

329
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:09,292
Look, I know that you think about Patrick like he was your own son.

330
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,620
And you probably saw some pretty horrible things happened to children when you worked for the FBI.

331
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,775
You are afraid the same thing is going to happen to him.

332
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,179
But I swear to you all that I want to do is to help this boy.

333
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:19,557
And I can't help him unless I answer this phone call.

334
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,439
Please, trust me.

335
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:30,512
George Harper.

336
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,842
Same phone booth, ten minutes.

337
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:37,217
Ten minutes.

338
00:27:51,343 --> 00:27:52,934
Miss Parker, I've got him.

339
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,535
Go, go.

340
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,301
The kidnapper's probably watching.

341
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,951
Get off here. I'll maintain visual.

342
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:09,676
You plan anything, I'll kill you.

343
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:11,933
I expected nothing less.

344
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:27,958
I am here, I am here.

345
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:31,577
Take the money across the street to the green garbage can.

346
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,476
- When do I see Patrick?
- As soon as I get paid.

347
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:37,491
How do I know you're telling the truth?

348
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:38,676
Where is my son?

349
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:41,677
Hello.

350
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,054
Harper, I said no law.

351
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,781
What are you talking about?

352
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,193
The deal is off, the boy is dead.

353
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:54,994
No, no, no.

354
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:03,922
You are a businessman.

355
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:06,473
Just name your price, I'll pay it.

356
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,981
Another two million in three hours.

357
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:17,576
I see one badge,

358
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:18,937
your son stops breathing.

359
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,173
I want to talk to my son.

360
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:21,737
I want to know that he is still alive.

361
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:25,858
I love you, daddy.

362
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:28,695
Intelligent boy you got, Mr. Harper.

363
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:30,657
Who says he need special led?

364
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,974
Keep the phone, I'll call.

365
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,295
- What happened? What the hell was that?
- It must be one of the kidnappers.

366
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,521
Look, he wants another two millions in three hours.

367
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:14,682
You got to get it.

368
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:17,677
Now you know who you can trust.

369
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:22,875
Can we trust this guy? How do we know we can trust this guy?

370
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:24,656
We still have two hours left.

371
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:32,395
Exponential algorithms.

372
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:35,695
Yeah, I used to try to solve those since a boy.

373
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,376
Those took my minds some place else.

374
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,734
Just like Patrick uses puzzles.

375
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,676
I never looked it like that.

376
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:47,012
We're going to find him.

377
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:55,802
He knew.

378
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:58,703
He knew.

379
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,401
He said this to me just before he hang up.

380
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:05,900
He knew that Patrick was in a special classes.

381
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,876
He knew that he would be held after school late.

382
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:13,479
But how did he know that he would be there alone?

383
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:16,914
Must be someone in this god-forsaken hospital who seeing Jarod.

384
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:18,395
- Find anything?
- Bingo.

385
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,196
''Dr. Charles Mitchell, Respected Physician Arrested in Panalex Murder''

386
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:29,896
Excuse me.

387
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:33,331
- Have you seen this man?
- Jarod?

388
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:34,975
Sure, just a second.

389
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:40,256
Yes, this is Dr. Hargadon. I need to page ... 7477 please, it's an emergency.

390
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,057
So you know Jarod?

391
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,074
- Are you a friend?
- Old friend.

392
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:52,996
He is upstairs. I am headed that way.

393
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:53,736
Come on.

394
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,422
Jarod's transfer came in today.

395
00:31:58,703 --> 00:32:00,719
But he still has one more patient.

396
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:08,274
Well, it's like he had the patient moved.

397
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,435
This is..., Syd.

398
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:17,495
If I know Jarod, he is right under my nose.

399
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:31,273
Oh, swing in the miss.

400
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:36,438
- Sam, ... close in the downstairs.
- Yes, Miss Parker.

401
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,062
Broots, Sydney, come with me.

402
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:58,176
- Thank you.
- Obviously you got my page.

403
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:02,919
Thank you to help me keep my work a secret.

404
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:06,800
Wait a minute. You are the one who got Dr. Mitchell confessed?

405
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:08,995
Yes, I am sorry that I had to lie to you before.

406
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:12,675
But I knew that the Pharmaceuticals company would send their lawyers after me.

407
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,841
Lawyers! Well, that explains that woman's attitude problem.

408
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:20,259
We're not leaving.

409
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,260
Check the employee records, Broots, find out where they're sending Jarod checks.

410
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,061
Okay.

411
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,881
But his last patient was transferred.

412
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:28,980
It's ..., Syd. Your boy usually thumbs his nose at me.

413
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:30,376
Could you go?

414
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,673
I can ..., I got the gut feeling.

415
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:48,315
''Dear parents, in an effort to ease congestion while the city completes roadwork at the school,''

416
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,941
''pickup for the students will be moved from south end of the school to the north,''

417
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:56,414
''at Tuesday, the 17th.''

418
00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:58,461
''Sincerely,''

419
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:01,195
''Martin Benton''

420
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,335
I want you to take the van.

421
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,679
Get me out of this.

422
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:58,852
Relax.

423
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:02,016
You've been kidnapped, just like my son.

424
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,053
- Harper?
- How much is he paying you?

425
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,192
How much is my son's life worth?

426
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:09,242
Harper, please.

427
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:11,543
Please get me out of here.

428
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:13,321
It's too early to beg.

429
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:18,801
Kidnapping victims, they usually last five point eight minutes before desperation sets in.

430
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:23,936
First, they have to face the overwhelming fear.

431
00:35:24,943 --> 00:35:27,537
And just like my son, you're wondering where is he going to take me,

432
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:30,398
is he going to kill me or is he just going to torturing me?

433
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:31,113
Let me go!

434
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:32,316
You are begging again.

435
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:36,401
You moved the student pickup to the north side of the school.

436
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:39,292
What you made sure Patrick didn't know about it.

437
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,811
He was out there all alone.

438
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,398
You supervised the kidnapping, didn't you?

439
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:45,476
I don't know what you are talking about.

440
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,259
I have a surveillance video from where my son buys his comic books.

441
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:51,460
Now, you tell me how much he is paying you.

442
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:54,396
A hundred thousand.

443
00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:59,379
Where is Patrick?

444
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:00,158
He'll kill me.

445
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,878
Not if I do it first. Where is he?

446
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:08,541
Money or no money, he is gonna kill Patrick.

447
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,842
No.

448
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,181
Where is that leave you now?

449
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,515
Where is he?

450
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,698
He is in an abandoned warehouse.

451
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,574
Across the street fromt the phone booth.

452
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:21,881
He is watching me.

453
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:23,582
Yes, yes.

454
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:28,795
Jarod, what's happening? We got less than thirty minutes.

455
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,077
I know where Patrick is.

456
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,591
- Where are you?
- At your place.

457
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:33,694
- Has anyone been there looking for me?
- No.

458
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:35,002
I'll meet you there.

459
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:46,158
- Man.
- Jarod, run! Run!

460
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,159
No.

461
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,457
Miss Parker, there is a little boy.

462
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:18,974
He's been kidnapped.

463
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,275
He needs my help.

464
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,342
Won't work this time.

465
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:24,172
They'll kill him.

466
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,371
- Let the police take care of him.
- They don't know about it.

467
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,772
Get Jarod to the car.

468
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:29,896
Sydney, please.

469
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:31,857
Please don't let this happen.

470
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:35,379
This is just only stole me when I was a little boy, please.

471
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:38,893
I want to see my mummy. Let me go.

472
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:40,282
It is over.

473
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:44,442
How did you face your past, Sydney?

474
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,100
Miss Parker.

475
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,502
- I'll take it from here.
- Like how you will.

476
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,039
- If you have a problem, talk to Mr. Raines.
- Back off.

477
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,017
Don't, willie!

478
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:05,335
I am hit. I'm hit.

479
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:07,820
- Jarod, stop!
- Parker!

480
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:16,621
Please.

481
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:37,441
We're sorry. The mobil unit you have dialed is either outside of...

482
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:23,894
Now, I am gonna kill your son.

483
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:26,338
And you're going to watch.

484
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:28,722
You can handle that, Mr. Harper?

485
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:38,235
I am not Mr. Harper.

486
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:10,512
I am so proud of you.

487
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,419
I am the proudest mummy in the world.

488
00:40:44,623 --> 00:40:47,283
It's over, Patrick.

489
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:53,884
It's over.

490
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:00,785
It's over.

491
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:11,575
- Dad!
- Patrick!

492
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,136
Let me look at you.

493
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,880
- How are you, ah?
- I'm okay.

494
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:31,836
Unacceptable.

495
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:37,182
Jarod escaped because of you, Miss Parker.

496
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:38,538
Not at all.

497
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,239
Parker caught Jarod.

498
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,137
Willie botched it. That's what my report would say.

499
00:41:44,223 --> 00:41:47,081
How do you think my father will react when he reads that?

500
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:50,015
This isn't over.

501
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,755
You can bet your bald head on that.

502
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:02,980
I can fight my own battle, Sydney.

503
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,654
I knew you did the right thing with Jarod.

504
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:09,478
You know,

505
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:11,757
Sydney,

506
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,115
sometimes I wonder if you do want him out there,

507
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:17,316
helping the little guy.

508
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,640
I want him back as much as you do.

509
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:21,718
I just don't want hin dead.

''Kidnapper Captured-Accomplice Found in Abandoned Van''

511
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,673
Those people who were looking for you,

512
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,721
they think you're pretty valuable.

513
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,420
As far as I concerned, you died in 1979.

514
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:51,621
Wow.

515
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:55,122
Are you looking for this?

516
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:57,414
Yes, the piece.

517
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,940
Looks like a perfect fit.

518
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,633
