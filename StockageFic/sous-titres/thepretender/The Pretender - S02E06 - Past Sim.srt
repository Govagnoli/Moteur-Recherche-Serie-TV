1
00:00:00,863 --> 00:00:02,537
Previously on The Pretender

2
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:04,541
Broots is in the middle of the custody battle

3
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:06,859
The PI(Private Investigator) was trying to get something on his ex.

4
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,542
Thanks to you, my daughter has started crying since last night

5
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:12,194
Tomorrow I have to send her to her mother which is a place she doesn't want to go

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,942
Mr. Lyle¡­freaky around more than Ed McMahon.

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,532
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

8
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:20,179
And that's what scares me.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,580
- Hey, Jarod.
- Hey, Kevin.

10
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:35,863
Shall I get you as usual?

11
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:39,538
My mum thinks she's going to mad of me for getting another ice-cream man.

12
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:43,020
She said if anybody that would sell drug to the little kids, she would put him under to jail.

13
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:44,497
She doubts funny that's what you put on.

14
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,540
I was happy to help.

15
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:49,654
- Hey, what's that?
- A magic 8-ball.

16
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,581
- Magic?
- Shake it up

17
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:54,423
- Ask it a question, and it tells you the future.
-Really?

18
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:56,500
- Can I try?
- Go for it.

19
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:01,934
Will I ever find my family?

20
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:04,938
What did it say?

21
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:07,419
'' Better Not Tell You Now''

22
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,096
I am standing in front of the federal courthouse

23
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:25,797
and the aftermath would appear to be the well-executed abduction

24
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,598
of key murder witness Emma Barrett

25
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:32,863
Now eighteen mothes ago, Barrett, 37, witnessed the cold-bloody killing of her son, Max

26
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:36,664
and the innocent by-stander caught in the crossfire of the violent shootout

27
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:39,893
involving ruthless Yakuza crime boss Sammy Tanaka,

28
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:44,394
in what federal agents' describing as ''...chirurgicale type strike''

29
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:47,893
The van carrying Mrs Barrett to testify against Tanaka today

30
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,255
was the third vehicle in a heavily-armed motorcade.

31
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,779
The victim will be arriving

32
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:59,393
in the third vehicle of an heavily-armed motorcade.

33
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,141
Several witnesses here today say,

34
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:04,536
the scene was unbelievable like something out of a movie

35
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:05,537
Blue smokenades

36
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,375
were ... the both sides of plaza.

37
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:09,415
Coloured smokenades will be ...

38
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,182
here and here.

39
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,859
Why was this person kidnapped?

40
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,420
That's not important.

41
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,221
But I need you to continue the rescue plan.

42
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:22,722
Because the victim is located in the transport vehicle here

43
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,323
I would suggest at second and third scenario.

44
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:27,732
Automatic weapon ... behind the building over here

45
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,103
and a staged auto accident some where here

46
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,780
That will leave the transport van vulnerable to assault

47
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,143
The strike of the van today was followed by 2 other scenarios:

48
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:39,977
automatic gunfire around the courthouse ...

49
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:43,278
and the staged car accident all drawing the attention away

50
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,579
from the transport van containing the state's key witness

51
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,116
We do have two reported wounded at this point.

52
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,692
They are special agent Russell Gillson and the driver of the van

53
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:55,378
agent Jeffrey Edwards.

54
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,754
- A report on scene at¡­
- lt's still false, Sydney.

55
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,218
In order for the rescue to succeed,

56
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,619
the van driver will have to die.

57
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:07,278
We've just received the information from the ... Hospital

58
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,379
that the van driver, agent Jeffrey Edwards, has died.

59
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,012
Edwards was 35 years old,

60
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:15,279
and a survived-by wife and two young sons.

61
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,814
The van driver will have to die.

62
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:22,297
Oh, My God!

63
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,255
The van driver will have to die.

64
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:26,340
What've I done?

65
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,491
I killed the man today, Sydney.

66
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:30,899
i killed him as I pull a trigger on myself.

67
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,542
- Jaord.
- Simulation 2578.

68
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:35,343
You told me it was a rescue scenario.

69
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:39,332
Then I see it's used in the killing of federal agent and the adbuction of the innocent woman.

70
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:42,854
- The Center is not in the abduction business.
- Tell It To Emma Barrett.

71
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:43,939
It is Lyle, isn't it?

72
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,133
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:47,380
I am talking about lies.

74
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:51,478
I am talking about how many people have died because of the way you use my simulations.

75
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,679
You used me.

76
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,241
Nobody's going to die any more.

77
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:58,263
If it's a war the Center wants, it's what you'll get.

78
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:02,336
But I promise you Emma Barrett will not be the next casualty.

79
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:18,637
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

80
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:22,038
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

81
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:27,039
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 6
Past Sim

82
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,040
YTET PRESENTS

83
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:43,041
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

84
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:50,702
Something on your mind?

85
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,655
We just received a phone call from Jarod.

86
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,501
A call to return himself, I hope.

87
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:57,974
He claimed that the Center's involved in the abduction of the key witness

88
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,475
who saw the 10-year-old son murdered.

89
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:02,382
- The killer?
- The Yakusa crime boss, Sammy Tanaka.

90
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:04,142
Sounds dangerous.

91
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:08,343
Jaord claims that the abduction was based on the simulation he created

92
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,413
just before he escaped the Center.

93
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,976
But I assured him the Center's not involved.

94
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,858
You may made a mistake.

95
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:20,139
Do not tell me the Center is now slamming with any criminal that...

96
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:23,819
Oh, it's not the same. Now Mr. Lyle is ¡­ Mr. Lyle ...

97
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,059
Then Stop him.

98
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,552
We'll stop him.

99
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:31,155
Daddy, you helped to build this place,

100
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,056
you care about what it's doing for.

101
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,812
How can you just trun your back on that like it never existed?

102
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,616
It's just different then.

103
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:41,579
Maybe it's time for younger lion to roar.

104
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:55,854
Shot the life!Shot the life!

105
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,142
Series...

106
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,100
Staged auto weapons

107
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,777
Shot the life! Shot the life!

108
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:04,612
Automatic...weapon

109
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,131
I'm here! I'm here!

110
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,934
Colored Smokenades...

111
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,058
Leave the van ... vulnerable to attack

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,653
We've got Barrett!

113
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,059
Mr Darrell? Jessica Klein.

114
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,418
Call Me Jarod.

115
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,217
The DOJ(Department of Justice) of Washinton called, said you'd be coming in.

116
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:23,856
I didn't realized you will be so soon.

117
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:26,134
There's a lot of work to be done.

118
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,540
I know most of the attorneys in the D.C. Office. How long have you been assigned there?

119
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,336
Actually I just started today.

120
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,772
Stepped that right in the middle, didn't you?

121
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:36,739
It is said Sammy Tanaka and Yukuza has been all over it.

122
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,461
- You are presenting Emma Barrett?
-Yes.

123
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:41,057
Mrs. Barrett has been to so much.

124
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,058
The lost her son for over a year,

125
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,059
that woman is lived in fear and isolation.

126
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:46,976
and now, this.

127
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,492
Why is the case taken so long?

128
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,694
You've read the folder on Sammy Tanaka.

129
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,155
The DOJ has tried to... him for ten years.

130
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:05,302
And the hunchers of Washington will make sure they'll act together before this case sees inside a clue.

131
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,734
Would you like to question the agent involved?

132
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:09,456
Very much.

133
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:12,294
- What else can you tell me about the shooter?
- He was ...

134
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,892
White hair, about 35.

135
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:17,743
- What about the others?
- I didn't get a good look.

136
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,332
No, the eyebrows were thicker.

137
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,253
That's it.

138
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:21,954
Russell.

139
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,457
How are you feeling?

140
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,822
I am so sorry, Miss Klein.

141
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,661
Jarod, this is agent Russell Gillson.

142
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,501
Jarod is another lawyer form DOJ.

143
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,861
David Chase, agent of FBl.

144
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:35,462
Agent Chase, Agent Gillson.

145
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:39,020
I was wondering if I might ask you some questions about the Emma Barrett's abduction.

146
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,498
It all happened so fast so it's kind of blur.

147
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,456
You told the police there were 3 gunners.

148
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:47,058
Yes, sir. They were all carrying automatic weapons.

149
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,759
Asian make, I think.

150
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,938
Just wish I could go on for a few more rounds¡­

151
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:56,053
- You were able to return fire?
- Yes, madam. But it was too late. By then Jeff...

152
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,461
Agent Edwards was shot.

153
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:02,642
The service teach you to touch yourself emotionly, but the truth is...

154
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,676
I will never forget the look on his face before he's dying.

155
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:13,378
Speaking of the devil¡­

156
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:16,862
Tanaka's killed one true man at this time.

157
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,063
Let's go.

158
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,421
Well, thank you for your time.

159
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,337
Take care of your shoulder.

160
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,338
Yes, sir.

161
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,173
No, certainly the deal is progressing....

162
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:41,543
Yes, things continue this plan, the Center can expect a significant deposit in forty-eight hours.

163
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:46,259
Yes, I understand the delicate nature of this particular operation.

164
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:50,200
And I personally assure you successful, the deal.

165
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,113
Those vertical pieces of glass behind you are called doors.

166
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,058
Polite people knock before they open them.

167
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:01,853
Why is the Center doing business with drug dealers and murderers?

168
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,596
You have to be more specific.

169
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:04,882
Sammy Tanaka.

170
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:09,183
Why weren't we informed about the abduction of Emma Barrett?

171
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,221
I don't know that woman.

172
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:11,022
You are a liar.

173
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:13,812
Is he taking.... (doped)?

174
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:17,943
We know about your corruption of simulation 2578.

175
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,215
You two have been busy.

176
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:23,972
I decided to extend the Center's cope of operation.

177
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,453
The only I can discuss, security reasons.

178
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:31,103
Jarod will take the use of his simulation as a personal attack.

179
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,395
It sounds like a threat.

180
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:36,255
To involve Jarod as an accessory to murder and kidnapping,

181
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,653
that is asking for retribution ... what you can't even imagine.

182
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:41,854
I'll take a note of that advice, but

183
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,859
you don't have to knock when you leave.

184
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:57,963
Well, that was pretty terrible.

185
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,313
Don't complain it. You got what you want, you got the kid.

186
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,877
You gave me no choice, you know it.

187
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:06,413
I just want to know how you knew that I take your precious child support money went to Vegas.

188
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,916
I didn't.

189
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,317
Well, somebody knew and they told the judge. That's how come you won.

190
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:12,021
I don't think anybody won here.

191
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:17,799
You knew this would happen if you don't change your life style.

192
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,199
I don't care about this.

193
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,180
I am sad about Atlantic city.

194
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:26,581
Atlantic city?

195
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:29,682
Do you have any idea how much the bus fee to New Jersey cost?

196
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:47,275
There, don't gamble it all the way like you've done anything else in your life.

197
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,776
I don't do that any more.

198
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,458
What? What?

199
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,722
Here, in case you get hungry.

200
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:13,457
Gotta go.

201
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:14,898
Be a good kid.

202
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:20,556
Come on.

203
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:27,757
Everything will be alright. Come on.

204
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,972
The loss of a child.

205
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:32,842
I couldn't even imagine.

206
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:36,479
I doubt Tanaka is ...sleep ...the boy.

207
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,057
He is as ruthless and cold-blooded as ...I ever met.

208
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:42,813
According to Tanaka's file, he is being linked to over a dozen murders.

209
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,621
and he's never been convicted.

210
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:48,176
Men like Sammy Tanaka insulated themselves from the act.

211
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:49,833
They push buttons and people die.

212
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:53,356
Until Max Barrett and his mother stepped out from that pet shop.

213
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:54,698
What happened?

214
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,701
Tanaka was irritated.

215
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,174
He got across the drug deal by one of the Vietnam's heroin dealer.

216
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,475
A big mistake.

217
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,940
It doesn't sound very smart.

218
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,135
Sammy Tanaka may wear 5000 dollar suits and drives rolls-Royce.

219
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:10,054
But underneath it, he is still a ( little scoundrel of) Tokyo.

220
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,323
He called the guy in the sidewalk and opened fire.

221
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:18,942
An innocent boy's killed by Tanaka's bullet coming out of the wrong pet store the worng time.

222
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:22,215
Emma Barrett is only person to actually see Tanaka pull the trigger.

223
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,316
Do you still think she is dead?

224
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,962
She doesn't but the FBI does.

225
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:28,432
Bureau's decided to put all but the minimum number of agents off the Barrett's case.

226
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,033
Why?

227
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,834
Waste of time and manpower.

228
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:34,263
The woman was probably dead before she was ever taken out of that van.

229
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,364
Then where is her body?

230
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,023
Why take her at all with killing her as the objective?

231
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,224
It's been twenty-four hours. We haven't heard a word. I am sorry.

232
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:51,721
And once the victim has been isolated by the friendly forces, what then?

233
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,676
Well, that would depend on part of the remaining strength of kidnappers.

234
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:58,936
The best scenario would be to relocate the victim within one block radius near the initial assault.

235
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:02,156
And how long should the victim be held and checked?

236
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:03,332
24 hours.

237
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,179
Excuse me.

238
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:06,496
Late for something?

239
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:08,412
I hope not.

240
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:53,502
The rescued victim should be held in a low, profile structure.

241
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,377
One with clear front, rear and side access.

242
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:59,536
A low-income hotel would be adaptable.

243
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,553
Bring up the Barrett woman. We've followed in.

244
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,882
What are you doing? Where are you taking me?

245
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:24,383
Ah, no!

246
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:29,574
Wait! Wait!

247
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:30,918
Let him down! Go!

248
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:47,403
- This is Sydney.
- Emma Barrett is still alive.

249
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:52,253
I saw Center team transported her out the hotel less than a block from the original abduction.

250
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:53,573
You are positive?

251
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,574
They shelved her in a van and took off.

252
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:57,918
They nearly killed me.

253
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,219
There's nothing I can do.

254
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:02,714
...I heard about this, Jarod.

255
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:03,778
Then help me.

256
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:06,158
I need to know where the Center has taken her.

257
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:09,292
But Mr. Lyle has been very tight lipped.

258
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,260
What do you think ...with her?

259
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:15,855
The Center will hold her until they get the money.

260
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,832
After that her life is no value.

261
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,436
Please,Sydney.

262
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,158
There is enough blood on our hands already.

263
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,137
Excuse me for not getting up.

264
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:49,656
I want them off my back.

265
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:50,832
Them?

266
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:52,074
Miss Parker and Sydney.

267
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,775
They are asking questions.

268
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:58,317
Questions fed by information that can only be supplied by one man.

269
00:15:58,503 --> 00:15:59,538
Jarod.

270
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,153
He was ...by a sweaper team last night.

271
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:10,737
What do respect, maybe you should re-exam the entire Tanaka scenario.

272
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,920
I assume the Triumvirate of this monitoring ... closely.

273
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:17,453
Don't tell me about the Triumvirate.

274
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,779
I am in control of the situation.

275
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,735
Barrett's been moved to a Center safehouse.

276
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,579
And I have a meeting with Tanaka's son in two hours to finalize this deal.

277
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:27,558
I don't want any more affairs.

278
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,361
You have my complete and total loyalty.

279
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,436
Have this placed on Miss Parker's desk.

280
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,820
The information is on it's way.

281
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,759
I hope she won't be a problem, you know our way.

282
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:03,674
You have my complete and total loyalty.

283
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:14,742
Thirteen months you sift and dig, preparing the case on the ground when the moment you found it comes up, blows up in your face.

284
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:15,696
What happened?

285
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:17,297
The judge refused to postpone the trial.

286
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,738
We still haven't located Barrett yet.

287
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,739
And I quote: if it's not the burden of the court to assure that you have a witness, this is the state's.

288
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:24,333
How long?

289
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,734
Trial is on tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

290
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,878
Without Emma Barrett's testimony, a child's killer is going to get free.

291
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,613
I am sorry, Jarod, I am out of cards to play.

292
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:43,971
So, how do you like your new home? Pretty cool, ah?

293
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,272
Yeah. What's the smells then?

294
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,173
Smells?

295
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,703
That burnt toast.

296
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:56,440
That's, that's because I burnt dinner...

297
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,914
It's, I think it's the stove, that all stove, it's kind of...

298
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,518
And you know I put a swing thing at the back yard. and you still like a swing, don't you?

299
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,702
- I guess.
- Ah, honey¡­

300
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,856
Ah, Listen.

301
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:13,657
Be careful.

302
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:22,981
She is a beautiful little girl.

303
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:26,971
You must scare me heart-attack.

304
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:28,491
I did not want to be seen.

305
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:31,422
It appears your custody hearing won is your hope.

306
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:34,734
Oh, Yeah, it's a ... Oh, Listen¡­

307
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:37,935
- Thanks for giving me the information that my ex-wife's gone to Las Vegas.
- What?

308
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,054
You didn't tell the judge?

309
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,617
But ... Um, What're you doing here?

310
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:45,576
I need your help to break into Lyle's personal file.

311
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,899
Mr. Lyle? You are not ... it's crazy!

312
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,616
A life for this ...

313
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:53,816
Mine¡­ Sydney, I just ... I just brought my daughter home.

314
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:56,219
Can you imagine what they'd do to her if they caught me?

315
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,858
I'm sorry, but ... I cannot.

316
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,938
Congratulations on your daughter.

317
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,239
Thanks.

318
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,240
Look, I'm...

319
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,422
I am sorry.

320
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,123
Thanks.

321
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:17,902
-Ah...
- Hello,Mr. Broots.

322
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,377
Oh, my God!

323
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:22,878
Sydney.

324
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,615
- Is there something wrong?
- Um.

325
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,822
I forgot the number.

326
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:41,862
We have to talk.

327
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:54,732
I would like to discuss details of the exchange.

328
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:58,459
I'm sorry. The translator was supposed to be here 15 minites ago.

329
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,540
I am not accustomed to waiting, Mr. Lyle.

330
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:10,158
You want to know how an organization so powerful that can be run so inefficiently.

331
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:14,978
Hi, Tommy.

332
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:19,022
You are such a brilliant now.

333
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,497
You two know each other?

334
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,455
Tommy and me spent a ...

335
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:31,531
long, hot college summer together in Tokyo.

336
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,419
You did not change at all, Parker.

337
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:42,971
Say to this charlot that I want to regulate the exchange of this evening.

338
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,657
He wants to finish the details of tonight's exchange.

339
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:56,296
Once the ten million dollars transfered into the account of the Center,

340
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,461
I want to recover the parcel.

341
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:02,661
He says the ten million will be transfered online from his account

342
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:05,218
into the Center's, then he'll take with it the package.

343
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,902
I'm guessing Emma Barrett?

344
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,502
Tell him I'll personally oversee the transfer.

345
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,622
Our illustrious pin-head will be present in person.

346
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,096
My father has a saying:

347
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:21,214
''Never to trust a man

348
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:24,575
''who's nose is as brown as Mt. Fuji in the summer."

349
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,532
What?

350
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,575
He insists I'll be present at the exchange.

351
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:34,222
Fine. Fine, tell him that's fine.

352
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:37,502
I believe that his virility was insulted.

353
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:45,381
Tommy, What happened to you?

354
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:52,460
My father is a very exacting man when he does not have what he wants.

355
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:55,338
What happened to his hand?

356
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:59,694
The Yakusa was punished by taking a little finger of ''offending'' party.

357
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:01,302
What did the guy have to do to lose the thumb?

358
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,857
Good question.

359
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:05,822
See you tonight.

360
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:43,296
Do you realise it's dangerous for me?

361
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,811
And my daughter?

362
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:51,495
I think I understand dangerous, Mr. Broots.

363
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,541
I feel like I should ask you for your autograph or something.

364
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:59,021
I mean, don't you think it's strange that here we are, face to face?

365
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:00,622
Strange?

366
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:04,380
Strange like everything else associated with the Center.

367
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,775
I ... I still don't understand

368
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:13,176
how you could be responsible for what happened to, this, Emma Barrett, person?

369
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:15,832
They used one of my simulations to kidnap her

370
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,833
and they are trying to sell her to the man that murdered her son.

371
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:25,133
The Center is doing business with child killers?

372
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:27,698
i think they are keeping Mrs. Barrett in the Center safehouse.

373
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:31,578
I need to access Mr. Lyle's security records to find out where the house is.

374
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,615
I already told Sydney it's impossible.

375
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:38,373
Sydney? He asked for help with this?

376
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:39,674
Yeah.

377
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,361
But you see...

378
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:45,377
The thing is Lyle doesn't use computers.

379
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:46,982
He doesn't believe in them.

380
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,254
That's what scares me the most about this guy.

381
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:54,094
And anything this important, somebody has to physically get into his office.

382
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:59,543
Oh, no, oh... no no

383
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,535
You...you don't expect me to do that.

384
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:05,737
We all need help, Mr. Broots.

385
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:10,297
Help is the thing that the most important to us.

386
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,841
You sent the information about my ex-wife's gone to Las Vegus.

387
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,654
You'll be a good father.

388
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:31,213
A child cannot ask for more than that.

389
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,414
Jaord, I...it's...I...

390
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:35,541
It's too dangerous ¡­ I ...

391
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:36,812
This is Max.

392
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:41,181
He was at same age as Debbie

393
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:45,912
when he was shot down in the street, in cold-blood.

394
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:51,258
Help me.

395
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,659
Jaord ...

396
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:13,292
It's cool air ... to my skin.

397
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:17,781
Why did you leave this information on my desk about Mr. Lyle's meeting with Tommy Tanaka?

398
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,291
You seem upset.

399
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,742
What do you want?

400
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,395
The same as you.

401
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:28,396
Normality return a better times.

402
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,052
A ten-digit access code.

403
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:41,699
Mr. Lyle will have one exactly the same, except for the final digit.

404
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:45,259
During the transfer of funds, you need to enter your code number

405
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,738
without being detected.

406
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:49,297
You are going to steal Lyle's money?

407
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,455
No, Miss Parker.

408
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:53,535
You are.

409
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,036
Hello.

410
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:50,854
The eagle has landed ...

411
00:27:27,823 --> 00:27:29,620
Everything is ready, Mr. Lyle.

412
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:32,103
Mr. Tanaka enter his access code, once begin to move

413
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:34,619
and then you'll enter yours to receive it.

414
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,053
Let us just do this.

415
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,302
Not this illustrious pin-head.

416
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:57,173
- I understand you. I also doubt his competences.
- Yes.

417
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,374
Parker, I prefer that you slaps the code.

418
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:00,213
What's going on?

419
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:03,777
- Mr. Tanaka would feel more comfortable if somebody elses would enter the access code.
- Who?

420
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:10,578
Do it.

421
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:26,422
Transfer underway.

422
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,535
Now, I want my good.

423
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:34,542
Mr. Tanaka would like to take possession of his property now.

424
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,777
Bring the woman down.

425
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:40,896
Wait. wait.

426
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:43,439
The money is moving in and then out of the account.

427
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:47,256
What are you trying to fool?

428
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,455
- What the hell is going on? Who did this?
- Jarod.

429
00:28:59,456 --> 00:28:59,743
Damn it.

430
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:01,381
Jarod's getting away!

431
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,138
Stop!

432
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:30,338
''Do not count on it''

433
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:40,458
Ten million dollars,

434
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:42,096
add that to the funds lost in Omaha,

435
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,420
Jarod has walked away with nearly 30 million dollars in the Center assets.

436
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,217
Not mentioned the 40 million he took during the wall Street transfer.

437
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,221
- Which he returned.
- Minus interest.

438
00:29:50,503 --> 00:29:52,061
That's not the point.

439
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:57,280
Jarod's involvement in this situation has placed me in an extremely vulnerable position.

440
00:29:57,343 --> 00:30:00,858
I warned you about the danger but involved I mean anything like this.

441
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:04,180
There is no way he can have known the location of the safehouse without the help of the inside.

442
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:05,737
That an accusation?

443
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:13,778
It's obviously the man like Jarod will settle for nothing last than complete justice.

444
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:17,100
I want every sweeper we have available on this case. Find Barrett.

445
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:20,615
- And if they cannot?
- Set the security seal around the federal courthouse.

446
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,292
Sammy Tanaka's trial resumes in the morning at ten o'clock.

447
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,574
Jarod will try to deliver Barrett then.

448
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:28,935
I've promised the Tanaka family he would not succeed.

449
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:34,059
This place isn't much, Mrs. Barrett

450
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:35,098
but I can protect you here.

451
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,599
You should eat something.

452
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:44,016
You don't trust me.

453
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:46,057
I understand.

454
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:49,696
But if I wanted to hurt you, I would not have ... to get you out of that house.

455
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,416
Then let me go.

456
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:54,256
It's not safe.

457
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,941
I know the man who took you.

458
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,780
They'll stop nothing to get you back.

459
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,452
- Sammy Tanaka.
- The man didn't work for Tanaka.

460
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,495
He's going to sell you to him.

461
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:12,017
How do I know you won't sell me?

462
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,652
You do not.

463
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:26,177
But he does.

464
00:31:40,423 --> 00:31:42,962
All I remember is blue smokes filling the van

465
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:43,963
and the sound of gunfire.

466
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,893
Did you see agent Edwards before he was killed?

467
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:49,617
Yes, he was a good man.

468
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,334
I believe he had children.

469
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:55,458
Two sons.

470
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:59,419
Do you have a family, Mr. Darrell?

471
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:04,220
I was separated from my parents when I was very little.

472
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,775
I've been searching for them.

473
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,261
I hope you'll find them.

474
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:14,495
How many shots was agent Gillson able to get off before he was wounded?

475
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:16,243
Shots?

476
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,977
Yes, he said he was able to return fire before it was overpowered.

477
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,139
Oh, no, You must have misunderstood him.

478
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,574
Agent Gillson never inpose his weapon.

479
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:28,613
I just wish I could go on for a few more rounds ¡­

480
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:32,054
- You were able to return fire?
- Yes, madam¡­

481
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:33,755
Right.

482
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:35,656
I am done, Jarod.

483
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:36,979
What do you mean?

484
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,652
For over a year, I've been living in motel rooms.

485
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:42,298
Not even allowed to visit Max's grave.

486
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:46,371
My son is gone. Nothing is going to change that.

487
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:50,738
And now, a man is dead because he's trying to protect me.

488
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,973
A man with a wife and two children.

489
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,977
I don't want any more blood on my hands.

490
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,296
And what about your son?

491
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:06,021
Unless you stand up,

492
00:33:06,303 --> 00:33:09,420
Unless you walk into that court room and point your finger at Sammy Tanaka,

493
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:10,772
then none of these matter.

494
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:14,616
Is that what you want?

495
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:29,940
You knew Jarod's going to be at the transfer tonight?

496
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,774
I was wondering the same about you.

497
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,382
Save it.

498
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:37,737
You've play me like a piano.

499
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:39,820
And I'm sick of the tone.

500
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:45,856
This is about Barrett and Lyle, isn't it?

501
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:51,257
The Triumvirate has .... of Mr. Lyle's leadership.

502
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,615
Like dealing with Sammy Tanaka, he has left the Center exposed.

503
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:58,095
You didn't dream this up all by yourself.

504
00:33:58,383 --> 00:33:59,498
Who else is involved?

505
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:05,618
I am.

506
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:08,732
Let him go.

507
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:10,778
Please.

508
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:15,974
I apologized for the secrecies, but it was important that

509
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:18,143
you believe exactly what you believed.

510
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:21,021
And all the steps by the younger lion that was all part of it?

511
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:23,339
- For your own protection.
- The money?

512
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,898
Furthered it into a secondary Center account.

513
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:27,741
Proper time through the proper channel,

514
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,537
this information will be needed implicating Mr. Lyle in the fact

515
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,939
and the disappearance of Emma Barrett.

516
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,854
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

517
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:41,261
Now considering everything that happened, and did you trust me.

518
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:50,883
So if Sammy Tanaka and his psycho thinks that

519
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:53,343
Mr. Lyle stole their money and their witness¡­

520
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:57,898
It will be a very good time to be Mr. Lyle, will it?

521
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:05,557
My name is Russell Gillson.

522
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:09,358
I am currently a special agent working for the Department of Justice.

523
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,422
I was assigned this personal protection for one Emma Barrett.

524
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:16,174
Armed men made access to the armed-van

525
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:19,275
containing myself, Barrett, and agent Jeffrey Edwards.

526
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,694
I drew my weapon and fired several rounds in defence.

527
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,902
Fired several rounds in defence.

528
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:28,703
Fired

529
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:30,204
Fired

530
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:31,505
Fired

531
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:36,139
You are dead, agent Gillson.

532
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:55,857
Mrs Barrett?

533
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:59,576
Wake up. We have to be in court in a couple of hours.

534
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,577
Mrs. Barrett?

535
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,021
Emma, are you awake?

536
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,980
How did you know I'd come here?

537
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,295
Because this is where I would come if it was my child.

538
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:53,774
Max was such a funny little kid,

539
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:56,372
but timid, afraid.

540
00:36:57,223 --> 00:37:00,260
There was a big dog lived in the apartment next door.

541
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:03,057
Everyday when Max come home from school,

542
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,652
this dog will start barking.

543
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:09,216
Deep, dangerous barking.

544
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:14,060
And Max, he will just stop at the end of the hallway,

545
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,141
wait for me to come and get him.

546
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,055
He was so afraid.

547
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:23,216
That's why I decided to buy him one of his own.

548
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:31,220
It was my fault we were coming out of the pet store.

549
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:39,979
You had no way. No one knew what was going to happen that day.

550
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:43,576
Max loved you and you loved him.

551
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,339
That's all you have to remember.

552
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,380
The court begins in less than two hours.

553
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:08,100
Do you really think Tanaka and those other people are going to just let me walk into that court?

554
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:09,862
It's a matter of fact.

555
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:11,772
I do.

556
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:54,103
Kevin? Hello, it is Jarod.

557
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,499
Yes, the ice-cream man.

558
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,814
I was wondering if you might do me a favor?

559
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,422
''Outlook Good''

560
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,578
I expected more securities.

561
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:12,981
Well, the FBl must think Barrett's already dead.

562
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,051
He has got less than ten minutes to get her on that witness stand.

563
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:19,096
Maybe we should lock the other way this time, Miss Parker?

564
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:21,021
We are talking about the killing of a child.

565
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:23,021
We are talking about Jarod.

566
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,656
This is Parker. Give me your status checked?

567
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,217
North access secured.

568
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:27,572
South access secured.

569
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:30,980
I want everyone on their toes. Jarod should be here in any¡­

570
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:35,938
What are you two doing here?

571
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:37,622
We heard the gunfire, we came over¡­

572
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:40,778
This way! This way!

573
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:46,779
Miss Parker.

574
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:57,852
Son of a ...

575
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,912
- ''Don't Count On It''
- He's already inside! Let's go! Let's go!

576
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:05,413
Wait. Wait...

577
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,056
In the case the people voices Sammy Tanaka,

578
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,698
does the state wish call a witness?

579
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:19,372
Your Hornor, the state wishes your request delay.

580
00:40:19,663 --> 00:40:20,459
Grounds?

581
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:24,782
I believe the court is very aware that the state key witness is unavailable for testimony at this time.

582
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:27,293
And I believe Mr. Klein, you have been not this dead in the street.

583
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,883
My ruling stands as posted.

584
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:33,064
Now, do you or do you not have a witness to call?

585
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,664
Your Honor, we do not.

586
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:43,292
If I plead this in the court,

587
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,795
I would like to present Emma Barrett as witness for the prosecution.

588
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,222
Nice to see you, Mrs Barrett.

589
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,295
It's nice to be here, Your Honor.

590
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,539
We'll take a five-minute resets since we are in the witness.

591
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:03,179
I would like to thank you, agent Gillson

592
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,180
for all your help in bringing Mr. Tanaka to justice.

593
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:08,382
I couldn't have done it without you.

594
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:18,061
I'm DOJ, and those people are wanted.

595
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,219
Arrest them.

596
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:20,773
There he is. Go!

597
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,212
Take him.

598
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:24,258
You've got to be kidding?

599
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:25,818
Let go of me.

600
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,019
Jarod. Jarod.

601
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,058
Did they captured Jarod?

602
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,280
- No.
- Damn it! At least we eliminated one problem.

603
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:38,342
I made it clear with Sammy Tanaka people that Mr. Lyle was not to be trusted.

604
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,057
It's a win-win situation.

605
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:45,461
We take down Lyle and take up ten million dollars.

606
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:51,777
Impossible.

607
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:55,217
- What is it?
- The account is empty.

608
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,414
The money's gone.

609
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:00,815
Ten million dollars.

610
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:03,254
It's going to help a lot of people.

611
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,416
I just want you to know I couldn't have done that without your help.

612
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,854
If you haven't transferred the funds through the Center's secondary account,

613
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,815
none of these would happen.

614
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:16,178
Thank you.

615
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:17,879
Oh, and...

616
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:20,137
Enjoy the gift.

617
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:27,738
Will you ever come home, Jarod?

618
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,660
''Better Not Tell You Now''

619
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,259
Yes, you are ... Perfectly.

620
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:46,415
I assure you that the stolen money is being tracked down as we speak.

621
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:48,581
I understand.

622
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:50,582
I promise...

623
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:55,342
I promise you we'll have no more trouble with Sammy Tanaka or his people.

624
00:42:58,303 --> 00:42:59,258
Yes, sir.

625
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:41,259
''Past Sim''
