1
00:00:00,858 --> 00:00:03,952
- <i>Previously on</i> The Pretender.
- I know the truth.

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:07,464
And what truth is that, Jarod?

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,591
The truth...
about what makes you sad.

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:14,434
- Your mother was a special person.
- My mother was weak. Period.

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,202
The only thing that ever bothered me was:
Why in an elevator?

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,675
<i>Your mother</i>
<i>was a very special woman.</i>

7
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:24,306
<i>There was a part ofher</i>
<i>I knew better than anyone.</i>

8
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,818
<i>There was a part ofher</i>
<i>she kept hidden, separate.</i>

9
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Is that all you do, Jarod? Dig up the past?</i>

10
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:34,282
That's easy for you to say.
You have one.

11
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:44,228
[Screaming]
Mama! Mama!

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,166
- They're trying to hurt her!
- Stay here, Jarod.

13
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,831
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- Mama, no!

14
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,271
- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- <i>No.!</i>

15
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:54,010
Mama!

16
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:56,069
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

17
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,629
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

18
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,909
- What?
- [Sydney] We've got a hit.

19
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:30,970
Jarod's the finest sewer rat
I've had the pleasure to work with.

20
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:34,540
I've never seen someone
so excited about excrement in my life.

21
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,950
A real fecal aficionado.

22
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,046
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>How charming.</i>

23
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:41,284
- <i>[Sydney] How long was Jarod here?</i>
- Couple of weeks.

24
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,486
- That's all it took him to figure it out.
- <i>[Miss Parker] Figure what out?</i>

25
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,530
That we were digging
into an aquifer.

26
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:49,031
If we had hit that thing,
it would've flushed 45 members...

27
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,192
of the International Brotherhood
of Sewage Workers...

28
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,202
right into
the jaws of oblivion.

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,797
Just like that Egyptian army
in <i>The Ten Commandments.</i> Whoosh!

30
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,342
Great.
Now Jarod is Moses.

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,344
Moses?

32
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,404
- Charlton Heston.
- [Chuckles] Right.

33
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,011
Thanks.

34
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:23,525
Mr. McElroy, <i>this</i> is where
Jarod always emerged?

35
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,535
Right in this spot.

36
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,867
<i>Something special about it,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't tell me.</i>

37
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,099
<i>Said he had to ship out.</i>

38
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:39,104
<i>Commander Forrester,</i>
<i>we have a situation here.</i>

39
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,174
- Report.
- Bogey, sir.

40
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:43,447
Victor-class submarine,
bearing one four eight.

41
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,546
<i>[Jarod] And closing.</i>

42
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,285
This could be the rogue
we're looking for.

43
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,522
Relax, sailor.
This is the fun part.

44
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,086
Why does the fun part
have to happen on <i>my</i> watch?

45
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,962
- Alert the X.O. and the captain.
- Aye, aye, sir.

46
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,025
We've got a fight
on our hands.

47
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:04,997
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>

48
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:51,550
- <i>[Man] Attention on deck.</i>
- <i>[Man #2] As you were.</i>

49
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,749
<i>Captain Nagel.</i>
<i>Commander Nashton.</i>

50
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,758
It's the <i>Rostov,</i> sir.

51
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,987
After she deployed
from Odessa...

52
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:01,554
<i>the Uzbeki captain declared independence</i>
<i>from the Black Sea Fleet.</i>

53
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:04,760
- <i>He's rogue.</i>
- With a hip pocket full of nuclear warheads.

54
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:09,067
And judging from the intel file,
her first strike target... is Los Angeles.

55
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,369
[Beeping]

56
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,672
- Something's up, sirs.
- They've opened the V.L.S. doors.

57
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:16,440
Those S.L.B.M.'s will be ready to fire
in approximately two minutes.

58
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:20,506
<i>Torpedoes in the water,</i>
<i>bearing one three seven and one four two.</i>

59
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,745
- Ready torpedo decoy.
- Ready decoy.

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,344
Ready decoy. Aye.

61
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,856
Something's wrong with
this relay, sir.

62
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,620
- What's the problem, Baker?
- Aaah!

63
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,389
We've lost the decoy signal.

64
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,523
- Gentlemen, we got a torpedo on our ass.
- Torpedoes closing, 300 yards.

65
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,863
- The decoy signal's still dead, sir.
- 200 yards.

66
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:40,802
Ninety seconds
to S.L.B.M. launch.

67
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,361
<i>Come on, Baker.</i>

68
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,875
- Got it. Decoy's on line, sir.
- <i>[Beeping]</i>

69
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,813
Torpedo number one just took the bait.
Number two closing.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,652
It's a miss.

71
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,246
<i>Rostov's</i> V.L.S. system
is still ready.

72
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,485
Those nukes fly

73
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,720
- Forty degrees starboard.
- <i>[Man] Forty degrees starboard.</i>

74
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,730
- Steady on course... zero nine zero.
- <i>[Man] Zero nine zero.</i>

75
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,767
Sir, suggest we fire both torpedoes now
while he's still in range.

76
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,392
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Sir.</i>

77
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,638
I recommend
that we fire one now...

78
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:19,335
that we veer approximately 30 degrees starboard
and then fire torpedo two.

79
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,140
- Veer? Why don't we just...
- Fire torpedo one.

80
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,339
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Fire one. Aye. Torpedo away.</i>

81
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,413
Thirty seconds
until warhead launch.

82
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,784
- Veer thirty degrees starboard.
- <i>[Jarod] Right full rudder.</i>

83
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,449
Steady course
one two zero.

84
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:37,255
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Right full rudder, one two zero. Aye.</i>

85
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,488
One is a miss, sir.

86
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,129
- Fire two.
- Fire two. Aye.

87
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,034
- <i>Torpedo away.</i>
- Twenty seconds until warhead launch.

88

Those birds are hot.

89
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,812
Ten seconds until
warhead launch.

90
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,879
Number two is a direct hit.
She's going down.

91
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:07,287

92
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,621

<i>Another three seconds...</i>

97
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,142

<i>this crew is loose.</i>

101
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,461
It's too loose.

102
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,826
The <i>Monroe</i> is a team,
like links in a chain.

103
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:49,195
If one of those links
breaks under stress...

104
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,497
<i>we slip that much closer</i>
<i>to disaster.</i>

In one week, we hit the big blue.

00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:03,005
It is imperative that
your response times improve.

107
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:06,549
After what happened
on our last tour...

108
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,950

109
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,424
All right.

00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:20,930
You just traded your day off

I didn't really want a day off.
Did you, Baker?

00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,171
- What?
- You can't even handle a little circuit flare-up?

126
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,182
I mean, if something
goes wrong this tour...

127
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,276
you're not gonna screw up on us like you did
in the pump room with Seaver?

If I even catch you
looking at these sailors the wrong way...

135
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,103
I'm gonna have you in the scullery
every day for a week!

136
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,801
- Understood, sailor?
- Yes, sir!

137
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:43,712
- Fall out!
- <i>[Man] All right. Move out.</i>

<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Sir.</i>

139
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:56,583
Well, you handled
that little situation well.

140
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,187
Just as well as
maneuvers this morning.

141
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:02,357
Sir, I'm sorry about that.

142
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:05,663
- I didn't mean to step out of line.
- Oh, yes, you did.

143
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:08,136
You're just lucky that
you made the right call.

144
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:12,141
I guess. Nagel seemed pretty steamed
about the last tour.

145
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,677
Yeah, well, that's
the only chink in his armor.

146
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:18,306
We lost a sailor.
There was a gas leak in the pump room.

147
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:21,078
- A gas leak?
- Yeah. JX-5.

148
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,416
Whoa. A roomful of that
could've set off the entire ship.

149
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,422
Whoo. Tell me about it.

150
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,458
I had the deck that night.

151
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,983
It's pretty intense. It's not something
I want to live through again.

152
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:34,930
Hey, tell me something,
will ya?

153
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,592
How did you know that the <i>Harrison</i>
was gonna cut and run?

154
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,603
"Bulldog" Ted Drucker
was at the conn.

155
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:43,834
- It's his favorite evasive technique.
- Oh, you served with him?

156
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:47,434
<i>Actually, Jarod's from the</i> Grant, <i>sir.</i>
<i>Lieutenant Paula Pratt.</i>

00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,449
Lieutenant Commander
Jarod Forrester.

160
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,918
Yes. I just ran the required
checks on your file.

161
00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:00,047
Your dates on the <i>Grant</i> don't jibe
with the Bureau of Personnel.

162
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,225
So why don't you call the <i>Grant</i>

163
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:09,732
I will. As soon as she gets back
from a silent escort in Antarctica.

164
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,234
Next month.

165
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,600
Come see me
at P.S.D. tomorrow.

166
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,374
That woman needs a hobby.

167
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:20,706
She reminds me of someone
I used to know.

168
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,769
Go through the box

It's been nearly 30 years, but I remember
how much she loved the children here.

174
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,296
I have reason to believe
that she might have rescued some of them.

175
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,431
- Rescued?
- It's a long story.

176
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:54,204
Did she... Did she bring
any children here?

177
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:57,912
No. We've always gotten
our children the usual way:

178
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,781
orphans, runaways,
victims of child abuse.

179
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,446
- I'm afraid I wouldn't know where to begin.
- [Sighs]

180
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,447
I might.

181
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,994

None of them ring a bell.

An associate.

186
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:32,138

he might have visited you.

187

Yes, sir. We caught this bug
trying to hot-wire an ensign's jeep.

223

Oh, that's a great big lie. Besides, I didn't

- Melina Pratt.

Pratt? As in Security Officer Pratt?

228

As in her daughter.

229
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,295
- You're gonna tell her about this, aren't you?
- What about your father?

230
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:04,026
He's the navigator
on the <i>Farragut.</i>

231

- That's on the Indian Ocean, on patrol?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,372
He's been gone for
about four months now.

233
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,466
Four and a half.

234
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,534
Must be pretty tough
on you...

235
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:17,842
and your mother,
your father being gone that long.

236
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:20,940
My mom just works more.
To me, it's no biggie.

237
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:24,976
So your dad is gone,
and your mom works all day.

238
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:28,957

<i>Is that true?</i>

240

you should become a high school counselor.

The, uh, JX-5 leak in the pump room.

267
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:02,162
- Oh, yes. Right.
- Seaver botched the retrofit.

268
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:06,403
Which gave the board of inquiry an excuse
to try to mothball the ship again.

269
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,410
<i>Damn leeches came in here.</i>

out of the water.

272
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,680
Finally, it took
seven admirals to decide...

273
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,654
the problem was Seaver's
shoddy work.

274

I'll ease off Baker then.

<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>going alone.</i>

328
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,578
I won't be alone, Mom.
There'll be 40,000 other people there.

329
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:22,682

I am busy. We will talk about this later.

Yeah, what else is new?

331
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,897
My daughter.

332
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,694
- Yo. What's up?
- Why won't you talk to me?

333
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,758
[Chattering]

334
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,670

335
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,573

336
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:50,135
Not exactly.

337
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:53,011
This police officer
stopped by and, uh...

338
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,017
left you
this parking ticket.

339
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:57,246
Great.

340
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,413
My mom's gonna go ballistic
when she sees this.

341
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:02,253
Not to mention
when she finds out you stole her car.

342
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:06,819
But having her go ballistic...
that's the general idea, isn't it?

343
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:24,612
Come on. You can do it.
Try it again.

344
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:28,310

345

you how to blow bubble gum.

352
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:56,211
I don't care.

353
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,908
- My mom hates me, and my dad's never around.
- Your mom does not hate you.

354
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:03,578
- Parents love their children.

366
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,033
Scott Seaver did not
botch that retrofit, sir.

367
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:04,505
And just because some big panel
of admirals says so...

368
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,269
Doesn't mean it's true.

369
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,769
Right.

370
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,818
Scott was edgy...

371
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,819
the whole week
before it happened.

372
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:21,880
I think he knew there was
something wrong with the <i>Monroe...</i>

373
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,722
but he never would've
let us deploy like that.

374
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:30,966
Look...

375
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:35,164
you don't gotta worry about me getting tanked
or getting into fights anymore, sir.

376

What are you talking about?

377
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,039
I'm gonna talk to
Lieutenant Pratt.

378
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,043
I'm out of here.

379
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,807

<i>You think that's going to</i>
<i>solve anything?</i>

381
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:49,249
I watched him die, sir.

382
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,621
You know, uh,
it hit us out of nowhere.

383
00:26:57,694 --> 00:27:03,428
The pipe burst, and the whole place
was filling up with JX-5.

384
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,468
Scott told me to
get out of there.

385
00:27:06,536 --> 00:27:09,300
He said he could handle it.

386
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,298
I could've saved him.

387
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:18,440
But then Nashton
sealed the hatch.

388
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,573
Nashton.

389
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,743

394
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,934
<i>He couldn't breathe.</i>

395
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:53,448
Wait.

396
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:56,246
The X.O. was on deck
that night.

397
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,049
Now, why would Nashton come down here
to seal the hatch?

398
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,154
He said the whole ship
could've blown.

399
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:05,786
He said he had to
seal the hatch.

400
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:15,399
Some best friend
I turned out to be, huh?

401
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:22,035
He didn't have to die, sir.

402
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,605
I should've stayed.

403
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:32,244
It should've been me
that died.

404
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,722
It wasn't your fault.

405
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,661
<i>[Nashton] There's been a lot of talk</i>
<i>about decommissioning her...</i>

This accident...
this tragedy...

409
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:03,845
happened because of substandard work
by a young engineer named Scott Seaver.

<i>[Man] You believe that sealing that room</i>
<i>was the correct course of action.</i>

411
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:11,989
JX-5 gas might have seeped
to the rest of the ship.

412
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,996
She was a powder keg,
ready to blow.

413
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:18,556

him out, I would have done so.

she was looking for answers.

<i>I spoke to his best friend.</i>

454

He said Seaver was nervous
the whole week before the deploy.

With all due respect, sir.
You've lost it.

Did Nashton threaten your career,
or did he threaten your son's education?

458
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:26,858
What's the difference?

459
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,658
Nashton said he was gonna turn
the investigating panel on me.

460
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,995
I'd have been
kicked out on my ass.

needed work.

Brass never knew.

465
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,403
And the extra work
would have delayed deployment.

466
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,246
Or worse,
put the <i>Monroe</i> in mothballs.

467
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:52,645
No more <i>Monroe...</i>

468
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,813
no more career for Nashton.

469
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,616

- It could've been your shift.
- Oh, come on.

472

<i>There was plenty of time.</i>

00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:59,374
Your mom is responsible
for a lot of people's lives.

496
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:04,316
Maybe in all that, she overlooks the life
that's most important to her, but I know...

497
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:06,819
she loves you very much.

498
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,354
I really miss my dad.

499
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,095
"I love you."

500
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:29,136
I.L.Y.

501
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,340
My dad used to put it on all the satellite
communications he'd send us from the subs.

502
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:38,750
You know, they only give you, like, 40 words
to say everything you can to each other...

503
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:41,287
so you gotta abbreviate.

504
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,091
I just wish he was here
to say it in person.

505
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,694
Shh, shh, shh.

506
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,662
Shh.

507
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:22,088
Sorry, Mama.

508
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,088
I'm sorry too, honey.

509
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,069
- We'll talk inside.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:31,127
It's okay.

511
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,941
- You have a great kid.
- Yeah.

512
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:40,710
I think I should tell her that
a little more often.

513
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,384
Thanks.

514
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,977
[Engine Starts]

515
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,050
Are you sure that resigning
is the right thing to do?

516
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,115
Made up my mind, sir.

517
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:30,760
- Did I say "at ease," sailor?
- No, sir!

518
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,231
Are you sure it's the right thing to do, sailor?

519
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,895
- Yes, sir!
- Is that what Scott Seaver would have wanted?

520
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,132
Hope to see you
on board...

521
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,075
sailor.

522
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,134
At ease.

523
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,110
- [Young Jarod] What's that, Sydney?
- [Young Sydney] I don't know.

524
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,586
[Woman Screaming]
No! No! No.

525
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,589
They're trying to hurt her.

526
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,386
- [Young Sydney] Stay here, Jarod.
- No!

527
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:01,053
- No.
- [Man] Get her on the elevator!

528
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,096
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>
- [Gunshot]

529
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,564
- [Man] Get the kid out of here!
- [Young Jarod] Stop!

530
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:09,399
- What?
- Jarod has them, doesn't he?

531
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,563
<i>Has what?</i>

532
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,630
The answers
you're looking for.

533
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:16,972
When I catch him,
I'll just have to find out.

534
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,342
You may have that chance.

535
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:24,047
CommanderJarod Forrester
is currently serving aboard...

536
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:26,518
the destroyer U.S.S. <i>Monroe.</i>

537
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:29,886
One of Broots's
routine scans caught it.

538
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:35,729
However, Naval Intelligence
may already be onto him.

539
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:39,232
- Naval Intelligence?
- That's correct.

540
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,359
Have my father
call the secretary.

541
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,426
- Yes, Miss Parker.
- Mmm.

542
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:45,495
<i>[Phone Beeps Off]</i>

543
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:49,375
<i>[Young Miss Parker]</i>
<i>Mama.!</i>

544
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,741
<i>[Sydney]</i>
<i>No. Keep her back. Go back.</i>

545
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:54,508
- <i>[Young Jarod] Leave me alone.!</i>
- <i>[Young Miss Parker] Mama.!</i>

546
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,620
Yes. I'd like to purchase
some tickets, please.

547
00:39:58,112 --> 00:40:01,513
From the secretary.
I'm impressed.

548
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,174
You should be.

549
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:07,554
Hell of a day
for a deployment.

550
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:10,249
- What's the good word?
- Surprise.

551
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,690
Your knack for discipline
has inspired me.

552
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,719
I put together one last surprise drill
before we deploy. Here.

553
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:19,129
<i>Crank it to maximum.</i>

554
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,101
TheJX-5 main?

555
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:26,162
- That'll overload the system.
- Oh, relax. I've shut off the pressure.

556
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,174
Only the alarm will sound.

557
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:31,575
Think of it as my personal
highway to hell.

558
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:45,148
- What's Jarod wanted for?
- You name it, he's done it.

559
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:52,357
- After you.
- <i>[Whistling]</i>

560
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:02,932
Pressure's building up.
Hey, where the hell is everybody?

561
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,001
They're in the mess.

562
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,980
Which is sort of
what you're in now.

563
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:13,915
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

564
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:19,652
Hey, o-open the hatch!

565
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,521
<i>Forrester.!</i>
<i>Open the hatch.! Now.!</i>

566
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,831
<i>Are you starting to feel</i>
<i>out of it?</i>

567
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,135
Are you starting to feel
disoriented?

568
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,769
- Open the hatch!
- I can't do that.

569
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,779
It could blow
the whole ship up.

570
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:42,543
You're just
going to have to die...

571
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:45,380
<i>to save everybody else.</i>

572
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,613
<i>Just like Scott Seaver did.</i>

573
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,954
It's a horrible way to die.

574
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:53,619
Your lungs,
they fill up with toxic ice...

575
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,958
<i>and then they freeze.</i>

576
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,898
<i>No matter how hard you try...</i>

577
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:01,935
you won't be able to breathe.

578
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:05,768
But this is just a judgment call
I'm going to have to make.

579
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,036
Think of it as just another demon
you have to deal with...

580
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,043
when you're an officer.

581
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,045
Huh, Nashton?

582
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,638
Open the hatch!
That's an order, Commander!

583
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:19,174
That's an order I can't really follow.
You see...

584
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:22,654
I'm not an officer
on this ship.

585
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:25,556
Think of me as
Naval Intelligence.

586
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,356
You don't have
anything on me!

587
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,361
<i>[Jarod On Speaker]</i>
<i>I know that you forced Danes...</i>

588
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,594
<i>to tamper with the evidence</i>
<i>after the accident...</i>

589
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,533
to ruin Scott Seaver's name.

590
00:42:36,603 --> 00:42:39,595
<i>You had to preserve</i>
<i>the</i> Monroe <i>to save your career...</i>

591
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,766
<i>so you let</i>
<i>a 20-year-old kid die.!</i>

592
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:45,539
Didn't you, Nashton?
Didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you?

593
00:42:45,612 --> 00:42:48,012
Yes. Yes.

594
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,016
God, I'm sorry.

595
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,976
<i>I let him die.</i>

596
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,791
[Gasping]

597
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:09,267
<i>Now, did you really think that I would</i>
<i>put this ship into danger?</i>

598
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,566
<i>That was just laughing gas.</i>

599
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:14,232
So try to laugh a little.

600
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:16,037
[Panting]

601
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:22,148
Take him straight to
Captain Nagel.

602
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:24,241
And that's an order.

603
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,878
Yes, sir.

604
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:29,115
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Dismissed.</i>

605
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,954
Sir, you have a man
impersonating an officer on this ship.

606
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:37,428
I know that.
At ease, Lieutenant. There he is.

607
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:45,228
- We were talking about Commander Forrester.
- Jarod?

608
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:47,239
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Jarod is Naval Intelligence.

609
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:49,605
- I plan to see to it he gets a medal.
- Where is he?

610
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:53,669
Well, he was ordered back to Norfolk
by the secretary no less.

611
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:56,341
<i>If you hurry,</i>
<i>you might still catch him.</i>

612
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,417
<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

613
00:45:56,537 --> 00:46:01,941
The nearest ocean
is 1,756 miles from here.

614
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,541
That's just the way I like it.

615
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:40,773
