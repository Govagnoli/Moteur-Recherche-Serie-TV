1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,230
All right, could it be behind
door number one, two or three?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,400
And you have first choice right now,
Kathy. What door do you want?

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,103
- [Kathy] Three.
- Door number three.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:15,614
And, Debbie?
Debbie, just for the fun of it-

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,446
Just for the fun of it, which one would
you have chosen if you went for it?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,578
- [Debbie] Two.
- Number two. What was behind number two?

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,623
Just two- $2, 000 in cash...

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,219
because the super deal
was behind... number one!

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,991
And number three had the $1,000.

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,761
- [Knocking]
- [Woman] Ready to take the plunge?

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,167
Ready.
It's my "big deal of the day."

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,797
[Man]
Jarod must've screwed up bad...

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,936
if they sent three of ya out here
to close him down.

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,675
You sure that you're his
Amway field representatives?

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:54,243
Do you really think that we could
fool someone as smart as yourself?

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,949
Well, uh, I-I guess
it's that Amway thing.

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:03,519
Uh, I just never thought of Jarod
as a glycerin and honey soap kind of guy.

18
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,326
That is what you people sell,
isn't it? Soap?

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,163
Yeah, uh, everything
from, uh, baby shampoo...

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,793
to, uh, industrial-strength
pool cleaner.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,861
That'd be good foryou.

22
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,373
Oh, look.

23
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,808
The Match Game, the home version.

24
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,540
Uh,Jarod, he's a-
he's a regular lightning round lunatic.

25
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,549
When he's not surfin' the waves,
he's surfin' the Game Show Channel.

26
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,710
Parker?

27
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,482
Pushing the Limits.

28
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,185
Taking Risks.
Confessions of an Adrenaline Junkie.

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,161
What are we talkin' about here, Syd?
Jarod Knievel jumping Buicks at Caesars?

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,064
It's daredevil stuff, you know?
He's always doing dangerous things...

31
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:45,230
Iike night surfing
and street luge and-

32
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,071
He even strapped that bullet proof vest
on once and he had me shoot him blindfolded!

33
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,976
All manifestations of
an obsession with risk-taking.

34
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,210
What kind of training do you put
your sales people through, actually?

35
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,979
We'll send you a brochure.
Dr. Quackenbush...

36
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,750
once again, your diagnosis
has come too late to find Jarod.

37
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,554
Well, not that late.
He left less than an hour ago.

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,754
Was that with or without
his blindfold?

39
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,922
You don't need a blindfold
to jump off a bridge.

40
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,503
[Woman] You sure you want
to stay with this old cord, Jarod?

41
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,732
You've done 295 on this one.

42
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,641
Well, I only really need it to last 296.

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,086
[Yelling]

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,918
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

45
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,928
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,864
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

47
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,027
How many people died
because of what I thought up?

48
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,539
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

49
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,800
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

50
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,640
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

51
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,702
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

52
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,681
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.

53
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,513
[Jarod]
Life's a gift.

54
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,220
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

55
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,464
Mr. Goltz's M.R.I. reveals
a closed fracture...

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,735
of the right parietal bone
with a subdural hematoma.

57
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,743
[Man]
We've inserted a C.S.F.. shunt...

58
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,644
so we should know more
once his edema's resolved.

59
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,649
I notice on his admission chart
the presence of glass fragments in his hair.

60
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,776
[Man] It's a mystery.
I assumed they came from his glasses.

61
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,786
But his mother says
Tony doesn't wear them.

62
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,880
- Could it have been a sports goggle of some kind?
- No. Industrial-grade glass.

63
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,153
I, uh, did a lab analysis myself.

64
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,491
You did it, not the police?

65
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,760
[Man] They're treating the entire
Goltz case as a bungee stunt gone bad.

66
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,994
Open and shut.
No more, no less.

67
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,107
Tony? Honey, come on back home.

68
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,474
Your sister and I miss you so.

69
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,274
I always keep my family close too.

70
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,645
Sorry. You must be Dr. Nichols.

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,379
- Call me Jarod.
- Oh, please, sit down.

72
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,547
When Tony wakes up,
I just want him to remember.

73
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,184
Actually, I didn't think
I'd ever see these photos again.

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,161
I thought Tony's wallet
had been lost in the accident...

75
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,857
but somebody found it
at the nurses' station this morning.

76
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,127
It was left in that envelope
wrapped in wax paper.

77
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,735
Well, at least the pictures
were still there.

78
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,406
His sister Carrie took those
at his last birthday.

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,675
A week later, he was off
looking for his dad.

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,877
He was searching for his father?

81
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,318
His father rode off on a dirt bike
in '91 and never looked back.

82
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,721
Searching for your family.
It's instinct.

83
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,726
Now his- his sister Carrie's doing it.

84
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,195
Not long after we came out here
to look after Tony, she just took off.

85
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:03,099
I'm just hoping that someday, we'll all
be smiling like in those pictures again.

86
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,606
The best therapy for him is to hear
the voice of his family and his friends.

87
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,407
I guess that's just me now. His friends
used to come by and visit, but they stopped.

88
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,605
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

89
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,945
He and his daredevil friend Zed...

90
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,985
used to ride motorcycles
out at a place called Willow Ridge.

91
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,954
I guess Zed's riding alone now.

92
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,101
# [Rock, Indistinct]

93
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,127
- [Honking]
- [Tires Screeching]

94
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,077
You okay?

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,143
Hey, no problem.
I always wanted to be a hood ornament.

96
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,485
I'll take that as a "yes."

97
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,684
You know, the way you flew up
my tailpipe, I thought you were a cop.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,287
Not today.
Are you sure you're all right?

99
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,763
No, it's okay.
The chick can handle it.

100
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,097
Chicks?
They call me Jarod.

101
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,797
- Friends call me Shay.
- Hmm.

102
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,534
Friends like Zed?

103
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,271
- You know Zed?
- I understand that he 
and his friends race this road.

104
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,042
Huh. Well, maybe I was right about you.
Maybe you are a cop.

105
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,278
Just somebody tryin'
to fight the boredom.

106
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,345
Oh, by the way, nice racing.

107
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,293
[Engine Sputtering]

108
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,562
It's not exactly a police escort,
but I have an extra seat.

109
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,238
Ask me, Speed Racer's
kissed the asphalt...

110
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,647
one too many times
without a helmet.

111
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,981
[Sydney]
Could be a psychotic cry for help.

112
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,318
Hi, Sis. So I heard Jarod
never came back to his lair.

113
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,324
Any luck deciphering
his new occupation?

114
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:44,056
Don't quote me, but I think
he morphed into the human cannonball.

115
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,329
Jarod seems to be exhibiting all the signs of
an obsession with extreme thrill-seeking.

116
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,336
Hmm.
Maybe he's rejuvenating.

117
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,032
Some jump off cliffs,
others seek religion.

118
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,939
I, for one, replenish my soul
by going back to nature.

119
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,501
- Oh.
- What, surprised to find I like to camp?

120
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,071
No. Surprised to find you have a soul.

121
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,108
On that loving note, I'm off
to the wilds for three days.

122
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,711
My office will know how to reach me.

123
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,560
I can die now.
I've seen it all.

124
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,619
[Chuckles]
You wanna bet?

125
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,131
They were just delivered.

126
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,601
Scratch "human cannonball."

127
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,072
- He's freakin' Chuck Barris.
- Well, actually, Monty Hall.

128
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,405
And what exactly is the deal
with Jarod's Big Deal, Broots?

129
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,037
We open door number one
with this key.

130
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,274
- What about the other two?
- Time-locked.

131
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,977
- They'll open at predetermined intervals.
- [Miss Parker] Give me that.

132
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,817
Okay, quizmaster,
what is behind door number one?

133
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,148
[Broots]
Looks like a giant fortune cookie.

134
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,420
[Miss Parker]
It is a giant fortune cookie.

135
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,056
[Broots]
So what's our future hold?

136
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,602
It's not about our future.
It's about the past.

137
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,604
It's a dinner bill
from a few weeks ago.

138
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,631
"The Hidden Truth."
And the waitress was called May Lin.

139
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,406
"The Hidden Truth." Yeah. That's the Chinese
restaurant I pass by on my way here.

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,505
- I've never been there.
- Me either. You, Syd?

141
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,847
I don't eat rice.

142
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,615
So what do you think
it means, Miss Parker?

143
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,919
That we need reservations.

144
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,486
[Man]
You lose.

145
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,101
[Shay]
Yo, Zeddie, Jojo, Mackey.

146
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,664
What up, Shay? Where you been,
chillin' on a beach with a coldie?

147
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,209
- Just riding.
- Yeah?

148
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,643
You gonna do that luge in a wet suit?

149
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,113
I've been surfin' today, darlin'.
Jojo?

150
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,707
But I hear that whaling stretch of road in
the Glen's gettin' shut down next week.

151
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,448
- So they're dropping the hill?
- Not soon enough. Name's Zed.

152
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,219
- Jarod.
- He's not some Jehovah's Witness
knockin' on my door, is he?

153
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,817
Well, I've witnessed a lot,
but never Jehovah.

154
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,331
That's good, 'cause I'm broke.
And I haven't seen God.

155
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,958
At least not since I had that awesome
meltdown lugin' a canyon last week, hey, guys?

156
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,296
[Man]
Right on!

157
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,236
- You like to ride, "J"?
- Anything and everything.

158
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,364
What do you do for a living?

159
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,501
Well, I seem to have trouble
holding down a steady job.

160
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,511
I get bored pretty easily.

161
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,843
Ah, boredom.
The endless bowel.

162
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,112
- What about yourself?
- A job here, a job there, you know.

163
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,551
- Whatever keeps Cheerios on the table.
- Amen to that.

164
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,112
He can ride, Zed.
I know since Tony's been out...

165
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,158
- you've been looking for another player.
- Is that right?

166
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:31,322
- You up for an endorphin fix?
- If it takes more nad than
luging down a canyon, sure.

167
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:36,562
- Why not?
- Well, if you got 'em, bring 'em along.

168
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,537
Then you tell me.

169
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,602
Come on, mates.

170
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,712
[Zed]
200yards, headon.

171
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,714
Keep your wheels on the double yellow.

172
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,717
In the old days, they used to call this
chicken. I think of it more of a chance...

173
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,844
to, uh, get a grin from the gods.

174
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,218
Let's make them smile.

175
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,120
Let's do it.

176
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,593
I'm damn good, Jarod,
but Zed's great.

177
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,762
Don't blink.
He's cageable.

178
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,804
- Oh!
- Ooh!

179
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,816
Nice one, "J" man.
Not even my mate Tony took me that far.

180
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,917
There's a spot in my tribe
if you want it.

181
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,191
Mmm.
Got nothin' better to do.

182
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,169
You know, I've never seen Zed
take to anybody so fast, Jarod.

183
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,679
Easy come, easy go,
I guess.

184
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,081
- Are you talking about Tony?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:36,986
- Who is this guy?
- Tony used to hang with the group
before I got here.

186
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,253
Then he got messed up in a bungee accident
a little over a month ago.

187
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,817
Did his cord break?

188
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,194
Frayed or something while takin' a plunge
off the Parker's Mill Road.

189
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,325
The doctors don't give him
much of a chance.

190
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:54,532
But, hey, like Zed always says,
first one to 40 alive loses.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,302
"J" man!

192
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,843
I'm really glad you made it tonight.

193
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,936
I don't know if Shay told you,
but Friday nights...

194
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,243
we don't exactly
square dance around the radio.

195
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,715
We like to try new things,
push the envelope.

196
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,652
- Then let's make the gods grin.
- No, no, no.

197
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,451
- Let's make 'em laugh out loud.
- [Man] Whoo!

198
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,958
Free the brain, free the body.

199
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,126
Free the body, free the soul.

200
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,171
And you thought we were goin'
hang glidin' tonight, "J."

201
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:44,650
Fire walkers in Mauritius learn how
to channel their fears, harness them...

202
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,921
to create a power
that could not be denied.

203
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,932
It's a power free for the taking.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,401
Nothing is free.

205
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,536
I'm startin' to think you're a slave
to the same demons I am, "J."

206
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,104
Without demons, there can be no angels.

207
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,117
F.Y.I.

208
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:52,283
Basaltic rock.
It's a much better conductor of heat.

209
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,657
If you're going to free your soul,
I say free it.

210
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:05,566
I guess our Chinese dinner
was officially a zonk last night.

211
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,933
Any results yet on that dinner bill
from the fortune cookie?

212
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:12,134
Well, my pal Bodie down in Physical
did a rush job for me.

213
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,039
- The geek with cloudy cataracts?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,510
Have you seen them lately?
It's milkier than a Guernsey.

215
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,980
Says the kids love it on Halloween.
Some zombie thing he does.

216
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,507
- The results, Broots.
- Uh-

217
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:27,317
The-The only prints on the bill
belong to the waitress.

218
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,483
May, last name, Lin.

219
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,255
The one who quit over a month ago
with no forwarding address?

220
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:35,695
Like I said, zonk.

221
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,928
Oh, Miss Parker?
Jarod's door number two just opened.

222
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,936
Come see what I found inside.

223
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,268
[Jarod]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

224
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,467
It's time for another exciting game
of You Don't Have a Clue.

225
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,704
I'm your host, Jarod Winkerdale...

226
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,975
and it's time to see
if you have a clue.

227
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:55,176
This is no stress disorder, Syd.
It's Chernobyl of the brain.

228
00:15:55,251 --> 00:16:00,314
Today's lucky contestant
is Miss Parker!

229
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,585
She'll have overnight
to figure out her clue.

230
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,356
And if she does, she'll win a trip to
the beautiful Cabins O' Love hideaway...

231
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:11,059
nestled into the rolling hills
of Thompson, West Virginia.

232
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,295
Don't look at me.
I watch soaps.

233
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,736
Okay, Miss Parker, here's your clue.

234
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:19,172
The hidden truth may be missing...

235
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:23,975
but you won't find it
until you claim your prize.

236
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:27,107
- [Bell Dings]
- "The hidden truth."

237
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:30,482
- The name of the restaurant.
- "May. May missing."

238
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,420
The waitress May Lin is missing.

239
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:36,686
"You won't find it
until you claim your prize."

240
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,195
A trip to the beautiful Cabins 0' Love.

241
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,924
Beautiful indeed.

242
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,775
[Tony's Mother's Voice]
Tony's wallet had been lost in the accident...

243
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:06,618
but somebody found it
at the nurses'station this morning.

244
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,954
It was left in that envelope
wrapped in wax paper.

245
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:20,099
- Four bucks.
- These are delicious.

246
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:24,435
Oughta be. Harry's got the dirtiest
dirty water dogs in town.

247
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,907
Four duckies.

248
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,139
My wallet.

249
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,977
- Have you seen my wallet?
- How would I know where it is?

250
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,415
Well, since you have such
a knack for finding wallets...

251
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,715
I thought maybe you knew
where mine was.

252
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,950
Look, when Isaw on the news...

253
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:44,425
that the guy was in a coma from
that bungee accident, I felt guilty.

254
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:47,486
- Oh, an honorable thief.
- I didn't rob him. I found it.

255
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:52,466
- About a month ago in the bushes
when I was sweepin' up glass.
- Industrial-grade glass.

256
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:55,299
It was on the sidewalk
below that high-rise there.

257
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:59,000
The morning after the robbery,
a rare coin dealer on the 30th floor.

258
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:04,012
A bunch of'em zip-lined from that building
through the windows to that one.

259
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,344
You'd have to be crazy
to try a stunt like that.

260
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,976
Or searching for your soul.

261
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,300
[Door Closes]

262
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,370
Jarod, what are you doing?

263
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,467
I was looking for a wrench.
My-My bike's losing compression.

264
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:12,139
- And you?
- Oh, uh, I thought you were Zed.

265
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,745
Did you take this picture?

266
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:19,379
No. Before I got here.

267
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:22,856
- Is that Tony?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:27,225
I-I guess. Zed used to talk about him
all the time right after the accident.

269
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,230
More than he does now.

270
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,994
Tony and Zed,
they were really good friends?

271
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:35,003
Tony was in Zed's inner group.

272
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,539
See, with Zed it's all about
the ultimate thrill...

273
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:41,668
pushing the envelope, challenging the
people around him to find their true selves.

274
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:44,872
When he thinks you're ready,
he invites you on the ultimate thrill.

275
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:47,780
Ultimate thrill, or ultimate test?

276
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,444
- Both, I guess.
- Have you been invited?

277
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:55,248
- I guess he doesn't think I'm ready yet.
- And Tony?

278
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:59,852
Was that the ultimate thrill,
or the ultimate test?

279
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,195
I don't know.
If you're not in, you're not in.

280
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:08,294
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.

281
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,305
[Forced Chuckle]
I'll see you later.

282
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:14,974
- So when does all this fun begin?
- Meaning?

283
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,444
Meaning I'm not hanging
around here for my health.

284
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,482
The only people around here who are having
any fun are you and your merry little men.

285
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,383
Well, those merry little men
are special people, Jarod.

286
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:26,115
People who have proven
themselves, you know?

287
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:29,317
- Pushed the limits of both mind and body.
- And the law?

288
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:34,159
Your toys, they weren't exactly
dropped off by Santa Claus, were they?

289
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,722
Like I said, "J," whatever it takes
to put Cheerios on the table.

290
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,967
Do you think you have
what it takes, Jarod?

291
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,973
I don't know.
Why don'tyou be the judge?

292
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:54,475
It's simple, "J." I dump you
in the water, then I throw in a key.

293
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,951
Object:
Free yourself before you die.

294
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,750
- Zed, this is too far.
- A closed mind is a crippled mind, Shay.

295
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,815
Make fear work for you.
Conquer it.

296
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:07,260
Jarod knows.
You have to taste death to live life.

297
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,458
Right?
Oh, I almost forgot.

298
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:20,108
- Can you conquer the fear, "J"?
- You'd be surprised what I can do.

299
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,468
- One minute.
- Give him the key.

- What are you doing?
- Like the ads say...

303
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:09,089
How about you, Shay?
How far will you push it to be your best?

304
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:16,093
Ninety seconds.

305
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,350

Welcome to the merry men.

311

May Lin stayed in this cabin here.

312
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:21,990
Perfect.

313
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:25,397
I tried to engage May
in some occasional chitchat...

314
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:28,164
but the little waitress
was a bit stand-offish.

315
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,899
I can't imagine what would make her
uncomfortable around here.

316
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:36,172
Me neither. But I guess them people
just like to stick to themselves.

317
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:38,179
What kind of a racist comment
is that?

318
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:41,307
Oh, no.
I'm not unsophisticated.

319
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:44,512
I was talking about her gender.
Single woman and such.

320
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:48,089
You're unattached, aren'tyou?

321

As unattached as your limbs
are gonna be...

Well, anyhoo...

You're gonna have to trust me.

He met this guy named Zed,
who promised to help him find our father.

He said he used to ride
with Dad back in '96.

A month ago, the night of
Tony's accident, he called me.

I told him that our mother got a call
from our grandmother...

She said my father died in '92.

351

That's way before Zed
claims he knew him.

So Zed was stringing
your brother along.

353

Tony got really angry, and he said
he was gonna confront Zed.

00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:29,799
It makes perfect sense.
Mr. Lyle is locking himself away.

489
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,808
Oh. That makes sense?

490
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,277
[Sydney]
As a child, Mr. Lyle's foster father...

491
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:38,281
kept him locked in a woodshed
weeks at a time.

492
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:41,580
We all try to preserve
our childhood...

493
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:44,212
with one ritual or another.

494
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:47,257
In Lyle's case, this woodshed
may be the only place...

495
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:49,850
in the whole world
where he feels safe.

496
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:53,021
- What does that have to do with May Lin?
- Everything.

497
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:56,995
- You mean he-
- I believe the word is torture.

498
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,468
I believe the word is murder.

499
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:02,097
And the Jeopardy answer
is he sleeps in a shed...

500
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,607
just like the one he was
tortured in when he was little.

501
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:07,542
He stalks and kidnaps Asian women...

502
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:11,946
who he then brings to
a hidden torture chamber.

503
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:16,680
- Who is Mr. Lyle?
- Or what?

504
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:21,186
[Zed]
We're almost into the cash room, boys.

505
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:23,523
- [Beeping]
- Got it. We're in.

506
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,461
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- It's payday. Go get the cash.

507
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,522
Go!

00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,812
Smile, Shay.
This is supposed to be the fun part.

510
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:52,185
Come on. Let's go.

511
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:58,054
- Best thrill yet.
- Yo, Zeddie!

512
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:01,360
It's locked.
Come on, Zeddie!

- [Alarm Sounding]
- What is goin' on here? Aah!

515
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,805
You know, it's amazing what you
can do with a pair of wire cutters...

516
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:17,177
and a garage door opener.

517
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,184
- Take these cuffs off now!
- That wouldn't be any fun.
Where's the thrill in that?

518
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:24,119
Speaking of which,
I got a surprise foryou.

519
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:27,453
- Just... don't go away.
- [Yells]

520
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:30,358
Here. Go to your mom.
She's worried about you.

521
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:32,589
Now, go.

522
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,927
What the hell are you doing?

523
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,968
I'm giving you something that
you didn't give Tony- a chance.

524
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:40,629
Slim, but a chance.

525
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:48,112
- What's going on, "J"?
- The ultimate thrill.

526
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:53,276
The ultimate test.
Or should I say, the ultimate splat?

527
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,248
Wow. This cord is so old.
I don't-

528
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:01,655
I don't know if it's gonna make it through
another jump. Oh, well, like you say-

529
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:05,389
[Imitating Zed] "It's time to do battle
with the beast of the gods."

530
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:08,432
- Pull me up, "J," now!
- Oh, can you feel it?

531
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:12,629
Can you feel the fear?
That's your ticket to the ultimate thrill.

532
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:15,171
Yeah! Get me down from here!

533
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,731
Did you give Tony Goltz that chance?
He trusted you.

534
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,972
He trusted you to find the father
that he'd been searching for.

535
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:25,812
He found out you lied to him, that you were
just using him, turning him into a thief.

536
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,681
Tony was gutsy... but stupid.

537
00:40:28,753 --> 00:40:30,721
He was going to turn you
into the police...

538
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:33,985
so you tied him to a faulty bungee cord
and you tossed him to his death.

539
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,322
Only he didn't die, did he?

540
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:39,693
Now he's lying in a hospital bed
trapped inside his own body...

541
00:40:39,764 --> 00:40:42,961
and he may never again
experience another thrill.

542
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:46,800
But then again, neither will you.

543
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:49,203
No. No. No.

544
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:51,468
- No. No!
- Ready, set-

545
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,635
Okay! Okay! I did it!

546
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:58,171
I knew Tony was gonna go to the police.
Now get me down from here!

547
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,685
You'd better relax, Zed.

548
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,947
- Come on. You feel it?
- Yeah, well-

549
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:07,855
You feel the danger? That's your passage
to the other side, remember?

550
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,825
- No!
- Enjoy your journey.

551
00:41:09,894 --> 00:41:12,488
- No!
- Oh, like you said-

552
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:17,227
You've got to taste death
to experience life.

553
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,031
[Yelling]

554
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:36,348
I guess this old cord had
one more jump in it after all.

555
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,549
Get me out ofhere!

556
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,856
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

557
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,894
What? Jarod attend
a Monty Hall garage sale?

558
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,598
Mr. Lyle, you seem so, um-

559
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:58,608
Relaxed?

560
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:00,906
Yeah, I just came in from the mountains.
I heard you had a lead on Jarod.

561
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:04,914
No, all of this... was a dead end.

562
00:42:08,286 --> 00:42:12,450
Didn't even shed any light
on his personality, Syd?

563
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:15,515
No. Not on his.

564
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,366
Oh, well.

565
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:28,669
Um, nothing personal,
but you three look terrible.

566
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,707
You should take a break, rejuvenate...

567
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:34,211
get into the great outdoors,
relieve some ofthat stress.

568
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:38,078
God knows it makes me feel so alive.

- What?

One of us has to stop him, Miss Parker.

573
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:54,390
- I was too late for May Lin.
- I'll keep my eyes open. Count on it.

574
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:58,333
Jarod, we took a hell of a risk
breaking into Lyle's apartment.

Sometimes, the risks
we take are worth it.
