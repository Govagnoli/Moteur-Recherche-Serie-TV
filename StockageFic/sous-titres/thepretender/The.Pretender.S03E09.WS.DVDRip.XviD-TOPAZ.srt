No body, no sign of foul play.
The man walked out.

Now, Dr. Gardner, it's only natural to want
the facts about the man you're replacing...

But you still have to
deal with the body.

<i>It's an accident.</i>

181

00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:30,323
I just get so bored
sometimes, Sydney.

329
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:34,658
A sharp mind left idle can become
a very sharp weapon indeed.

330
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,034
You gonna come in, Doc?

331
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,299
Or do you just like to watch?

332
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,476
Interesting experiment.

333
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,576
There's no way the rat can win.

334
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:02,589
<i>Every turn leads nowhere.</i>
<i>No reward, no way out.</i>

335
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:05,922
- Seems pointless.
- Maybe that is the point.

336
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:09,020
He with the biggest brain wins.
Is that it?

337
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,031
Or she.

338
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,167
<i>Certainly not them.

339
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,569
<i>Their tiny brains</i>
<i>can barely think.</i>

340
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,235
<i>So, round and round they go,</i>
<i>chasing their tails forever.</i>

341
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:26,246
Very cruel, Miss Dunning.

342
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:29,772
Although I can't believe
a rigged game doesn't bore you.

343
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:33,853
Once in a while...

344
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,914
even the dumber animals
do something unpredictable.

345
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:39,222
<i>Something that catches you</i>
<i>off guard.</i>

346
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:41,228
<i>And that's when it really gets fun.</i>

347
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,958
Fun, till you get bitten.

348
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,193
I haven't been bitten yet.

349
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,031
Yet, being the operative word.

350
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,037
Everyone's gotta go sometime.

351
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:52,630
The question is-
Who will go first?

352
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:57,576
Which brings us back to-
the biggest brain rules.

353
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:01,412
The superior mind
always has a way out.

354
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,043
Tiny little door marked "Exit."

355
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,149
Well, maybe it's time
to run for it.

356
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,953
- <i>[Rat Squeaking]</i>
- Oh, uh, Jarod.

357
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:20,127
<i>[Camera Whirs]</i>

358
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:22,136
I'll keep it in my glove box.

359
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:24,434
<i>Just like Professor Clark.</i>

360
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,812
<i>[Miss Parker]</i>
<i>I just don't get it, Sydney.</i>

361
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,543
He hasn't so much
as looked at another woman...

362
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,551
since the day my mother died.

363
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,985
And now, just like that,
he decides he's replacing her.

364
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:43,047
No, he's not replacing her.

365
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,787
Your father has lived alone
a long time.

366
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,421
It's only natural for him
to reach out again.

367
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,431
You sound like you're on his side.

368
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:55,026
<i>There are no sides here.</i>
<i>You must let him move on with his life.</i>

369
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:57,037
I'm sorry it's painful for you.

370
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,039
It often is
for the children involved.

371
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,502
- I'm not a child.
- Then you know what you must do.

372
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,877
Professor Clark said
in his book...

373
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:18,858
that motive springs from that bottomless pit
called the human psyche.

374
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:23,455
<i>That no matter how deeply you dig,</i>
<i>you never exhaust it.</i>

375
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,967
Let's do right by him, shall we?

376
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,968
Let's figure out why...
he was killed.

377
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,909
Let's start with the police.
Richard, you're our cop.

378
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,917
<i>What do they think?</i>

379
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:48,354
Statistically, money and jealousy top the list.
It could have been a robbery.

380
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:50,687
Except the 40,000
was left in the car.

381
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,251
So jealousy then. Another teacher
with a gripe against Professor Clark.

382
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,992
<i>[Gwen]</i>
<i>Or his wife, if she knew about the affair.</i>

383
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,193
It could be something
as simple as road rage.

384
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:02,429
No, that's spontaneous.
This was planned.

385
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,165
Well, we're in
a unique position here today...

386
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:07,470
because we have the killers
in our class.

387
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,409
Why don't we ask them?

388
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:12,412
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

389
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,505
<i>Why would you murder someone?</i>

390
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:17,676
- Maybe I didn't like him.
- <i>If you don't like someone, you avoid them.</i>

391
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,879
If you see them walking down the street,
you walk to the other side.

392
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,252
You don't send them
careening off a cliff.

393
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,222
Grady, any thoughts?

394
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,956
I don't know.
Why does anyone murder?

395
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,964
I'm not asking anyone.
I'm asking you.

396
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:34,866
So, dig down deep into that bottomless pit
of yours and tell us why would you kill.

397
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:38,064
- Well, uh-
- Hello?

398
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:42,098
There are a million reasons
to kill. Revenge.

399
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:45,203
<i>Revolt. Release.</i>
<i>Superstition.</i>

400
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,240
<i>Paranoia. Bad debt.</i>
<i>Bad childhood. Bad hair day.</i>

401
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:52,479
<i>[Jarod] I'm afraid you've missed</i>
<i>the most relevant one.</i>

402
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,486
Arrogance.

403
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,223
You see, our killers, they think
they're smarter than the rest of us...

404
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:04,288
and that this is all a game.

405
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,231
That's the reason
they have accomplices.

406
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,235
What fun is it to commit
the perfect murder...

407
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,601
if you don't have someone
to gloat over it with?

408
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,937
<i>But arrogancejust may be</i>
<i>their downfall.</i>

409
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,772
Professor Clark says in his book
that the perfect murder...

410
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,336
is committed by one person alone.

411
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:22,645
- Why is that?
- Because accomplices can be unpredictable.

412
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:25,845
Exactly.
You never know what they might do...

413
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,480
how they might react.

414
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:31,047
Take our role players over here.

415
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,562
What if one of them couldn't take
the pressure and crumbled?

416
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:39,999
What if one of them went to the police
and cut a deal?

417
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:43,367
Aren't you getting a little ahead
of yourself, Jarod?

418
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:48,705
<i>I mean, there's no evidence that Professor</i>
<i>Clark's death was anything but an accident.</i>

419
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:52,679
Well, quite obviously, you haven't spoken
to the police today.

420
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:56,376
I talked to the detective
in charge of this case...

421
00:28:56,451 --> 00:29:00,182
and he's convinced that the Polaroids
in the glove compartment were fakes...

422
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:02,849
along with the e-mail
and any other evidence...

423
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:06,382
<i>that might suggest</i>
<i>that there was another woman.</i>

As of today...

425
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:15,292

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,702

That's why I brought
his favorite beer.

You know, a teacher is very lucky

<i>Grady, shut up.</i>
<i>Ajury could never convict us.</i>

<i>I'm the onlyjudge that matters now,</i>
<i>so let's examine the evidence.</i>

544
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:17,099
First, in all your planning,
you forgot one very important thing.

545
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,578
Professor Clark had a family.

546
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,842
He had a baby on the way...

547
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,249
and a wife who never
stopped believing in him.

548
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,517
You two, on the other hand,
you only have each other.

549
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,524
Before the tragedy, that is.

- <i>What tragedy?</i>
- <i>Don't play dumb, Claire.</i>

551
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,354
It's all in your suicide note.

552
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,594
<i>It says in here how you and Grady</i>
<i>killed Professor Clark.</i>

553
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:46,538
But grieving for the loss of his friend Matthew,
Grady cracked under pressure...

554
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:49,906
and wanted to go to the police
and confess.

555
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:54,038
So you- [Imitates Gunshot]
Killed him.

556
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:58,484
<i>And then you hung yourself, because you</i>
<i>couldn't face the utter futility and remorse.</i>

557
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:01,487

They're so fragile.

00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:04,388
- They'll know it's not my handwriting.
- <i>But it is.</i>

559
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,087
You see, I found these notes
that you wrote Professor Clark in his files...

560
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,995
and I traced over
various words and voilà.

561
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,930
Suicide note.

562
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,093

- You first.

00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,347
- I'll tell you whatever you wanna hear!
- Shut up, Grady.

568
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,786
He won't do it.
The bullet's just a blank.

569
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:37,824
Oh, you think so?

00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:45,192
<i>[Grady] Please, Jarod. Oh, God, no!</i>
<i>Come on, Claire, it's over!</i>

[Whimpering]
Okay, we did it!

572
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,864
We murdered Professor Clark!

573
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:55,102
Partly it was thrill, but mostly Claire was mad
at him because he wouldn't sleep with her!

574
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:57,474
- Shut up, Grady.
- Just don't kill me.

575
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:01,777

It was a bluff.
