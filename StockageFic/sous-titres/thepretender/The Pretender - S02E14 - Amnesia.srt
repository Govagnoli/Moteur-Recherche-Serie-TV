1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
Wait a minute, I didn't do anything.

2
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,201
Wait! I didn't do anything.

3
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:32,502
- What, what the hell is that?
- Move it!

4
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:36,803
No.

5
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,103
I want to call my father!

6
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:40,504
Do you hear me?

7
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:45,505
Nice PJs!

8
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:47,206
They pulled me right out of bed.

9
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:49,607
I was in the shower.

10
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:52,008
Hmm! Thanks for painting that one for me.

11
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:53,609
What the hell is going on here?

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,510
Trouble.

13
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,611
The worse kind.

14
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,012
I thought you were leaving town.

15
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,413
Well, I came to say goodbye, Sharpton.

16
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:39,914
And I knew you'd be here.

17
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:41,615
Like you are every night.

18
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,016
Collecting your payoff.

19
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:46,017
Same bat time, same bat channel.

20
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,018
I heard that on a re-run.

21
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:49,719
I don't know what you are talking about.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,820
Every night you head out alone,

23
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:52,821
you make your run,

24
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,822
collecting your drug money.

25
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,123
Then one night you hit a little girl.

26
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,624
You couldn't stop because of all the contrabands you had on board,

27
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,825
so you let her to bleed to death.

28
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,826
Tell me, what you are going to do about it?

29
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,227
I'm going to make sure that this is your last run.

30
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,228
You got it all down pat don't ya.

31
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:14,429
Well, you're right.

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,230
I do deliver drugs and I do love my money.

33
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:18,931
And I do head out alone.

34
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,132
But you left out a little something.

35
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,133
What's that?

36
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,934
The part where I stop and pick up my partner.

37
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,035
Come on, we're going to be late.

38
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,836
He'll freeze to death out here.

39
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,637
Yeah. It's a rough world, ain't it?

40
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,338
There are pretenders among us

41
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,839
I was taken from my family.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,640
Thirty-Six Hours, he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others.

43
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,841
How many people died because of what I thought up?

44
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:54,942
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

45
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,443
He is a pretender.

46
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,144
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

47
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,845
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

48
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,746
He defends the weak and the abused.

49
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:05,947
Life is a gift.

50
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,648
THE PRETENDER
Season 2

Toy Surprise

00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,649
YTET PRESENTS

52
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,650
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

53
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,051
You are a doctor?

54
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:19,552
I am, today.

55
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:35,553
Hey, wait!

56
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:38,454
Don't twitch or the dog'll rip the Adam's apple clear out of your throat.

57
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:39,755
Won't you?

58
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:41,256
Don't get me wrong.

59
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:43,357
He's a good-looking dog but that dog was born mean.

60
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,658
He did save your life however.

61
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,159
Found you in a parking lot.

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
Near barked his head off until I found ya.

63
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,961
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

64
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:53,962
Ah there you go.

65
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,263
Hey, what're you looking at?

66
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,264
You got something to add to this?

67
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:58,765
Why don't you get out of here and go back to your bed.

68
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,266
Go on.

69
00:03:59,367 --> 00:03:59,767
No. No...

70
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,768
Don't try getting up, don't try getting up.

71
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,469
You need to just stay right there and rest.

72
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,870
You got smashed pretty hard.

73
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,271
You just rest. You need to rest. You need to rest. You just rest.

74
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:12,672
What happened?

75
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:13,673
What happened?

76
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,174
Oh, Ah, You my friend have been mugged.

77
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,275
And oh no, they got all your money.

78
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,776
I'm, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:20,877
All your money's gone.

80
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,278
That's bad but your stuff is safe.

81
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,379
I saved your stuff.

82
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,980
That's good.

83
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,581
Where am I?

84
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:28,582
Where are you?

85
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,683
You my friend are in my little corner of paradise.

86
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:34,384
At least for now.

87
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:38,085
Hey, hey, ah, my name's Argyle by the way.

88
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:38,986
My name's Argyle.

89
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:42,687
And I'm called this on account of this birthmark that I got on the back of my thigh.

90
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:43,688
You want to see it?

91
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,589
You want to check it out?

92
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,690
No? Okay! That's cool.

93
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,591
Most people don't.

94
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,192
No offence taken.

95
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,093
You got a lot of stuff in here, dude.

96
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:56,094
Hey, I hope my patch job keeps in the blood, okay,

97
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,595
because look, the dog never complained about the doctoring.

98
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:04,796
But hey, I think you'd be the better judge you being the real M.D. and all.

99
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:06,897
- Doctor?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,098
You're a doctor, my friend.

101
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,599
This Id here says that your name is Jarod

102
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
and you, my friend, are a thoracic surgeon.

103
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,801
Give me a 3 cc syringe and a size A ET tube.

104
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,302
She's going into respiratory arrest.

105
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:22,003
Prepare to ventilate.

106
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,004
Give me the syringe. Remove the plunger.

107
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,405
Air entry on both sides of the chest.

108
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,806
She's pinking out.

109
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,907
Now that's a nice sound.

110
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:36,908
Come on. Come on. Yes! Yeah baby.

111
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,209
Now that's a nice sound.

112
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,910
We're gonna have us some heat now.

113
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,811
Oh. Oh.

114
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:44,412
Nothing ever works in this place.

115
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,613
Including you.

116
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,014
Never!

117
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,615
That's all going to change.

118
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,416
That's all going to change. Real soon!

119
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:55,317
I'm thinking four years of college.

120
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:58,018
I'm thinking Medical School.

121
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,019
I'm thinking doctoring prescriptions.

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,220
You know, I've been riding a wooden pony for years now.

123
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,421
And I'm thinking, you might just be my brass ring.

124
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:09,322
Brass Ring?

125
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,923
Pot of gold, boy, ship that's come in.

126
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,024
The way out man.

127
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:17,425
I'm thinking the hospital'll pay a healthy finders fee for one of it prize physicians.

128
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,126
Not a doctor.

129
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:21,727
You're not a doctor?

130
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,128
Come on. Who, the hell, are you then?

131
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,629
I don't know.

132
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,130
What is this?

133
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:35,731
It's a T-board.

134
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:37,132
A what? What?

135
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,733
T standing for torture.

136
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,934
The Centre Tribunal.

137
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,535
They want answers and until they get them we're not going anywhere.

138
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,336
Well, no. You're kidding right?

139
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:50,937
Don't soil yourself, Broots.

140
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:53,238
They want us unbalanced.

141
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,339
That's why they yanked us in the dead of night.

142
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,840
They're trying to fracture us emotionally.

143
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,741
Well, it's working. I'm shattering.

144
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:03,142
How do you know so much about this?

145
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:05,543
I've been on the other side of the glass.

146
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,444
So how does it turn out?

147
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,445
Fine.

148
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,546
If you're on the other side of the glass.

149
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:13,947
Oh great!

150
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,648
I knew Raines would be involved.

151
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,149
The question is who's behind it all.

152
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,750
The Triumvirate, cruskin.

153
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,551
Under whose authority?

154
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:25,752
Bridget!

155
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,153
That bitch is like a bad cough.

156
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:29,654
Who are those guys in the shadows?

157
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:30,455
I don't know.

158
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:32,756
I need to get word to my father.

159
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:33,557
Here.

160
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,358
I'm not sure that he will be able to help.

161
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,259
Sydney!

162
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,460
Hello lovey!

163
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,561
Bridget.

164
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:47,762
The last time I saw you,

165
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:51,563
you were trying to blow my father's helicopter out of the sky.

166
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,064
How did you get back in the Centre?

167
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,665
Well, before we get to that,

168
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,966
I promised some friends of mine I'd find out

169
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,867
why after eighteen months, Jarod is still out there.

170
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,068
Not possible.

171
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,669
They created him.

172
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,570
They know what he's capable of.

173
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,471
Yes, they do.

174
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:16,472
They think, the only way that he could still be eluding the Center

175
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:20,573
is that one, or all of you, are working with him.

176
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:24,273
They think that?

177
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,774
Or you made them think that?

178
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,375
Either way, no one's leaving until we find out who.

179
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,376
We start with you, Tex.

180
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,277
Whoever you are, you've got a tooth sweeter than mine, that's for sure.

181
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,478
Sugar's a killer, you know that?

182
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,279
It will rot all the teeth out, right out of your head.

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm lucky. I'm blessed. I've really good teeth.

184
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,281
They're all mine.

185
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:00,782
Hey, buddy?

186
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:02,483
What's wrong?

187
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:04,984
Oh no.

188
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:08,185
You don't know who you are and you're burning up.

189
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,886
That's what happens when you're left out in the elements.

190
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,187
That's what happens.

191
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:15,388
Your problem was you weren't looking over your shoulder.

192
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,589
You always gotta look over your shoulder, man.

193
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,090
There's always somebody back there in the dark,

194
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:24,991
Some mook, some punk back there gunning for you, I know.

195
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:26,792
You gotta look over your shoulder, man.

196
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:28,793
Look over your shoulder.

197
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,394
Or maybe you're running away from this cutie pie.

198
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:32,895
Who's this?

199
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:34,596
Hey

200
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:37,597
Who's this pretty lady?

201
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:38,398
What did she do?

202
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,499
Bust your rocks for not bringing home the green.

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
Hey, you didn't bring home the green.

204
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,101
Maybe she's another doctor.

205
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,802
You know, you'd better think twice about that next time.

206
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:54,603
Well, I'll be John Brown.

207
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:57,304
I will be John Browned.

208
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,405
You're not a doctor.

209
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,406
You're a park ranger.

210
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,607
No, you're a fireman.

211
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,608
No, you're a roach exterminator.

212
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,109
No, you're a federal investigator.

213
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,310
I'm, I'm sorry, mister.

214
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,311
Could you help me out here for a second?

215
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:19,712
I'm kind of at a loss here.

216
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:20,613
Who the hell are you?

217
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:22,914
Mister?

218
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:24,715
Mister?

219
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,216
I don't know who I am.

220
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:54,917
I didn't do anything.

221
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:24,218
Broots scared.

222
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,519
How do you think he will hold up?

223
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Before or after he wets his pants?

224
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,421
Can I, Can I have a robe?

225
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:57,722
Is Jarod smarter than you?

226
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:00,023
- Huh?
- You've been chasing him for over a year.

227
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,424
Has he alluded you because he is smarter?

228
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:03,425
No.

229
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,226
We try hard every day to find Jarod

230
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:10,027
but the wheel of fortune just hasn't landed on our number yet.

231
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:19,728
Spinning, spinning, spinning.

232
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,129
Well, he is a Pretender.

233
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,830
He's a one-man Siegfried and Roy.

234
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:31,631
Show me what you have.

235
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:35,232
Jarod interconnected 173 international calls.

236
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,333
But backtracking those calls was impossible

237
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:40,934
because instead of a call forwarding device triggered by a single call

238
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:45,135
all one hundred and seventy-three calls was individually initiated.

239
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,436
- Ingenious.
- And very expensive.

240
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:49,137
I don't care what it cost.

241
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:52,738
Oh, that's good because Jarod charged them all to your calling card.

242
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,739
He's, he's clever and smart.

243
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,240
Which makes tracking Jarod more fun.

244
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:00,241
Fun?

245
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:02,942
No! I...

246
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:04,543
Are you saying he's your hero?

247
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,144
No. I'm... No, I'm not saying that.

248
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,545
Then what are you saying?

249
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:13,345
Just... I'm just saying that Jarod's clever.

250
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,046
You can see it in his eyes.

251
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:16,847
You can tell.

252
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,248
According to your file you've never laid eyes on Jarod.

253
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:20,849
You never have, have you?

254
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,750
No.

255
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,151
I, ah, I'm referring to pictures.

256
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:27,252
Hello, Mr Broots.

257
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:28,253
Oh, my God!

258
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,454
Help me, please.

259
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,155
Eighteen months, no results.

260
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,056
We find it hard to believe that someone could be this inept on purpose.

261
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:48,957
Help me...

262
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:53,458
Mr Broots!

263
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,159
If you're not helping Jarod then who is?

264
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,860
Can I have a robe please?

265
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,461
You're like you and me.

266
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:16,362
Bunch of names. Travel light. Man on the run.

267
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:18,763
Who are you running from anyway?

268
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:20,264
John Law.

269
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:25,365
The man with a smile on his face and the evil in his heart? Huh?

270
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,366
Who you running from?

271
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,867
Hey.

272
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,267
Maybe you got a bounty on your head?

273
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:34,968
Your head's burning up.

274
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:36,669
You're burning up, man.

275
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,070
Oh no. This is not good.

276
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,471
You've been out in the elements too long man.

277
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,272
Out in the elements too long.

278
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:44,573
I knew it. This is not good.

279
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,174
I knew it. This is bad.

280
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:52,275
Jarod! Jarod!

281
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:03,776
I love you, Jarod.

282
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,777
Don't leave me.

283
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,078
Please don't leave me.

284
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,879
Come on!

285
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,880
Hey! Hey! Are you okay, man?

286
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,381
Are you okay?

287
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,482
No! No! No, don't you die on me, man.

288
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,783
Don't you die on me! Don't you leave me!

289
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:27,584
You're my brass ring man!

290
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,285
Come on! Don't you die on me, man!

291
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:31,086
Don't you die on me, man!

292
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,487
I know the escape procedure.

293
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,188
The fire! It's too hot!

294
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,889
It comes into the airline.

295
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,190
I try not to breathe but it is too late.

296
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:44,791
I can't open the hatch.

297
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:46,192
I can't open the hatch!

298
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:47,493
No one can get to us.

299
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:48,794
We can't be saved.

300
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:54,495
I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning!

301
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,496
Hey! Your fever broke.

302
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,597
Doubt left you with me for a while.

303
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,098
So, what's the Centre?

304
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,399
Your your little freakish home movies are all labelled ''For Centre Use Only. ''

305
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,500
What's the Centre?

306
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,001
I don't know.

307
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:28,402
You don't know!

308
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,103
I...I'll tell you what I think, Jarod.

309
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:36,104
I think that you got a big brain.

310
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:40,705
And I think that these Centre guys, I think they're after you.

311
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:43,706
And I think that means you're worth something to them,

312
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:46,707
which means you're worth a lot to me.

313
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,608
You see I got a big brain too.

314
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,409
Jarod, I got a big brain too.

315
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,310
Why won't you work?

316
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:55,911
Why won't you work?

317
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:57,912
Why won't you work?

318
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,813
I'm just trying to fix things, Jarod.

319
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,714
I'm just trying to make them right.

320
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,415
Not a big deal.

321
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,116
No big deal.

322
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,417
Just trying to fix things.

323
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:49,518
Who are you?

324
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,619
The proudest woman in the world.

325
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,420
Who am I?

326
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,621
Just trust your feelings.

327
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,622
Always trust your feelings.

328
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,523
Jarod, I told you I can't accept this.

329
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,724
But I made it for you.

330
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:16,625
This card is meant for someone else.

331
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:18,726
Don't you love me, Sydney?

332
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,427
We have work to do.

333
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:41,828
Is Sydney your dad or something?

334
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,329
I'm so glad I left Debbie at her god mother's.

335
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,230
I can't believe how long they've had Sydney out there.

336
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,231
You wear a watch to bed?

337
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:58,432
Yeah.

338
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:00,033
Why?

339
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:05,134
In case I wake up and, you know, need to document something.

340
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,435
Let us continue.

341
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,436
When are they going to leave him alone?

342
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,537
When they hear what they want to hear.

343
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,338
He's been out there for six hours already.

344
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,439
And they'll take another six if they want to.

345
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,540
What are they doing this for?

346
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:00,641
Because they can.

347
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,742
Jarod is my life's work.

348
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:07,343
My interest in him is primarily scientific.

349
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:11,044
That interest demands that I remain objective

350
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,845
which precludes the possibility of guilt.

351
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,946
Don't you love me, Sydney?

352
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:28,247
Forgive me father for I have sinned.

353
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:29,948
I have betrayed a friend.

354
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:31,949
Have you prayed to the Lord?

355
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,950
Not even he can forgive me for what I have done.

356
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:40,751
The bond between Jarod and me is as unique as Jarod is special.

357
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:45,452
Unique enough for you to be fighting for his freedom.

358
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:46,753
I would never do that.

359
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:50,954
Jarod's a very complex case.

360
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,855
I've tried to keep him alive

361
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:57,256
and to hold his psyche in check during this pursuit.

362
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,957
What are you? His wet nurse?

363
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:02,358
We must be patient.

364
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,559
Your tactics are far too aggressive.

365
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,760
The day you really anger Jarod is the day that he will disappear forever.

366
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,161
I have tried to bring him back.

367
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,662
That is my objective.

368
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:16,963
As a scientist,

369
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:20,164
I think The Centre is as good a place

370
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:24,665
as he will find to maximise his tremendous potential.

371
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,866
You don't know who Jarod is.

372
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:48,167
You don't know who Jarod is...

373
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,468
You're not a doctor. You're a park ranger.

374
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,569
No, you're a fireman.

375
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,270
No, you're a roach exterminator.

376
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:57,371
No, a federal investigator.

377
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:02,472
I'm sorry, mister. Who the hell are you...

378
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,773
- How are you?
- I can be anything I want to be.

379
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,274
I can be a doctor, I can be an engineer, I can be an astronaut.

380
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,275
But I don't know who I am.

381
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,476
Our father gave you this.

382
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,577
Who the hell are you?

383
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:21,678
I'm your brother.

384
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,479
Jarod, go and find our parents.

385
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
I want to know what I look like.

386
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,381
I want to know who I am.

387
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:36,482
I want to know who I am...

388
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:38,183
I'm not really a plastic surgeon.

389
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:38,984
My name is Jarod.

390
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:39,885
I'm not really a doctor.

391
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:40,586
Jarod Jones.

392
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:41,787
I'm not really in the Coast Guard.

393
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:42,088
Jarod Kent.

394
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:42,487
Jarod O'Leary.

395
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:43,088
Jarod Wright.

396
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:43,989
Who the hell are you?

397
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,790
Well, I sure as hell aren't Florence Nightingale.

398
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,591
This is who you look like.

399
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:54,592
This is who you are...

400
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,293
You're my son.

401
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:03,894
You're my life.

402
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,795
I love you, Jarod.

403
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,396
Then one night you hit a little girl.

404
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:21,497
Jarod.

405
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:30,899
Hi, Jarod.

406
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,400
Hello?

407
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,301
Hello. My name is Argyle.

408
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,702
A.R.G.Y.L.E.

409
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:57,203
Um? Is this the Centre?

410
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,204
Maybe. Why?

411
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:02,205
I don't know.

412
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:03,806
Maybe I've got something you want.

413
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:05,607
Uh huh!

414
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,208
Well, I'm all ears.

415
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:19,909
Dog here, he's a hero.

416
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,010
See I rescued him from the pond.

417
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,211
And he saved you.

418
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,712
He saved you, I saved him. It's ironic.

419
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:27,113
It's ironic. Yeah?

420
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:29,714
When did I go from patient to prisoner?

421
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:30,915
Prisoner.

422
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:32,616
Prisoner.

423
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,317
Prisoner! That's cold man.

424
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:36,218
That's cold.

425
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,219
What would you call it?

426
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,120
What would I call it? What would I call it?

427
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,621
I, I call it ironic.

428
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,722
I call it ironic. I call it ironic.

429
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,323
Just slip into my skin for a second, would you?

430
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,524
Just for a second, slip into my skin.

431
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,725
A wigged out stewardess, gets a hangnail.

432
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,326
Kills the entire flight crew.

433
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,127
Three hundred people drop out of the clouds. Boom!

434
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,328
A postman goes postal. Bang!

435
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,029
A Bus driver goes bustal. Crash!

436
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,930
And we, we all sit idly by

437
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:14,331
and say ¡°You are crazy man. Crazy. That was so crazy. I'm glad it wasn't me.¡±

438
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:19,932
The point is you've been sprouting crazy here a while now.

439
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,333
And I'm just making sure that's not me.

440
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,234
Okay. Fair's fair.

441
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,835
And by the way, I'm not into hurting you either.

442
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,236
So you can rack easy on that bro.

443
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,137
Hey, I wish we had a deck of cards

444
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:37,038
because I got this great trick I could show you.

445
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,439
Is that my phone?

446
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,240
Yeah.

447
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:41,341
Who'd you call?

448
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:42,942
Yeah! I just called the doctor.

449
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,043
I called your doctor to see if he made house calls..

450
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,444
You called Sydney?

451
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,245
No. No. No. He wasn't there but a lady answered.

452
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:52,046
- Miss Parker?
- No. No. No. No. It's Bridget.

453
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,847
- She sounded sexy.
- Did you tell them where you are?

454
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:55,348
What? Do I look like a road sign?

455
00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:00,249
Listen to me. These people. This organisation. They will kill you. Trust me.

456
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,950
Trust you? No, you listen to me.

457
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:03,751
Trust. Trust. Great word. Right?

458
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:08,252
Trust. It's on every coin, every bill, every buck, every bond in this country.

459
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:11,253
And yet it's still the one thing you still can't buy.

460
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:12,154
Argyle!

461
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:14,855
They are setting you up!

462
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:20,256
No! No! No! No! No! No!

463
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:22,357
Bridget said you'd have an answer for everything and you do.

464
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:23,458
Don't ruin everything.

465
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,459
It's good here. It's good. It's good.

466
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,760
Three hours ago you didn't know whether you were park ranger or rodeo clown.

467
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:32,761
Now you're cracking foxy about some secret organisation that wants to hurt me.

468
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,662
It's you they want, my friend.

469
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:35,363
It's you.

470
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,264
I just happen to hold the deed.

471
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:38,965
You listen to me.

472
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,266
I speak from experience.

473
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,467
You're dealing with the devil.

474
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:59,068
Thank you for joining us, Miss Parker.

475
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,769
Well, it was an invitation that I simply couldn't pass up.

476
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,070
Lose the butt.

477
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,671
You don't have to worry about me blowing smoke.

478
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:12,872
Put it out!

479
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:18,773
This is cruel.

480
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:20,674
Even for a T-Board.

481
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,675
Fire away, babe. I'm not going anywhere.

482
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:32,576
The Triumvirate is a bit murky concerning your motives in the pursuit of Jarod.

483
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:40,577
Well. Maybe they should pull their heads out of their sand boxes.

484
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,378
I do my job. Period!

485
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,579
What we are looking for is the truth.

486
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,980
Truth?

487
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:57,281
That is a very interesting word coming from you.

488
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:02,482
So you have no other agenda in doing your job.

489
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:07,283
No unresolved issues or conflicts with the Centre or Jarod.

490
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:10,484
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.

491
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:12,485
Is that the truth?

492
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:16,686
I know the truth, Miss Parker.

493
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:20,187
And what truth is that, Jarod?

494
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:23,488
The truth about what makes you sad.

495
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,689
Daddy, I want to know what really happened to my Mum.

496
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,790
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.

497
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:40,491
You didn't answer about Jarod.

498
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,592
Where did you find my mother's ring.

499
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:48,693
In one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.

500
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,194
Like her medical file.

501
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,895
Oh, you'd be surprised what one can find in there.

502
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:53,596
Jarod!

503
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:54,897
You know the dance, Miss Parker.

504
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:58,598
You help me with one of my secrets, I help you with one of yours.

505
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,799
We weren't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor.

506
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,100
I don't know if he was my mother's allier or betrayer.

507
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:05,801
Well, keep searching.

508
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:08,602
Igor holds the secret to both our pasts.

509
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:10,603
What makes you so sure?

510
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:12,304
Call it a gut feeling.

511
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:16,105
So you're saying that in your past year and a half pursuit

512
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:19,006
he's not had any undue influence on you?

513
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,007
That's what I'm saying.

514
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:21,808
Not of any kind?

515
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:23,809
No influence at all!

516
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,210
Not even emotional?

517
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:31,011
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

518
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:32,412
Do you believe that's true?

519
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,413
You paint a pretty sad picture.

520
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,114
How do we end up like this?

521
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:37,015
Like what?

522
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,016
Alone.

523
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:41,717
Searching.

524
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:45,218
It's ironic because we both want the same things.

525
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,019
Someone to care about

526
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,420
someone to care about us.

527
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,021
Do you think we'll ever find that kind of love in our lifes?

528
00:29:58,322 --> 00:30:02,022
How do we end up like this?...

529
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:03,423
Miss Parker?

530
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:06,524
Miss Parker?

531
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:08,825
Hi!

532
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,126
We're done here.

533
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:15,227
Miss Parker.

534
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,828
You may have a cigarette now.

535
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,229
I just quit.

536
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,730
Mr. Argyle.

537
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:31,931
You know Bridget.

538
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,932
If your body is half as good as your brain

539
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,333
you and I might just find a way, you know.

540
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,134
Coming from a man of your brilliance that's quite a compliment.

541
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:44,435
Hey, by the way you hit it right on the nail indeed about cashew boy here.

542
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,436
He's a nut, alright?

543
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,737
Yes. He's crazy.

544
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:48,438
But he's resourceful!

545
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,039
So have you come up with a price?

546
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,640
Bridget. If this is about Jarod...

547
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:53,541
Shhh. I'm on the phone.

548
00:30:55,842 --> 00:31:00,442
You know, I was out scamming this softie suburbanite the other day out of his lunch money

549
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:02,843
when I saw this dapper Dan in a Rolls Royce.

550
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:04,144
A Rolls Royce, Huh?

551
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,745
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

552
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,246
Real, real shiny!

553
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:13,247
Anyway, this guy right, he gets out of the car,

554
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:17,048
and I find myself staring at his threads, right.

555
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,449
I'm staring at this cat's threads

556
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,450
and I'm thinking to myself I don't know the dude from the president of England.

557
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:23,451
I don't know if he's a liar,

558
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,352
if he kicks his dog, if he smacks his old lady, nothing.

559
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:31,153
And yet, I find myself having this instant, incredible respect for the guy

560
00:31:31,854 --> 00:31:33,454
on account of the suit he's wearing.

561
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:35,755
Ah hah! Go On.

562
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:44,156
Yeah! His suit, his shirt, his watch, his loafers, the whole kit and caboodle.

563
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:46,657
One piece more expensive than the next.

564
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:50,258
Silk on silk. Leather on leather.

565
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,159
And you know, I'm thinking to myself, Bridget,

566
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,860
I'm thinking to myself, to drape this guy it must have cost at least,

567
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:07,461
I don't know, at least ten thousand dollars, Bridget.

568
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,562
Is that the price of respect, Mr Argyle?

569
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,663
Hey! Hey, a man ain't squat without respect.

570
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:21,964
Well, ten thousand dollars is a great deal of money

571
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:28,865
but I think I can convince my people to approve it.

572
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:36,066
No!

573
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:40,867
No! Big brain.

574
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:43,968
Don't do this.

575
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,069
Bridget? Write this down.

576
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,870
That's just three hours away.

577
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,371
I'm on the next plane.

578
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,172
If you've found, Jarod I am the only one who can bring him in.

579
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:00,773
Sorry darling.

580
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,074
This time he comes in.

581
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,575
Hey! Hey! It's all for the best.

582
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:07,876
You're going back where you belong.

583
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,177
I'm getting out of here.

584
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,178
It'll all be fine.

585
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:11,579
Trust me.

586
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,880
Trust me!

587
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,381
This sucks!

588
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:24,882
Why are they making us just sit here and wait.

589
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:30,383
So when wonder woman brings him in

590
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:33,184
it will prove the point we didn't because one of us was helping him.

591
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:35,985
Leaving us as good as dead, huh?

592
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:38,586
I never thought that I'd be rooting for Jarod.

593
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:41,587
I didn't mean that.

594
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,888
I didn't mean that!

595
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:47,489
Daddy!

596
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,990
Angel.

597
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,991
Oh, I came as soon as I found out.

598
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,092
How dare they put my daughter through a T-Board.

599
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:56,393
- Are you alright?
- For now.

600
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,394
You'll all be out of here after I lop off a few heads.

601
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:02,795
Daddy, be careful.

602
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:03,996
Right.

603
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:13,297
Boy, I never thought I'd be glad to see your old man.

604
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:16,498
Yeah, I'm glad he's here too, Broots.

605
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,599
Unfortunately, there's reason to believe he's been here the whole time.

606
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,500
I'm sorry, Parker.

607
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,201
He's done it again.

608
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:51,802
Mr. Argyle?

609
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:53,903
Bridget?

610
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:55,804
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you!

611
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,305
Get the case out of the trunk, Willie.

612
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,906
Yes. You've got something for me in the trunk, Willie?

613
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:06,907
I bring you respect in a bag.

614
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:16,008
Oh wow.

615
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:20,209
Ten thousand real ones.

616
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,110
Where's Jarod?

617
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,411
He's in the basement, in the boiler room. Hey!

618
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:25,112
Willie, when you see I've Jarod,

619
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:26,213
put a bullet in his brain,

620
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:27,314
if you can find it.

621
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:28,315
My pleasure.

622
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:29,716
What are you talking about ''bullet in my brain''?

623
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:30,617
That's not nice!

624
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:34,418
Hey, hey.

625
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:35,219
Damn!

626
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,320
Well, if it isn't sleeping beauty.

627
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,921
And they said you were so hard to catch.

628
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:58,622
Time to rise and shine.

629
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,523
Wake up, my little love muffin.

630
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,824
Come on, baby, wake Up!

631
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:14,125
Wake up.

632
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:19,526
Hi. Time to go home.

633
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,027
Sorry.

634
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:24,428
But I'm never going back there.

635
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:30,529
You're not so mean.

636
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,730
Nice to see you again, Willie.

637
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:20,831
Hi!

638
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:22,632
Your brass ring.

639
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,333
I knew you were the one to trust right from the start.

640
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,334
On second thought.

641
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,035
I think I'll donate it

642
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:31,236
to the pond.

643
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,737
In dog's name.

644
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,038
Like you said, he's the hero.

645
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:37,939
Give me back my pez.

646
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,740
Bridget?

647
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:52,141
Nope! Sorry! It's just Jarod.

648
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,042
But you can come and pick up your blonde now.

649
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:05,343
Sweet dreams, love.

650
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:17,644
She blew it, didn't she?

651
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:21,045
- Jarod?
- Alive, still free!

652
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:21,646
So are you.

653
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:23,547
Thanks for the robe.

654
00:40:25,748 --> 00:40:26,748
Give ne a lift?

655
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,949
To where, daddy? Another dead end.

656
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,950
- What are you talking about? 
- Don't you dare!

657
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,151
You set me up, for a T-Board?

658
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:41,552
I was wondering how long it would take you to figure that out.

659
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,653
Come on. You really don't think I could fool you.

660
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:46,754
You're a Parker.

661
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:48,255
I'd be stupid to even try.

662
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,656
Besides these damn shoes are killing me.

663
00:40:53,857 --> 00:40:57,457
If this is true, then why would you ally with Bridget?

664
00:40:58,658 --> 00:41:00,758
Bridget cut a deal with the Triumvirate.

665
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,759
Your butt for hers.

666
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,860
I had to go along with her to get rid of her for good.

667
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:06,461
Action, reaction.

668
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:07,562
Give and take.

669
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,063
It's not about who knows what

670
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:13,364
It's about who thinks they know what and what you want them to think.

671
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,865
- I...
- To keep the hungry dogs away

672
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,066
you must toss them a bone now and then.

673
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:21,767
Is that what I am? A bone?

674
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:25,768
You're my legacy and you proved it again today.

675
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:27,369
Never forget that.

676
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,470
It'll keep you alive.

677
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:30,471
Trust me.

678
00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:37,372
You should find something you can trust.

679
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:38,473
And you trust me.

680
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:39,674
Trust me.

681
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,275
How can you still trust him? Trust him?

682
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,876
Will you be alright, Miss Parker?

683
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:54,977
Of course.

684
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:57,878
Let's get out of here.

685
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,179
Let's go. Let's go.

686
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,380
Sydney, do you think that someone in the Centre is really helping Jarod?

687
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:07,781
In the Centre? Anything's possible.

688
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:29,082
We're still searching for him

689
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,983
and we'll find the leak.

690
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:39,884
Did you uncover something that can help us find Jarod, Angelo?

691
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:48,985
Keep working.

692
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:51,586
Keep working.

693
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:23,487
See you tomorrow, same bat time same bat channel.

694
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:31,788
You remember me?

695
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:35,489
You don't learn so easy, do you, pal?

696
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,490
Maybe not.

697
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,391
But I never make the same mistake twice.

698
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:45,592
Who the hell are you?

699
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,093
I'm many people.

700
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:52,594
But tonight I'm a truck driver.

701
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:04,595
''Amnesia''
