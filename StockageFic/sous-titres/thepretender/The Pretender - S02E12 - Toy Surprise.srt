1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:02,497
Previously on the Pretender:

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:04,341
I have been thinking a lot about my mom lately.

3
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:06,375
Me too. Everyday.

4
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,415
I'm not like everyone else around here,

5
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,614
I am not afraid of your father.

6
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:12,495
Things haven't been the same since they arrived here.

7
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:14,452
You put a gun on me, no big deal.

8
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:17,423
Cos I know you don't have the rocks to pull the trigger.

9
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,651
You are going to shoot me?

10
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,896
Cafeteria closed?

11
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,197
Ah, Miss Parker.

12
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:47,498
Everyone's supposed to leave the Centre for today's fire security test.

13
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:51,180
Then why are you playing with matches?

14
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,213
I don't follow.

15
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,817
Hayes, if you're going to work for me,

16
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,234
you need to understand three things.

17
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:01,738
First, keep the tie straight.

18
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,239
Second,

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,540
get a new tie.

20
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:08,062
And the third?

21
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:10,897
Candy's for the clients.

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,653
- What?
- Ah, there you are sweetheart.

23
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:29,898
Daddy.

24
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:33,655
- Is that you?
- Well, unless you've got another father somewhere I don't know about.

25
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:35,291
Listen, I tried you at the house.

26
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,292
What are you doing at the Centre on a Sunday, especially this Sunday.

27
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,679
A false alarm on Jarod. Where are you?

28
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,280
About to get on a Centre helicopter.

29
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,281
I'll be at Blue Cove tonight.

30
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:45,852
But your vacation?

31
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,414
I didn't feel like laying around on a beach.

32
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,500
I couldn't forget what day this is.

33
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,821
I've been thinking a lot about your mother.

34
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,378
- You have?
- Surprised?

35
00:01:56,643 --> 00:02:03,261
Um, ah, It's just that you've never called me like this on this day, I mean.

36
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,460
Well, when you get to where I am in life regrets start to eat you up.

37
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:12,977
There are lots of things that I've been meaning to say to you and to her for a long time.

38
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:17,457
I'm here, daddy, for you.

39
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,099
Ah, be there at seven, will you?

40
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,336
I was just leaving for the cemetery

41
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:26,637
but we could go and see mum together?

42
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:30,159
Yeah. For once there'll just, just three of us.

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,060
Wait for me.

44
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,198
I'll be at home. Daddy...

45
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:14,199
Mum, No... Mum, no.

46
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,134
I miss you, mum.

47
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:27,019
The anniversary of a parent's death can be a heavy cross to bear,

48
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:28,222
especially alone.

49
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:31,523
If you would like company at the cemetery?

50
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,882
Thanks but I won't be bearing a cross alone this year.

51
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:36,814
Your father?

52
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,061
I have visited my mother's grave every year

53
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,662
on the anniversary of her death

54
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:50,463
but my father would never talk about it.

55
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:57,013
Why is it people wait until the end of their lives before...

56
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,858
they...face regrets?

57
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:05,619
Regret is born of a parried emotion.

58
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:08,374
But your mother's death is a wound,

59
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:12,492
a wound that not even the Parkers can ignore forever.

60
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:17,014
You've never seen him grieve, have you?

61
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:20,182
Until you do,

62
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:23,296
until you can share your grief with him,

63
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,414
you will never heal.

64
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,080
Daughter...sad.

65
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,598
Well, well, well.

66
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:50,017
Look what the cat dragged in.

67
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:51,777
Stealing office supplies?

68
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,331
Reviewing your past attempts to catch Jarod.

69
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:56,776
Not pretty.

70
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,095
Splash a little colour on, love.

71
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:01,296
So depressing.

72
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:10,416
- Daddy?
- Have you spoken to your father today?

73
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:11,974
What the hell do you want?

74
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,075
I want to help you.

75
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:16,094
- Where are you now?
- I'm leaving Blue Cove.

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,895
- What is it Jarod?
- Turn around and get back to the Centre as fast as you can.

77
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,052
Why?

78
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,661
Someone is going to kill your father.

79
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,862
There are pretenders among us

80
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:31,971
I was taken from my family.

81
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:35,893
Thirty-Six Hours, he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others.

82
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,181
How many people died because of what I thought up?

83
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:42,261
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

84
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,476
He is a pretender.

85
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,222
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

86
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,820
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

87
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:51,942
He defends the weak and the abused.

88
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,372
Life is a gift.

89
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:56,373
THE PRETENDER
Season 2
Episode 12
Toy Surprise

90
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,374
YTET PRESENTS

91
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,375
DICTATION: ±¿±¿/´Ð´Ð

92
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,497
You are a doctor?

93
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,693
I am, today.

94
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,097
Someone has ordered your father's assassination.

95
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:19,055
My source says there's a file in the Centre's mainframe tagged ''Arkham''.

96
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,295
Apparently it explains everything.

97
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,592
Jarod, this is the wrong day for games.

98
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:25,693
I know what today is Miss Parker.

99
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:27,635
The Centre took your mother away from you

100
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,802
just like they took me away from mine.

101
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:32,598
Don't let them finish the job by killing your father.

102
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:36,342
My father kept you in the Centre your entire life, Jarod.

103
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:37,843
Why would you want to help him?

104
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,012
Because if he dies

105
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:40,816
my answers die with him.

106
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:42,675
And so do yours.

107
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,581
Jarod, I don't know about this.

108
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:00,980
Mr Compty, I've spoken with Chris's former counsellors.

109
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:04,335
We all agree. He's ready for this climb both physically and mentally.

110
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,695
I want to believe that hiking and mountain climbing are going to help

111
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:10,213
but ever since Chris's accident last year

112
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,955
we've tried therapists, retreats, vacations, everything.

113
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,156
I just want the old Chris back.

114
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:21,692
That's why I'm here.

115
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:25,416
He's just lost his best friend.

116
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,617
It takes time to heal from that kind of pain.

117
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:30,455
You spoke like a man who's experienced some loss himself.

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,614
I'm not giving up on your son without a fight.

119
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,337
Chris. Jarod Crockett.

120
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,032
We've got a tough trail ahead of us

121
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,233
if we're going to beat the others back to the base camp.

122
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:49,695
Are you ready to climb this monster?

123
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,418
I'm ready to go home.

124
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:08,101
The truth is I'd rather be home.

125
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,402
I'm missing my daughter's dance class.

126
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:13,457
The Arkham files, Broots. Focus.

127
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,294
It would a lot of easier to find if I could use my workstation.

128
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,795
I don't know why we can't use the tech room.

129
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,696
Because the tech room is the first place they would look.

130
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:20,072
Who? There's nobody here.

131
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,878
People trying to kill my father.

132
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,879
What?

133
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:31,418
- Oh God, I'm sorry.
- Now, you know what this is about.

134
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:35,174
Ok. Arkham.

135
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,977
- Have you been able to reach your father?
- His phone's dead.

136
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,254
So's the radio on the chopper.

137
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,580
He lands on the Tower's helipad in four hours.

138
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,261
Sydney when he called,

139
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,562
he...was reaching out to me.

140
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:56,177
Be careful, Parker.

141
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,014
He's disappointed you before.

142
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:04,302
Sydney, you were there the day that my mother was killed.

143
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,053
Did you ever see him...

144
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,454
Grieve over her?

145
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,092
Tell me.

146
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,733
Moments after she died, your father told me never to speak about it.

147
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,742
not to you, Jarod, anyone.

148
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,102
He ordered me back to work as if nothing had happened

149
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,538
Then...

150
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,738
What?

151
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:40,022
Then he said, life goes on.

152
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,055
Daughter sad.

153
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,755
Everyone sad.

154
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,258
Daughter sad.

155
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,221
This compass isn't working right.

156
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,182
I think we're lost.

157
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:40,262
I think you're right.

158
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,335
Whatever, it's not my fault.

159
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:48,702
You have to report positions to me.

160
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:55,101
We're a team out here. We have to communicate.

161
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:58,493
You guides are all the same.

162
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,694
Always trying to bug me out.

163
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,213
Bug you out?

164
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,902
Yeah, get me to communicate.

165
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,175
You want me to talk about stuff.

166
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,142
Back off. I don't need your help.

167
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:11,461
You don't have to go through this alone.

168
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:15,898
Just climb, ok?

169
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:20,660
Well, that might be easier than you think.

170
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,941
''Jeep is dead, I have gone ahead to station.''

171
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,217
You thinking what I'm thinking?

172
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,218
What?

173
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:50,979
Short cut.

174
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:52,453
We get this thing working.

175
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:54,054
We take the fire trail out of here

176
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,055
and we beat everybody to the cliff face.

177
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:56,773
I do not know.

178
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:58,777
Come on. We'll get done faster.

179
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,413
It'll be our little secret.

180
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,934
You're good with secrets, aren't you, Chris?

181
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,793
I got it! I got Arkham.

182
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:16,418
Arkham?

183
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,018
What are you doing here?

184
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,782
I live here.

185
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:24,372
You wheeze, I'll shoot you.

186
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:25,773
Ah, Miss parker?

187
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,276
- We've a little problem here.
- Open the file, Broots.

188
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,577
Ah, I can't. The files' like a doorbell on it

189
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,678
- and if I open it, a warning's going to be sent...
- Then whoever is behind this will know that we're here.

190
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,093
Ding dong. He already does. Do it!

191
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,438
Ah, it's encrypting.

192
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:42,698
It's turning into gibberish.

193
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,099
Did you see what it said?

194
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,781
Ah, neutralisation, ah, nineteen hundred hours...

195
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:47,979
Seven PM.

196
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:52,156
That's the exact time your father is due to land on the Tower helipad.

197
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:55,973
So it's true. They're going to murder my father.

198
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,413
I have no knowledge of this.

199
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,694
You son of a bitch.

200
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:15,959
I'd say we're all in the dark on this one, Miss Parker.

201
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:25,780
No computers. No phones. No power.

202
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,214
Doors are electronically sealed.

203
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:30,892
Sub-level lock down.

204
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:34,414
Designed to keep the Centre intact during a nuclear event.

205
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:36,901
Or a palace coup against my father.

206
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:39,002
Override the lock down.

207
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,138
lmpossible.

208
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:47,279
- If you think I'm going to sit here like one of your caged lab rats...
- I'm trapped too, Miss Parker.

209
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,179
My oxygen tank is almost empty.

210
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,980
Would I do that to myself?

211
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:56,373
Whoever is trying to kill your father now knows you're here.

212
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,893
And they'll come for you too.

213
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,496
Raines has a point.

214
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,256
Now, is it possible that the lock down has something to do with the fire security test?

215
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,901
There is no test you moron.

216
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,202
They wanted to clear the Centre.

217
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:14,103
Now I'm laying odds that Nosferatu has a sniper on the helipad.

218
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,578
I don't believe Raines had anything to do with this.

219
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,615
Wake up and smell the oxygen Syd.

220
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:20,655
He's behind everything.

221
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:22,856
Can you unlock the Arkham files?

222
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:25,583
Well, I...I've got them on disk. It will take a couple of hours, give or take.

223
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,302
I've got less than two and my father's dead, do you understand?

224
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,641
Easy Parker.

225
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:32,379
Broots is doing the best he can.

226
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,175
Could it be that the elevators have a back up power system?

227
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:40,819
Oh, Hayes.

228
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,571
- Who?
- My new sweaper.

229
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,222
Ah, I left him voice-mail after I called you two.

230
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:47,923
Now, his orders are to find me in the sim lab

231
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:50,124
if he hasn't heard from me within the hour.

232
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:53,019
Well, that's now. We're in the clear.

233
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:55,100
That's if he got the message.

234
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:59,078
Parker family motto. Never depend on anyone but yourself.

235
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,633
Give me the sim lab. This is Hayes.

236
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,334
Hello? Hello?

237
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,496
I'm unable to contact the Centre sir.

238
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,318
Keep trying.

239
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:39,498
Try it now.

240
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,822
Nah. We've got to push start it.

241
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:50,139
I'm going to pop the clutch. You give me a good push.

242
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,732
Think you've got it in you?

243
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:53,578
Yeah, whatever.

244
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:55,813
Ready?

245
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:05,942
- Jarod?
- My brakes!

246
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,043
Jarod.

247
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:14,544
Jarod.

248
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,045
Jarod.

249
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:34,246
Jarod.

250
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,447
Jarod. Jarod.

251
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,152
The Centre's original boiler system extends through every sub-level

252
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,174
right up to the lobby.

253
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:53,714
Damn!

254
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:58,115
Tragically ironic that all this is happening on the anniversary of your mother's suicide.

255
00:16:58,343 --> 00:16:59,137
Murder.

256
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,615
And don't talk about her.

257
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:14,412
Please. Help me out of here.

258
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,815
I'll help you out of there.

259
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:26,316
Miss Parker.

260
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:28,653
Are you okay?

261
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,456
Why wouldn't I be?

262
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,458
I just haven't seen you in awhile, since...

263
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,455
since what happened to your mother.

264
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,761
She killed herself, Jarod.

265
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,762
She was sick.

266
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:53,738
What's his name?

267
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,179
They call him Angelo.

268
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:56,982
Sydney says he's special,

269
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,283
but I can't get through to him.

270
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:03,211
Maybe I can.

271
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,256
Cracker Jack?

272
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,976
You've never had them?

273
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,102
The snack with a toy surprise.

274
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,141
Why would someone want a surprise in their food?

275
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:24,092
Surprise.

276
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,096
You did it?

277
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:47,597
What about the elevator?

278
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,236
Oh, I've found some tools.

279
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:53,414
And look. These. Walkie talkies.

280
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:56,018
My father lands in ninety minutes. What about the Arkham file?

281
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,896
It'll take three hours at least.

282
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,340
Sounds like he's got even less.

283
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:05,537
I'd better stay with him. His pulse is bad.

284
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,436
Alright, if you don't hear from us in twenty minutes,

285
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:14,817
I want you to forget Mr Clean and get out.

286
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:18,335
You're my failsafe, Syd, in case we get nailed.

287
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:21,183
Wait. What do you mean nailed?

288
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:33,620
Back Broots.

289
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:35,978
Stay here.

290
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:42,659
Stop or you're dead!

291
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,660
Miss Parker.

292
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:09,971
Breathe now.

293
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,893
- Who? Who?
- Sweepers.

294
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,582
But I don't know either one.

295
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,218
Come on, Let's go.

296
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,119
Jarod? Jarod.

297
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,615
- What happened?
- You flipped the jeep.

298
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:30,781
- Is that hurt?
- Only when I blink.

299
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,616
I gotta get you out of here.

300
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,901
I think I broke my leg.

301
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,896
Chris, you have to go get help.

302
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:43,293
They're going to send a search.

303
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:45,394
I mean, when we don't show up, they're going to come looking for us.

304
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:48,114
Chris I could be bleeding internally. You have to go get help.

305
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:51,337
Just...just climb over that cliff.

306
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:52,560
There should be a road.

307
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,961
You can do it.

308
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,653
I cannot! I cannot!

309
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,851
Sydney, we're at the elevator.

310
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:33,772
What?

311
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,133
Oh. It's a bullet hole.

312
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,453
They haven't fixed that after all these years?

313
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:47,439
It's the Centre.

314
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,740
They're always trying to send a message.

315
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:03,039
Chris, you have to go get help.

316
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,540
God, Oh, my god.

317
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,582
Listen to me! You have to go get help.

318
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,137
No, I can't. No! I can't do that.

319
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:10,651
Yes. You can.

320
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,301
This is about your car accident, isn't it?

321
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:16,740
It's about how your best friend died.

322
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,016
You listen to me.

323
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,379
Accidents happen. People die.

324
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:23,654
- That is no secret.
- Why do you keep saying that?

325
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,898
Because I can help you, if you let me.

326
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:28,138
Let me help you.

327
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,735
Nick wanted to go for a shortcut that night.

328
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:35,199
He was going too fast.

329
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,800
We spun out and we hit a tree and jammed the steering wheel into him.

330
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:40,579
What happened?

331
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:44,656
And then the cops got there and his car was on fire

332
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:47,093
and I was outside and Nick was still inside.

333
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:50,940
Nick died instantly. You can't blame yourself for that.

334
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:56,373
That's what I'm trying to tell you. He didn't. I let him die.

335
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:57,898
I let him die.

336
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,776
You'll enjoy this.

337
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,021
I had one of those...

338
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:09,632
parental wakeup calls at breakfast,

339
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:12,772
you know, time sure flies.

340
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:16,620
My little Debbie tells me she knows what she wants to do in life.

341
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:19,336
She's ten.

342
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:23,143
Anyway, she says...

343
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,715
You ever think of getting out of here, Broots?

344
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:27,816
Excuse me?

345
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:30,099
The Centre. Leaving.

346
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:35,635
Taking Debbie and just going somewhere...else.

347
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:37,436
Yeah!

348
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,358
Actually lots of times.

349
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,259
Do it.

350
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:43,617
Don't worry about what other people think.

351
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:49,901
Don't buy into the false security of staying put.

352
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,894
If you think that's what you need to do, then do it.

353
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,542
Do it for Debbie.

354
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:00,382
and do it now

355
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:04,092
because the next elevator you get on...

356
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,141
I...I never knew your mother, Miss Parker

357
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:19,141
but I bet the choices she made

358
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,142
had everything to do with her little girl.

359
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:34,934
So what does Debbie want to do with her life?

360
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:38,815
She says she wants to be just like you.

361
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,852
Here we go. We're going to the lobby.

362
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:56,898
Wait for me.

363
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:09,494
Love.

364
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,333
I'm getting real sick of you.

365
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:20,053
You should not have searched the mainframe.

366
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,219
And where exactly are Broots and Sydney?

367
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,698
I thought Stooges travelled in threes.

368
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,212
By the way,

369
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,733
fire drills are for pyros and grade schoolers.

370
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,854
Can't blame a girl for trying.

371
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:35,977
If you were at the cemetery,

372
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:39,121
crying your little eyes out like you were supposed to be

373
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:41,873
you wouldn't be in this tricky little mess, now would you?

374
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,737
Don't you think it's time to turn off the faucet.

375
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,138
How appropriate for you to die in this elevator.

376
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:55,061
Just like mummy.

377
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:58,979
If there is one place that I'm not dying, it's here.

378
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,237
Miss Parker, you've been shot.

379
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:46,521
It's like a flesh wound. It must have been a ricochet.

380
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,614
Yeah, off my arm.

381
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,515
- You're bleeding pretty badly, Miss Parker.
- It is nothing.

382
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,099
No. Sit down.

383
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:55,171
Where the hell are we?

384
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,579
We are at SL-26.

385
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,580
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:05,533
Nice shot!

387
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,172
I hear something.

388
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,574
Wait! Wait! You're not going out there.

389
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:18,819
Here.

390
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,499
I want to kill her, not screw her.

391
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:23,262
Can you think of anything better?

392
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:27,933
I got your back.

393
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,338
Now I feel better.

394
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:36,892
Bet you never thought you'd get buried with a coward?

395
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:39,295
Is that what you are, Chris?

396
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:42,741
Is that what Nick would think of you?

397
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,016
What happened that night?

398
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,375
We were inside of the car.

399
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,215
I was upside down when I came to.

400
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:55,571
I looked over, Nick was stuck under the steering wheel.

401
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,616
There was blood everywhere.

402
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,260
He's looking over at me.

403
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,582
His eyes all scared.

404
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,334
They're begging me to help him.

405
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,259
And then the fire started coming in

406
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:15,692
the smoke.

407
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,575
I just sat there frozen.

408
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:22,614
I can still see his eyes.

409
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:26,858
What did you do?

410
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:35,660
I slid out of the car.

411
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,501
And I crawled away.

412
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:44,094
Then the flames grew bigger.

413
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:47,773
I could hear his voice calling me from the fire.

414
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:55,021
I should've burned, Jarod.

415
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:58,735
I should have died.

416
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:03,943
Nick was pinned inside that car. You couldn't have saved him if you wanted to.

417
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,262
Because I ran away.

418
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,738
If you had stayed in that car, you would have died.

419
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:10,213
Your response was human.

420
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,936
I ran away!

421
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:15,619
I know what loss is like.

422
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:20,701
I watched my brother die in a car accident.

423
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:23,238
Not a day goes by that I don't blame myself

424
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,639
that I don't think of something that I could've done.

425
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,696
As time went by

426
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:34,938
he forgave me.

427
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:39,302
I hear his voice inside of me.

428
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,792
Just like you hear Nick's.

429
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,574
What would he want you to do now?

430
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:04,299
Wait, Miss Parker. Careful. Did you hear that sound?

431
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:09,500
Oh! I'm officially in hell.

432
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,001
Give me that walkie.

433
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:12,202
Angelo.

434
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,662
Broots, how's the Arkham file coming?

435
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:22,818
- Two hours.
- Great.

436
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:24,736
My father lands in one.

437
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,342
You gotta get me back to the lobby, Broots.

438
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:33,258
Tasty.

439
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:43,458
Tasty.

440
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:47,340
Daughter

441
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:49,892
sad.

442
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:56,851
You miss your mother, don't you?

443
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:00,261
She used to give me these.

444
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:03,058
It's just me and my daddy now.

445
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:04,652
But he's always working.

446
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:08,578
My mum and I used to talk about things.

447
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,656
She would brush my hair

448
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:13,173
or we'd read together.

449
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,572
My mum's gone too.

450
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,336
I talk to her though.

451
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,101
Her voice is inside of me

452
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,294
just like your mother's is inside of you.

453
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,254
Mum. They're trying to hurt mum.

454
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:36,775
Daddy. Trying to hurt Daddy.

455
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:38,492
Daughter sad.

456
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:44,817
Wait! What are you...

457
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:45,854
Don't touch that.

458
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,538
He's speeding it up.

459
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:56,032
- Golden Hawk down.
- What?

460
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:59,501
There's no sniper. She's sabotaged the helicopter.

461
00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:03,137
Golden Hawk down.

462
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,738
It's a distance sensitive triggering device.

463
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:18,820
- A what?
- A triggering device.

464
00:32:20,423 --> 00:32:23,092
As soon as the helicopter gets within a hundred feet of the tower

465
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:25,701
an explosive device goes off.

466
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:28,816
The helicopter loses control and crashes.

467
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:30,895
But it looks like an accident.

468
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,138
Exactly.

469
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,502
Toy surprise.

470
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,095
I told you I don't want any!

471
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,258
Ah. Surprise.

472
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,179
It is a DSA.

473
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,097
And it's dated the day of my mother's death.

474
00:32:59,383 --> 00:33:00,080
Where is Jarod?

475
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,481
He's been taken to his space, Mr Parker.

476
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:05,182
What happened to Catherine?

477
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:10,453
My wife was very sick.

478
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:14,373
Troubled, yes.

479
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:16,937
But suicide?

480
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:20,557
You'll never discuss this incident with anyone.

481
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,498
Ever.

482
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,192
Not with Jarod

483
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:27,093
and especially not with my daughter.

484
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,339
Go home, now!

485
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:34,333
I want you back in this laboratory tomorrow,

486
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:35,977
ready to work.

487
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:38,495
Life goes on, Sydney.

488
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,461
Life goes on.

489
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,175
Daddy sad.

490
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:17,215
Must save Daddy.

491
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:21,499
Let's finish this.

492
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:24,574
The boiler hatch should be right over there.

493
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,652
Parker, where are you?

494
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,738
We're at SL-26 heading for the boiler.

495
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:32,901
You've got to hurry, your father lands in less than thirty minutes.

496
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,361
Tell me something I don't know.

497
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:37,041
Miss Parker! Up there!

498
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,842
The boiler goes all the way up to the lobby.

499
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,542
Let's hope I'm not too late.

500
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,182
Everything's in place.

501
00:34:46,703 --> 00:34:49,417
Thirty minutes until Centre airspace and the triggering point.

502
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:03,892
You ready?

503
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,019
Yeah I think I am.

504
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,620
Jarod.

505
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,142
Hurry back.

506
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:28,218
- Maybe I should go with you?
- No, I can move faster alone.

507
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,254
Wow. Twenty-six floors in fifteen minutes.

508
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:36,692
Are you sure you're ok to do this?

509
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:48,793
- Do you remember the code to the power bunker?
- I've got it, Broots.

510
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:51,619
Good luck.

511
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,820
Yes.

512
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:37,742
Syd, I'm in the lobby. Hayes is dead.

513
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,251
Raines isn't far behind.

514
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:41,738
I'm plugging him into the Centre's oxygen system.

515
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,172
Get the power on.

516
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,612
- Put the walkie to his ear.
- We don't have time, Parker.

517
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:55,460
Do it!

518
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,657
Are you trying to kill my father?

519
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:01,498
No.

520
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:03,292
Who is?

521
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:08,091
The same people who killed your mother.

522
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:09,379
Who?

523
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,452
He's blacking out!

524
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,973
Miss Parker, you have got five minutes.

525
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:54,233
The Centre's in sight. It'll be good to be home.

526
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:06,893
Hello, love!

527
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:08,741
You don't give up, do you?

528
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,253
Drop the accent. Nobody's buying it any more.

529
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,082
Fine with me bitch. Too much damn work anyway.

530
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,081
That's the problem with you Parkers.

531
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:25,782
You never finish what you started.

532
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,256
You look finished to me.

533
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:48,698
You okay?

534
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:51,898
Yeah! Nick would be proud.

535
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:53,738
I know, he told me.

536
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:56,573
Thank you.

537
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,461
Son, your dad's waiting for you.

538
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:04,962
Bye.

539

00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,219
Sorry for the false alarm but it was for a good cause.

541
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,618
But your leg is broken.

542
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:32,175
I eat a lot of ice cream. Calcium.

543
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:33,658
It's good for you.

544
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,020
Bridget will be dealt with.

545
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:11,021
I want you to know.

546
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,454
Let's not talk about that now.

547
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:19,817
God, It's...it's beautiful here.

548
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:25,617
You've never been back?

549
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:28,342
Not since the burial.

550
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:30,455
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

551
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:41,457
From now on, every year we come here, together.

552
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:44,915
There are things I've wanted to say...

553
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,062
You don't have to say anything Daddy.

554
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,734
It's just good to have you back.

555
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:55,019
Are you ok?

556
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,298
Life goes on.

557
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:15,298
- Parker.
- I'm glad your father is alright.

558
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,382
Thank you,Jarod.

559
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:19,062
You miss her?

560
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:22,618
Yes.

561
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:24,695
She misses you too.

562
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,221
How can you be so sure?

563
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:28,936
Read the card.

564
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,973
''Her voice is inside you.''

565
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:05,017
