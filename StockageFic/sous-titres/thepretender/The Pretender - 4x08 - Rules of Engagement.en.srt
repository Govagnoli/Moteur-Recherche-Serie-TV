00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,683
It's painful, but it's
not life-threatening.

167
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,481
- Apparently, his sons had a different opinion.
- Maybe I should have kept...

168
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,545
Mr. Larsen one more night
to ease their minds.

169
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,887
Does this figure mean
anything to you, Doctor?

170
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,725
$41,342.17?

171
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,390
- Not in particular. What is it?
- [Sighs] That's a good question.

172
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,093
Agent Jackson,
there are patients in there...

173
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,331
who will die in the next few hours
if left untreated.

174
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,066
[Sighs]
Excuse me.

175
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,074
Sarah, my name is Jarod.

176
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,275
- The man with the telephone.
- I'm with the F.B.I.

177
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,253
I think it's safe to say that neither one of us
woke up this morning expecting to be here.

178
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,290
- [Sighs]
- I realize that you're going through...

179
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,191
a very difficult time right now.

180
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,888
But I have to understand:
Why are your brothers doing this?

181
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,091
Look, I want to end this thing
without anybody getting hurt.

182
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,033
But the truth is, I can only hold
those men off for so long.

183
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,401
Move over there.
Get that door.

184
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:46,243
Everything was always
pretty crazy in our family.

185
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,305
But things seemed to really
come undone after Mom died.

186
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,318
- Especially for Cam.
- Your mom was here, at this hospital.

187
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,321
Same room where Daddy is.

188
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,358
[Sighs] She was so sick
when they sent her home...

189
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,088
and... she died a few days later.

190
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,653
And now your father's here.

191
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,529
Look, my brothers may be
doing the wrong thing...

192
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,967
but they must be doing it
for the right reason-

193
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,438
and I am not gonna help you
kill them for it.

194
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,513
Agent Jackson.
Got the equipment you wanted.

195
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,040
All right. Let's see
what's going on in there.

197

- What are we gonna do, Cam?
- I'm thinking!

198
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,868
[Softly]
I'm thinking.

199
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,884
[Billy] I hope you know
what you're doin', big brother.

200
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,438
- I don't get it.
- Sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall.

201
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,983
Or in this case, the airvent.

202
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,098
Grab those blueprints.

203
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,379
This will give us a better sense of the space
where the hostages are being held...

204
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,008
windows, exits-

205
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,914
[Deputy]
I'll be damned.

206
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,409
I could use this to get a clean shot. I have
men on the roof, next to the seized wing.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,244
Isn't it your job to consider
everybody's safety?

208
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,808
My job is to save the lives
of those civilians inside!

209
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,447
If I hesitate, and one innocent person
dies, it's my fault.

210
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,918
I won't make that mistake.

211
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,993
The sheriff seems a little on edge.

212
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,631
[Deputy]
He has his reasons.

213
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,335
[Jake] Cam! What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

214
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,174
- [Cam] I know what I'm doin', Pop.
- You wouldn't be here...

215
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,646
if your mama was still alive.

216
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,621
Well, she's not, and I am.
Stop talkin'.

218
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,620
Man, there are guns and badges
all over the place down there.

219
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,460
[Sighs] Well, what the hell did
you think was gonna happen?

220
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,796
Come in here with guns, they'd leave 
a parking ticket on our car?

221
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,637
Just keep lookout.

222
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,707
Sheriff says,
kill the air and the lights.

223
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,705

- Cam. This is Agent Jackson.

Turn the lights and air back on!

229
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,503
All right, I'll give you what you want,
and you give me a couple of hostages.

230
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,371
- Why should I trust you?
- You have my word.

231
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,004
No harm will come to you or your brother, 
as long as we keep talking.

232
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,749
It's going to get really warm in there.
Now, do we have a deal?

233
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,685
Cam. You can trust me.

234
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,489
- Cam? Talk to me.

[Gunshots Continue]

238
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,874
I had Cam's trust until
your sniper got trigger-happy.

239
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,943
Hey! Cam Larsen isn't
a man who can be trusted.

240
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,956
He incited a riot while he was in prison.
Did you know that?

241
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:03,289
The guards were beating the prisoners, and
they were convicted on brutality charges.

242
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,294
Did you know that?

243
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:08,422
I got Cam on the line.

244
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,296
- Cam.
- Are you guys crazy?

245
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,360
I had nothing to do with that
shooting, I swear to you.

246
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:17,271
Look, i-it's important that I come 
in there and speak to you face-to-face.

247
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:19,468
I'm not here to talk!
I'm here to save my dad's life.

248
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:23,274
Understand? It's too hot in here.
Turn on the air, now.

249
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,976
Yes. Yes, I will turn the air conditioning
back on, I promise.

250
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,918
- Now, can I come in there?

251
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:33,184
Okay. But just you.
Unarmed. Ten minutes.

- All right. Ten minutes.
- [Line Clicks]

- Those are Cam's kids.
- I had them brought in.

- To get into his heart.

- What?

256
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:17,697
- Where are you?
- Never mind. Did you find Jarod?

257
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,793
I was scanning police chatter
in Fletcher Ridge...

258
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,862
and I came across a hostage negotiation
situation there at a hospital.

259
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,272
- F.B.I. involvement.
- And?

260
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,276
It sounded like something
that Jarod would be drawn to...

261
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,006
- so I-I contacted the Chicago office 
of the F.B.I.-
- Let me guess.

262
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,311
- No F.B.I. involvement.
- If there were any agents on the job there...

263
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:38,617
they would have come from the Chicago
office, and they hadn't sent anybody.

264
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:42,022
[Groans] He never left town. Get the jet
ready, and I'll be back as soon as I can.

271
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:16,016
Last night, Daddy was
yelling at Billy and Sarah.

272
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:20,826
- He was angry?
- He said the hospital was gonna
send Grandpa Jake home to die.

273
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:24,163
Just like they did Grandma.
He said they were murderers.

has been removed from the line.

- What are you talkin' about?
- Jake Larsen has sky-high levels
of creatine kinase enzyme...

485
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:56,771
- in his blood.
- So?

486
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,673
- His fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen.
- I still don't follow.

487
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,371
He has heart disease.
He's headed for a massive heart attack.

488
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:06,244
His only chance of survival
is heart bypass surgery.

489
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:09,580
The same surgery
this hospital denied him. [Sighs]

490
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,915
- Who the hell are you?
- Excuse me?

491
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:19,087
I called the F.B.I. Nobody's ever heard
of an Agent Jarod Jackson.

492
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:22,996
Well, it's a big agency.
Maybe you talked to the wrong person.

493
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,933
If any of those people in there die,
it's on your head.

494
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:28,903
You understand what that means, to have
somebody's blood on your hands?

495
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:32,873
As a matter of fact, I do.
And so do you.

496
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:37,743
Your deputy told me about that hostage
situation a year ago at the grocery store.

497
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:39,941
The way you lured that
perpetrator into the doorway...

498
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:43,543
and hesitated to take the kill shot.

499
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:48,922
Did he tell you how that same
hostage-taker took his gun...

500
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,186
and shot to death
a 15-year-old stock boy?

501
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,754
Did he describe the sick feeling 
I get every time I see 
that boy's parents on the street?

502
00:33:55,832 --> 00:34:00,860
- You did what you thought
was the right thing to do.
- And an innocent boy...

503
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:03,872
lost his life.

504
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,706
That's the blood I have on my hands...

505

Certainly has been
a long day, hasn't it?

508
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,911
- Agent Jackson.
- I was wondering if you and I
could have a little talk.

509
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:50,418
Oh, well, the truth is,
I'm late for a meeting. Perhaps later.

510
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:53,922
I know about the cover-up concerning
Jake Larsen's coronary disease.

511
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,790
But what could an H.M.O. possibly
have to gain by such a cover-up?

512
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,796
I saw you and Dr. Franklin arguing in
the parking lot. I know what's going on.

513
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:04,526
We could talk about it here in private,
or we could go downtown...

514
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,034
and talk under the glare
of the television cameras.

515
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,469
It's up to you.

516
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:13,671
Is it just for the money?

517
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:16,439
Or is it something more personal?

518
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,707
I see the way you and
Dr. Franklin are together.

519
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:27,452
My girlfriends and I...

520
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:30,788
used to dream about meeting a doctor.

521
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,124
Falling in love,
and living happily ever after.

522
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:37,656
I actually believed that's the way
it would be for Stephen and me.

523

Your signature is on the release forms
for all the patients in question.

524
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,638
I made my decisions based on
Franklin's recommendations.

525
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:48,734
I looked the other way in one case,
next thing I knew, I was-

526
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:53,007
All for money.

527
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:57,644
Franklin was getting kickbacks from
the H.M.O.'s for not doing expensive surgeries.

528
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,917
By denying certain procedures
to critically ill patients...

529
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,857
he saves the H.M.O.
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

530
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:06,952
- And makes a nice percentage.
- I swear to you...

531
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:10,226
I didn't know about Jake Larsen
until his sons took over the hospital.

532
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:13,564
Franklin said that you questioned him,
and he threatened to expose me...

533
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:17,163
if I said anything, and-
I was afraid.

534
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,233
Not half as afraid as those patients
who were sent home to die.

535
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:36,889

- It's ancient history.

were coming down the hallway-

it really increases the effects of the drug.

- [Gasping] Why?
- Because of what you did to Jake Larsen.
