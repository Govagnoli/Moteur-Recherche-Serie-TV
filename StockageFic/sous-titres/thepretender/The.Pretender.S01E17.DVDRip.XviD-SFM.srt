You gonna kill me?

- Thank you.

514
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:11,212
I should've done that sooner.

- Jarod.

it's gonna make you feel a whole lot better.

He's a maniac. A maniac!

523
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:22,686
He tried to teach me a lesson. He thinks
he's some kind of one-man judge and jury!

524

- Where is he?
- That way. By the front desk.

No more surveillance.

No lie detectors.
No more games.

539

I think I know who killed my mother, but right
now I'm more concerned with why she died.
