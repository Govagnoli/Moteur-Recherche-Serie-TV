1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,371
[Broots] Jarod sent these. 
From what I can tell,
all taken within the last few weeks.

2
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,706
There's Portland, Houston, Lexington.

3
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,214
- Someone's been tracking us?
- Not us-

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:18,079
You. Look.

5
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:24,583
Feels like the hunter's
becoming the hunted.

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,820
[Ringing]

7
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,794
- What?
- Someone has eyes for you.

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,356
The question is, who?

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,597
[Jarod]
Sometimes the answer is the question.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,138
Don't get Kwai Chang on me, Jarod.

11
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,505
Ooh, I love that guy, 
wandering the earth, helping people.

12
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,909
Like I'm trying to help you
and your father.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,914
My father? Jarod.

14
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,712
[Dial Tone]

15
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,986
- What did he mean, help your father?
- Damn it.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,048
What is it, Parker?

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,059
My father is still in hiding...

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,925
but I received a cryptic e-mail
from him this morning.

19
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,069
Daddy told me not to trust anyone.

20
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,572
There's a Centre contract
out on my father.

21
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,080
Well, then why-why did he follow you?

22
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,789
They probably think I'll eventually
lead them to the real target.

23
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,163
- [Barking]
- [Chattering]

24
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,564
Don't anybody touch my cards,
or it'll get ugly!

25
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,966
Yeah, huh.

26
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,971
- And Harry cheats.
- Yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,166
[Barking Continues]

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,200
Damn raccoons.

33
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,392
I got something for
your garbage-eatin' little ass.

- [Barking, Whining]
- [Screaming]

35
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,175
The fish is swimming along happily
in its natural environment.

36
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,976
You drop the hook in, 
you yank it out, you catch him.

37
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,245
- And then after all that, you release him?
- It's really not that confusing.

38
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,718
- [Siren Wailing]
- Tell that to the fish.

39
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,527
Hey, boy. What's going on?

40
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,687
Hunters caught something freaky
up in the mountains.

- [Man] Is that a boy or a girl?
- [Gasps]

44
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,774
- Get away from the window.
- [Man] Look.

45
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,077
What kind of creature is that anyway?

46
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,913
- [Grunting] Come on now. Come on.
- [Woman] I think it's a girl.

47
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,284
Don't make it any harder
than it has to be.

48
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,949
[Groaning]

49
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,357
[Woman]
Oh, that poor thing.

50
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,622
- Come on. Get in the car.
- [Whimpering]

51
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,599
I'll take that.

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,638
You ever see anything 
like that before?

53
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,545

00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,483
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.

57
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,492
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,428
Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

59
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,591
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?

60
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,103
Since I broke out, I've spent 
every moment searching for my past.

61
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,366
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,739
A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,005
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,240
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.

65
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,077
Life's a gift.

66
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,591
- You a doctor?
- I am today.

00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,500
- [Mumbling]
- [Man] Locate Dr. Bennett right away.

00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,097
Get a lab crew, linguist, pediatrician.

69
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,109
- I vote for a veterinarian.
- The state is sending
one of their people to observe.

70
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,338
- [Man] A social worker?
- Psychiatrist.

71
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,472
- We don't have much time.
- [Gasps]

72
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,049
- Oh! Damn it!
- Oh, stop her!

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,055
Go! Go! Somebody stop her!

[Groans, Hits Ground]

75
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,065
[Man]
It's like she's never seen a window before.

76
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,341
It's okay.

77
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,401
Everything is going to be okay.

78
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,416
It's okay. I'm not
gonna hurt you, honey.

79
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,718
- I'm just gonna clean this up.
- [Whimpers]

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,385
How you feeling? Hmm?

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,020
All right. I'm almost done.

82
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,998
You're making a big mistake dealing with her
like this. She's afraid to be touched.

83
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,230
We'll instruct our own staff,
if you don't mind, Doctor-

84
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,396
Bell. Jarod Bell.

85
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,203
The state shrink from Provo.
Your office contacted us about your arrival.

86
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,903
- This is Doctor Bennett.
- How do you do?

87
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,002
- Hello.
- I'm Dr. Wolverton.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,074
I read your book, The Effects of Isolation
and Deprivation on the Human Psyche.

89
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,587
Your theories prompted a great deal of debate
within the psychiatric community.

90
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,182
My writings are controversial because they push
the envelope of psychosocial medicine.

91
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,522
Well, it's always difficult
to break from the pack.

92
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,629
Given her physical appearance
and her lack ofverbal skills...

93
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,463
she must have been isolated
at a very young age.

94
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,801
The question is, what made her
suddenly decide to make contact.

95
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,772
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- [Whimpers]

96
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,006
We show her kindness,
we establish some kind of trust...

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,344
and she'll begin to communicate
in her own way.

98
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,907
We don't have that kind of time.
With no legal guardian...

99
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,079
we lose her to Social Services
in 36 hours.

100
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,487
You haven't been able
to find any family?

101
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,752
No, the police are running her picture
on the net. Until then...

102
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,990
I suggest we take advantage of the time
we have left with our one-of-a-kind specimen.

103
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,058
Bring her out.

104
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,968
- We were looking for you.
- Good news, I hope.

105
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,132
Well- [Clears Throat] The numbers on these
photographs are Level One encryption codes...

106
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,176
used exclusively for
Triumvirate communiques.

107
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,974
- Mutumbo?
- The assassin uploaded them
through our satellites to Africa.

108
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,813
I was able to isolate the killer's designation.
He calls himself "The Owl."

109
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,045
And according to personnel files...

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,988
that designation is used by Mr. Cox.

111
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,116
The Grim Reaper.

112
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,591
You can't say Jarod didn't warn us.

113
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:51,369
[Laughs] Broots, I wanna know everything
about our picture-taking freak.

114
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,771
Uh, Miss Parker, I ran Mr. Cox through
the database. He came up empty.

115
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,776
The guy is a blank slate.

116
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,871
The only proof that we have that he exists
is the fact that we're looking at him.

117
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,543
- Sweep his office.
- He doesn't have one.

118
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,552
But get this.

119
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,180
I-I talked to my friend Rory in Purchasing.

120
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,190
The fellow with the artificial leg?

121
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,453
No, that's Rudy in Public Information.

122
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,519
- Rory's the one with the birthmark
on his head shaped-
- [Stomps]

123
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,259
Iike Gumby.

124
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,032
Okay. Anyway, Rory told me that Mr. Cox
has been mail ordering surgical supplies...

125
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,538
- and having them delivered at the Centre.
- Track the deliveries.

126
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,541
I'm on it.

127
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,309
What if Mr. Cox really
is the Grim Reaper?

128
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,379
- All the more reason to make sure
he doesn't find my father.
- Hmm.

129
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,458
[Banging]

130
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,630
- Make sure to keep her room warm.
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,828
Thank you.

132
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,737
I hate to see her kept in this place.

133
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm Dr. Sulvane-Anne.

134
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,104
Dr.Jarod Bell.
I'm the state psych.

135
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,206
She needs familiar surroundings.
Plants, grass, sunshine.

136
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,878
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry. I'm afraid that's not possible.

137
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,217
We have to keep 
her environment sterile.

138
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,986
If she's been isolated her entire life, 
we don't know what her immune system 
can handle.

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,655
Well, her vital signs are off the chart.
B.P. is 200 over 120, pulse is 150.

140
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,096
- At least let me give her a mild sedative.
- No meds.

141
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,932
And I want minimal interaction.
We're only here to observe.

142
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,938
How do you expect to find out who she is
if you don't try to communicate with her?

143
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,600
She's unable to communicate, Doctor.

144
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,840
And the hard truth is, she's not going 
to learn for a very long time.

145
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,847
I agree with Dr. Wolverton.

146
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:47,648
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to study the very core of the human animal.

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,655
Specimen, animal.
How about human being?

[Banging Continues]

149
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,785
If you'll excuse us...

150
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,920
we've got to go meet with the press.

- Are you okay?

I just can't get past her eyes-

155
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,014
how sad they look, how lost.

156
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,644
You know, it only takes
one person to make a difference.

157
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,488
Cardinal rule of traumatized patients, Dr. Bell:

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,994
Do not invest emotionally.

159
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,631
How come I don't think
you really believe that?

160
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,794
[Banging Continues]

161
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,009
Where did you come from, little girl?

- [Chattering]
- Doctor! Doctor!

163
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,426
- Is the little girl able to speak?
- Does she understand anything?

164
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,428
- How long has she been in the wilderness?
- First of all...

165
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,430
we don't have any answers as ofyet.

166
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,161
But this is the finest
private research facility in the state.

And we've assembled a team of specialists
who are the best in their fields.

168
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,041
- Was there any sign of abuse?
- How is she holding up emotionally?

169
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,271
[Wolverton] As Dr. Bennettsaid, we have
an expert team working on the situation.

170
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,940
Now, we'll keep you updated
as the situation warrants.

171
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,677
- No more questions. Thank you.
- [Chattering]

172
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,082
No more questions.
Thank you.

[Chattering Continues]

174
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,189
[Man]
Give us the answer to 
a simple question, Doctor.

175
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,541
She's pretty.

176
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,778
- Are you on Dr. Bennett's team?
- Not exactly.

177
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,320
- Dr. Jarod Bell.
- Leslie Twain.

178
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,322
I'm with the Salt Lake Chronicle.

179
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,554
If you could just let me get a couple 
of pictures, a brief interview for my paper...

180
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,721
I might be able to help you
figure out who she is.

181
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,130
My story would be syndicated
all over the country and-

182
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,829
Dr. Bell is not at liberty
to give interviews.

183
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,337
Rest assured, everything is under control.

[Glass Shatters]

185
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,238
I'm sorry, you're gonna have 
to go join the others right now.

186
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,270
- What happened?
- Where the hell did she go? Where?

187
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,108
- Did you check the main building?
- Top to bottom.

188
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,119
She has to be somewhere on the grounds.

189
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,587
- What about the press?
- We moved them in the commissary.

190
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,625
- Wait a minute. What are you
planning on doing with that?
- It's for her own safety.

191
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,820
That weapon was not meant
to be used on humans.

192
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,829
- The subject is in a total state of-
- The subject...

193
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,888
is a little girl who
is scared out ofher mind.

194
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,834
Please, Doctor.
Let us do our work.

195
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,894
[Chattering]

196
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:58,376
[Woman On P.A.] Dr. Wilson, call extension 11.
Dr. Wilson, extension 11.

197
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,435
What now?

198
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,974
We find her first. Come on.

199
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,225
- Here we go. Take my coat.
- Okay.

200
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,853
- [Gasps, Whimpers]
- It's okay.

201
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,920
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

202
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,271
Here.

203
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,206
Go ahead. Take her.

204
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,175
Go ahead.

205
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,079
- [Grunts]
- [Laughs]

206
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,357
You think that's funny?

207
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,919
- I guess that is pretty funny. [Laughs]
- [Laughs]

208
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,761
[Sighs]

209
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,551
- She seems to be reacting to
the change in her environment.
- Hmm.

210
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,985
Hervitals are stable.
She's breathing easier.

211
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,784
So what did you say to her
up in that tree?

212
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,158
Nothing. We just laughed.

213
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,097
What are those plants doing in there?

214
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,657
- That room was to be kept sterile.
- They can't harm her.

215
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,499
[Wolverton] This is too much interaction.
The subject is too important.

216
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,472
The subject? Why don't
we give her a name?

217
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,032
Assigning her a name is
assigning her a personality.

218
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,101
It could prejudice the results
of the case study.

219
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,285
Violet.

220
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,753
Violet. I like it.

221
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,954
- [Babbles]
- She spoke.

222
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,662
[Babbling Continues]

223
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,971
- Wh-What is she saying?
- It's mimicry. Random phonetics.

224
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,339
No. She's trying to tell us something.

225
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:24,048
[Babbling Continues]

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,711
- [Anne] What's happening to her?
- She's going into seizure.

227
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,318
- Help me hold her down.
- [Groaning]

228
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,326
MyGod, she's burning up.

229
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,363
Dr. Bennett, I need my medical bag.

230
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,364
Get my bag now!

231
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,060
[Gasps]

232
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:56,110

233
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:59,306
Social Services, please call 571.

234
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:15,084
Hey. You should go home
and get some sleep.

235
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,154
Later.

236
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,562
The results of the tests came back.

237
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:25,163
It was a common flu strain.
It went right through her defenses.

238
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,641
Well, she responded to the medication.

239
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,905
It was scary to see herso helpless.

240
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,971
- Are you investing emotionally, Doctor?
- [Laughs]

241
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:42,087
I don't understand it. Her room 
was sterile, the plants were indigenous...

242
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:45,183
and none of us exhibited
symptoms ofbeing sick.

243
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,821
- I don't know where the virus came from.
- [Grunting]

244
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:52,128
Oh, she wants her doll.
It's the only thing that calms her.

245
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,644
What are you doing?

246
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,115
This is a cocktail of cold 
and flu strains.

247
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,786
There must be at least
10 separate viruses here.

248
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,159
Or 12.

249
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,664
You think someone purposely
infected this doll?

250
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,327
Unless you believe that
a dozen infectious viruses...

251
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:30,132
magically infested
the same square inch of material.

252
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,400
Well, I don't understand. Why?

253
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:37,878
Someone close to the situation is afraid
that Violet is going to begin to communicate.

254
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,972
What you're implying is crazy.

255
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,381
These men are the top in their fields.

256
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,386
Wolverton's research
has saved thousands...

257
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:48,014
and Bennett's work with P.O.W.'s
in isolation is groundbreaking.

258
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,717
I know the record.
I don't know the men.

259
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,022
We have to get that
little girl out of here.

260
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,667
I can't be a part of this.

261
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,105
I see the way you look at her.
It's not just a doctor-patient relationship.

262
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:10,836
What are you so afraid of, Anne?

263
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:20,621
I had a son- Matthew.

264
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:24,386
He was a little younger
than Violet when he got sick.

265
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:29,021
I took him to the best clinics
in the country...

266
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:31,759
the best doctors.

267
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,701
- But I couldn't save him.
- I'm sorry.

268
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,338
Losing him nearly killed me.

269
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,604
I cannot go through
those feelings again.

270
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,272
Not again.

Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell!

273
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:14,269
- Dr. Bennett.
- I understand that you've located
the source of the illness.

274
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:17,243
Yes, as matter of fact, I did.
I was going to show it to you in the morning.

275
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:21,646
It seems that the infection
came from her doll.

276
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,113
This is very disturbing.

277
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:29,816
- [Clattering]
- What was that?

278
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,984
Dr. Bennett. She's not in her room.

279
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,255
- What?
- The little girl is gone.

280
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,490
Damn it. Damn it!

It's okay, honey. It's okay.

00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:18,228
You okay?

Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

287
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:29,044
I'd like a second chance to help,
if you'll let me.

288
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:46,493
This is the fourth time Cox has pulled over.
What the hell is he looking for?

289
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:49,731
- I never pictured Cox as
the pickup truck kind of guy.
- [Sighs]

[Miss Parker]
Yeah, well, he's a blank slate, remember?

291
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,868
Oh, which reminds me,
I talked to Rory in Purchasing.

292
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:57,571
He said he didn't know where Cox
had the surgical tools delivered.

293
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:00,740
- We're going in circles.
- Wait a minute.

294
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,621
- What's he doing with the shovel?
- Oh, criminy.

295
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:08,815
That's a dead something.

296
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,018
He's taking pictures of roadkill,
just like he did when he was tracking you.

297
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:14,584
Flattering comparison. Thank you.

298
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,766
Tell me he didn't just scoop
that worm banquet into the truck.

299
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,635
Ew. What now?

300
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:29,768
Stay with him. If that psycho
gets to my father, we're all roadkill.

301
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,394
What makes you so sure that
this is where she came from?

302
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:53,559
The winters in the region
are far too brutal...

303
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:56,126
for anyone to survive
without some kind of heat source.

304
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:59,230
- According to this map,
there's just one hot spring in the area.

her being out there and done nothing?

328
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:05,538
Yes. From the looks of these photos,
it's been going on for over 10 years.

- Some other time, maybe.
- Oh, where are you going?

335
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,038
To find out who did this.

336
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:44,576
- Did someone die?
- Yes.

337
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:47,086
Where have you been?

338
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:50,948
- You really were at a funeral.
- In Dover.

339
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:54,688
Mr. Cox, he spent the night there.
He's pretty chummy with the owner.

340
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:57,390
- The old guy?
- I'm running him down, 
but I don't think...

341
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,626
he has any connection to the Centre.

342
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,261
Weird thing though, Mr. Cox only came
and went through the back door.

343
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:06,033
With Hefty bags.

344
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,702
Yeah, I don't know what's in them.

345
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:11,108
What comes out the back door
of a mortuary?

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,977
Body parts.

347
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:18,485
Well, whatever was in them,
he had sent to the east wing of SL6.

348
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:22,284
East wing. That was the infirmary
when I was a kid.

349
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:24,290
I got my tonsils taken out there.

350
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:26,656
Well, I don't think he's handing out
lollipops to little girls.

351
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,787
- Not live ones, anyway.
- Ew.

352
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:35,099
I think it's time we paid
the Grim Reaper a visit.

354
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:47,271
Give me the photos.

355
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,502
- What are we doing here?
- I'm gonna leave these for Cox.

356
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,136
Let him know he's being watched too.

00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,098

[Sniffs]
That's right.

362
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:42,120
You had your tonsils removed here, didn't you?

363
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:46,324
Well, I had to clean out
the old file cabinets.

364
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,389
Out with the files,
in with the body parts?

365

Hangin'at the mortuary.

Mysterious bags of God knows what.
Scooping roadkill.

367
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:58,943
- You followed me?
- You take surveillance photos of me...

368
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:03,311
you better be prepared
for a little retaliation.

369
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,577
Who's the gray hair?

370
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,949
His name is Carl. He's my father.

371
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:13,990
- Your-Your father's the mortician?
- Mmm.

372
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,291
We used to have long talks about life...

373
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:20,958
while he was embalming the corpses.

374
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:27,836
Now we just exchange tricks 
of the trade for my hobby.

375
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,897
My father gave me an erector set once.

376
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,739
- Hobby?
- Mmm.

to see its way into the afterlife.

Well, that's Dad's theory, anyway.

383

I will be keeping an eye on you.

This is one from the earlier 
surveillance tapes.

392
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,244
The footage was taken
near the crash site.

393
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:59,454
These shots were taken three years later.

I can't believe she survived 
all those years alone.

395

- What do you mean, Cox is telling the truth?

[Clears Throat]
I was digging around, and I found this-

409
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,660
Lyle's expense account.

410
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:39,959
Three weeks ago, Lyle bought
a very expensive Leica camera.

411
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:43,524
Well, what kind of camera
do you think took those shots?

412
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,536
And then there's this.

413
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,538
A Centre memo.

414
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:52,441
Lyle not only brought Mr. Cox to the Centre,
but he created his position.

a Centre assassin, and he works for you.

my father- our father- killed?

a part of this family.

you would see that I'm just trying
to help him, the same way you are.

and leak them to the Triumvirate...

for your alibi.

- Alibi for what?
- I don't know.

Give me my clothes.

Besides, Violet had nothing
when you found her.

It would've been no different
if I hadn't found her.

I was just an observer!

463
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:07,698
It was a scientific study.

00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:10,394
Oh, and it paid off for you, didn't it?

00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,540
- Oh.
- Only your data wasn't based
on scientific research.

- It was based on the terror 
of an orphaned child!

I'm the one that should be thanking you.

485
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,964
It took a lot of courage to sign 
those court papers to become 
Violet's legal guardian.

486
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,332
I guess you could say I got a message.

My son came to me,
and he said it would be all right.

to be alone anymore.
