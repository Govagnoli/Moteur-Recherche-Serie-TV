1
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,777
At least Jarod could have led us
to a place near the Strip...

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,783
then I could have
hit the craps table.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,617
[Clears Throat] Well, hit this instead:
single malt, like you asked for.

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,452
And you're forgetting something.
Jarod didn't lead us here.

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,550
His friend told him to stay here
in an e-mail I intercepted.

6
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:32,394
- He's been compromised this time,
and he's gonna walk right into our hands.
- My hands.

7
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:37,164
- Now go to your room.
- Oh, this is my room. Our room.
This is the honeymoon suite.

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,968
- Not even after four of these.
- Oh, no, no. Miss Parker, it's perfect.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,568
Why do you think Sydney and Lyle
are coming tomorrow? If Jarod came here...

10
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:48,410
and he saw a woman and three men
on the register, well, 
he'd- he'd know we're here.

11
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,642
This way, if-
if you and I pretend...

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,311
to be the honeymoon couple,
well, he'd be none the wiser.

13
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,748
- This was your idea.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,817
I mean, it's a good one, isn't it?
Nobody'd believe you and Syd.

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,261
He's- He's middle-aged,
and he's Flemish.

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,528
And you, you're young and- unless you think
that you'd rather room with Lyle.

but your own brother?

Relax, Romeo.
That's as far as I go.

19
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,872
Take first watch. Anybody pulls into
that parking lot, send up a flare.

00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,004
- Okay.
- Broots?

00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,606
Fall asleep,
it'll be a hell of a wedding night.

I should be having some fun in the sun,

Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

How many people died
because of what I thought up?

41

- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

when Argyle decided to become a Pretender.

Why don't you get him to help you?

Oh. Well, you see,
this ain't Double "D's" kind of gig.

call a "multifacetal" type thing.

hada secret for writing detective stories.

69
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,552
"When in doubt," he said,
"have somebody enter the room with a gun."

Okay, it's an ice-cream cone.
But it was pistachio...

00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,968
and I'm allergic to pistachios.

is now Dick Dixon, private eye.

was another epic work of fiction.

a week earlier.

He was working the building
as a "hospitality technician."

And that's what he called it.
I call it "janitor."

abandoned office when... she walked in.

Uh, yeah.
Um, no. He's gone.

00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,935
- Yeah.
- Do I work for him? I am his nom de plume.

93
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,102
I'm his coup de grace. I am
his comrade-in-arms, you know what I'm sayin'?

99
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,891
Yeah. My parents gave it to me
on account of my birthmark.

What's your boss's name?

112
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,671
No. People just call him that.

113
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:29,147
He's a good man, takes care of us,
and all the girls have comprehensive dental.

114
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:34,881
- Wow. That's key.
- And this bucket of quarters 
is all he's got left.

115
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:40,483
And he told me to give this
to Mr. Dixon.

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,824
Okay.

117
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,991

of a big-time private eye extraordinaire.

126

Determined to help Mona, he made 
his way back into the Club Ali Bar...

127
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,732
and, like a true detective,
was looking for clues-

128
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,760
anything he could find that would lead him
to where or what happened to Dirty Willy.

129
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,306
But he wasn't ready to be a star.

130
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:33,277
As soon as things got real,
Argyle wished he'd taken a bit part.

[Argyle Gasps]
Dirty Willy.

132
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,552
He'd done the job, solved the case.
He had the killer cornered.

133
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,022
- So Argyle did what Argyle does best.
- [Gasps]

134
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,857
- He never saw the hit man.
Who could at that speed?
- Woah!

135
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:53,797
He was pretty sure the killer 
didn't see him- pretty sure.

136
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,029
Which brings us back
to our pistachio-packin 'porker.

137
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,037
He was wondering
the same thing as me.

138
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,266
- Where the hell is Mona?
- Well, I -I -I don't know.

139
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,605
She told me she was comin' 
to see you, Dixon. And now she's gone?

140
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,305
- Did she say where she was goin'?
- She hasn't told me anything.

141
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,043
- Did she leave anything?
- Look. Normally, I don't talk
to gun-wielding thugs.

142
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:16,077
Yeah. Your mama must be real proud
of you now, eh, big boy?

143
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,725
No. She'd probably give me a lickin'.

144
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,394
My mama's dead.

145
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,125
Truth is, I'm not a thug.
My name is Mike. I'm Mona's brother.

- Hi.

[Sighs] It just ain't like her not to check in.
Our parents died when we were real little...

148
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,572
and I made a promise to Mom
that I'd take care of Mona.

149
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:45,015
- I just gotta know if she's okay.
- [Sighs]

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,282
You will. Just as soon as we find out 
anything, you'll be the first to know.

151
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,018
- I promise. Right, partner?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,653
Dick Dixon is on the case,
kickin' tail and takin' names.

153
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:01,393
You are Mr. Positivi-tivity, 
the Shah of "I Can." Hey, now. Swell ride.

154
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,265
Like I always say,
private dick's gotta have a ragtop.

155
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,703
- You are not going.
- What are you talkin' about?

156
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,173
I am not a detective. You are not my partner.
If I'm going to help, you stay outta my way.

157
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,109
That was extremely hostile.

158
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,012
I can't keep saving your life
if you keep lying yourself into a corner.

159
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,573
- You have to think.
- [Engine Starts]
- Hey!

160
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,585
- [Engine Stops]
- I've been thinkin'.

161
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,520
I was-
[Spoken Lyric] till I met you.

162
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,526
Now after you helped me and Pop last year,
I'm mendin' my wicked ways, you know.

163
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,290
I ain't had nothin'
but honest jobs since.

164
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:36,563
Only thing missin' is the love of my life.
And I met her last week.

165
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:48,203
- Mona's the one.
- You spent six minutes with her.

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,741
360 glorious seconds, J-Man.
Somethin' happened between us, I'm tellin' ya.

167
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,186
It was like "electronical" chemicals
or something.

168
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,190
Pheromones, baby,
I'm tellin' ya.

169
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,318
And now my future brother-in-law's
weepin' in his pistachio.

170
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,364
You gotta let me come with you, J-ster.
You gotta let me help her.

171
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,195
J-Man. J-Dog.
Please, I'm beggin' ya.

172
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,292
Please, please, please,
please, please.

173
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:14,169
There are certain times in life when you need
to think with your heart, not your head.

174
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,371
This wasn't one of those times, but I thought
it was, so I made the following mistake.

175
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,937
- Please?
- Get in.

176
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,848
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,046
- [Engine Starts]
- Argyle is on the case. Come on!

178
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,920
How did I get in this nightmare?

179
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,398
Well, I-I remember
I was watching out for Jarod...

180
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,961
and you looked at me with bedroom eyes,
like you wanted to do the late-night creep.

181
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,405
I did not. We did not.

182
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,035
Well, how can you be sure,
Miss Parker?

183
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,841
For starters, pigs aren't flying,
hell hasn't frozen over...

184
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,712
and you're not the last man on earth.

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,745

- How's the stakeout going?

187
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,053
Sydney, how are you?

188
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,661
I... am fine.

189
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,957
Sweeper team says you haven't reported in.

190
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,125
Huh. Something came up.

191
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,900
I... overslept, but-
but I was just getting dressed.

192
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,805
I'll be there tomorrow
with Lyle and Raines.

193
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,639
Parker, is everything all right?

194
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,578
I am rolling nothing but sevens.
[Chuckles]

195
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,753
[Quietly]
You so much as hint at this 
when they arrive...

196
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,286
I will amputate your head.

197
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,301
- Well, what about this?
- There is no "this."

198
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,667
Nothing happened, Broots.

199
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,471
Like I said, it was a nightmare,
and I'm glad I woke up.

200
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,706
When you say things like that,
do you even consider my feelings?

201
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,780
What is it about me
that you find so repulsive?

202
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,822
- You really want to know?
- Yes. I really want to know.

203
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,017
Okay.

204
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,357
Now you shut up and listen.

205
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:22,432
What I find so utterly uninspiring
about you...

206
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,561
is your idea of risk
is to go without deodorant.

207
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,701
When the bullets stop flying,
you're always the one shaking in the corner.

208
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:35,873
That, in the game of life,
is second string.

209
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,645
And-
[Spoken Lyric]

210
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:44,815
Hey. Stop, and let me tell
you something, and you-

211
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,688
you shut up and listen.

212
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,593
You're right.

213
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,224
I have never taken a risk.

214
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,531
Because the whole time I've known you,
I've only wanted to take just one.

215
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,231
Which one would that be?

216
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,833
You're in your office.

217
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,704
It's late, and I sneak in.

218
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,742
In one hand I have gardenias, and in the other
I have a bottle of single malt-

219
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,017
two of your favorite things
in the world.

220
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,550
And I find that little spot
on the nape of your neck...

221
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,529
and I just...
rub it the right way...

222
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:30,558
to get rid of that migraine you always get
about 6:20 every night-

223
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,537
the one you never tell
anyone about.

224
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,801
The truth is, if I had just one shot...

225
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,813
you know what I'd do?

226
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,209
I would take your pain away.

227
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,052
Truth is, you'd be lucky
to get a scrub like me.

228
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,233
- Do you hear that, Broots?
- What?

229
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,903
Pigs are flying.

00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:28,747
[Jarod Narrating] Life is strange.

234
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:33,091
One hour in the Nevada sun,
and I had more unanswered questions
than the Warren Commission.

235
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:35,528
- # [Continues]
- There was Dirty Willy's murder to solve...

236
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:38,089
and Mona, the missing showgirl,
to track down.

237
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,499
But Argyle had to see his father, Benny.

238
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,906
The old man used to be obsessed with the pope.
I was about to find out he converted.

239
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,569
Wayne Newton is more than a holy man.

240
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:52,479
He is the shaman of the Strip.
He's the duke of downtown.

241
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:55,847
- Wayne Newton is Las Vegas.
- If you say so.

242
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,079
You know, I met him once, sort of?

243
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:01,783
My Adella and I, uh,
saw him in Vegas long ago.

244
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:06,158
Who'd have thought
I'd be back here in Vegas with Argyle...

245
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,823

246
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:12,231

00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,395

- [Man] Sorry.

248
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,237
Yeah.
The only one missin' is my Adella.

249
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,210
This week would've been
our 50th anniversary.

250
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,840
She was my inspiration, Jarod.
She's the reason I'm writin' 
a song for Wayne.

251
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,544
- Hey, Pop, we-we don't have time for that.
- Oh, sure we do.

252
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,678
The big "W," he changed our lives...

253
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:35,315
so my Adella suggested
that I should write him a song...

254
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,383
sort of a companion piece
to "Danke Schoen."

255
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:41,760
She said,
"Call it 'AufWiedersehen"'...

256

- Uh, Wayne is playin' 
in a charity tournament...

261
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:03,413
and he will be right there putting...

262
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:06,319

Oh, yeah.

266

Well, yeah, but it's worth it
for my Adella's last wish, isn't it?

267
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:23,799
It's more than worth it.

268
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:26,603
- Yeah. Good.
- And the big "W" will love it, Pop...

269
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,372
but we gotta get out of here.
We gotta catch ourselves a killer.

00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,437

- Catch you later, Pop.

00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:35,973
[Jarod Narrating] It was nice
to see Benny again, but Argyle was right.

272
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:41,388
We did have a killer to catch.
So we went back to the scene of the crime.

273
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:44,392
Okay.
Uh, Dirty Willy bought it right about here...

274
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,792
and I saw the killer
standing right over there.

275
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,764
Hey, funny face,
this area's off limits, all right?

- Okay. I'll tell you what I told

Mona ain't your typical showgirl,

She won't show her cones,
and she saves her dough. [Yelps]

291

Things are gonna be different from now on.

314
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,940
- [Water Stops]
- Broots, you are gonna pay for...

315
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,948
using all the hot water, you moron!

316
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,950
You were saying, Broots?

317
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:25,954
Syd, please tell me
you're here to relieve me.

318
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:29,355
Being cooped up with Felix Ungar here
makes me glad to see your sorry mug.

319
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:33,191
Lyle and I are registered at Caesars.

320
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:35,196
Separate rooms?

321
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:38,461
- Well, separate suites.
- [Scoffs]

322
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,662
[Sydney] Lyle will be here later.
Perhaps we can take over.

323
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:46,231
Hopefully, I won't have plugged Broots
before then. Call me when he gets here.

324
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:54,807
- What?
- I thought things were gonna
be different between us.

325
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,182
There is no "us."

326
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:01,553
At least...
not that they know of.

327
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:07,885
Could you imagine
what they would do if they knew?

328
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:11,923
Right. Right. We don't- We don't wanna
give them any ammunition, now do we?

329
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,868
Speaking of which...

330
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:18,532
my clip is empty.

331
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:21,577
Oh, yeah. I get it, baby.

332
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:25,410
But if we're gonna do this-
[Whispering] we gotta do it right.

333
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,678
I've always had a little fantasy
I want to live out with you.

334
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,845
But first I want you to call me...

335
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,117
"Puff Daddy."

336
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:38,058
Say it. Say it.

337
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:42,188
- Puff-
- [Inhales] Daddy.

338
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:44,255
Oh!

339
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,699

[Jarod Narrating]
They say that life is stranger than fiction.

348
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:47,155
Mine certainly has been,
and this was no exception.

349
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:50,130
Mona was kidnapped, but by whom?

350
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:53,794
Whatever trouble her boss, Dirty Willy, found,
it had certainly found her...

351
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,361
and it was only a matter of time
before it found us.

352
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,570
I did what Syndey always taught me:
When in doubt, go back to the evidence.

353
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:05,045
A couple of things just don't make any sense.
According to the autopsy report...

354
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:08,208
what killed Dirty Willy
was low levels of oxygen in his tissues...

355
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:10,809
due to hypothermia- extreme cold.

356
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:13,320
He froze to death.
In Vegas?

357
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:17,189
And he had several ice pick holes
in his hands.

358
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,250
I'm thinkin' torture.

359
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,564
Wait a second, J-Man.

360
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:26,465
You don't think who's ever doin' this
might, you know...

361
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,332
- poke Mona like that?
- Let's hope not.

362
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,800
According to this file,
he is the number one suspect:

363
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:38,404
Constantin Falzone-
an extortionist for the Posavac crime family.

364
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:41,314
What other part of your two-plus-two case
don't add up to four?

365
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:44,250
[Jarod]
Dirty Willy weighed over 300 pounds.

366
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,017
Frozen or not, that's a lot of Willy
for one man to carry around.

367
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,490
- Wait. What are you sayin', "J"?
- There were two killers...

368
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,050
who tortured Dirty Willy
and froze him to death.

369
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,996
Question is,
what did they want out of him?

370
00:23:56,065 --> 00:24:01,662
[Exhales]
That's easy, baby- cash, do-re-mi, J-Man.

371
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:04,501
Everybody knows
Falzone collects around town...

372
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,939
so maybe Dirty Willy
couldn't come up with the green...

373
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:09,204
and the twins get P.O.'d with him.

374
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,406
- Twins?
- Falzone's got these Frigidaires 
that work for him.

375
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:15,973
- Calls 'em his caddies.
- Caddies? Why?

376
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:18,451
[Jarod Narrating]
Falzone- Sin City old-timer.

377
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:22,548
Doesn't care about shopping malls,
pirate ships or the Eiffel Tower in the desert.

378
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,958
He's only interested in cash...
and a three handicap.

379
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:29,429
J-Rod, those two goons killed Dirty Willy
and kidnapped my Mona.

380
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:31,693
I say we waste 'em and snag Falzone.

381
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:35,203
No. We meet Falzone out there
on his own turf.

382
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,205
But you don't know how to play.

383
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:40,470
It's all geometry and physics.
How hard could that be?

384
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:44,570
[Narrating] Sydney always taught me,
the most difficult Pretends 
have an inner secret.

385
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:48,378
Once you reveal that secret,
it comes naturally.

386
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,161
- [Club Hits Bushes]
- [Bird Squawking]

387
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,154
[Dog Barks]

388
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:44,297
In 56 minutes, I found the secret 
to a perfect golf game.

389
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:46,534
I'll share it with you sometime.

390
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,169
The twins were impressed,
just like I said.

391
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,179
Falzone wanted to take me on.

392
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,844
- Then I told them I was Dick Dixon.
- [No Audible Dialogue]

393
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:58,478
Guess which one's married.

394
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:03,253
The twins promised to get us to Falzone,
which they did.

395
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:07,819
However, in true Chandleresque fashion,
we found out it was with a twist.

396
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,365
Someone else had gotten to him first.

397
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:15,801
And to think I wasted 56 minutes.

398
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:23,440
Raymond Chandler always said, 
"The best way to get a reader's attention 
is with a dead body."

399
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:25,980
But of course,
Chandler wasn't writing this one.

400
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,212
[Gasping]
I got balls!

401
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:35,618
[Splashing]
I got balls.

402
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:41,923
Unbe-friggin-lievable.
People actually throw these away.

403
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:45,831
- And that makes them yours.
- Possession is 9/10ths.

404
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,395
You oughta know.
I hear Dick Dixon steals wives.

405
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:54,738
And I hear you hang Dirty Willys.
And now you've kidnapped Mona Jeffries.

406
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,643
How come I get the feeling
you cheat at golf?

407
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:00,739
If you're not cheating,
you're not playing.

408
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:04,183
- Hey, we want Mona back.
- Who are you- Little Dick?

409
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:06,448
All right. I'll show you little,
ya big freak.

410
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:11,824
Hey. Dirty Willy never came up short,
so there's no reason to kill him.

411
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:15,660
As for Mona,
a Viagra-poppin' man such as myself...

412
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:19,030
can only pray to enjoy a muffin 
like that in the morning.

413
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:24,733
All right. That's it. You and me gonna throw
right now, paisan. I had it with this mook.

414
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:28,868
Hey. I got no beef with Dirty Willy.
I got no beef with you, Dixon.

415
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:32,675
Mona asked me for help. She said 
that Dirty Willy was gettin's queezed...

416
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:36,275
by, um, a couple of goons
by the name of the Frost Brothers.

417
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:40,152
- [Together] The Frost Brothers?
- The Frost Brothers.

418
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:44,454
Now I got my finger in every casino
in this whole town. I never heard 
of these guys.

419
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,518
Okay? So that's it. That's all I know.
All right? Are we done? Are we done?

420
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:51,191
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

421
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:55,733

# [Humming]
Room service.

423
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,774
I was just talkin' to the manager.
You won't believe what he was telling me.

424
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:12,252
- And what would that be, Mr. Broots?
- Glad you could join us.

428
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,727
It's of Jarod heading for the runway.
He skipped town.

429
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:30,033
Your theory isn't holding.
It's time to go home.

430
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:34,098
No, but the- the e-mail said
that he was gonna be here. W-We have to stay.

431
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,236
- Broots, it's over.
- No. I just talked to the manager.

432
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:39,906
He took a reservation last night
under the name of "Jarod Siegel"-

433
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,712
as in "Bugsy Siegel,"
the man who created Vegas.

434
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:44,912
A reservation
doesn't mean he's gonna show.

435
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:46,921
- We're leaving.
- We're staying.

436
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:50,585
Did he just ignore us?

437
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,753
You wanna barge in here
and try and scare me? You go ahead.

438
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:59,768
But don't question my skills. 
I'm not second string anymore. 
I do a job, and I do it well.

439
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:03,896
And if your paranoid minds can't take that,
then you can go chase that photo.

440
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:06,202
Miss Parker and I will catch Jarod.

441
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,511

or we're through.

00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,559

[Jarod Narrating]
As Argyle and I drove back to Benny's...

446
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,107
we knew that without the mysterious
Frost Brothers, there was no Mona...

447
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,274
and no dream for Argyle.

448
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,649
But Argyle 's dream
wasn't the only one in jeopardy.

449
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,247
- Oh, those bastards. Bastards, all of them!
- Benny, what happened?

450
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:58,384
There I am.
I am standing there in the bunker.

451
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,793
I am halfway into my "overature,"
and they grab me.

452
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:04,765
- Wayne's bodyguards.
- Oh, bite your tongue. Wayne's people...

453
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,324
would never do that with a rake.

454
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:11,031
Ah, it was those lowlifes that work for
the other half of Wayne's threesome-

455
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,666
those "mugicians" with the big hair?

456
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:16,440
It's a good thing
they didn't bring their tigers, boy.

457
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:19,906
- Whew.
- So Wayne never heard your song?

458
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:24,242
No. And I know he would've loved it.
He would've loved it.

459
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:26,475
Of course he would have.

460
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,713
- What's the matter with him?
- We haven't found Mona yet.

461
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:35,452
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
It's always a girl, isn't it?

462
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,361
Let me let you in
on a little tiny secret.

463
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:41,363
He's just exactly like me.

464
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:46,459
- No.
- Oh, yes. I was wild. I was unchecked...

465
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:48,800
until my Adella tamed me.

466
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:53,502
I still remember that trip to Vegas.
We wanted to get away from it all.

467
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:58,344
Dr. Kanapa had told us that 
we wouldn't be able to have a family...

468
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,816
and I know it was really tough for her.

469
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,819
But my Adella-

470
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:07,983
God, she looked so beautiful
the night we went to see Wayne.

471
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:13,121
Ya never saw a polka dot dress
like that in your life.

00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,824
Well, big Wayne-

473
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:19,995
he picks her out of the whole crowd...

474
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,769
and he sang "Danke Schoen" right to her.

475
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,332
- It was-
- Like a dream.

476
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,349
Yeah. That night,
Adella came back to the motor court...

477
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,714
all giddy from Wayne's show, you know?

478
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:41,417
And we drove the cattle across the prairie
all night long, if you catch my meaning...

479
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,889
and... we were blessed.

480
00:31:45,962 --> 00:31:50,729
- You conceived Argyle.
- Rolled a hard eight. [Chuckles]

481
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,997
- [Benny] So now, when I see him
goin'through all this-
- [Dog Whimpers]

482
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,939
I think, "Where would I be today
if it weren't for my Adella?"

483
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:02,110
She was your Mona.

484
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,743
[Sighs]
Jarod...

485
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:10,650
ya gotta find that girl for my boy.

486
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,655
[Dog Whimpers]

487
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,221
[Jarod Narrating]
It seems everybody who met Mona wanted her:

488
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,957
Argyle, her brother, Falzone.

489
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:23,295
It got my detective gears spinning.

490
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:26,961
Look, buddy boy.
I followed her home once- okay, twice.

491
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:31,440
Nick had known everything about Mona:
where she lived, how she saved her money.

492
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:33,499
Maybe he knew
who the Frost Brothers were.

493
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,240
- But I swear, I never heard of 
the Frost Brothers.
- It was almost a dead end.

494
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,248
- Almost.
- Dixon.

495
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:43,275
Deputy Wyatt hadn't punched me 
the first time we met. 
Guess he figured I was due.

496
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:47,983
- Oh, this is gettin' really old.
- You tryin' to destroy three months
of real police work?

497
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,583
- We almost got Falzone for extortion.
- So get him.

498
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,958
After you talked to him?
You of all people should know...

499
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:55,827
there's only one way
to do things in this town: the Vegas way.

500
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:58,424
What about the Frost Brothers way?

501
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:00,628
- What's that place got to do with anything?
- Place?

502
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:02,296
- Place?
- Place?

503
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:07,002
Place. It's an abandoned meat-packing plant
outside town. So what?

504
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:14,150
[Dog Barking, Whimpers]

Mona?

[Whimpering, Barks]

507
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:27,963
Mona?

508
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,935
Mona! Mona!

509
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,498
- Mona.
- I didn't think you'd come.

510
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:42,841
- Oh, you're so cold. 
L-Let's get you out of here.
- Argyle, these two guys-

511
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,903
They had masks on.
They grabbed me.

512
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,007
They've been trying to get me to tell them
what Dirty Willy told me.

513
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:51,679
But I can't tell them that secret,
'cause I can't do that to Willy.

514
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:54,519
- Well, you could tel I us the secret, Mona.
- Tell us later.

515
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,218
We have to get out of here right now.

516
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:58,692
Yeah. We need to get you back
to your brother.

517
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:01,094
Brother?
I don't have a brother.

518
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,156
- Sure you do. Two of'em.
- [Barks]

519

- Argyle, say hello to the Frost Brothers.

[Continues Growling]

521
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,850
[Jarod Narrating]
It was a case to make Ray Chandler proud.

522
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,719
Let's review.
Our two sheriff deputies, Wyatt and Mike...

523
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,318
they killed Dirty Willy-
tortured him, froze him, hung him.

524
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:35,524
But what did they want out of him?
Money? Do-re-mi?

525
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:38,226
- You won't be surprised
if I tell you the answer is no.
- [Whimpers]

526
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,566
Dirty Willy had
one dirty little secret left...

527
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:45,074
and these guys were trying
to get it out of Mona... and us.

528
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,872
- It's been eight hours. Start talking.
- I got nothin' to say.

529
00:34:48,945 --> 00:34:52,904
You just don't get it, do you, Dixon?
We do things the Vegas way.

530
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:56,509
Now, Mona's brother here
is gonna drive her into the desert.

531
00:34:56,586 --> 00:35:01,387
If he doesn't hear from me in 30,
she's gone, and I ice the two of you.

532
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,659
- Oh, and I keep the dog.
- [Growling Continues]

533
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,928
Don't give 'em anything, Argyle.
Not one quarter!

534
00:35:12,702 --> 00:35:15,227
- [Barking]
- Ah, put a sock in it, Dog.

535
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:17,239
That was a strange thing to say.

536
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:19,798
Yeah, right-
especially since dogs don't wear socks.

537
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:23,937
Not Dog. Mona. She said, "not a quarter."
"Don't give them one quarter."

538
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:27,471
Well, J-Man, Mona left a bucket 
full of quarters in Dick Dixon's office.

539
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,078
Dirty Willy's secret. Whatever he was tryin'
to protect must have been in that bucket.

540
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:35,420
- Wyatt!
- Hey, what the hell are you doin'?

541
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:38,586
I'm gonna give him what he wants.
Wyatt!

542
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:50,331
- There it is.

543

[Wyatt On Tape]
Look, Willy. If you pay us what we need...

544
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,504
we won't need to get rough with you.
[Beeps]

545
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:58,706
Falzone wasn't extorting money
from Willy and his club. You were.

546
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,682
And the dirty fat boy
recorded me doin' it.

547
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,153
- All the time you just wanted that tape,
it was right there.
- Nice work, detectives.

548
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,553
Willy was just tryin' to get that tape
to Dick Dixon.

549
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,115
So now you got it.
Call your deputy and let Mona go.

550
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:13,526
Poor Willy didn't even know
that Dick Dixon had skipped town.

551
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:17,123
Wait a second.
You're not Dick Dixon?

- Let me outta this.
- Uh-uh.

558
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,981
- You know, you should be protecting people-
- [Slot Machine Clicking]

559

not extorting from them.

560
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:43,548
But I guess that's what they call
the "Vegas way," right?

561
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:46,026
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, we've already tried that.

- No! No! No!

- You don't know the half of it.

- You're going to make a call.
You're going to let Mona go.

And so did I- to the F..B.I.

When they arrived at the office,
they found a killer waiting for them...

along with the evidence
to convict him-

all courtesy of the mysterious
Richard W. Dixon.

576

# It means good-bye, my baby#

639
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:08,144
# I don't know why
I feel this pain #

640
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:10,549
# It's not my goiter #

641
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,748
# But let's reconnoiter #

642
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:18,487
# So even though I'm on that 
far-off desert in Morocco #

- # I'm feelin' rocko, 
but I wanna do this refrain #

There's more to come.

Uh, listen.
I wanna see you all tonight at my show.

650
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:45,717
You'll be my guest.
I'll leave your names at the front door.

651
00:42:45,788 --> 00:42:51,522
And by the way, I want you to know
that Adella was my inspiration too.

What a guy.

- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

655
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,431
That could be the worst song
I've ever heard.

656
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:08,068
- I know. But to him it was a dream come true.
- [Chuckles]

657
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:10,078

- He listened. He liked it.

Speaking of a lot,
thank you for that donation.

00:43:17,954 --> 00:43:19,888
It was for a good cause.

661
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,447
You know, I don't think I ever
got your name.

662
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:25,392
Well, everyone in town
calls me Dick Dixon.
