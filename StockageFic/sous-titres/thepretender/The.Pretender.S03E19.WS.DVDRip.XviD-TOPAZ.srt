165
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,207
The tournament was the only place that the
kidnapper could have watched Bryce perform.

Your kidnapper's M.O. Matches
that of a man...

the previous unsolved case files.

within weeks of each other in 1989.

176

Uh, Michael Taylor,
Theodore Reed and Harry Dunn.

but they'd been killed.

182

Michael Taylor and Theodore Reed.

They... may be subjects.

189
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,684
It's almost as if the kidnapper's
putting them through...

190

some sort of
testing procedure...

191

and rejecting them.

192

193

194

a partial shoe print...

195
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,830

199

emotional control.

200

His screen name was Joshua.

201
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,988
He traded e-mails with Bryce
before Bryce vanished.

202
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,548
All right. Well, I'll go

The last boy that was kidnapped-
the boy in the photograph-

206

How long was he held
before he was killed?

207
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,935
Seventy-two hours.
Maybe less.

- "Invisible."
- Invisible?

219
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,463
That's how Bryce refers
to himself in these e-mails.

220
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:44,023
He said that his father pushed him
so hard, he felt as if he didn't exist.

221
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:48,128
The other victims had similar
relationships with their parents...

222

specifically their fathers.

223
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:54,777
So, they all suffered deep psychological wounds
caused by strained parental relationships.

234
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,697
I think that Bryce wanted
his privacy too...

235
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,032
<i>but his father</i>
<i>wouldn't let him have it.</i>

236
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:57,666

<i>who paid particular attention to Bryce?</i>

- Uh, a teacher, a tutor, anybody?
- I taught my son chess.

247
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,881

the season's first tournament.

249
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,724

- He said he was gonna do a feature on Bryce.

250
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,729

to the city finals yet.

492
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,161
Joshua-Joshua can't say.

493
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,826
<i>Well, maybe these pictures</i>
<i>will help you remember.</i>

494
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,768
- I don't want to look.
- What happened to this Joshua?

495
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:19,034
I don't want to look.
No, I don't want- I don't want to look.

496
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:21,041
Father didn't think he cut it...

497
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:23,771
so he asked you to go out
in the woods and do this to him.

498
00:36:23,845 --> 00:36:27,178
He asked you to kill this boy, didn't he?
Look at the pictures, damn it!

499
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:42,953
I'm sorry.

500
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:50,736
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

501
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:54,640
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

502
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,041
- Theodore-
- I'm so sorry.

503
00:36:57,112 --> 00:37:00,479
- I'm so sorry.
- Theodore, help me.

504
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,915
<i>Help me save Bryce.</i>

505
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:13,222
<i>[Sobbing Continues]</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

506
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:14,853
<i>[Laughter]</i>

507
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,865
Ah, angel.

508
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,867
Ah, perfect timing.

509
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:23,996
Daddy, I need to
speak with you, alone.

510
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:26,040
Well, this is your family.

511
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:28,440
We, uh-We have no secrets.

512
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:38,279
- Daddy, I've recently learned-
- Miss Parker?

513
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:42,983
Oh. Excuse me. May we have
a word with you outside?

514
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:46,186
- Later.
- It's important.

515
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:52,426
Excuse me. One minute.

516
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,196
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

517
00:37:56,238 --> 00:38:00,106
- What?
- I checked the contents of that s-

518
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:05,242
I checked the contents of the syringe.
It was Pergonal.

519
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:08,248
- What the hell is that?
- It's a drug.

520
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:10,784
But a fertility drug.

521
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,650
Fertility?
Are you sure?

522
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:17,681
Bridget wasn't trying to get high.
She was trying to get pregnant.

523
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:21,889
Oh. But with whose baby?

524
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:25,126
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- <i>[Brigitte] So, Lyle and I
<i>came in here to celebrate.</i>

525
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,226
<i>I know I shouldn't, but I couldn't</i>
<i>help it. I was so excited!</i>

526
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:31,204
Too excited.
She spilled champagne all over my pants.

527
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:33,798
<i>I had to go into the bathroom</i>
<i>and clean myself up.</i>

528
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,639
Angel, you wanted
to tell me something.

529
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:42,008
It's nothing, Daddy.
I'm gonna get going.

530
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:45,246
<i>[Mr. Parker] No, wait. Wait. Wait a minute.</i>
<i>We have something to tell you.</i>

531
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,689
Brigitte and I are going to have,
uh, a little Parker.

532
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,823
<i>Congratulations, Miss P. You're gonna</i>
<i>have a baby brother or sister.</i>

533
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:58,695
<i>[Mr. Lyle]</i>
<i>Oh, this is fantastic!</i>

534
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,463
<i>[Mr. Parker] It turns out the erratic</i>
<i>behavior and mood swings...</i>

535
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>had to do with fertility drugs.</i>

536
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:05,806
You know,
the hormones and what.

537
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:10,275
This is a surprise.

538
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:13,712
Yeah. Well, it's a happy day
for the family.

539
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:19,410
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>Don't be a poop.</i>

540
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:32,899
Happy days, indeed.

541
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,802
Go, go, go! Go!

542
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:02,127
The woods. The woods!

543
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,807
[Bryce]
Where are we going?

544
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,605
We're going for a walk
in the woods.

545
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:19,511
<i>Hello, Joshua.</i>

546
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:22,641
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- I'm the Father.

547
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:26,619
I'm your father.
Don't be afraid.

548
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:29,486
I've come to set you free.

549
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,822
- <i>[Detective] Drop the knife!</i>
- <i>[Guns Cocking]</i>

550
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:35,658
- Drop the knife!
- No, You don't understand.

551
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,188
- No, <i>you</i> don't understand.
- I am the Father. He is my son. I am Abraham.

552
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:42,168
- Come on, do this.
- I'm going to set-

553
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:45,434
[Sobbing]
No!

554
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:46,974
[Yelling]

555
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,102
[Grunting]

556
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:56,879
- No more-
- <i>Father.</i>
- Killing!

557
00:40:56,951 --> 00:41:00,819
- All right, Jarod, we got him!
- No more! No more!

558
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:03,722
<i>Calm down, all right? Jarod.

559
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,491
No, no.
Everything for Father.

560
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,621
It's okay.
[Panting]

561
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,997
- It's okay. It's okay.
- [Sobbing]

562
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,468
It's okay now.

563
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:19,906
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

564
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:33,581
[Whispering]
Detective.

565
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:37,989
We can't thank you enough for giving us
a second chance with our son.

566
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:42,894
- How's your husband?
- I don't think he realizes the way he is.

567
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:45,524
But I do know that I'm
gonna do everything I can...

568
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,728
<i>to show our son</i>
<i>that there's more to life...</i>

569
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:51,363
than winning chess matches.

570
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,941
[Murmuring]

571
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:14,993
His name is Dr. Samson Dane.
He was a child psychologist.

572
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:17,964
He treated Meyers, Taylor
and the other missing boys.

573
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:21,433
He used his influence to lure them
away from their families.

574
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:24,131
Dane's own son died
of a genetic disorder.

575
00:42:24,205 --> 00:42:26,366
My guess is his name was Joshua.

576
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,205
All these years he was
trying to recreate a family.

577
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,078
They're being admitted
to a psychiatric facility.

578
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:40,212
With any luck,
they'll be deprogrammed.

579
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:44,452
- What about their parents?
- They're seeing them today.

580
00:42:44,526 --> 00:42:46,494
Ten years is a long time.

581
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,758
A child never forgets
the people who love him.

582
00:42:57,071 --> 00:43:00,370
- Well, l-
- Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

583
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:03,172
- [Chuckles]
- I got you this.

584
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:05,769
For me? Thank you. Uh...

585
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:09,681
- [Laughs]
- For the kid in you. [Chuckles]

586
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:21,288
- Good luck, Jarod.
- Thank you.

587
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,733
I'll see you.
