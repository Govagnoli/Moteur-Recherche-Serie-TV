1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,677
I understand the pressure that you're under, I do.

2
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,442
Daddy, Daddy.

3
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:12,534
I know how patient you have been with my handling of Jarod, but,

4
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:19,700
No more excuses. I…

5
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:22,537
wasn't finished.

6
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:43,738
What?

7
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,654
I thought you came here to kill me.

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,355
Better to find the story.

9
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,156
Who are you?

10
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,578
My name is Igor.

11
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:53,213
- Let me go, Frankenstein.
- I'm going to...

12
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:03,254
Beautiful, beautiful.

13
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:05,773
People think spontaneous combustion is a myth.

14
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:09,997
I don't. I wouldn't be caught dead because of combustion in my pocket. Hey, look at this.

15
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:16,438
Focus.

16
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:19,538
There must be an connection between ''ring a bell''

17
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:21,979
and the Frankenstein movie.

18
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:23,861
Do you remember any of the dialogue?

19
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:25,162
Something like:

20
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:26,639
''Who are you?''

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
''My name is Igor.''

22
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,954
Hey, Son of Frankenstein!

23
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:33,376
Basil Rathbone goes back to his dad's castle and meets lgor, Bela Lugosi.

24
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:34,896
And they bring the monster back to life.

25
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,119
It's not a Jesus James Whale's movie, but,

26
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:38,476
it's definitely get a chatter.

27
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,177
Oh, you are a lonely man, aren't you?

28
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:44,078
Look.

29
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:47,761
It's an angel with the broken wing.

30
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,635
Perhaps Jarod perceives himself as a fallen angel?

31
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,897
Or he simply forgot to put the caution fragile tags on the box?

32
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:56,898
Hey look!

33
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,276
Igor knows the secret.

34
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:01,253
What's secret?

35
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:03,695
The Center throw a rock in you head one.

36
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:08,820
I am calling Bjorn to getting ... Broots, why don't you watch Son of Frankenstein again,

37
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:10,680
and see if Basil is a wonder boy.

38
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,341
We have half of our sweapers out there looking for him.

39
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:14,442
We are gonna find him.

40
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,732
And when we do, we'll have a little spontaneous combustion of my own in mind.

41
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,119
That's him! Get him!

42
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:49,317
I'll get him out!

43
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:56,418
Mark, get in!

44
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,219
There are pretenders among us.

45
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,677
I was taken from my family.

46
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,615
Thirty-six hours, he's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

47
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:22,881
How many people died because what I thought up?

48
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,997
Since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.

49
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:26,722
He is a pretender.

50
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,962
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

51
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,714
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

52
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,676
He defends the weak and abused.

53
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:36,757
Life is a gift.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000

You are a doctor?

00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,378
I am today.

59
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,812
End, cut!

60
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:15,976
Beautiful work, Jarod.

61
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:17,735
That is what I get paid for.

62
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:19,936
Jarod.

63
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,891
They said that you are the hottest new special ... in town

64
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,332
that I realised that matter literally!

65
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:25,533
Brynne McLain.

66
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,434
Thank you for comming.

67
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:29,217
I just never doubt I get invited to alive at your resume.

68
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,414
It's a clever idea, really sense.

69
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:37,737
Although I've been wondering why a special effects coordinator will actually do that fire stunt himself.

70
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,021
No one pulls the stunter design unless I try to first myself.

71
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:46,282
- Noble.
- Smart, considering the accident on the Blaster Beer set last week.

72
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,942
I figured the FX coordinator was a little smart

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
that's exactly what you mean.

74
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,559
Producing a Super Sunday can pay a new beer,

75
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:53,862
can make a break of an agency.

76
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,656
The accident put it on jeopardy.

77
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,920
Which is what I have wanted you to see for yourself

78
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,797
how my effects ... Say!

79
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,173
Bit better. With commercial time in three million per thirty,

80
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:04,578
I need Pavarotti.

81
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:35,815
Twitch, and I'll be watching grey matter of the walls.

82
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:57,052
- What?
- And how is lgor?

83
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,452
He'd better not snore.

84
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,859
Oh, sounds the noisy makes keep you up,

85
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,337
So sharp toe nails.

86
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:05,056
It's all funny, Jarod.

87
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:08,096
- Will you tell me what it means?
- Ask lgor.

88
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:11,262
Right. ''He knows the secret.''

89
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,818
Can we do the kwit dance another time?

90
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:17,061
Sure, if you tell the secret of who I am.

91
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,096
You know I cann't help you with that one.

92
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:22,533
Well, then I cann't help you with this one.

93
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:25,616
But I have a god's feeling.

94
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,541
You figure it all out.

95
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,615
What're you looking at?

96
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:43,094
And now we've got Marianne Bosha live on the scene.

97
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:47,502
Friendship and Fire. As tragedy striked at the filming of Blaster beer commercial.

98
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:50,054
Stuntman Dave Dugger was hospitalized

99
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,732
with severe burns and head trauma.

100
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:55,342
who attending to drive this Cadillac through out an exploding billboard.

101
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,457
Although a small explosion was planned

102
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,132
witnesses describe the one occured as massive.

103
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,720
Well, our thoughts and prayers,

104
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,521
at secure ...

105
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,577
as well as Blaster brewery,

106
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:06,578
that make us blaster beers

107
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,555
all with Dave Dugger and Dugger family.

108
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,495
We all wish Dave Dugger's recovery.

109
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,138
In meantime, we want an internal investigation.

110
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,096
to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident.

111
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,977
Adding irony a pain,

112
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,733
this stunt was maximized by Dugger's long time FX coordinator,

113
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,741
and childhood friend Mickey Clausen.

114
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,657
Dave and me have done some of the stunts a hundren times.

115
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:31,415
I ... I ... don't know what went wrong.

116
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,260
Dave is my best friend.

117
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,261
Excuse me.

118
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,517
Dave Dugger's hospitalized in the intense care unit of Queen of Hope hospital.

119
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,012
His prognosis remains uncertain.

120
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:52,057
''Tragedy on Blaster Beer Set''

121
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,299
We thought it's a lot of times expensive in this campaign, Jarod.

122
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,381
Blaster brewery spend millions to launch this new beer.

123
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:02,258
That's why I hire Jarod, Mr. Connelly. He will make your beer blast through America's TV on Super Sunday.

124
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:03,259
I like ...

125
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,340
Let me show you what we have in mind.

126
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:09,252
- You remember Ray Slater. He's my assistant.
- I was Mickey Clausen's assistant.

127
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,658
we redesigned the stunt, so that the Blast trajectory blows over the car,

128
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:17,520
it'll be safer, yet larger blast.

129
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:18,978
It'll be a shot to die for.

130
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:22,102
Hey, Jarod, you have to show your brainstorm to the director.

131
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:25,438
- lan? Ian?
- Yes.

132
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,878
lan Tottenham, this is Jarod Lugosi, a new special effects coordinator.

133
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,979
Hello, Jaord.

134
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,294
We've all seen explosions,

135
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,097
but we need the audience to feel the explosion,

136
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,862
touch it, taste it,

137
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,942
cry for it.

138
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:41,658
Excuse me.

139
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:46,339
Cry for it?

140
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,217
He's pump us and then secure,

141
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,653
But he want a clear directing might .. glu spot.

142
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,713
Sounds revealing.

143
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,619
So you are up to speed on the campaign concept?

144
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,338
Well, I've never actually seen any of the commercials.

145
00:08:58,783 --> 00:08:59,818
Show him spots.

146
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:06,016
The campaign concept involves around two young guys.

147
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,258
Sean and Joey.

148
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:10,103
- Who finds tickets to the big game
- In a case of Blaster beer.

149
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,897
- So now they are driving across America...
- In Blastermobile.

150
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,617
- to make a time for gig-off.
- the gig get them lost.

151
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,461
In our first spot, they winded in Louisiana.

152
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:20,211
and an old Cajun guy tells them to go west.

153
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,619
- so they blast off...
- And they end up here

154
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,052
Wow, check it out, dude!

155
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,857
Polar bears, penguins,

156
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:31,482
Santa Clause.

157
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:33,776
Dude, I don't think this is California!

158
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,180
No, man. This is Cream Day.

159
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,377
Let's punk!

160
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,261
Aren't they big talking frogs!

161
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,419
So who are these talking frogs?

162
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,023
Last year's big commercial?

163
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,776
This year will be all Sean and Joey

164
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,940
who in the last spot finally make it to California

165
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,215
- But they ...
- use too much Blaster power

166
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,256
and they end up overshooting in San Diego

167
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,418
when they are crashing a billboard on a beach in Tijuana.

168
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,136
Isn't that great?

169
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,142
So let me get this straight.

170
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:13,822
There are people out there who will buy your beers

171
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:17,300
based upon two guys who are not only two ... to read a map.

172
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,098
but simple-minded enough to drive through an exploding billboard?

173
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:22,651
That's our target market.

174
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:26,073
Jarod, we've got three days to finish this spot make it on your date.

175
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,074
Can you make a scene?

176
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,142
Like Pavarotti.

177
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:34,592
I need some remote control to do whatever it does but I can't find it.

178
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:38,813
I'm sure it's whereabout its line with the clues he's given us.

179
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:41,813
Come on, lgor, do something.

180
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,539
Catch on fire, ring a bell...

181
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,017
Help me!

182
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,739
Syd, give me your cell phone.

183
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,257
Audio-sense triggering mechanism.

184
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,899
Just like spontaneous combustion that blew up that crate in my office.

185
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,533
Jarod is annoying, but he is clever.

186
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,854
..., Brootsie.

187
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:20,416
It'll take my fingers off.

188
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:22,978
Give it to me.

189
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:26,978
My name is lgor.

190
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:31,218
''Ring a bell'', lgor knows the secret.

191
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,819
Igor knows the secret.

192
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,520
Igor knows the...Igor knows the secret.

193
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:39,172
That's it?

194
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,581
Another dead end.

195
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:43,057
You look just like her

196
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,758
You look just like her.

197
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,415
Just like whom?

198
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:54,699
Your mother.

199
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:58,099
lgor knows the secret about your mother.

200
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,742
Cancle clever. Jarod is just annoying.

201
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,061
Broots, I want you to search the man from DSAs, anything else you can think of.

202
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,697
Sydney, check your files. Any reference to lgor,

203
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,153
a name, anagram or acronym, whatever.

204
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,101
Ok, Jarod, you got my attention.

205
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:36,538
You think we're going to need stuntman for the shoe gag?

206
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:39,219
Not if we caught the socks with ...

207
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,414
We can put rubbers mat on the shoes.

208
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,457
- That toys came pretty sample?
- It's a model kit.

209
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,879
Didn't build models when you were a kid?

210
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,858
I built the Empire State building once.

211
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:59,400
And I carved the design of what later became the AMC Pacer out of a bar of soap.

212
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:00,579
It wasn't my best work.

213
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,122
How long have you been on the program?

214
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:06,832
Your ... chip.

215
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,896
I've been sober five years and unchanged.

216
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:10,832
That's great.

217
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,802
Dave Dugger sponsored me on the program.

218
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,742
He was the stuntman that was burned.

219
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,834
Dave is the reason I'm sober today.

220
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,853
And you know, he is the reason I'm alive.

221
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,776
Sounds like a good friend to have.

222
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,633
So what I think it is?

223
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,419
She was built before the fire.

224
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,897
That's what happened when you go to have in the potassium chlorate.

225
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:39,061
Is that what Brynne's investigation concluded?

226
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,852
They know Mickey Clausen screwed up. Case closed.

227
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,155
I just find it hard to understand how he can screw up so badly.

228
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:49,298
I mean every effects coordinator knows how reactive PC is.

229
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,282
At show base,

230
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,091
you want to keep good rep,

231
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,683
you get to produce the flash and fx.

232
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,422
So you think Mickey put his best friend in harms way to,

233
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,972
enhance his reputation?

234
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,021
As much as I hate to say.

235
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,322
That's exactly I will say.

236
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:20,937
Halitosis.

237
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:22,798
Excuse me?

238
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,559
The creature from death breath.

239
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:30,461
Now that is destined to become a classical among special effects ...

240
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,303
Do I know you?

241
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,604
I am Jarod Lugosi.

242
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:37,199
I was wondering if I might pick your brain for a minute.

243
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:38,462
Yeah, this is the first.

244
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:42,123
Guy who replaces me on the job comes to ask me for some point.

245
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,421
I always learn from the best.

246
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:51,373
Those are your folks?

247
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,674
Those are Dave Dugger's parents.

248
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,941
You and Dave are really close, ah?

249
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,642
Yeah, like brothers. His folks practically raised me.

250
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,897
But my days in Dugger's family are over.

251
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,411
Because of the accident?

252
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:07,912
I must have miscalculated the amount of the oxidizer.

253
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:09,318
What's that you think happened?

254
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,601
Well, cars don't blow up by themselves.

255
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:15,095
Were you able to detect anything when you watch the dailies?

256
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,202
I cannot watch them.

257
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,638
Here.

258
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:20,522
I want you to take them.

259
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:25,571
I can't see on tape what I see in my nightmares.

260
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:29,579
I just wish it were me in that car.

261
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,061
Have you seen Dave or his parents since the accident?

262
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,972
I can't face him. I can't face his folks.

263
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:45,597
Not after this.

264
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:48,073
If you don't go to the hospital,

265
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,338
they will never know how you feel.

266
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,475
Don't lose the people that you love.

267
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,080
Guy, may you have a good ride. Let's go!

268
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:26,939
How this happened?

269
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,312
Get him out of it.

270
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,717
Help me, help me!

271
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:36,618
Oh, no!

272
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:02,096
How this happen? Get him out...

273
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,375
There wasn't one explosion.

274
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:07,982
There were two.

275
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:19,075
You look just like her. lgor knows the secret. My name is Igor. My name...my name is Igor.

276
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:22,281
- What's wrong with the Igor, Broots?
- I don't know. I don't know what it is.

277
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:25,016
Forget lgor. What do you mean you didn't find anything?

278
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,773
I searched the main frame, checked all the DSA logs.

279
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:31,179
Just no acronyms, no anagrams, nothing on Igor.

280
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:36,141
And I went through my files but I find anything pertaining to anyone but that name.

281
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:40,142
Igor knows the secret. Figure it out. I've got to get feeling.

282
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,202
Shut that thing up or I swear to God I'll shoot it.

283
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:44,577
It's out of function. That is automatic.

284
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:46,978
Don't, Miss Parker.

285
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,679
... got to get feeling.

286
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:52,202
Got feeling.

287
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,712
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

288
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:03,500
How to get feeling?

289
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:17,801
Hi.

290
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,319
I am so sorry. I never meant...

291
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,398
Mickey.

292
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,253
Now the gag would look something like this.

293
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,921
That's it's. I've seen bigger rubber burns.

294
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,322
Those snikers were supposed to step in rock of fuel.

295
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,274
Maybe we should use some our rubber...

296
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:01,796
Just make it big.

297
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:05,397
But not too big. We got millions of dollars invested in Joey and Sean.

298
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:07,634
You should ... on some ... stunt..

299
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,577
That's supposed to be cold supplement and petrol.

300
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:16,723
Okay, first of all, lan, it's not called petrol. Maybe in your country they are called petrol. But over here in America, we call it gas!

301
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,324
- And second of all, have you been snipping son ...
- Okay, people.

302
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,899
He is right. The gasoline is way too volatile.

303
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:24,735
Safety doesn't sell beer. Flash does.

304
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,875
I got a day and half left on the shoot. Jarod, work with me here.

305
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:29,761
I have an idea, Jarod.

306
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:45,778
Napalm.

307
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:47,579
Napalm?

308
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:49,918
Where did you get it?

309
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,819
I made it.

310
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:54,594
You make your own napalm?

311
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,602
Mickey told me how.

312
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:01,480
With right balance, you can create massive explosion under control burn.

313
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,760
It's perfect for the shoe gag.

314
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,473
You might have a future in this business.

315
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:19,731
The tape from inside lgor is a security record of sublevel twenty-seven.

316
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:22,139
So that's what it looked like before it burned.

317
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:24,698
April 12, 1970.

318
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,621
The day before your mother died.

319
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,058
Mom!

320
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:32,692
Mr. Fenigor?

321
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,577
Mr. Fenigor? Fen…

322
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:36,739
lgor!

323
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,456
Can you recognize him?

324
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,017
Too damn dark.

325
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,180
Did you find out where they're keeping Timmy?

326
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,340
He's in room 155.

327
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:47,495
I've got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight.

328
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,278
I have got a feeling something's going to happen.

329
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,679
can't escape ... special camera records us now.

330
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,017
I can't have to warn people finding out about these.

331
00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,895
I'll take care of it.

332
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,174
The children's lives depend on us.

333
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:03,612
Who the hell is Timmy?

334
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,133
Somebody Mr. lgor was trying to help my mother rescue.

335
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:07,538
One was Jarod.

336
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:08,972
Syd, do you remember Timmy?

337
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,978
I want more co-operation next time.

338
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,498
Who is that?

339
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,222
When can I go home, Dr. Raines?

340
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,380
In good time, Timmy.

341
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,855
He's crying, Sydney.

342
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,656
He's scared.

343
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,662
- I want to talk to him.
- No, Jarod.

344
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:40,663
Come on.

345
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,382
It was one of Raines' project.

346
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,263
And if this was going on on in SL twenty-seven...

347
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,340
Timmy must have been...

348
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,853
one of Raines' experiments.

349
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:52,454
Broots

350
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,375
Run in Fenigor. I need to know who he is.

351
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,982
And Sydney, you go through your files again into searching for anything on Timmy.

352
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,174
We're going to find room 155.

353
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,740
What? You mean SL twenty-seven?

354
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:05,818
Again?

355
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:10,972
My mother wasn't afraid to go down there. Are you?

356
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,378
Oh, Yeah!

357
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:13,554
That's Raines' secrets in sublevel.

358
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,255
If he finds out we have been down there, He'll have us killed.

359
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,859
Then make sure he doesn't find out.

360
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,015
With the smoke, it's fire.

361
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:49,458
You shut up?

362
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,898
I've been sober 5 years and unchanged.

363
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:41,217
There is actually nothing on Fenigor.

364
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,740
And the only sound of Timmy's stay in the Center

365
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,881
is a simple discharge ...

366
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,453
signed by then Dr. Raines,

367
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:54,098
dated April 14, 1970.

368
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:57,739
The day after my mother was killed. How coincidental!

369
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:01,054
Hey, look!

370
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,694
''Lindbergh Baby Kidnapped''
- Jes

371
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:07,020
How long has the Center been doing this stuff down here?

372
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:10,261
Are you going to browse or you are going to help us find ...?

373
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:12,898
- Sydney, what else do Timmy's records reveal?
- Very little.

374
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:16,135
No last name, no forwarding addresses.

375
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,462
Common for a routine discharge.

376
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:23,179
Well, if it was so common then why was my mother so intending to rescue him?

377
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,978
Like the creature said: ''lgor knows the secret.''

378
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:33,381
The secret as to what got my mother killed maybe even who murdered her.

379
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:35,255
Easy, Parker.

380
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,261
One stopped at the time.

381
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,615
The information you are talking about could get us all killed.

382
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,616
Miss Parker.

383
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,298
What the hell...?

384
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,499
What is that?

385
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,496
It's a neuro-electric chair.

386
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,656
For a kid? I think I'm going to hurl!

387
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:18,055
I remember rumours about clandestine experiments involving brain-waves manipulation.

388
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:22,776
No wonder my mother was trying to save Timmy,

389
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,941
save all the children. This is unbelievable.

390
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:26,942
Hey, guys

391
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:29,182
Let's get out of here.

392
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,977
This place was trashed in a fire, we'll never know for sure what's happened to Timmy.

393
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,539
Maybe, maybe not.

394
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:38,501
What are you thinking, Einstein?

395
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,935
Let's bring in Angelo.

396
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:46,543
Maybe he can empath what happened down here.

397
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:50,419
What are you doing?

398
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:52,100
You cannot sell off your business.

399
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,901
This is your life's work.

400
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:56,651
Tell that to Dave Dugger and his parents.

401
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,378
Mickey, they are just trying to ... what happened.

402
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:01,494
Hollywood just ... what happened.

403
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,934
There is no stuntman in this town would work with me again.

404
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:06,617
I cannot believe that.

405
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:09,337
Everybody in town knows how wonderful you are at your job.

406
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:12,258
You are only as good as your last project.

407
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:14,258
It is over, Jarod.

408
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:18,061
- Alright, I'll buy it all.
- Excuse me.

409
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:18,939
I'll buy everything.

410
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:20,781
Mr. Formaldéhyde.

411
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,857
The lipstick camera you used to trail the cyclops

412
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,532
The bust that you created all these wonderful grotesque figures.

413
00:26:26,823 --> 00:26:28,734
This one is not for sale, alright?

414
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,015
This is Dave Dugger.

415
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,916
We made this bust when our first gig together here.

416
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,698
This is the face I'll always remember.

417
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,913
I do not know what I'm going to do, Jarod.

418
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:51,914
I just...

419
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:55,536
What am I going to do?

420
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:02,822
What's the matter with him? I've never seen him ...!

421
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,253
He is on empath perhaps he is confronting

422
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,660
some negative associations as what he has for SL twenty-seven.

423
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:09,661
It could have meant both.

424
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:17,782
Maybe this was not a good idea.

425
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:20,077
Well if he can tell us something, it is a good idea.

426
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:20,878
Get him in here.

427
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,216
Come on, let's go, Angelo!

428
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:25,496
Angelo, Angelo, tell me what happened here?

429
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:28,136
- Angelo is frightened.
- What happened here, Angelo? Tell me about...

430
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:30,637
- Miss Parker, please.
- Tell me about Timmy.

431
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:37,838
Timmy...Timmy

432
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,061
No more Timmy.

433
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:02,362
- Angelo. Angelo.
- No more Timmy.

434
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,096
Come back, Angelo.

435
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,374
No more Timmy.

436
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,201
- Yeah.
- Ray, It is Jarod.

437
00:28:27,202 --> 00:28:28,202
You're working late.

438
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:30,935
(I do a little arrangement.)

439
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,118
I have got some good news.

440
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:36,434
I just came to the hospital, Dave Dugger regains consciousness and he's asking for you.

441
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,621
Ray, are you there?

442
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:44,122
Yeah.

443
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,178
It's ... that's great news, Jarod.

444
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:49,138
I'm on my way.

445
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:55,139
- Is he ok?
- Angelo.

446
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,222
Can you hear me?

447
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:01,941
Angelo, can you speak?

448
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,821
I am sorry, Angelo.

449
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:11,097
Please, talk to me.

450
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:16,418
What you know may help me discover who killed my mother.

451
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:17,619
Angelo.

452
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:21,778
Look, I know how much this information means to you.

453
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,372
But down here will you hit a dead end.

454
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:26,695
Dead end is not our option, Sydney.

455
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:32,896
Somewhere in this hell hole are the answers about Timmy and Igor,

456
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,733
and the truth about what happened to my mother.

457
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:39,418
And it's time to take a look in the Raines' private deal and safe files.

458
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,319
Hey, Dave.

459
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:56,772
Are you awake?

460
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,473
Of course.

461
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:01,857
Hard to talk.

462
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:08,019
How are you doing?

463
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,778
(I am not likely to go to dance.)

464
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,178
I am sorry.

465
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:21,135
Don't get on soft on me, Ray.

466
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,212
Now that have drawn Mickey left me…

467
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:34,698
I need my real friends to be strong.

468
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,295
You are the only real friend that I have left.

469
00:30:45,183 --> 00:30:46,696
What's up, buddy?

470
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:49,534
Your hands are shaking.

471
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,701
I started to drink again, Dave.

472
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,092
Why?

473
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:01,297
It is the guilt.

474
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:03,618
About what?

475
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:07,421
The ... I did to you.

476
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,502
I don't understand.

477
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,613
Mickey didn't do this to you.

478
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:21,212
He was looking out for you.

479
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:24,292
But Brynne, she would take no for answer.

480
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,335
One day she talked to me about the explosions

481
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:30,252
and I told her about my napalm and gave her a little demonstration.

482
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:34,212
When the explosion happened, I know she's stolen some and put it on the radiator.

483
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:38,093
I confronted her about it, and she threatened to off me if I talked.

484
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,819
With my background, nobody's going to believe me?

485
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:43,697
My career, my family

486
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,858
my life would have been oversewd.

487
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,658
I sold you and Mickey out to save myself.

488
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:00,376
I am sorry, Dave. I am so sorry.

489
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:07,696
It's ok, Ray.

490
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:18,135
The first step towards forgiveness,

491
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,455
is telling the truth.

492
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:09,051
Hello, Brynne?

493
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:10,812
It is Jarod.

494
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:13,454
I made an explosive break-through,

495
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,052
and I would like you the first see it.

496
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,177
Would you come to the set, before two o'clock tomorrow?

497
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:21,698
Wonderful.

498
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:33,499
Jarod.

499
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,558
You should know I make it apart to never get intimate with any of the man I work with.

500
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:43,301
Like it's for us. The job ends today.

501
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:45,753
But we still work here.

502
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,699
I get to tell you I put so much napalm on that billboard.

503
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:50,432
When this Cadillac hits it,

504
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:54,279
it's going to explode like Baghdad during the Gulf War.

505
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,538
Watch.

506
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:14,619
Hey, Brynne, why don't we take Cadillac for a little spin before we turn...?

507
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,920
Okay.

508
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:23,721
Thank you sir.

509
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:27,898
(Your belt.)

510
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:38,219
Do you have something special in mind?

511
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:41,439
Actually I thought of driving you into that billboard.

512
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:44,236
- What?
- Don't worry.

513
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:47,321
I've set it up to be very bit safe as you set up for Dave Dugger.

514
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:50,579
I even spill Ray's homemade napalm all over the radiator.

515
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:52,398
Just like you did to Dave.

516
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,333
I am out of here.

517
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:54,917
Oh, there is no point of struggling.

518
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:57,013
You know how strong ... glu is.

519
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:58,814
You created the commercial for it.

520
00:34:58,983 --> 00:34:59,872
Are you insane?

521
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:01,998
People thought I was when I set myself on fire.

522
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,180
But I did remember to put on the suit and cover myself with Zel-jell.

523
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:06,633
So I should be just fine.

524
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,917
I am sure Dave Dugger would take the same precautions.

525
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:15,973
But how was he supposed to know that you re-did another explosion for inside of his car?

526
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:17,737
I don't know what you're talking about.

527
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:21,614
Well, maybe a little 3rd degree burn will help your memory.

528
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:23,015
Jarod.

529
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:25,737
Oh, come on, Brynne.

530
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,239
You will be a shot to die for, remember?

531
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:29,418
Jarod, please!

532
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:31,182
Why would you put napalm on the radiator?

533
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,354
The bigger the explosion the better the commercial?

534
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:34,762
You tell me something.

535
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,640
What demographic says that the beer sales are more important than that man's life.

536
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,854
The commercial had been ... lost in account.

537
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,355
What about what Mickey Clausen lost?

538
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:43,956
What about Dave Dugger?

539
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,180
They lost everything. The only thing you could have lost was just a job.

540
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:48,776
Just a job?

541
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:51,055
I work my ... to get what I am.

542
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:52,254
It is a boys' club.

543
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:58,576
Through glass ceilings I am not about to lose it all because a funky special effects guy was too soft to do the job we paid him for.

544
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,876
You know something, Brynne?

545
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:04,276
I don't think your ...agency is going to be giving your ... officer after all this.

546
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:05,936
Look on the bright side,

547
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,876
maybe you have a career ahead of you.

548
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:09,477
In stunt work.

549
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,678
Jarod, Jarod.

550
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,279
Jarod.

551
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,080
No, Jarod.

552
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:41,636
- Did the camera record all that, Mickey?
- We got we want.

553
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:45,452
That's rep.

554
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:51,538
I found Timmy.

555
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,261
In Raines archives.

556
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:56,518
Run them.

557
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:18,678
Mrs Parker, what are you doing here?

558
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:21,254
I came by to visit Timmy.

559
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,274
I don't think that's a good idea.

560
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:27,651
Well, Dr Raines, my husband thinks it's important my visit with hold the children.

561
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:30,799
Wait here.

562
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
Hi.

563
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:38,201
Timmy, my name is Catherine. How are you doing?

564
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:41,072
I miss my mum and dad..

565
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:43,252
I know you do, honey.

566
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,617
Come on, Timmy!

567
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:55,858
That's it?

568
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,923
Well, there is another one dated on the following day.

569
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:10,424
No, no. Timmy.

570
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:14,816
You ... to come in here.!

571
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,917
My god.

572
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:17,855
What have you done to that little boy?

573
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:19,522
It was an experiment!

574
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:21,694
My husband was ... for this!

575
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,743
You don't know your husband as well as you think you do.

576
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:27,442
I advise you remain quiet about this.

577
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,493
You know what's best for you.

578
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:34,394
Timmy!

579
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:46,417
Raines, what you can do with Timmy now?

580
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,859
There is no Timmy any more.

581
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:52,441
From now on, he is being called…

582
00:38:54,783 --> 00:38:55,532
Angelo.

583
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,921
Is Timmy Angelo?

584
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,119
What, what Raines do to him?

585
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:14,980
Somehow his emotions,

586
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:18,302
his ability to relate to the physical world,

587
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,794
were driven invert.

588
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:24,839
And gave Angelo his unique gift.

589
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:27,540
But took away his life.

590
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:30,791
Were you involved in this?

591
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:32,276
If I had known about this,

592
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,331
I would have done everything in my power to stop it.

593
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,536
And then you were dead.

594
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:38,361
Just like my mother.

595
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:50,118
So you actually sold your effects stuff?

596
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:53,432
Yeah, I know, I know. I don't suppose you will be willing to sell it back.

597
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:55,133
For the right price.

598
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:56,334
Then charge him double.

599
00:39:56,623 --> 00:39:58,554
It's ... think he did this to me.

600
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:03,619
Thanks a lot, Jarod.

601
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,220
Hi, Mickey.

602
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:16,221
Mickey.

603
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:50,721
Timmy is gone.

604
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:35,961
White choose the ... variation,

605
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:39,435
to answer the blacks, ... in defence.

606
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:40,841
Very good, Jarod.

607
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,073
Who are you, Mr. lgor?

608
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:01,071
Sydney, when do I get to meet that boy?

609
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:02,859
He is gone.

610
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:04,160
What do you mean ''gone''?

611
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:06,161
I received a copy of paperwork today.

612
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:08,559
Dr. Raines released him.

613
00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:10,972
Did he do something wrong?

614
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,862
He wasn't special.

615
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,954
You were special, Timmy.

616
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:42,355
What?

617
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,333
How are you coming with my ..feeling?

618
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:46,392
You need to ask?

619
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:49,295
Why the game, with the creature, why not just tell me?

620
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,737
Sometimes the destination isn't as important as the journey.

621
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:57,074
Well, where on your journey,

622
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,160
did you find that... ?

623
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,613
In one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.

624
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:05,863
Like her wedding ring and medical file.

625
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:08,775
Oh, you will be surprised what one could find in there.

626
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:09,676
Jarod.

627
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:11,440
You know the dance, Miss Parker.

628
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,457
You help me with one of my secrets,

629
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:16,658
I help you with one of yours.

630
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:21,078
We weren't able to find anything about lgor or Fenigor.

631
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,943
I don't know if he was my mother's ... or betrayer.

632
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,462
Keep searching.

633
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:31,038
lgor, he holds the secrets to both our pasts.

634
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:32,597
What makes you so sure?

635
00:43:33,198 --> 00:43:33,798
Call it,

636
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:35,621
you got feeling.

637
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
''FX''
End
