00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:38,797
Man likes to know when he's about to
have his throat ripped out and fed to him.

168
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,065
It didn't seem important.

169
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,266
Important?

170
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,332
Does that look important?

171
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,937
Fleets of these behemoths,
like crazed flying monkeys...

172
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,847
terrorizing U.S. citizens
from Seattle to Miami.

173
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,908
Terrorizing?

174
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,480
Halcion gas.
C.I.A. created it in 1971.

175
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,255
- 1969.
- I knew it. You're one of them.

Would you stop, please?

177
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:11,729
This is a mass hallucinogen.
This is pretty potent.

178
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,659
Well, not anymore.
I cut it with 50% oxygen.

179
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:17,827
Hell, your dentist
has stronger stuff.

180
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:20,393
Even so, I caught
an accidental whiff.

181
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,531

182
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:27,668
- Your point being?
- Remember the medfly?

183
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:30,179
No such thing.

184
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,807
Lock your doors
and bolt your windows, amigo.

185
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,875
The exterminator's coming,
and his name is SkyVionics.

186
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:39,582
- SkyVionics?
- Merchants of death. Trust me.

187
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,057
I've been a clown

- Excuse me?
- What's your drink?

00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:32,207
Uh, I was raised on optimized

198
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,541
hearts of palm, wheatgrass,
asparagus mixed with tomato.

Virgin Mary,
celery garnished.

I'm expecting company.

201
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,110
Mm-hmm.

<i>So, Lieutenant Gant...</i>

211
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:39,505
why is the air force so concerned
with a civilian flier?

212
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:43,444
You're testing a system that's designed
to protect military pilots.

213
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,482
It's my job to make sure
it's safe.

214
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,483
And I'm up for wingman
on Friday's test.

00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:50,076
I don't fly avionics

217
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:54,323
True.

218
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:58,521
Now, from what I understand,
Collins had plenty of time to eject.

219
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,120
Time, yes.

220
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:03,632
Ability, no.

221
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,566
His record in the Gulf
says otherwise.

222

Well, between me and you
and that wall of fame...

223
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,866
Collins didn't eject
because he blacked out.

His drink of choice was not a Virgin Mary.

- Is that true?
- You can take my word for it...

227

or steal my report
from the Special Projects Office in D.C.

228
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,017
Now that would be impossible.

229

Look, not even his wife fought the allegations,
and they cost her his pension.

230

- But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday.

244

You don't want a repeat of the last test.

245
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:32,381
We won't.
This time no test pilot's gonna let me down.

246
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,924
Ron Collins could have
flown circles around you two.

247
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:38,393
Instead he hit the bottle.
I'm surprised you missed that.

248
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,659
I called him on it the morning of the test.
He said he was fine.

249
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,495
So it wasn't
a mechanical failure.

250
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,967
The residual alcohol
in his blood...

251
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,971
caused him to black out
when he pulled too many g's.

252
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,007
Collins was flying a safe plane.

253
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,235
I'm sure he was.

it unzipped an executable

00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:43,678
Cool.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>SkyVionics Radio...</i>

501
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,758
has reached the end
of another broadcast day.

502
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:55,853
This is Eagle, signing off.

503
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,396
Let's go.

504
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:02,766
<i>[Jarod]</i>
<i>Yee-haw.!</i>

505
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,362
This is so cool.

506
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:15,148
<i>[General]</i>
<i>Matthews.</i>

507
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:18,617
The government wants a refund.

508
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:33,660
<i>Oh.!</i>

509
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,662
Yes!

510
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,129
Mom! Mom! Come look at this!

511
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,233
Well, I guess it's not easy
living next to a nutcase.

512
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:44,098
You're not crazy,
Mr. Hollis.

513
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,868
I believe everything
you've told me.

514
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:50,900
<i>I'm still not sure about</i>
<i>the Eleanor Roosevelt thing.</i>

515
00:41:52,914 --> 00:41:57,078
There is another piece of information
that I'd like you to keep your eye on.

516
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:59,176
What's that?

517
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,823
It's in Delaware.

518
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:04,825
Blue Cove.

519
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,952
A place called the Centre.

520
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:10,555
Now, that's the only map
you're ever gonna find it on.

521
00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:15,899
It's a dangerous place. People should be
made aware, if you know what I mean.

522
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,370
Oh, yeah.

523
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,373
This is real ripe.

524
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,432
I'll spread the word.

525
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,501
I'm counting on it.

526
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,111
- Good luck.
- You too.

527
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,785
Uh, Jarod.

528
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:37,924
I don't know what it is you're after,
but I hope you find it.

<i>[Country]</i>

530
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,580
Miss Parker.

531

<i>You're Miss Parker.</i>

532
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:17,791
- That's right.
- Hmm.

533
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:32,211
- <i>[Sam] What is it?</i>
- Silly Putty.

534
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,409
Do you have a mirror?

535
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:44,354
"Late pilot cleared of error."

536
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,970
Nothing.

537
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:12,782
<i>[Man] I'm beginning to dread that</i>
<i>the Parker killer instinct wasn't hereditary.</i>

538
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:17,814
- I'll find him, sir.
- Let me be perfectly clear.

539
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:21,419
Jarod is not
some minor inconvenience...

540
00:44:21,496 --> 00:44:25,398
for you to pad
your Centre expenses with.

541
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,991
I understand, Mr. Raines.

542
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,093
We're ready for you, sir.

543
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,763
