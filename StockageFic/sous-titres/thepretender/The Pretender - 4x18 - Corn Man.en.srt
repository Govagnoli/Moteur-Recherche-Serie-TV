00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:03,035
[Jarod]
Let me get this straight.

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,435
You buy personal items
for a small amount of money...

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,565
you sell them to perfect
strangers for a lot more money?

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,769
Is America a great country or what?

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,109
- [Bells Jingle]
- Yo, Toni.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,445
- I got a nice surprise for you today.
- You got a job?

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,213
Who needs one when you can
find rich stuff like this?

8
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,619
A digital camcorder.
It's got liquid crystal display...

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,057
digital something, headphone jack.

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,595
Nice!

11
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,756
- Looks like it fell in the river.
- It did.

12
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,232
I found it in the washbasin
below Koomer Falls.

13
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,532
I figure some mope must have been makin'
a home movie and dropped it.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,971
- Give you 20 bucks for it.
- Twenty?

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,134
I was looking for
more like a hundred.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,939
Yeah, and people in hell
are lookin' for ice water.

17
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,311
One Andrew J.
Take it or leave it.

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,817

What's a- a home movie?

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,787
Did you grow up in
a basement or something?

22
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,295
- Or something.
- You know, mom, dad and the kids...

23
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,264

American family vacation...

24
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,562
and record it for posterity...

25
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,628
in case anybody wants to watch it
without a gun to their head.

26
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,139
I would.
I'd love to.

27
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,109
- How much?
- Hundred bucks.

28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,475
Sold.

day four of our vacation...

31
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,135
and today we're officially starting
our trip down memory lane.

32
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,469
Here on the banks of "Kooner"-

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,304
- What is this? A stream or-
- It's a creek. Koomer Creek.

34
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,812
Koomer Creek. Yeah.
Well, whatever it's called...

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,371
- it's beautiful.
- What?

36
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,885
- [Both Laughing]
- [Girl] I thought this was
gonna be stupid, but it's neat.

37
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,421
Really? You mean Mom's
not a complete moron?

38
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,686
- Well, not complete.
- Ha, ha, ha.

39
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,953
So this all used to be
part of Gramps's land?

40
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,495
Yeah. This is where I grew up.

41
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,464
Right over there on that log
is where your dad first kissed me.

42
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,865
Oh, my God.
Look. It's still there.

43
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,869
- What?
- Look.

44
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,701
Here. Let's get a shot.

"Nancy and Ted."

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,203
Dad told me there was
a place near here...

47
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,804
Iike, a cabin or something,
you guys used to go to, to be alone.

48
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,816
Hmm. It's an old mill.

49
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,579
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,315
- Is that where I came from?
- What do you mean "came from"?

51
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,721
Well, you said this trip
was something about my heritage.

52
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,555
- I was just wondering if you and Dad gave-
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

53
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,028
a whole new meaning
to "grinding the corn."

54
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,930
- Let me tell you something, young lady.
- Hitting too close to home.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,993
Um, you know what? I forgot
my fanny pack in the car. I'll be right back.

56
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,005
Okay. You know, this place
actually doesn't suck.

57
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,940
Can't believe you didn't
bring me here before now.

58
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,104
Mom, are you listening to me?

59
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,879
I'm being serious for once,
and she's not listening to me.

60
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,510
[Nancy]
Stop it! No!

61

- Leave me alone!

- Help!

Mom, are you okay?
If you're joking around, this isn't funny.

Where are you?

- Run. Run.

00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,907
- What?
- Run. He's- He's coming back.

Thirty-six hours and he's already demonstrating
more talent than any of our others.

81
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,279
How many people died
because ofwhat I thought up?

82
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,785
Since I broke out, I've spent
every moment searching for my past.

A genius who can become
anyone that he wants to be.

85
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,687
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,695
- [Miss Parker] He defends the weak and abused.
- [Jarod] Life's a gift.

87

- You a doctor?
- I am today.

Oh, I sure hope this is gonna work.

90

- Your car.

[Nancy]
Don't you have something to say?

96
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,617
Um, I had a little accident
in your Mustang.

97
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,391
And we need a new taillight. But Mom's gonna
check and see if they have one here.

98
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,989
And I promise I'll pay for it all.

99

[Nancy]
Yeah, right. Okay, here.

100
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,870
Now, I'm gonna get some gas.

101

if they have a new light.

had a lobotomy.

I can send you one of these.

for decades by her loving husband, Mr. Raines...

123

of the Centre.

124
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,949
Edna knows things about
your mother, Miss Parker.

125

Things she won't tell
to anyone but you.

126
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,517
She wouldn't even tell me.

127
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,526
Edna wants to come home,
but she can't.

128
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,824
There's an army of Sweepers
out there looking for her.

129
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,831
She told me her redemption...

130
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,459
will be to tell you what
she knows before they catch her.

131
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,799
So you better hurry.
Be careful.

132
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,328
And know that Edna said no matter
what happens, she wants you to keep digging.

133
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,433
That the secret your mother
wanted to tell you when you were little...

134
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,308
is buried out there,
and you need to find it.

to order the parts from Flagstaff...

- Well, you're a stranger.

166
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,908
His ghost still haunts strangers
that come into this town.

167
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,953
- I said shut up, Newt.
- You can tell me to shut up all you want.

168
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,955
Corn Man's still a-comin'.

169
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,354
Not that I'm puttin'
any stock in Newt's curse...

170
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,023
but does seem like you've been
havin' a streak of bad luck lately.

171
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,464
I had a couple of women
bash right into me.

172
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,970
They said they were passing through here.
Mother and daughter.

173
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,872
- Driving a red Mustang convertible.
- Oh, they was pretty.

174
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,513
The blondes.

175
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,049
Looked like they could be sisters.

176
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,916
They needed a taillight, as I remember,
but I didn't have one for a '65.

177
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,184
They just got some gas and headed out.
I haven't seen them since.

[Bell Dings]

179
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,858
Fill her up, little brother. And be sure
and put it on the department's account.

180
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,233
You ever get tired of telling me
what to do, big brother?

181
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,402
Brotherly love, you understand?

182
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,741
You must be the guy
the sheriff radioed in about.

183
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,145
Word sure travels fast around here.

184
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,809
Yeah. Well, you know,
we like to stay on top of things.

185
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,445
- Anything I can help you with?
- Actually, maybe you could recommend a motel.

186
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,853
Looks like I'm going 
to be here for a while.

187
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,256
Well, Clearwater Inn's
the only one in town.

188
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,489
Don't get much business, except for
an occasional trucker, but, uh, it's clean.

189
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,588
- I can give you a lift.
- Ah, no, thanks.

190
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,532
Actually, I'd- I'd rather walk.
Get to see your town.

191
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,660
Don't blink.

192
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,329
You'll miss it.

195
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,660
I've always wanted to stay
at a zero-star resort.

196
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,464
Leigh, try and be nice
for five minutes.

197
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,697
I am being nice.

198
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,979
- [Man] Welcome to Clearwater Inn.
- [Nancy] Thank you.

199
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,450
[Man]
Room's all ready. Room 14.

200
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,579
- [Nancy] Room 14 it is.
- [Man] Presidential suite.

201
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,556
What president stayed here?
Millard Fillmore?

202
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,616
Well, actually,
I just call it that...

203
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,460
so I can charge more
to smart-mouthed kids and their mothers.

204
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,931
[Leigh Chuckles]
Clever.

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,935
I'm sure it'll be just fine.

206
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,836
Thank you, Raymond.
Come on. Let's go.

208
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,578
Hello.

209
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,213
I'd like to rent a room, please.

210
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,692
Fill this out. Be sure and put down
the make and model of your car.

211
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,991
- Actually, I'm going to need a rental.
- Uh, two blocks that way.

212
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,657
- And good luck with what you get.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

213
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,634
Just want to drive around.
It's beautiful here.

214
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,966
[Chuckles]
Well, that's in the eyes of the beholder.

215
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,370
Some friends of mine
seemed to have thought so.

216
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,308
As a matter of fact, I think they stayed here
a couple of days ago. A mother and daughter.

217
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,607
Beautiful, blonde.

218
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,014
Mmm. Don't remember 'em.

219
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,019
I hear you only get
the occasional trucker through here.

220
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,215
Surely you remember
two beautiful women in a red convertible.

221
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,056
Hmm. Well, you'd think I would.

222
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,392
But I don't, because they weren't here.

223
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,595
Here we go.

224
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,307
Think we'll put you
in room number five.

225
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,571
I'll take number 14, please.

226
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,579
It's my favorite number.

227
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,672
Sure.

228
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,686
Fourteen it is then.

229
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,471
Yeah, there's someone here
asking about 'em.

230
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,946
Even knew what room they were in.

231
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,410
Mom. Do you believe in ghosts?

232
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,454
- [Nancy] Ghosts?
- Yeah. You know, the souls of the dead.

233
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,819
They can come back to haunt the living.

234
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,791
I don't know, honey.
I never really gave it that much thought.

235
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,919
[Leigh]
Then how do you explain those flashes?

236
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,929
[Nancy]
It's called heat lightning.

237
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,900
- And it's been happening
around here for a long time.
- Whatever it is, it's freaky.

238
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,200
Like that story that guy was telling me
back at the gas station.

239
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,240
You know, the one that gave me this.

240
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,435
He was telling me about the curse.

241
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,876
- All strangers are cursed.
- Hmm.

242
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:11,246
It all started back when some Corn Man
hacked up a family out by Grandpa's old ranch.

243
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,650
[Nancy] Honey, that's just an old tale
that people have been telling for years.

244
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,280
It's ridiculous.

245
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,325
- I hope so.
- It is.

246
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,326
Okay.

247
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:26,660
- Wait. How do you turn this off again?
- Little red button.

248
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,368
- Mom.
- What?

249
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,200
- Mom, there's somebody out there.
- What? Where?

250
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,105
By the tree. He was standing-
He's staring at me.

251
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,803
[Nancy]
Okay.

252
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,971
Look.

253
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,972
[Nancy]
I don't see anyone.

254
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,415
He was right there by the tree.
I swear.

255
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,785
[Nancy] If there was someone there,
they're not there now.

256
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,348
He warned us we'd be in danger.
Maybe he was right.

257
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,360
Maybe the Corn Man's coming, Mom.

258
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,986

That's not happening.

I'm growing kind of attached to the place.

or a home to go back to?

I have to talk to you
about your wife and your daughter.

- Trouble? What do you mean?
I- I just spoke with them.

- This morning.

They said they were fine.
What's the problem?

335

We've had a minor car accident.

336
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:39,430
Well, that's strange.
Nancy didn't mention anything about it.

337
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,365
That is strange.

338
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,926
That car must mean a lot to you.

339
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:47,532
Actually, it was your daughter
who was driving. Leigh.

340

She backed into me.

341
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:52,946
Uh, your wife gave me the name
and number of your insurance company...

342

Is your wife expected home soon?

344
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:01,481
No. They're both still out of town. Look. All my
insurance is handled through Western Mutual.

345
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:03,717
But, you know, I prefer
to handle this myself.

So why don't you get an estimate,
and I'll send you a check for the full amount.

Yes, but I would not- Uh-

I can only assume
she couldn't face the world any longer.

I'll miss her so much.

Is that why you kept her
locked up for 30 years?

That was to protect her.

You never protected anyone
but yourself, Raines.

368
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:15,417
You can bury her again, Raines.

I wouldn't bring in any outside help.

Row 14, plot six.

493
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,645
That's my mother's grave.

494
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:43,776
Jarod's e-mail said to keep digging.

495
00:32:43,852 --> 00:32:47,219
The answers... are buried out there.

496
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:52,721
You don't think Jarod
wants you to dig her up?

497
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,497
Miss Parker, it's your mother's grave.

498
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:04,702
Get shovels.
We've got work to do.

499
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:10,034
- [Sighs]
- [Ted's Voice] They're dead.

500
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:13,513
If the kidnappers haven't killed them already,
they will now for sure.

501
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:15,516
[Sighs]

502
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:17,051
What are you doin'?

503
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,952
I'm gonna watch this video again.
Maybe I missed something.

504
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:23,685
Can't believe you didn't
bring me here before now.

505
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,057
[Leigh] Are you okay?
If you'rejoking around, this isn't funny!

506
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,564
- Well, not complete.
- Ha, ha, ha.

507
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:36,968
[Young Jarod's Voice] I've studied
the evidence and read the interviews, but...

508
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,472
it just doesn't make sense.

509
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,805
The answer's right in front of you.
Everything you need is there.

510
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:43,640
- But I can't see it.
- But she can.

511
00:33:43,712 --> 00:33:45,737
See what it is that she sees.

512
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:49,113
Look, Jarod.
Look hard.

513
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,316
Did you see that?

514
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:57,716
What?

515
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,764
That.

516
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:11,904
The answer's there.
It was there the whole time.

517
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:18,742
She sees him.

518
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:21,942
[Frank]
Adams? He was in the parking lot?

519
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,951
[Ted]
Adams? Who's Adams?

520
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:26,487
- My deputy.
- And one of the kidnappers.

521
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:29,149
- Then who's the other one?
- My guess is his brother Kent...

522
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:30,782
from the gas station.

523
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:33,828
- So these guys have gone to kill my family?
- Not if we get to them first.

524
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:36,864
Wait a minute.

525
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,661
- Listen to this.
- [Ted's Voice] Nancy.

526
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:42,135
- [Nancy] Oh, Ted, thank God.
- Are you and Leigh all right?

527
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:44,968
We're a little ground up,
but we're, um- we're alive.

528
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,203
We're a little ground up-
We're a little ground up-

529
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:50,335
- I don't understand.
- "Ground up."

530
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:52,710
On the video,
Leigh kept referring to an old mill.

531
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:56,512
Yeah, near my father-in-law's ranch.
Nancy and I used to go there all the time.

532
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:59,554
You wife was trying to tell you where
she and your daughter were being held.

533
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,249
Let's go.

534
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:05,020
Let's just hope they're still alive.

535
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:18,399
- [Crickets Chirping]
- [Owl Hooting]

536
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:29,582
[Broots] You've made me do a lot of things
I don't want to do, Miss Parker...

537
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:32,518
but this has gotta be the worst.

538
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:34,521
What if someone finds us?

539
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,319
Then you'll just have to hold them off
while I go for help.

540
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:39,326
Oh, great.
That's-That's lovely.

541
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,385
Row 14's over here.

542
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:43,954
[Thunder Rumbling]

543
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:50,136
- [Clank]
- [Broots Whispers] Whoa. Sorry.

544
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:55,237
- I feel like I'm in a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
- [Owl Hoots]

545
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,144
- Wait. What was that?
- Settle down, Shaggy.

546
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:01,205
It's an owl.

547
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:10,481
[Owl Hooting]

548
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,050
This is it.

549
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:17,394
Miss Parker, this just isn't right.

550
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,060
Are you sure you want to do this?

551
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,534
Jarod's done a lot of twisted things...

552
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:28,866
but he would never lead me here
just to torment me.

553
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:32,175
[Thunder Rumbling]

554
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,341
Now dig.

555
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,701
[Vehicle Approaching]

556
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:08,408
[Vehicle Door Opens]

557
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,449
- Where the hell have you been?
- Wright tipped off the sheriff.

558
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,547
- We gotta get out of here.
- No one followed me.

559
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:18,457
That's because I put a bullet
in the leg of the guy who could've.

560
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,461
What about them?

561
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:28,769
This wasn't part of our plan.

562
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:30,930
Yeah, well, plans change,
little brother.

563
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:33,338
They can identify us.

564
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,672
[Grunts]

565
00:37:35,744 --> 00:37:37,143
[Grunts]

566
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:39,942
Leigh, now! Run!

567
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:45,476
I'll get the daughter.
You take care of her.

568
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:59,195
Damn, mom. That hurt.

569
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,701
If that's the way you're gonna be-

570
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,371
Oh, I don't think so.

571
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:08,204
[Groans]

572
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:12,513
- Nancy.
- I'm fine.

573
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,209
But Leigh- She ran out,
and the deputy went after her.

574
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:18,210
[Panting]

575
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,151
[Panting, Whimpers]

576
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:22,349
[Panting]

577
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,465
[Adams]
You can't get away.

578
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,146
[Groans]
Get away from me!

579
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:49,240
Don't work that way.

580
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:52,480
- It's nothing personal. You understand.
- Please. I want to go home.

581
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:55,921
- Just business.
- Please. I want to go home.

582
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,518
- The only place you're going is 
in Koomer's Creek!
- No! [Screams]

583
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:02,188
Stop screamin'.
No one can hear you scream out here.

584
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:03,731
I can.

585
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:10,003
Come here!

586
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:15,236
[Groans]

587
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:44,438
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- [Sobbing]

588
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:47,100
It's okay.
[Whispers] It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

589
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,109
- [Nancy] Leigh.
- Go. Go.

590
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:52,512
- Leigh.
- Leigh.

591
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,140
Baby. Oh.

592
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:03,247
I don't know how to thank you, Jarod.

593
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:05,589
Just take care of them.

594
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:09,863
I will.

595
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:12,058
You ready to go?
Let's go home.

596
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:23,945
[Thunder Rumbling]

597
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:24,934
[Thunder Rumbling]

598
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,607
Well, this is it.

599
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:35,147
Miss Parker, are you sure
you want to do this?

600
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:38,158
- Ah.
- Huh?

601
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:40,217
[Sighs]

602
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,524
- Open it.
- Miss Parker-

603
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:47,125
- [Sighs]
- Why don't we just get the hell out of here...

604
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:49,432
- and let her rest in peace?
- [Sighs]

605
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:54,339
I want to rest in peace.

606
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,934
Now open it.

607
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:05,442
Are you sure?

608
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,082
Go ahead.

609
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,966
[Grunts]

610
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,872
Oh, my God.

611
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,918
- What?
- Miss Parker, your mother-

612
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:42,919
She's not in here.

613
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:08,774
Then where the hell is she?

614
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,731
[Miss Parker]
Jarod, I'm only going to ask you this once.

615
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:31,135
How did you know
she wouldn't be there?

616
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:33,436
- I didn't.
- Then who?

617
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:36,238
Edna did.
She knew all the secrets.

618
00:42:36,311 --> 00:42:38,711
Especially about the Mirage Project.

619
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,180
Unfortunately, 
she took them to her grave.

620
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:44,650
Well, I am sorry for you.
Edna was someone you could've trusted.

621
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:47,483
Unlike the Centre.

622
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,546
Or my family.

623
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:51,956
You were right in putting
your trust in your mother.

624
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,960
She knew the importance of family.

625
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:55,962
Of helping people.

626
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,590
If she kept any secrets from you,
it was to protect you.

627
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:01,499
Protect me from what?

628
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:02,968
The truth.

629
00:43:03,037 --> 00:43:05,267
Keep searching, Miss Parker.

630
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,401
But remember.
You can't believe everything you see.

631
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,309
After all, life is a mirage.

632
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:16,748
Sometimes the things
that scare you the most...

633
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:19,082
can be the things
that save your life.

634
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,382
