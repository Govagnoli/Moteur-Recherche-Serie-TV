The reservation's
under the name Andrews.

170
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,977
Take the case and wait there.

171
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,612
I've done everything you've asked.
<i>Can I at least just see them?

172
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,022
If it were my call,
I'd shoot you in the head right here.

173
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,952
I'll stay in touch.

174
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,571
Will she or won't she?

175
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,073
<i>Only her cardiologist knows for sure.</i>

176
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,312
You should probably stock up on red meat
and doughnuts while you're at it.

177
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,980
I mean, why waste
a perfectly good heart attack?

178
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:47,048
- Have we met?
- Thomas Gates. Friends call me Tommy.

179
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,156
So, what do your friends call you?

180
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,493
- I don't have any friends.
- Oh.

181
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,629
Two years, three months, 21 days.

182
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,235
- What?
- That's how long it's been
since I've had a cigarette.

183
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,714
- How 'bout you?
- I stopped counting. Damn it.

184
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,685
- Do you believe in fate?
- Oh, please.

185
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,687
<i>Come on.

186
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:21,089
A sensible ex-smoker risks her hard-earned
two and a quarter to rejoin the nicotine club.

187
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,960
A vending machine malfunctions,
giving a stranger...

188
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,726
in- in jeans and Pendleton...

189
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,464
time to convince her that she doesn't
really want to belong to that club.

190
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,275
Fate.

191
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:43,611
- <i>[Door Hinges Squeaking]</i>
- <i>[Bells Jingling]</i>

192
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,616
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

193
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,903
[Gasps]

194
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,737
Now, why would someone run away
from the people they loved?

195
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:14,801
Who are you?

196
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,007
Someone who's trying to help you
find your light again.

197
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:32,484
And what were you planning
to do with this?

198
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,192
Get my children back.

199
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:51,343
<i>It was called the M2 Project.</i>

200
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:55,476
I was 22 when they recruited me
from the University of Virginia.

201
00:15:55,553 --> 00:16:00,286
- "They"? Meaning the company?
- The company.

202
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,791
Why was the C.I.A. Interested
in college students?

203
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,523
We were computer analysts,
tops of the class.

204
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:12,563
They took us and trained us
in the creation of covert simulations.

205
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:17,664
- Simulations?
- <i>Hypothetical scenarios.</i>

206
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:21,177
<i>Kidnapping, sabotage, assassination.</i>

207
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:24,373
They told us that the files were
being created for training situations.

208
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,679
How many people
were involved in this M2?

209
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,742
Five, including me.

210
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,811
We all had military background.

211
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,584
I was R.O. <i>T.C.</i>

212
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:36,421
So, you can obviously
handle a firearm.

213
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:41,759
My father was
a champion target shooter.

214
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,823
I was a better shot than him.

215
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,407
[Sighs]

216
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,844
I started reading stories
in the newspaper...

217
00:16:56,914 --> 00:17:01,544
of bombings, terrorist assaults,
political murders...

218
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:04,679
<i>and I recognized them from the files</i>
<i>that we thought up.</i>

219
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:11,720
You have no idea what that's like, to know
people are dying from something you thought up.

220
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:16,289
To have so much innocent blood
on your hands.

221
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,065
I understand.

222
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,002
I begged for a transfer...

223
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,607
and Renfro looked at me
like I'd asked him to give up a kidney.

224
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:36,152
- Renfro?
- Alex E.

225
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:41,084
The man in charge of M2.

226
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,019
So, what happened?

227
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:50,226
I started to ingest
small amounts of poison.

228
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,929
<i>Commercial pesticides.</i>

229
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,631
After a month
of throwing up on my desk...

230
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:58,266
Renfro actually signed
the transfer papers himself.

231
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:07,175
- Where's your husband?
- He walked out on us after Zach was born.

232
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,213
So, after 10 years with no contact
with anyone at M2...

233
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,522
out of nowhere,
they take your children?

234
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,334
It was 10 days ago.

235
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,371
<i>I was finishing the dishes.</i>

236
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,237
<i>Melinda and Zachary were</i>
<i>at the table drawing pictures.</i>

237
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:33,538
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- <i>I heard a knock at the front door.</i>

238
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,636
<i>Not unusual. We get salespeople</i>
<i>in our area all the time.</i>

239
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:40,309
- [Barking]
- <i>Then Maggie, our dog,</i>
<i>started barking in the backyard.</i>

240
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,217
- <i>[Knocking Continues]</i>
- <i>When I heard the knocking again, l-</i>

241
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:47,280
<i>I asked the kids to check on her,</i>
<i>and I went to answer the door.</i>

242
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,521
<i>When I opened it and there was</i>
<i>no one there, my heart stopped instantly.</i>

243
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,619
<i>I knew there was something wrong.</i>

244
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:56,689
<i>I went running to the back of the house,</i>
<i>and the kids were gone.</i>

245
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:00,533
Zachary! Melinda!

246
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:08,801
[Sighs]
I got a call a few minutes later.

247
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,337
I didn't recognize the voice, but...

248
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,408
the message was certainly clear-

249
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,478
I do exactly what they say,
or they kill my children.

250
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,755
I don't know who
they want me to shoot!

251
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,590
They'll tell you when they're ready.

252
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,666
- <i>[Bell Dinging]</i>
- [Horn Honks]

253
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,909
I think the guy's in the bathroom.

254
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,914
Too much applejack.

255
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,815
- Here, let me get that for you.
- I can do it myself.

256
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,819
Thank you.

257
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,896
So, you live up on Bryer, don't you?

258
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,955
<i>Careful.
They have stalking laws in this state.

259
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,059
<i>I'm restoring the split-level</i>
<i>just north of you.</i>

260
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,070
That dump on the hill?

261
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:11,198
There's nothing quite like
discovering a 17 th-century hardwood floor...

262
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:14,073
<i>under a sheet oflime green linoleum.</i>

263
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,044
I can only imagine.

264
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:19,105
Don't you have any passions,
Miss Parker?

265
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:25,052
- You know my name.
- People talk.

266
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,797
"Gates' Restoration.
'Where everything old is new again."'

267
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,061
I wrote that myself.

268
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,569
Move over, Hemingway.

269
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,174
Well...

270
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,574
you have yourself a nice day,
Miss Parker.

271
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,942
I have a feeling you deserve one.

272
00:20:56,987 --> 00:21:00,479
<i>So, the camel says, "Hump her?</i>

273
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,117
I don't even know her!"

274
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:05,127
Hump her.

275
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,686
- It's a- It's a good joke.
- Broots, I need your help.

276
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:10,858
- That joke always kills.
- Focus, Shecky.

277
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,027
- Okay.
- Thomas Michael Gates.

278
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:15,594
- Yeah?
- I want you to run him through the system-

279
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,163
personal history, family background,
the whole nine yards.

280
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:21,143
And I want this information
delivered to my office A.S.A.P.

281
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:23,145
All right. Who is he?

282
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,147
The quicker, the better.

283
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,610
Miss Parker,
did you hear the one about the coyote...

284
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,849
the, uh- the jackal
and the one-eyed armadillo?

285
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:35,391
<i>[Nervous Chuckle]</i>

286
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,159
Oh, well.

287
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,154
Rachel?

288
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:45,633
I downloaded this picture
from the federal archives.

289
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:49,502
- Do you recognize anyone?
- <i>That's Alex Renfro.</i>

290
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:52,064
- Hmm.
- What?

291
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,406
I ran a background check on him.

292
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:57,242
He's suspected in at least
a half a dozen political assassinations...

293
00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:59,805
and the F.B.I. Had him
on their internal top-10 list.

294
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,078
Why "had"?

295
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:05,918
Alex Renfro died in a bus crash
in Honduras in 1995.

296
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,015
<i>I also ran a background check</i>
<i>on all the other M2 members.</i>

297
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:12,892
Each one of them is dead,
along with their families.

298
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:16,592
- Each death ruled accidental.
- Oh, my God.

299
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,500
Each M2 death...

300
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,870
<i>was preceded within 48 hours</i>
<i>by a political assassination.</i>

301
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:29,236
They're doing the same thing to me.

302
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,543
After you do this job...

303
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:34,675
they're going to kill you
and your family.

304
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:45,790
<i>[Jarod] All right.</i>
<i>Let's go over this one more time.</i>

305
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,525
We know that Renfro and the other
members of the M2 unit are dead.

306
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,263
But was there anyone else that you can think
of that somehow might have been involved?

307
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,498
Nobody.

308
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,802
Think hard.

309
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,865
Don't you think I have?

310
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:02,844
Do you have any idea
what a nightmare my life has become?

311
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:06,576
Ten days ago I was planning P.T.A. Meetings
and making cookies for a bake sale!

312
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,552
Now I'm sitting here waiting for someone
to tell me who I'm supposed to kill!

313
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,112
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,091
Maybe we should take a little break.

315
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:20,689
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

316
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:24,996
You-You rescue me in a bathroom
like some phantom out of the night.

317
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:29,402
<i>You access classified files</i>
<i>like it's nothing.</i>

318
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:32,306
And you seem to feel what I feel
before I feel it.

319
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:35,743
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- I'm just a guy waitin' for a bus.

320

321
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,819
<i>[Knocking Continues]</i>

322
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:56,027
I'm standin' out here
like an idiot pizza boy.

323
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,590
I was in the bathroom.
I'm sorry.

324
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:14,715
You've made the place very homey.

325
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,477
Not much of a view.

326
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,718
- <i>I hadn't noticed.</i>
- Ooh, relax.

327
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:25,387
<i>You look guilty,</i>
<i>and you haven't even killed anybody yet.</i>

328
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,767
What's this?

329
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,701
<i>Open it.</i>

330
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,898
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom.

331
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:39,908
Do you mind?

332
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:47,043
<i>Senator Sanford Ryst.</i>

333
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:50,416
<i>He's givin'a speech</i>
<i>at Slayton Hall tonight.</i>

334
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:53,945

00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,694
to just walk away...

503
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,923
<i>even after you got what you wanted.</i>

504
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,931
Like I said before-

[Cards Turning Over]

506
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,935
There's a new player at the table...

507
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:44,700
and I'm afraid you're not going to like
the hand you were just dealt.

508
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:48,266
Go ahead.
Open the envelope.

509
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,751
[Sighs]

510
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,450
Aces and eights.

511
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,219
Dead man's hand.

512
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:08,059
Which is exactly what you are.

513
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,621
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

514
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:14,634
<i>Oh, God.</i>

515
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,737
<i>[Police Radio Chatter, Indistinct]</i>

516
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:26,407
- Get out of the car!
- Let me see your hands!

517
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:29,645
- <i>Get 'em up!</i>
- <i>Hands in the air, now!</i>

518
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:32,949
<i>Get your hands up</i>

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,004
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

521
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:52,506
- What?
- [Jarod] It's midnight, Miss Parker.

522
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:56,511
- What a shock to find you still at the office.
- I was just on my way out.

523
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,047
I met a woman who reminds me of you.

524
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:02,572
- [Continues]
- She was smart, compassionate...

525
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:04,676
and tortured.

526
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:06,687
Is that what I am?

527
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:09,815
Like you, she was
a prisoner of her past...

528
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:12,156
of people who wanted
to control her future.

529
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:16,028
Instead of fighting back,
she almost let them destroy her.

530
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:18,032
Doesn't sound like a happy ending.

531
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,035
Oh, it all worked out in the end.

532
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,537
I hope the same thing happens for you.

533
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:26,404
- Meaning?
- Trust your heart, Miss Parker.

534
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:29,376
Don't let them
take away your happiness.

535
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,005
- [Continues]
- [Beeps]

536
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,581
I didn't think you'd come.

537
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:21,219
Tell me about yourself.

538
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:23,265
What do you want to know?

539
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,728
Everything.
