00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:39,571
The answer is in the red files.

7
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:40,794
Red files?

8
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:43,219
Prodigy red files.

As much as I'd like to make a sale, I have admitted it's kind of spooky.

17
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:26,442
Tell me about the fire.

18
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:30,598
A family lived here at that time. A mother, a father and a young son.

19
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:32,782
The whole story was a tragedy.

20
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:43,460
Rumour has it that boy was stolen and the parents disappeared the night the house burned.

21
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,836
Do you know where they went?

22
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,112
They were renters.

23
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,498
Property changed hands right after the fire.

24
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:00,961
It's now owned by a company out of Blue Cove, Delaware.

00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,894
Look, I am late for work.

26
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:08,094
I'll be glad to give them a call if you'd like to make an offer.

27
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:11,758
No, thank you.

28
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:14,412
I am late for work myself.

29
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,613
Harvard, Med Johns Hopkins,

30
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:22,996
from a medical stand point, I'll be foolish not to hire you as head of inseminology.

31
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:24,655
Business stand point,

32
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:30,097
having a doctor named Spock on staff could be worth million bucks.

33
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,392
I am glad to be a part of the Nugenesis Family.

34
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,955
Family is what those fertility clinics all about.

35
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,279
You might say it's our job to make the future.

36
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,316
Dr. Haring, you have a moment?

37
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,517
There are pretenders among us.

38
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,698
I was taken from my family.

39
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:57,638
Thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.

40
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,921
How many people died because of what I thought up?

41
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:03,936
Since I broke up, I've spent every moment searching for my past.

42
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:04,956
He is a pretender.

43
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:09,062
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.

44
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,600
- The Center wants him alive.
- Preferably.

45
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,680
He defends the weak and abused.

46
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:14,757

I am today.

00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,158
Mr. Fenigor?

53
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,055
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

54
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,138
Please tell me who killed my mother.

55
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:48,717
What did you mean by prodigy? What answers are in the red files?

56
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,642
Please help me.

Miss Parker.

58
00:03:53,994 --> 00:03:56,094
You are not supposed to be here. No one is.

59
00:03:58,143 --> 00:03:59,012
Has he talked?

60
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,858
He hasn't spoken since they brought him in.

61
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,622
An opinion around here is that he never will.

62
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,656
Well, we've tried in Vitro, Gift, Zift.

63
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,999
We've literally gone around the world trying to get pregnant.

64
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:21,458
But NuGenesis show us the only fertility clinic seems to get really care.

65
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:22,478
Always will.

66
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:27,092
NuGenesis prides himself being on the cutting edge of reproductive technology.

67
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:30,893
And I am proud to say that Jarod here, is on the cutting edge of all.

68
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:31,758
Can you help us?

69
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,359
Any couple with as much love to give as you two obviously have,

70
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,662
deserve to have a child.

71
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:38,163
Thank you.

72
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:40,713
Dr. Dewitt will be sharing duties as well.

73
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,714
Anything you need, they're here for you.

74
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:49,016
A patient mental attitude is sometimes more important than his or her physical condition.

75
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,581
If her mind has faith, her body would follow.

76
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:56,435
Oh, it's up to us to make sure our patients keep that faith, so our science can do its job.

77
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:57,336
Jeremy.

78
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:02,313
Run these and get the results back to Dr. Spock, staff.

79
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:05,195
Spock? Funny.

80
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:12,918
For over thirty years, we helped couples like the Brewster realize the fruits of parenting.

81
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,157
Thirty years?

82
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:15,858
Long before you were born.

83
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:17,878
I like this guy.

84
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,257
My brother Boris would have liked him too.

85
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:24,080
- My father.
- And as he always said,

86
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,175
''Get busy.''

87
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,655
Well, I get to go.

88
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:29,922
I'll catch up with you later.

89
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,323
Red files.

90
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,439
This is where you came from.

91
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:56,298
Any word out of Fenigor?

92
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,998
He's still unconscious.

93
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,101
You look like you need to change your pamper.

94
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:05,473
Ah, something weird is going on with Mr. Raines.

95
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,701
Everything going on with...

96
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,702
that half-burnt wheezing ghoul is weird.

97
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:19,033
No. He is packing up his office, to go.

98
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:20,140
Well, find out where.

99
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,241
And while you will find out what prodigy means.

100
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,061
Oh, well, that's easy.

101
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,235
Prodigy is someone extraordinary, very talented child.

102
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:27,883
I know what it means to webster's.

103
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:31,521
- I want to know what it means to the Center.
- Ok.

104
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:37,434
So you and Sydney find out everything you can about prodigy and something called ''the red files''.

105
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:39,960
Okay, I will do what I can, but Sydney's occupied.

106
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:41,838
Doing what?

107
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,578
String soap adds grey matter?

108
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:54,080
I am putting him through an experimental neuro-stimulation therapy,

109
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,416
that hopefully we'll unscramble Angelo's mind.

110
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,943
Good luck pulling jello brains out of ...

111
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,994

00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,175
A new blood work on the Brewster's.

116
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,676
I want to cross check with the raw records.

117
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,421
I am afraid you are not allowed in here.

118
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,716
Jeremy is a pitbull for protocol.

119
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,482
Hell, even I am not allowed back here.

120
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,876
Uncle Nicholas's policy.

121
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:51,777
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:00,120
Infertility is a sensitive personal issue.

123
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,773
One reason Nugenesis has been so successful is because of trust.

124
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,174
And confidentiality.

125
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,019
We don't even use patients' names.

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Only code numbers.

127
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:13,396
- Jeremy will get anything you need.
- Thank you.

128
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:15,997
- Good night, Jarod.
- Good night.

129
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,935
Only four more treatments left, my friend.

130
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:39,162
Hope it works.

131
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,563
Thank you.

132
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:54,464
Sydney.

133
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,865
Good morning, ladies.

134
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,175
Got to have a special pass to go up that way.

135
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,174
- A pass?
- That's Corridor Seven.

136
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,496
You are not allowed.

137
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,894
I am finding there's many places I am not allowed around here.

00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:08,795
''Mr. Raines Personal''

139
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:18,895
Oh, my god.

140
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:29,355
- Make sure all of these boxes are out of my office tonight.
- Right.

141
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,294
I'll meet you later.

142
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:48,995
Hello, Jarod.

143
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:50,382
My name is Sydney.

144
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,583
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

145
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,696
Why?

146
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,597
Where are my mum and dad?

147
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:57,436
Here is a fresh bandage.

148
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:10,396
Why?

149
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,597
Wherer are my mum and dad?

150
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,354
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.

151
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,359
If he starts sing ''A rain in Spain'', I am gonna pass out.

152
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,534
Angelo's mind is working again.

153
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:28,139
We are restoring the neuro-pathways of his memory.

154
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,253
You know that serotonin isotope?

155
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,532
It seems to regenerate dead pathways.

156
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,418
However, if he doesn't get the entire dosage,

157
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:40,653
he'll regress permanently.

158
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,155
I am impressed, Einstein.

159
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:46,916
But my gut tells me that Jarod has something to do with this.

160
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:52,093
Jarod wanted to know what could be discovered if Angelo's mind returned.

161
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,235
The potential is unlimited.

162
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,492
I believe he can even play the piano.

163
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:26,312
Music.

164
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,052
What's going on?

165
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,811
Cos then he woke up remembered he was Liberace.

166
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,859
Mr. Valentino played that as a child.

167
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:36,734
Information of his mind has been absorbing for a lifetime.

168
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,676
It's starting to re-emerge.

169
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:41,457
This is the icying on a very freaky cake.

170
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:42,532
What are you bubbling about?

171
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:47,178
I found this in Raines' office. He had twenty more in file on his desk.

172
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,975
The desk just accidently I hid under for over an hour.

173
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:55,072
Hiding is bad enough. But I had to watch what Raines did, you know, personal stuff.

174
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:56,674
What could have been so awful?

175
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,420
He changed his pants.

176
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,480
Oh, thanks for that.

177
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:05,277
Why is Raines packing and moving?

178
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:08,617
And why this freak had twenty photos of the same school children?

179
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,521
Red files.

180
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,081
He can't be doing it again.

181
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,960
- Not again.
- Angelo, easy, Angelo.

182
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:26,198
He said red files.

183
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:30,039
Then if he is getting his memory back, then he must know something about them.

184
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:33,674
If that's truth is somewhere in that demented mind, he might know who killed my mother.

185
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,775
Miss Parker.

186
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,296
You have a mail.

187
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:19,137
This is where you came from. Red files.

188
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,253
Rumour has it that the boy was stolen¡­

189
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:22,992
Where are my mum and dad?

190
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:24,793
Oh, my god.

191
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,055
They're doing it again.

192
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:28,056
They're going to take another child.

193
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,220
The Center's going to make another pretender.

194
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:44,852
I thought the pretender program was discontinued years ago, Sydney.

195
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,861
Calm down, Jarod, calm down.

196
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,619
They stole me from my parents.

197
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:51,241
And they are trying to steal another child, aren't they?

198
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:54,815
Not sure. But the recent events make me feel you may be right at this.

199
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,241
And what are you going to this time? Are you just going to sit by and let it happen again?

200
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:01,834
Jarod, please. I think Angelo may hold some answers.

201
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,152
How the treatments working?

202
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:07,053
Yes.

203
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:10,477
He saw something that seemed to trigger the bad memory.

204
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,262
I know how he feels.

205
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:24,263
''Dr. Jarod Spock''

206
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:41,358
He is over here.

207
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:44,959
Angelo.

208
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:46,833
What's wrong with him, Syd?

209
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:50,812
Angelo needs strip his treatment dotted with specifically time intervals.

210
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:52,592
Come on, friend.

211
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,257
Answers below.

212
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,742
What is prodigy, Angelo?

213
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,881
Answers below.

214
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:11,316
He is pointing to the floor below us, sublevel 27.

215
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,112
''Inception''.

216
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,713
Another birthing table.

217
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,218
It is a delivery room.

218
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,619
Oh, my god.

219
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:30,798
They're recreating this place.

220
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:31,499
What?

221
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:34,801
- Oh, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Broots.

222
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:35,983
Answers here.

223
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:39,557
Find the security cameras archives that belong to this room, anything and everything.

224
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,258
Yes, mam.

225
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,359
Answers...

226
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:45,332
Syd, get Angelo his next treatment. Find out what else is in his head.

227
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,852
It may be the treasure chest I've been looking for.

228
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:01,212
My name is Sydney.

229
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:02,977
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

230
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:03,961
Why?

231
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,162
Where are my mum and dad?

232
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:23,703
If you're looking for information, the way you're going about that you gonna get caught.

233
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,622
If you want help, I'll help you.

234
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:26,823
Why should I trust you?

235
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:31,622
Because your mother did.

236
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:37,494
I polished floors in this place for over thirty years.

237
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,139
I've seen a lot of people come and go.

238
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:44,552
The hearts in the hands, filled with love they want to share with the child.

239
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,478
Your parents were like that.

240
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:47,482
How did you know them?

241
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:49,955
They were here over six months trying for a baby.

242
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,021
Your mother treated me with respect.

243
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,258
I saw her a year so later.

244
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:58,840
I'll never forget the gleam she had in her eyes when she showed me her baby boy.

245
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:00,982
The same gleam that's in yours.

246
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,817
That's what hurt so much.

247
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,118
Hurt?

248
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,881
I saw them a few years later.

249
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,061
She was scared, on the run.

250
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,762
Somebody had stolen the boy.

251
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,114
My guess is that was you.

252
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,522
I've been searching for them.

253
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:19,355
Part of your pain is because of me.

254
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:22,099
See I told Dr. Boris what she said.

255
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,100
There was a lot of weird stuff going on in Corridor Seven backed in, with kids.

256
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,472
Testing and stuff.

257
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:29,851
Dr. Boris paid me to forget about it.

258
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:31,252
The weird stuff stopped.

259
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:35,118
Dr. Boris died and everything ran away.

260
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:38,782
Until what?

261
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,483
A while back to start up again.

262
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:43,672
Kids, testing, and then you showed up.

263
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,621
Do you recognize any of these children?

264
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,322
It's a local elementary school.

265
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:55,453
One of these children is going to be taken, just like I was.

266
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:59,679
I may need your help to stop it.

267
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:04,612
I owe you that much.

268
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,695
And your mother.

269
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:07,996
Thank you.

270
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:20,034
There is no Timmy.

271
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:23,583
From now on, his name be Angelo.

272
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,622
He is remembering what Raines told my mother after he fried his brain.

273
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:29,977
- I am afraid he is remembering too quickly.
- Well, cut his dosages or something.

274
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,178
I don't want him to pop before he can answer my questions.

275
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:33,093
Can't be done.

276
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:36,993
The treatment is giving this specifically time stages that can't be interrupted.

277
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:41,419
Any break in the schedule means the new pathways and the system will atrophy.

278
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:42,419
And if they do?

279
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:47,801
Angelo will regress to his previous self.

280
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,479
Permanently.

281
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,822
- Angelo.
- There is no more Timmy.

282
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:59,053
From now on, he should be known as Angelo.

283
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,096
Get me Mr. Raines.

284
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,856
I stored Dr. Boris's stuff down here, Jarod.

285
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:12,703
If you get red files anywhere, there is only one place it would be.

286
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,682
You ain't a safe cracker, are you?

287
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:21,942
Maybe today,

288
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,461
I don't have to be.

289
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,798
You find something?

290
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:41,999
Yes.

291
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:43,033
Me.

292
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:47,698
And the red files.

293
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,376
What is saying there about you?

294
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:02,418
It's personal... Blood type, blood scans, height, weight, it's all medical.

295
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,719
Except for one thing.

296
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,782
Destination.

297
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:05,683
Destination?

298
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:06,884
It's blacked out.

299
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,076
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.

300
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,582
I was here.

301
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:41,717
Pi times square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.

302
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:44,001
Very good, Jarod. You are very special.

303
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:45,311
Where are my mum and dad?

304
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:52,678
You won't believe what I've found.

305
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,279
What?

306
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,522
Security videos logs in the mainframe,

307
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,523
that correspond to the inception room.

308
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:00,324
And?

309
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:05,193
A visual record classified under Catherine Parker.

310
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:06,194
What?

311
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,321
It's the day you were born.

312
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:10,679
Keep pushing.

313
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,074
Miss Parker, it's your birth.

314
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,802
This is too weird.

315
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,503
Oh, well, it's just beginning.

316
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:20,098
Here comes, here comes.

317
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:22,958
- Is that...
- The Saint Dr. Raines.

318
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:24,439
Raines delivered me?

319
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,236
Specks your bottom in a second.

320
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,651
I am going to puke.

321
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,615
It's a girl.

322
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:31,702
I can't believe he saw me nude.

323
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,658
Okay, Catherine, the next one is coming. It's coming quick.

324
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:36,692
Next one?

325
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:38,937
Sydney, what's going on?

326
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:41,253
It appears you didn't arrive alone.

327
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:42,822
There is a trouble with the boy. Nurse.

328
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,823
Syd.

329
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:46,937
What's wrong with him?

330
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:48,495
Tell me what's wrong with him?

331
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:51,556
What else is on that?

332
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:56,780
The tape ends there. It cut off, or edited...

333
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,231
Or erased.

334
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,232
So no one would find out the truth.

335
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:04,842
I had a brother.

336
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,671
I feel like I found a treasure chest,

337
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,972
and inside it's only dust.

338
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:21,313
Well, sometimes answers lead to more questions.

339
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:24,259
But for what it's worth, I do remember what your parents first names were.

340
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:25,792
Margaret and Charles.

341
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:26,893
Yeah.

342
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:31,995
Which it still not to say they are your biological parents.

343
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,075
What do you mean?

344
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:37,976
Back in those days, this was also a adoption agency not just a reproduction center.

345
00:24:38,263 --> 00:24:40,697
Dr. Boris headed up the adoptions.

346
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:43,143
Dr. Nicholas ran conceptions.

347
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,898
Another dead end.

348
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:49,679
Maybe not.

349
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,480
''Oakview 555-6507''

350
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:02,921
The old Oakview Lodge, near Stone Mountain.

351
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,171
Your parents used to stay there when they were here.

352
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:07,376
Could be a treasure, could be dust.

353
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:20,936
Yes, just let me know when this's done, will you? I don't want any excuses. That...

354
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:24,658
Angel.

355
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,179
That thing has a stop button?

356
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,680
Oh, yeah.

357
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,558
Endows me my private pride,

358
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:40,020
you do look exquisite sitting there.

359
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,579
Some day you will, permanently.

360
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:45,274
Parents always want what's best for their children, and...

361
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,275
- Of course, you look...
- How dare you?

362
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:51,476
What?

363
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:56,015
Why didn't you tell me I had a twin?

364
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:01,971
Your mother and I,

365
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:10,120
wanted to spare you unnecessary pain.

366
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,163
I was away when you both were born.

367
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:16,037
He died before he ever lived.

368
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:17,262
We buried him.

369
00:26:18,623 --> 00:26:19,615
But not too pain.

370
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:24,539
Pain or not, I have the right to know, I had a brother.

371
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,421
- Angel...
- No, daddy.

372
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:36,277
Parents make mistakes too.

373
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:40,540
He is in a small plot here on the Center grounds.

374
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:43,075
- Buried at 66. I can take you there.
- No.

375
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:47,479
I'd, I'd rather find him myself.

376
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:04,873
You take one more step, I'm gonna blow your head off.

377
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,460
I will settle for ''no vacancy'' sign.

378
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,441
I'm so sorry.

379
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:20,214
It's just a awake head scared of burglary around here lately.

380
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:24,238
Well, with the hour I know, I just didn't think anybody's gonna be checking in.

381
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:25,319
Are you the owner?

382
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,120
Yeah.

383
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:29,340
Lewis King Road. And keep it to the stars.

384
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:31,937
Well, you can name your pleasure.

385
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,354
I got mountain view, lake view.

386
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:37,055
I even got one room my old man used to tell people Jeff Davies slept in.

387
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,612
Did you grow up here?

388
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:43,493
I grew old, never up.

389
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:44,594
Lewis.

390
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:47,822
Do you recognize this woman?

391
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,323
Oh, my Lord.

392
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,660
You must be baby Jarod.

393
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,361
I'll never forget the winter I met your parents.

394
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:01,362
You know that the lake view I mentioned.

395
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,274
Well, I think float's over.

396
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,075
And I went out on it,

397
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:06,391
broke through.

398
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,375
Your dad rushed in and saved my life.

399
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:15,499
What is it?

400
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:18,577
That's funny. You don't look like either one of your folks.

401
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:22,760
This cottage right here was theirs. Let's go and take a look.

402
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,416
Oh, here, this's it.

403
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:30,251
The light's working.

404
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,461
Well, it's, it's not much.

405
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,354
But your dad loved the view.

406
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:41,655
Major Charles.

407
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:44,734
That's what I called your dad on the kind of Air Force uniform.

408
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:46,435
Air Force.

409
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,021
Yeah, he's a pilot.

410
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:51,298
He and your mummy used to sit out on this porch.

411
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,658
Watched sun rise in the morning.

412
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,471
They really loved each other.

413
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,672
- Lewis.
- Yeah.

414
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,236
I would like to stay here for a little while if you don't mind.

415
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,342
Make yourself at home.

416
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:05,633
You're sort of a family,

417
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,580
''In finding Timmy, you set Angelo free. 
Thank you, Sydney''

418
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:41,294
Good morning, class. My name is Jarod...

419
00:30:41,703 --> 00:30:43,136
My name is Mr. Kotter.

420
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:45,940
And I will be your substitute teach for Miss Markam today.

421
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:50,474
Well, the first of all business,

422
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,275
is we'll divide up to small groups and we will...

423
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:57,676
Ah, yes, Ari.

424
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:00,832
We always start with Pledge of Allegiance.

425
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,477
Yes, I've heard of that.

426
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:10,793
Why don't you to lead us off today?

427
00:31:14,383 --> 00:31:18,498
I pledge our allegiance to the flag,

428
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,695
of the United States of America,

429
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:26,396
and to the Republic for which it stands,

430
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:29,597
one Nation under God,

431
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,198
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

432
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:36,794
That's it?

433
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,995
That's it.

434
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:40,496
Okay.

435
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:43,777
Now we are going to divide up into groups.

436
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:46,702
As I call your name, please move to the table I assign you.

437
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,894
Table number one: Albert Williams

438
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,292
Ari Thompson

439
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,535
and Davy Simpkins.

440
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:57,332
Table two...

441
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:02,218
Tyrannosaurus Rex? Very good.

442
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,092
I would like you to solve this problem for me.

443
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,636
Can we just cut out dinosaurs like the other kids?

444
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,522
Class, work quietly for a moment.

445
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,223
I'll be right back.

446
00:32:38,263 --> 00:32:39,574
Where is Angelo?

447
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,375
He has escaped from the Center.

448
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:47,659
''In finding Timmy, you set Angelo free. 
Thank you, Sydney''

449
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,579
That's, that's beautiful.

450
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:53,693
Isn't it?

451
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,414
I hope you're proud of yourself, Syd.

452
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,018
Great.

453
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:06,957
While Algernon is out there picking flowers,

454
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:10,499
And you two ponder your navels, I am left with buckets.

455
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:13,138
And you just wait till Raines finds out.

456
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:18,295
- Does Angelo have to take the serum?
- I hope so.

457
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,877
He has three treatments left.

458
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:24,997
He misses one, and he'll regress to all the Angelo.

459
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,611
Permanently.

460
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:29,163
And what he knows will be lost forever.

461
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:40,921
Thank you, daddy.

462
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,022
Bye.

463
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:08,102
Pi times the square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.

464
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:10,856
Which one of you did this?

465
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:14,171
- You did.
- You're lying.

466
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,619
Seven red files.

467
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:32,873
These were just found by a sweeper team in Angelo's space.

468
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:33,974
Angelo?

469
00:34:34,223 --> 00:34:35,720
We're still searching.

470
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:40,640
You know the ramifications if this information's ever got out.

471
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:45,632
I want your blessing to accelerate prodigy,

472
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:48,037
to ensure its success.

473
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,362
Get the new one now.

474
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,291
Go, bring us the child.

475
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:14,692
Who is?

476
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:28,593
Angelo.

477
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,094
Angelo.

478
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:34,896
I got here as quick as I could.

479
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,962
It is so good to see you.

480
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:52,942
The real you.

481
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:56,483
It's good to be me.

482
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,284
Thank you, Jarod.

483
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,058
It's a big world out here.

484
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:16,613
My parents stayed in this room a long time ago.

485
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,462
Now I feel it's like it's me I am searching for.

486
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:26,220
I wonder if I ever know my parents.

487
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,433
You are in the red files too.

488
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:32,156
There are answers, Angelo.

489
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:34,536
You're just out to find them.

490
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,218
This is Timmy now.

491
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:45,892
What is it?

492
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:50,379
I heard that your brother died.

493
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:53,802
Feel sad to know that.

494
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:55,837
Yes, it does.

495
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:57,838
It feels...

496
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:02,802
It feels sad.

497
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:13,772
These blocks, they were used by the child that the Center wants.

498
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,958
If you could just feel something that would tell us who it is.

499
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:33,592
Timmy feels nothing.

500
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:37,193
No.

501
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:39,432
Angelo did.

502
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:45,353
Time for my treatment.

503
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:09,057
You are a very special little boy, Jarod.

504
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,658
- Red files.
- Red files?

505
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:29,559
Red files.

506
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,360
Prodigy.

507
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:33,161
This is where you came from.

508
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,518
We are all special.

509
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:38,819
Because of what's in our blood.

510
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,412
Three color-coded samples as requested.

511
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:44,881
Albert Williams, Ari Thompson, Davy Simpkins.

512
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:47,096
All three have blood samples on file.

513
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,282
How did you get pass Jeremy?

514
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,113
Nothing as invisible as a man with a mop.

515
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:54,912
What are you going to do with them?

516
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,901
Throw on waters.

517
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,775
Wait until the sharks come.

518
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:09,492
I am sorry.

519
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,720
I don't know how much more disappointment she can take.

520
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:16,994
How are you holding up?

521
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:19,295
The first time we started talking about adoption.

522
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:20,895
The process takes forever.

523
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:23,074
We just want a chance to raise a child.

524
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,975
I am sure you'll get that chance.

525
00:39:30,476 --> 00:39:31,476
Morning, Jarod.

526
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:33,877
Good morning, Dr. Haring.

527
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:36,120
I think Mrs. Brewster aren't pregnant?

528
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,041
No, not yet.

529
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:43,395
Although I have found three excellent egg donor candidates.

530
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,457
- Those have been analyzed, did you?
- Not yet.

531
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:48,961
But considering Mrs. Brewster's current cycle, I'd like to get on it right away.

532
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:50,062
Jeremy.

533
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:54,356
I want a complete work up on these immediately.

534
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:56,896
So it shall be right now, so it shall be done.

535
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,361
Let's hope we'll find what we are looking for.

536
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:04,162
Yes.

537
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:07,380
Let's.

538
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:16,981
Dr. Dewitt, there is something you should see.

539
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,196
Tell me you found Angelo.

540
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:25,092
No, but I found something else.

541
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,321
I think maybe Sydney should show it to you.

542
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,500
- I just take a little break.
- Broots.

543
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:36,593
Last time I saw that little Bambi's mother was in my cross hairs.

544
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:40,018
Well, I've been hitting dead ends on this birthing things,

545
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:42,480
so this morning I helped myself to Raines's moving boxes

546
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:45,581
where I found some personal surveillance files.

547
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:48,293
Twice in three days?

548
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:50,979
Broots found something you need to see, Miss Parker.

549
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,280
Sit down.

550
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,102
I'll stand.

551
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:02,256
Uh, it's more of your birthing record.

552
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:06,742
What's wrong with him?

553
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,776
I'm sorry, Catherine. The second child is stillborn.

554
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:15,231
Standard post-natal procedure for the baby girl and sedation for Catherine in the recovery.

555
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,132
Yes, doctor.

556
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,033
Oh, my god.

557
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:36,216
He was alive.

558
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:41,177
The male baby is ready for transportation to Nugenesis.

559
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:42,596
What's Nugenesis?

560
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:43,497
Yes.

561
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:47,171
I have a brother,

562
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,682
out there.

563
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,483
Jarod.

564
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:54,499
Is something wrong?

565
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:58,581
I found these in lab of on the doners' three blood samples.

566
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,633
I need to contact one of them right away.

567
00:42:00,823 --> 00:42:02,039
Did you find a perfect donor?

568
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:04,276
Well, unfortunately not for the Brewsters.

569
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:07,515
But it is perfect match for a special project I am heading up.

570
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:10,220
Dr. Haring doesn't know, right?

571
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:14,399
Anyway, the sooner you can get me the contact number on this subject, the better.

572
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,018
I'll do my best.

573
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,019
Thanks.

574
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,620
Davy Simpkins.

575
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:39,920
Is this Davy's house?

576
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,521
Well, it's the right address anyway.

577
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:54,281
Hello, I am sorry to bother you.

578
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:57,193
My name is Jarod Spock. And I am looking for Davy Simpkins.

579
00:42:57,383 --> 00:42:58,477
You just missed him.

580
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:00,093
- He doesn't live here?
- He did.

581
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:01,982
We are Davy's foster parents.

582
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,379
Oh, we were. They found him a permanent home.

583
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:05,279
He just left.

584
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,532
- They?
- The man from child placement.

585
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:09,993
Davy called him the Snowman.

586
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:10,894
Snowman?

587
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,078
Because of his hair.

588
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:13,479
It is solid white.

589
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,640
Raines's cleaner, Gar.

590
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:16,341
Is something wrong?

591
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:18,120
Did he tell you where he was taking Davy?

592
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:19,952
I assume to the county airstrip.

593
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:03,953
To be continued...

594
00:44:04,654 --> 00:44:06,954
''Bloodlines_1''
End
