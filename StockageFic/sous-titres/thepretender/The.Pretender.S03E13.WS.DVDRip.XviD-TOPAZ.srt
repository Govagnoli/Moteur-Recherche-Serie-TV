I couldn't tell you.

500
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,036
We'd both had enough.

501
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,917
She was my sister?

502
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:28,989
Her parents were killed.

503
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,115
She became a ward of the state.

504
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,719
Then she was diagnosed
with leukemia.

505
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,425
The doctor said there was, uh,
nothing could be done.

506
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:43,594
So the state, uh, put her
in a convalescent home...

507
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:46,172
to die.

508
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:48,707
How did she end up
at the Centre?

509
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,800
Well, your, uh-

510
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,903
your mother's priest, Father Moore,
told her about the girl.

511
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:55,915
They went to see her.

512
00:38:56,017 --> 00:39:01,148
Your mother said that might have been
you in the nursing home.

513
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,782
She had to do something;
otherwise, she couldn't live with herself.

514
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,258
So the two of you
adopted her.

515
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:10,888
Ah. Well, with
Father Moore's help...

516
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:13,091
we brought her
to the Centre...

517
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,566
where Catherine
could be with her.

518
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:21,641
We doctored her with an experimental drug
the Centre was developing.

519
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:28,981
Future treatment proved successful
because of what we had learned from Faith.

520
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:36,016
She died
shortly after Catherine.

521
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,763
[Sobs]

522
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,298
Miss Parker.

523
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,927
<i>There's some people</i>
<i>who would like to see you.</i>

524
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:51,937
Miss Parker.

525
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,505
Hi.

526
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,942
- <i>Mr. Parker.</i>
- <i>[Sydney] The nurse called to let us know...</i>

527
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:00,775
<i>that you'd regained</i>
<i>consciousness.</i>

528
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:04,044
And I thought
you'd want this.

529
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:08,812
[Sobs, Giggles]

530
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,495
Thank you both.

531
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,759
Broots.

532
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,960
[Clears Throat]
Guess we'll see you later.

00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:28,041
<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>

534
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,838
- [Beeps]
- Yes.

535
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,413
- Thank you.
- [Beeps]

536
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,483
What? Jarod?

537
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,417
They found him.

538
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,489
Alive.

539
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,395
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Jarod.</i>

540
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,526
It's nice to finally
meet you in the flesh.

541
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,467
I'm Father Moore.

542
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:03,675
But how did you find me?

543
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:06,302
Well, I was concerned
when you didn't arrive at Butte.

544
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:10,645
You seemed so anxious to meet
the last time we spoke.

545
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:14,915
Our mutual friend at the Centre told me
what happened and where I could find you.

546
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,320
- The Centre?
- No. No, no. Relax.

547
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:20,723
The Centre has no idea where you are
or where we're going.

548
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:24,355
Thank you-
for helping me.

549
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,195
<i>Catherine Parker would have
wanted it that way.

550
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,545
[Miss Parker]
I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.

551
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:41,706
- How did you get it?
- An old friend of your mother's.

552
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:48,481
- Father Moore.
- He found the rosary clutched in Faith's hand.

553
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,887
He knew how much
it meant to your mother...

554
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,516
so he wanted me
to give it to you.

555
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,164
Thank you, Jarod.

556
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,027
Do you ever
think about her?

557
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,070
I think about her
all the time.

558
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,106
- It's ironic too.
- What is?

559
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:10,710
All those years ago-
you and l-

560
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,279
we went searching for death...

561
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,610
and we found someone
who saved our lives.

562
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,775
I'm sure she was
in that room with me.

563
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,921
And I'm sure she was with me
up on that mountain.

564
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,490
She said she'd always
be watching over us.

565
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:27,961
She was.

566
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:34,758
- Are we crazy?
- I don't know exactly what happened.

567
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:38,326
- But I do know that I'm sure of one thing.
- What?

568
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:41,340
Love... transcends death.

569
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:46,675
That the people we love
touch our lives...

570
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:50,083
even after they're gone.

571
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,786
