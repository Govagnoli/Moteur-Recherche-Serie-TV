502
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,462
He was one of my superiors.

503
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:08,524
And after he got you transferred,
he intensified his drug experiments.

504
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:12,800
I did a bunch of shows on the subject
when I first got on the air...

505
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,468
how the army was pumping soldiers
full of potentially lethal experimental drugs...

506
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,477
without telling them.

507
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,706
<i>Well, your shows got the army nervous.</i>

508
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,409
They shut Spence down.

509
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:26,976
Some families tried to sue,
but of course they lost.

510
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,556
The brass conducted
an internal investigation.

511
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:34,685
They convicted Spence and locked him up
in Leavenworth for seven years.

512
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:38,698
- That's a long time.
- Time enough to develop a heck of a grudge.

513
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:46,735
He blames you
and your radio show...

514
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,809
for ratting him out.

515
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,811
Jarod, his parole office is in Olympia Fields.
That's close to Patty.

516
00:33:56,918 --> 00:34:00,012
We'll find him.

00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:10,760
You know, I've been tracking reports

520

525
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,031
Nah.

- You too. I'm so glad you're okay.

531

No one at the Centre has seen Miss Parker,

537
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,469
Well, that's it.
We're out of here.

538
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,479

- She made her decision, Doctor.
