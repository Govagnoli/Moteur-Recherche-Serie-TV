Who's the egg headin the go-cart?

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,995

- The new head of the Centre's Clean-up unit.

This is-

- Not a problem.

So, what did our little genius
leave us to clean up this time?

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,477
I'm afraid it's a bit
disturbing in nature.

- Ridiculous. Jarod wouldn't use drugs.

I'm afraid I will have to disagree.

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,663
We ran a series of field tests
on the blood residual of the syringes...

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,204
and it matched Jarod's perfectly.

With what Jarod's been through...

- We also found this.

[Broots] What, do you think
he left it here by accident?

00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,251
You're blessed.

164
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,382
Your son is going to get
to see you again, clean and alive.

165
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,393
What Huey is saying is that...

166
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,191
you need to accept the fact that
you have a problem.

167
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:35,427
I know I have a problem, Dr. Earl.
I lost my son.

168
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,667
Section "A,"page 22 had five obituaries.

169
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,938
So I ran the names through
the database, and one of them...

170
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,742
a guy named David Arnold,
used to work here.

171
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,748
- [Miss Parker] When?
- It doesn't say.

172
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,284
And there's no other information
on him, which is really strange...

173
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,718
because you know how this place is
about background checks.

174
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,849
Which makes your presence here
even more of a mystery.

175
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,359
This is ridiculous!
What if something happens to Jarod...

176
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,056
while we're chasing ghosts?

177
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,373
Broots, keep working the number codes,
and stay on this David Arnold lead.

178
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,376
Sure. No problem.

179
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,435
And, Broots?

180
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,743
You report onlyto me.

181
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,099
That's a fine-looking
little boy you have there.

182
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,501
I never actually knew my mother, but I always
imagined how great our relationship would be.

183
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,405
Look-Jarod, right?
I appreciate you defending me in here...

184
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,409
but, please, leave me alone, okay?

185
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,207
Sorry, I can't do that.

186
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,649
You see, the reason I'm in here...

187
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,882
is to help you,
as a favor to your father.

188
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,923
My father's been dead
for over 20 years.

189
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,151
Jill, I know.

190
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,821
Jill? Your little boy's here.
He's waitin' for you in the visitation lounge.

191
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,831
- I can't let him see me like this.
- You're his mother.

192
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,029
Nothing can change the way
he feels about you.

193
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,606
[Man On Speaker] Hilary and I
have a lot to do with you today, sport.

194
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,547
We've gotta pick up your tux for the wedding.
I've gotta get the plane tickets.

195
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,986
So you just say hi to Mommy,
and then let's get going, okay?

196
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,023
Todd, honey?
The tuxedo shop is open late...

197
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,059
and the travel agent
can messenger you the tickets.

198
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,219
Please, Daddy?

199
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:21,232
Chris, you spend as much time
with your mommy as you want, okay?

200
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,767
- Okay.
- Okay.

201
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,100
Guess who.

202
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,506
- Mommy!
- Hey! Look at you!

203
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,569
- I've missed you so much!
- I missed you too.

204
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,349
Why are you shaking, Mommy?

205
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,285
- Mommy's been sick, baby.
- Are you gonna get better?

206
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,754
Yes. And guess what.

207
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,090
If Dr. Earl says it's okay,
I can come home in a couple of days.

208
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,425
[Chris]
Does that mean I get to live with you?

209
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,790
Well, honey, no.

210
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,859
Don't you love me anymore?

211
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,766
Yes, of course I do.
I love you with all my heart.

212
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,047
Oh, God.

213
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,419
Garrett!
Circle of trust,Jarod.

214
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,754
Whatever you're doing in here,
you just broke the circle.

215
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,158
Take him back to his room.

216
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,288
[Buzzer Sounds]

217
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,593
Come on.

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,900
Yeah.

219
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,207
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]

220
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,710
These are his orders.

221
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,903
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]

222
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:57,444
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanna talk to you.

223
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,386
This is the only place that we can talk
unmonitored. Please trust me.

224
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,016
Just leave me alone.

225
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,828
I don't think
he would have wanted that.

226
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,688
Where'd you get this?

227
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:14,031
Your father gave it to me. I was taken
from my family when I was a boy.

228
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:17,561
That photograph was your father's way
of giving me a family when I needed one.

229
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:26,146
I realize that all this sounds crazy,
but it's the truth.

230
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:29,082
You don't belong in here.
And I know...

231
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:32,416
you never would have done anything
to jeopardize the custody of your son.

232
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:41,162
You know, I remember
when this picture was taken.

233
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:45,863
I was a junior in high school.

234
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:49,028
That was the year
everything went crazy.

235
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:54,064
I met this great guy.
A dealer.

236
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,236
God, I got strung out so fast.

237
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:00,611
And your father got you clean.

238
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:06,415
No guilt trips.
Just unconditional love.

239
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,982
Then he died.

240
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:14,962
I stayed clean through the whole thing.

241
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,364
I was clean for a long time.
That's when I met Todd.

242
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:23,201
We got married, had Chris.

243
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,536
It was such a good life.

244
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,132
And then you started using again.

245
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,235
Yeah.

246
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,816
I don't have an excuse for it.
I screwed up.

247
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:38,444
By the time I realized 
what I had done...

248
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,647
Todd had left, and he took Chris.

249
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,714
Then Todd met Hilary. I knew
if I was ever gonna get my boy back...

250
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,920
I could never use drugs again.

251
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:50,556
So I got clean again.
I got my teaching credential.

252
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:54,625
Everything was fine.
The court was gonna give me custody.

253
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:58,972
Then the day before the final hearing-

254
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:04,137
I swear to God
I don't remember using.

255
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,975
So I lost any chance
of getting my little boy back.

256
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:17,050
There is always a chance.

257
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,686
Not for me.
Once Hilary and Todd get married...

258
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:22,161
she can legally adopt him,
and then that's the end.

259
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:29,368
Tell me about this day that you said
you don't remember using.

260
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:33,499
I remember the morning. I was clean.
I came here for my weekly drug test.

261
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:36,544
I woke up three days later
strung out in the park.

262
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:40,776
I wouldn't have thrown it all away-
not my life, not my family.

263
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,421
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]

264
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,554
Hello, J ill.
How are we feeling today?

265
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,098
- Okay.
- Good.

266
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,634
Nurses tell me you've been having
a little trouble sleeping.

267
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,033
Would you like a clonidine patch?

268
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:04,368
Yes, please.

269
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,821
All right.

270
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,629
There.
That should help you relax.

271
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,220
Thank you.

272
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,994
Jill, I just wanna let you know,
if all goes well...

273
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,228
I think I can have you
out of here by Friday.

274
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:38,239
- Really?
- Really. We just wanna
make sure that you're ready...

275
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,832
- and there aren't gonna be any setbacks, okay?
- I'm ready. I promise.

276
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,774
Good. You get some sleep...

277
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,778
and I will check in on you later, okay?

278
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,814
Okay.

279
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,816
[Beeps, Buzzer Sounds]

280
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,356
[Broots]
The Delaware cartographer's offiice...

281
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:08,301
is e-mailing me a map coded 101776.

282
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,804
- A-22 should be the coordinates
that lead us to Jarod.
- Good work.

283
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:13,466
Will you let us know
the minute it comes in?

284
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:17,774
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Broots, I wanna review 
your G-4 report with you.

285
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:20,314
All right.
I'll catch up with you, Sydney.

286
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:23,146
Hmm.

287
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:26,016
- What do you got?
- Okay.

288
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:29,387
You know Winkey, the old guy with the facial
ticks that works down in the infirmary?

289
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,018
- We haven't had the pleasure.
- Okay. Anyway...

290
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:35,393
he remembers this David Arnold who used to
work there as an orderly like 20 years ago.

291
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:39,059
So I cross-referenced Arnold's name
with the infirmary's D.S.A. database...

292
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:41,466
and I came up with two matches.

293
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:44,801
The only problem is they're missing
from Winkey's archives.

294
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:46,807
Somebody's really gone
to some trouble...

295
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,038
erasing this guy from
the history books around here.

296
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:55,675
You've been making unauthorized entries
into the infirmary's database.

297
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:00,355
If it's David Arnold
you want to know about...

298
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:05,519
I can tell you he was one of the kindest,
gentlest men I ever had the pleasure of knowing.

299
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:10,357
- What's he doing these days?
- Pushing up daisies.

300
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:14,227
Arnold is deader
than your hair follicles.

301
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,466
[Sighs]

302
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,939
Tell me then, Miss Parker...

303
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:24,240
how does David Arnold get you
any closer to finding Jarod?

304
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:29,114
We explore all avenues in pursuit
of Jarod, even the dead ones.

305
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,920
He wouldn't be bugging us
about a database hit...

306
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,927
unless he had something to hide.

307
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:43,021
The answer lies in those missing D.S.A.s,
which are mostly likely...

308
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,532
in Raines's private collection.

309
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,999
- # [Dance]
- [Woman] Great. And one,
and two, and three, and four.

310
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:56,408
Keep it going.
Almost finished. Breathe.

311
00:21:56,478 --> 00:22:00,175
Good, and arms.
And one, and two, and three, and four.

312
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:02,182
Good job.

313
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:08,216
Hey, nice ride, dude. What are we waitin' for?
Let's get the hell out of here.

314
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,316
Even if I could start it,
they don't let me ride it.

315
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:13,327
You know anything
about motorcycle maintenance?

316
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:15,795
Well, I read a book on it once.

317
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:17,991
Nothin' to do with motorcycles, however.

318
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:22,230
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa. God.
- Does it flood when you hit the throttle?

319
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:24,602
Yeah.

320
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:28,109
The tabs from your float bowl
are disconnected from the needle, see?

321
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:32,438
I'll be dammed.
Hey, thanks.

322
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:35,005
Cool shirt.
What's "Skint Rabbit"?

323
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,017
It's a rock-and-roll band.

324
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,849
We had a big hit in the '80s.

325
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:43,152
- "Bloody Love Bones"?
- I was kinda out of it in the '80s.

326
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:46,922
And the '70s.

thinking you've been addicted for years.

493
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:20,123
What you're experiencing now,
physically and mentally...

494
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,760
that's what's known as "cold turkey."

495
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:26,771
- Gobble, gobble.
- You're sick.
- You son of a bitch.

496
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,673
Now, that is not expressing
an attitude of gratitude, Doc.

497
00:37:30,743 --> 00:37:32,711
But not to worry.
I brought along...

498
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:35,838
some clonidine patches
to help take that pain away.

499
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:38,110
- Please, give me a patch.
- First, we should talk about...

500
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:40,947
investigating our moral
self-inventory to decide...

501
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,011
- which one of you actually deserves a patch.
- Give it to me!

502
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:47,548
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm somebody that can help end your torment.

503
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,220
- Just tell me the truth.
- Come on. I can't take this.

504
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:54,494
- Don't give it to her, Jarod! Give it to me!
- Just-Just-Just talk to me.

505
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:58,503
- I can't.
- Mmm- Okay. Okay.

506
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,801
Please, give-give me a patch.

507
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:03,740
I guess you can look forward
to the next eight hours...

508
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,800
with your head in a bucket.
[Mimics Vomiting]

509
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:08,210
Give me a patch, please.

510
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,908
- [Hilary] Please give me a patch.
- One clonidine patch down.

511
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:13,508
- [Dr. Earl] Jarod, give it to me.
- Okay.

512
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,054
Okay. He did it.

513
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,986
- What?
- He needed the money.

514
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:21,891
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!
- Oh, please. Come on.
You said nobody would find out.

515
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:25,226
You're the one who needed
that stupid kid. You wanted the boy!

516
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:28,698
- Hey!
- Please, give me one ofthe patches.

517
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,997
Let me guess.
It went something like this.

518
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,164
Todd Moffiett is a very rich man.

519
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,003
So rich, in fact,
that if you two were to get divorced...

520
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,203
you could stand to make
one hell of a payday...

521
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,838
especially if you were
to adopt his son.

522
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:44,678
And what better way
to insure custody...

523
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,685
than to turn
his biological mother into a junkie.

524
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:53,350
- And who better to help you than
your ex-college sweetheart.
- How did you know that?

525
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:55,723
Let's just say that
I took a little peek...

526
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,194
into the doc's college yearbook.

527
00:38:58,263 --> 00:39:01,630
You two make such a cute little couple.
It seems so sad...

528
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,964
that college sweethearts
such as yourself...

529
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:06,903
are gonna have to experience
such horrific pain.

530
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:12,274
I've had my experience with that little
devil you're on. And let me tell you-

531
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:15,108
Somebody help me!

532
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,648
it's a bitch.

533
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,945
Only one clonidine patch left.

534
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:26,219
It would be a shame to have to white-knuckle it
through such a terrible detox.

535
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,782
Okay! I did it.

536
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:32,058
I drugged Jill Arnold
so she would lose custody of her son.

537
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:34,998
- Now can I have that patch, please?
- No, he did it.

538
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,126
Please give me the patch.

539
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:39,261
Like you say, Doc...

540
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:43,775
recovery starts when an individual
admits that he or she has a problem.

541
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:47,778
Isn't that right, Todd?

542
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:51,077
- That's right.
- Oh, God.

543
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,143
Let me tell you, the two of you
have one hell of a problem.

544
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:05,793
Listen, sport, we're gonna see Mommy
in just a few minutes.

545
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:08,492
- Okay.
- So Jill was tellin' 
the whole truth after all.

546
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,229
I feel like a real punk
layin' into her the way I did.

547
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:14,170
Hey, you live and you learn.

548
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,300
Yeah, but I've decided, you know, I'm gonna
finish up my time here the right way.

549
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,937
I've just been kind of
goin' through the motions.

550
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:23,174
I gotta start thinkin' about my future.

551
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:26,046
Good for you.

552
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:29,053
- Thanks a lot, Jarod. Somethin' for you.
- Hey, what's this?

553
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:31,055
- Skint Rabbit.
- Oh, wow.

554
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:34,957
"Bloody Love Bones." But don't listen to
it backwards. You'll end up here for real.

555
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:40,021
Thanks for everything.

556
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,624
I-I hope I can make this up to Jill.

557
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,828
Now's your chance.

558
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,396
Mommy!

559
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:02,050
Mommy, are we going home now?

560
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,420
We are gonna go home
in two seconds, okay?

561
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:10,427
- You look good.
- I'm startin' to feel good.

562
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:12,555
So what now?

563
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:15,429
One day at a time.

564
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:19,267
Jarod, I don't know how I could ever
repay you for everything you've done.

565
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:26,370
The debt's already been paid.

566
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,848
Thank you.

567
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:45,624
- [Phone Ringing]
- Sydney.

568
00:41:45,697 --> 00:41:47,688
I didn't think
you'd still be working.

569
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:50,792
Good of you to call.
I was getting really worried.

570
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:54,361
'Cause you thought I might have slipped
back into my childhood drug addiction?

571
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,602
Just tell me why.
Why did you let them do that to me?

572
00:41:57,676 --> 00:42:00,270
Jarod-

573
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:02,711
You're the only person that I trusted.

574
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:06,214
You were like a-

575
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,088
You should've stopped them, Sydney.

576
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,283
Jarod, I couldn't.

577
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,894
Why not?

578
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:19,897
Because I was a test subject myself.

579
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:23,763
What are you talking about?

580
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,464
I asked Raines-
Rather, I demanded...

581
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:31,134
that you be left out of the drug testing
and that they use me instead.

582
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,303
And Raines agreed.

583
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:37,314
It was only when I came out of detox
that I realized what had happened-

584
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:38,940
that he'd lied.

585
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:44,981
So you sacrificed yourself
to protect me.

586
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,753
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

587
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,991
I never wanted you
to feel obligated...

588
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:55,795
to stay here at the Centre...

589
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,995
if you had a chance to get away.

590
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,664
I'm sorry, Jarod.

591
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:03,139
I'm really sorry.

9999
