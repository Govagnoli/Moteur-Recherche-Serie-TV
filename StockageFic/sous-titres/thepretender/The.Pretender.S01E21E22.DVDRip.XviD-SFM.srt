- What the hell was that?

161
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,431
A violent reaction to
whatever was in the red notebook.

162
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:59,402
It's not red.

163
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:03,669

<i>absorbing, it's blue.</i>

165

<i>[Woman] Residents were stunned by</i>
<i>the attack on Harriet Tashman, a former nun.</i>

166
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,989
Tashman's injuries were minor...

167
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,029
and sources report that she
does not want to press charges.

168
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:01,429
At the moment, a spokesperson
for the police is telling us...

169
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,663
that they are considering
this case closed.

170
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,678

173
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:42,096
He scared me.

174
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,472
I'm glad he didn't hurt you.

175
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:50,709
Angelo has always been a mystery.

176
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,042
Something on your mind?

177
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,487
Mr. Raines was upset that
I gave you access to Angelo.

178
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:00,991
Boohoo for Dracula.

179
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,051
Angelo is his project.

180
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:06,893
Apparently, Raines has been worried
about him becoming violent.

181
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,230
- The guy is a marshmallow.
- <i>Still, he attacked you.</i>

182
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:14,238
- That justifies Raines's fear and concern for you.
- <i>Concern?</i>

183
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:20,040
Daddy, you may not want to hear this,
but I think he's working behind your back.

184
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:23,741
He would not defy me.

185
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,294
I'm sorry. Daddy,
I know that that tone is inappropriate.

186
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,356
No, no, no. You may be right.

187
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,097
I've never doubted Raines's dedication,
but he's been different.

188
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:44,165
Ever sinceJarod's been out,
I've wondered if there was something.

189
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,268
Trust me, Daddy. There is.

190
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,075
Do you have anything tangible?

191
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,316
No.

192
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:59,619
If you should find something
real, something I could trust...

193
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:03,457
I'll bring it
to your attention immediately.

194
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,328
My grandpa was
the caretaker here before me.

195
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,735
Miss Harriet, she's the woman
who owns this place...

196
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,638
gave me the job after Grandpa died.

197
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,779
She sends me money in the mail
to keep it looking pretty for her.

198
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,678
Funny, huh?

199
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,187
- Funny?
- Well, that she wants it kept looking so pretty.

200
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,746
She ain't been here
in 10 years or more.

201
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,592
Do you know where she is?
How to reach her?

202
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,826
No. I haven't talked
with her or anything.

203
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,234
Sometimes... Sometimes I wonder if
it's really her that sends the money.

204
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,407
Have you ever seen
this woman before?

205
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,979
- I have to go.
- Joe Bill, please.

206
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,883
This is my mother.
I don't know where she is.

207
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,656
Never knew my mama.

208
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,858
All there ever was
was me and Grandpa.

209
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,699
He says we're not
supposed to talk about them.

210
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,930
That they don't live here.

211
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:58,032
- They lived here?
- Over the barn.

212
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,375
Almost never came out.
Always alone.

213
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,549
She had red hair...

214
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,854
and he made planes out of wood.

215
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,894
Always planes.

216
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:22,457
When I was little, Miss Harriet,
she taught me how to read good... gooder.

217
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,526
These people always seemed like...

218
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,940
that book about the little girl
who lived in the attic.

219
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:37,108
Her name was Anne.

220
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,514
Anne Frank?

221
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,921
- The family that was hiding from the Nazis.
- Hiding.

222
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,322
Hiding.

223
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,727
<i>They left right after</i>
<i>Miss Harriet got took.</i>

224
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,963
Maybe it's them

225
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,802
Joe Bill, do you know
where they went?

226
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:06,401
Just went. They left some stuff.

<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>

228
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,318
- Yes.
- This is Agent Meadow. We got a lead on Doe.

229
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,552

here now. Ness. Ness?

- <i>[Phone Beeps Off]</i>

231
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,297
- I'll be back.
- Cabbie's in County General psych ward.

232
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,699
No injuries, but massive shock.

233
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,933
- Doc says he was literally scared nearly to death.
- What happened?

234
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:38,169
He was tied into his seat.
Mouth taped shut. Eyes taped open.

235
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,406
- Like he wanted him to watch something.
- His fate.

236
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,643
Doe parked his cab on top
of some railroad tracks facing a tunnel.

237
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,048
<i>Did the cabbie give us any leads?</i>

238
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:50,451
It's hard to talk after some psycho's
put his cigarette out on your tongue.

239
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:55,516
But he did say something about Doe
repeating, "I decide who lives or dies."

240
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,586
All the more reason for us to find him
before he finds Harriet Tashman...

241
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:02,030
if he hasn't already.

242
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,763
<i>This blue notebook</i>
<i>belonged to another subject.</i>

243
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,568
His name's Kyle, and he was part of
the Pretender program here years ago...

244
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,737
under the direction of then Dr. Raines.

245
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,806
I guess it only makes sense that you'd have
more than one freak in your farm system.

246
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,715
What makes Kyle so special?

247
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:24,118
The fact that he was
officially released from the center...

248
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,817
before the date
on the blue notebook.

249
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:32,125
Are you saying that Raines kept Kyle for
his own project? Where?

250
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,829
SL 27.

251
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,403
I rerouted the security system...

252
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,310
so if anyone has this place monitored,
it should be all right for about 30 minutes.

253
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,314
Look, since we don't have
much time...

254
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:54,580
why don't you keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

255
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,352
Fine with me. I don't wanna be
down here in the first place.

My God.

258
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,161
Somebody was forced to live here.

259
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,571
And from the look of
these striations...

260
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:21,806
he spent a great deal of time trying to
claw his way out of here.

261
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,543
<i>Sydney. Miss Parker.</i>

262
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,111

- <i>Down here. Down the hall.</i>

263
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,264
- What is it?
- It's a Brainchild.

264
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,165
One of the first generation
of super computers.

265
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:48,900
Raines's Brainchild. This is what he used
to record his work down here.

266
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,172
<i>I had a computer like this</i>
<i>in my early years with Jarod.</i>

267
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:57,476
And this was what
we stored his sims on...

268
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,915
before transferring them to D.S.A.

269
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,510
<i>Pretty useless now.</i>

270
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,525
Unless... those analogs
were backed up.

271
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:19,193
- In there? How?
- Some of these systems had
primitive hard-drive memories.

272
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,264
- [Laughs] Computer club in college.
- [Forced Chuckle]

273
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,004
Do whatever it is you have to do.

274
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,638
If it's in there, I want it out.

275
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,808
- Call me when you have it.
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

276
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,844
- You want me to stay down here? Alone?
- You still have 20 minutes.

277
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,022
Come on, Sydney.

278
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:57,402
Hi, Kyle. It's me, Jarod.
Remember?

279
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:01,241
- [Kyle] We're not supposed to talk.
- Where are you from?

280
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:05,646
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

281
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,209
I only remember here.

282
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,957
Do you know who you are?

283
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,494
- [Rewinds]

00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,098
- <i>[Miss Parker] What did you find?</i>
- <i>Ten million bits of information.</i>

<i>A lot of it's about Kyle.</i>
<i>My machines are sorting it out now...</i>

287
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,672
but I did manage to transfer one sim
onto a D.S.A. format.

288
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:38,080
- What's on it?
- It's hot. I'm tired.

289
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:43,519
I've been in Memphis
for three days. Can't sleep.

290
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,581
There's too many people
outside this motel.

291
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,651
I'm getting ready.

292
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,197
I'm gonna make history.

293
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,634
I'm gonna close a bleeding wound.

294
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:04,004
You don't think
Dr. King is a good man.

295
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,406
No. He's dividing our country.

296
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,968
We had laws, and we had order.

297
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:11,914
King doesn't obey,
and Americans, they're afraid.

298
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,474
[Young Raines]
Maybe it's you who's afraid.

299
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:19,717
No. He's the menace. Kennedy gave in
to him, and Hoover can't stop him.

300
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,818
<i>It ends now. He has to die.</i>

301
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,455
<i>[Young Raines] Now who are you</i>
<i>to make thatjudgment?</i>

302
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,967
I decide who lives or dies.

303
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,669
I decide who lives or dies.

304
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,834
- My God! He did it.
- Did what?

305
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,678
Raines. He always wanted to do this
experiment with one of the Pretenders.

306
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,742
He thought that if he could feed him
enough negative reinforcement...

307
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,084
<i>he could strip them of their morality.</i>

308
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:56,458
And he could, uh, create a sociopath.

309
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,362
I decide who lives or dies.

310
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,695
I decide who lives or dies.

311
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,205
You're all set there.

00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:28,154

- What about you, Lieutenant?

315
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:31,928
Well...

00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:38,168
- maybeJarod's right.
- [Young Raines] Damn it! That's it.

317
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:42,400
- [Young Sydney] What are you doing?
- I never should've allowed it.

318
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:46,307
- We're aborting.
- Dr. Raines. Dr. Raines.

319
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,011
A Flying Cross.
Did they give this to you?

320
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,575
No. I've just always had it.

321
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:59,419
- Dr. Raines let you keep it?
- Dr. Raines is my friend.

322
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,588
It's origami. I'll teach you
how to make it sometime.

323
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:12,534

I'd be happy to do you a favor.

488
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:08,563
New England Air? I'd like to book
a round-trip shuttle to Boston, please.

489
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:15,896
<i>All right. Gather around, people.</i>
<i>We finally got something.</i>

490
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:20,637
A phone tip. Witness saw John Doe try to
pry open an A.T.M. machine in Boston.

491
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,941
- A tip from whom?
- Some kid named Goofinski.

492
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:25,505
- We got the surveillance right here.
- <i>How do you know it's him?</i>

493
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,676
<i>Look. Look at that scar, Ness. That's him.</i>

494
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:33,246
All right. Foster, Caine,
Charles. We're going to Boston.

495
00:42:33,324 --> 00:42:35,622
- I'm checking this out personally.
- What about me? I want in.

496
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:38,184
Last thing I need is an agent
with a cold trigger finger...

497
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:40,822
- when I tell this crackpot to put his cigarette out.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

498
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:43,526
End of discussion.
You're an 18-11 on this one, Ness.

499
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:45,762
Oh, great. Desk duty.

500
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:52,974
The Dragon House is located in
a place called Delphi Shores, New Jersey.

501
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:56,377
- Thank you, Sydney.
- Chances are Raines will be...

502
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:58,915
zeroing in on the Dragon House too.

503
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:04,148
As you know, I have no choice but to give
Miss Parker the same information.

504
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,690
Go there and you won't be alone.

505
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:10,090
Loneliness is something
I left at the Centre.

506
00:43:11,562 --> 00:43:16,363
One last thing, Jarod. If you find Kyle...

507
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:20,768
you have to know
he's not the person you once knew.

508
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,830
Neither am I.

509
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,333
<i>[Harriet]</i>
<i>No.</i>

510
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:43,350
- Tell me where they are.
- I can't.

511
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,184
I heard once that
the anticipation of pain...

512
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:54,993
is far more effective
than pain itself.

513
00:44:56,934 --> 00:44:58,868
Now...

514
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:03,438
- we're gonna find out.
- <i>[Thud]</i>

515
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:24,949
My name is Jarod.
I'm here to help you.

516
00:45:29,954 --> 00:45:33,014
You're late. She's with me.

517
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:36,219
I love a class reunion.

518
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:42,691
Mr. Raines.

519
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:45,736
I knew I never should've
let you two get together.

520
00:45:45,803 --> 00:45:49,398
<i>Boys, let's go.</i>

521
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:52,272
I'm not going anywhere with you.

522
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:54,777
- Neither am I.
- [Gasps]

523
00:45:56,614 --> 00:45:58,775
Get 'em!

524
00:46:06,524 --> 00:46:10,790
Kyle, you know me. I'm Jarod.

525
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:15,128
They said Jarod was dead.
Now I decide who lives or dies.

526
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,930
Not this time.

527
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:28,437
I hit the Lotto!

528
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:32,949
<i>[Harriet]</i>
<i>Jarod, no.!</i>

529
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,382
[Miss Parker]
Jarod!

530
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:46,997
- [Sydney] Which one? Which one?
- Get Kyle!

531
00:46:57,308 --> 00:46:59,276
Get in.

532
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,214
[Engine Starts]

533
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:25,358
<i>You could've gotten us both killed.</i>

534
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,870
Why did you stop me
from shooting him?

535
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:32,774
I stopped you because
Kyle is your brother.

536
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:52,323
I don't remember my parents or
anything about having a brother.

537
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:56,560
Well, you were very young when you
were taken. We often repress, forget.

538
00:47:56,634 --> 00:47:59,296
How did they come to be with you?

539
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,033
Well, my own parents were killed
three weeks before my 11 th birthday.

540
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:08,101
I grew up in a convent, content to
give my life serving the church as a nun.

541
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:11,671
I had said my vows
and was cloistered for years.

542
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:16,448
- But it didn't take.
- Was my family tied to the convent?

543
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,012
No, no. There was another girl.
CatherineJamison.

544
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:22,992
We were real rabble-rousers.
Gave the Mother Superior hell.

545
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,029
One night we snuck out
and were crossing this frozen pond.

546
00:48:26,097 --> 00:48:28,588
I slipped in. I was drowning.

547
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,466
Catherine dove in, dragged me out
and then breathed life back into me.

548
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:37,132
She never became a nun,
but the spirit that glowed in her...

549
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,871
was something I've been
unable to achieve despite years of prayer.

550
00:48:40,945 --> 00:48:44,142
Then after she left the convent,
she married a man by the name of...

551
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:46,877
- Parker.
- Yes.

552
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,782
Catherine Parker.

553
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:51,720
- Did you know her?
- Her daughter.

554
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:54,349
What did she
have to do with my parents?

555
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:58,759
Well, in 1969,
the year I inherited this farm...

556
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:01,992
Mother Superior called
and said Catherine needed help.

557
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:06,400
Catherine showed up and asked me
to shelter a man and a woman...

558
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,463
who had had
their two young sons abducted.

559
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,509
Is that when
my parents came here?

560
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:16,410
I knew them as Charles and Margaret.

561
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,678
They were afraid.
They'd been searching for years...

562
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,049
and they were on the run.

563
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,054
It was safe here.

564
00:49:27,024 --> 00:49:29,754
Did they ever talk
or ask about me or my brother?

565
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:33,354
They never talked. I never asked.

566
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,423
It was too painful.
Especially for your father.

567
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,832
<i>It was clear how deeply</i>
<i>he missed his sons.</i>

568
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:41,736
<i>Did they ever say</i>
<i>who they thought might've taken us?</i>

569
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:45,298
<i>I think your father was afraid it would</i>
<i>affect your mother's health.</i>

570
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,670
[Crying]

571
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:57,448
- The baby.
- <i>She gave birth to a little girl a month later.</i>

572
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:07,954
- <i>I have a sister.</i>
- <i>Her name is Emily.</i>

573
00:50:08,032 --> 00:50:10,899
- Emily.
- <i>[Harriet Chuckles]</i>

574
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,869
There are no pictures.
I'm sorry.

575
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,737
Years later, I started getting threatening
phone calls and letters from Kyle.

576
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,745
<i>He must've figured out</i>
<i>I had some tie to your parents.</i>

577
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:26,647
He was desperate.
He thought I could help him.

578
00:50:28,152 --> 00:50:32,282
It was after the kidnapping
that your family vanished.

579
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:36,950
You've been hiding here ever since.

580
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:40,191
I'd lost contact
with Catherine Parker years earlier.

581
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:44,633
I felt alone, and I was afraid.
So I went underground.

582
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:48,138
<i>Your parents loved you, Jarod.</i>

583
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:51,072
They loved and they missed
you and your brother.

584
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,924
Do you remember where you first lived
when you came to the Centre?

585
00:51:19,437 --> 00:51:24,136
At first, three doors down
from the corridor entrance.

586
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:29,373
- Later, sublevel...
- What was the Manchester Solution?

587
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:33,240
The Manchester Solution.

588
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:38,983
l-I don't remember any solution
because the job was blown.

589
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:42,048
- I could've done it alone. I simmed it correct...
- [Whirring]

590
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:48,892
The others lost the will, but I didn't.

591
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:52,231
I decide who lives or dies.
I decide who lives or dies.

592
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:55,795
[Whirring]

593
00:51:55,873 --> 00:51:59,536
You said after all those years in prison,
he'd remember nothing.

594
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,773
- He can't remember everything.
- He remembers too much.

595
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:04,872
Jarod alone is bad enough.

596
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:08,612
I brought him in.
Why is <i>he</i> here?

597
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:13,020
- I asked him to be.
- Who in the hell is Kyle anyway?

598
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,422
Or should I say <i>what?</i>

599
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:17,825
Kyle is someone of concern to me.

600
00:52:17,895 --> 00:52:22,355
You missed Jarod. It was your best chance,
and he's still out there.

601
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:25,095
I know you're upset.

602
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:28,570
I should've told you that
I had brought Mr. Raines in on this.

603
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,097
I apologize. But things were
moving quickly.

604
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,838
Now Mr. Raines and I
will handle Kyle.

605
00:52:34,912 --> 00:52:38,040
- But, Daddy...
- No, no, no. Trust me.

606
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:44,581
Sydney, do you think
Jarod might return to the Centre?

607
00:52:44,655 --> 00:52:47,852
There's nothing here thatJarod wants.

608
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:50,416
And Jarod always has an objective.

609
00:52:50,494 --> 00:52:52,894
Besides, even though we never
figured out how he got out...

610
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:58,060
our latest security improvements are
quite beyond anyone's capabilities.

611
00:52:58,135 --> 00:53:00,569
Even Jarod's.

612
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:11,579
That's the first time I have ever heard you
doubtJarod's abilities.

613
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:15,813
Let's just hope they believed it
as much as you did.

614
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,803
- Get him out of here.
- No! Jarod, help!

615
00:53:39,877 --> 00:53:42,846
No, leave me alone.

616
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:46,610
Jarod! Jarod!

617
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:49,084
<i>Jarod, help me.!</i>

<i>[Dog Barking In Distance]</i>

619
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:47,306
You said it was
a matter of great importance.

620
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:50,370
[Quietly]
I want you to help me get to Kyle.

621
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:54,941
- Why?
- Because he knows something
about my mother's death.

622
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,389
What do you want me to do? Beg?

<i>[Birds Fluttering]</i>

624
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:12,395
What makes you so certain
that Kyle can help you?

625
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:14,835
Because he was Mr. Raines's pet project.

626
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:21,671
I feel it. Sydney, I feel it.
Kyle knows who killed my mother.

627
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:28,641
Look, they're keeping him in a section
I don't have access to.

628
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,519
Also, they're monitoring him
round the clock from the tech room.

629
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:37,083
There's just no way for
anyone to get there undetected.

630
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:42,827
- Right?
- Mmm, well, that's not entirely true.

00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:47,931
What do you mean?

632
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:50,997
I mean, I got us into
SL 27, didn't I?

633
00:55:52,743 --> 00:55:56,406
I could probably bypass the sensors...

634
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,474
and at a designated time,
loop the camera feed into the monitor system.

635
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:03,713
Well, for how long?

636
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:07,283
Mmm, long enough.

You're the one who decides
who lives or dies, right?
