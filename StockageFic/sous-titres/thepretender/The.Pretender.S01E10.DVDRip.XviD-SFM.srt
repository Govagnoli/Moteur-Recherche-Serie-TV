Heart attack makes sense. Folks at

<i>The eggnog was hard when we found it,</i>
<i>but it wasn't completely frozen through.</i>

49

had quite a bit of brandy in it.

- Oh, there's a shocker.
- <i>The milk had time to curdle.</i>

53

he'd have to visit

Which would mean his reindeer would have
to travel about 700 miles per second...

something under the tree
on Christmas.

184

a spirit, a feeling, that made you feel good.

185

Well, as long as you have that feeling,
Christmas George is gonna be right here.
