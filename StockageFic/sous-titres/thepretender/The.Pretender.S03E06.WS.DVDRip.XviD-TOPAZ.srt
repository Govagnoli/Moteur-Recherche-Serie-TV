167
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,220
<i>Yeah. Right. Right.</i>

168
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,962
<i>You're not as stupid as you look.</i>
<i>8.00 tonight.</i>

169
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,233
So, how's freedom treatin' you
on this fine morning, Jarod?

170
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,208
- It takes gettin' used to.
- It's a big world, full of surprises.

171
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,801
Kinda like that surprise I found
in my shower yesterday.

172
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,938
She didn't give you any lip, did she?

173
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,278
No. Just wasn't expecting guests,
that's all.

174
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,080
<i>It's like ridin'a bicycle.</i>
<i>You know how to ride a bicycle, don't ya?</i>

You get on and you just-
[Laughing]

176
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,290
- Now, that's funny.
- Yeah.

177
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,795
<i>You know what else is funny? Here I am, fresh</i>
<i>out of prison, and already my parole officer...</i>

178
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,060
he's supplied me with enough smack
to kill a horse...

179
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,430
<i>and a female</i>
<i>who may or may not be underage.</i>

180
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:33,164
Now, if the intention is to ease
the inmate back into society...

181
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,969
this seems a little bit rushed.

182
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,670
Well, I didn't expect you to shoot
the entire bag in one sitting.

183
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,806
As for the bimbo,
she's 22 goin' on 15.

184
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,817
<i>Come on. Sit down.

185
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,218
I just like my people
to be relaxed when they work.

186
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,782
And by "work," you don't mean
the metal shop, I assume.

187
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,362
Jarod Barker.

188
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,957
Arrested at age 14...

189
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,867
for petty larceny.

190

<i>Two aggravated assault convictions...</i>

193
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,238
and a handful of parole violations.

194
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,781
I won a spelling bee once
when I was seven.

195
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:20,613
Look.

196
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:25,122
You know how many opportunities are out there
for an ex-con with a history of violence?

197
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,316
<i>Zero. Nada.</i>

198
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,792

199
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:33,854
<i>Be at this address tonight at 10.00 p.m.</i>

200
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:44,304
<i>Oh, and, Jarod, one more thing.</i>

201
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,071
Stay away from Lupe Harmon.

202
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,707
How'd you know I talked to Lupe?

203
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,909
It's my job to know what you do.

204
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:56,010
<i>You did time with her husband up in Mayfiield.</i>
<i>What's his name?</i>

205
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,578
- What was his name?
- Bobby.

206
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:02,057
Right. Bobby. Terrible situation.

207
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:05,220
- He was one of your guys, wasn't he?
- <i>Just stay away from the widow.</i>

208
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,992
She can only cause you trouble.

209
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,534
You're the boss, right?

210
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,491
May I join you?

211
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,432
Sydney.

212
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:46,230
What are you doing here?

213
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,295
I thought you might need a friend.

214
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,679
Yeah.

215
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:59,046
- I like it here.
- Mmm.

216
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:03,178
Especially in the morning,
when everything still seems possible.

217
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,392
Sorry.

218
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,725
It's all right.

219
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,731
Thank you.

220
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,434
He's only 54 years old, Sydney.
It's not fair.

221
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,132
No, it's not.

222
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,107
How did you know that George was here?

223
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,410
An old friend sent me a message.

224
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:35,248
<i>Michelle, if you want someone</i>
<i>to talk to...</i>

225

- [Sighs]
- What is it?

227
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:53,537
It's Nicholas.
He's not handling this very well.

228
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:57,404
He's so, so angry.

229
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,211
It's painful
to lose someone you love.

230
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:12,987
He still doesn't know
that you're his real father.

231
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,125
It's not important now.

232
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,258
My husband is dying, Sydney.

233
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,393
Would you pray with me?

234
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,302
Of course I will.

- I would remember something like that.
- Yeah.

243
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:14,916
Did you, uh, tellJack
that we took a walk in the park?

244
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,278
I might have mentioned it.

245

What you workin' on?

246

249
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,636
No. That's terrible.

and a father who loves you.

337

He's not my father.

00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,097
You're wrong, Nicholas.

339
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,793
Being a father is more than giving life.

340
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:47,803
It's being there in the middle of the night
when you're sick or afraid or alone.

341
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:51,500
And it's teaching you how to ride a bike,
how to catch a fish...

342
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,668
how to tie a tie.

343
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:59,309
Being a parent

344

How much money did you say

362
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,103
It could be north of $100,000. Apparently,
the old gentleman does not trust banks.

363

I used to send Bobby
a single red rose every Friday.

374
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:18,083
He used to put them

Bobby wrote me twice a week.

377
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,754
He never mentioned anyone named Jarod.

Oh, yeah, he probably wouldn't.

379
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,893
I was transferred to Bobby's cell block
three weeks before he was released...

380
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,838

other things on his mind.

- You have great kids.

That's surprising. I thought
you were keepin' a close eye on me.

00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,970
I bought some steaks and a bottle of wine.

Jarod, I had no choice.

410

- Who was he? Just another sucker?

I was supposed to be
looking out for him.

421
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,650
I thought that paying for Michael's
medical care might turn things around...

422
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,314

that it was an accident.

All right, I did it! I did it!

496
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,862
You did what?

497
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,831
You... did... what?

498
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,391
I killed Bobby Harmon.

499
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:55,097
I made it look like it was a robbery.

500
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:59,165
How many other home invasion robberies
using parolees were you involved with?

501
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,507
- L-
- [Shouts] How many?

502
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,512
Uh, 10, 12.

- Sure thing, Jack.

506

<i>I heard my dogs.</i>

507
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,986
- I heard you shoot!
- What, this?

508
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,264
Neat trick, huh? Oh, one other thing.

509
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,105
- Look at this!

<i>Pardon me, Mrs. Stamatis, but the doctor</i>
<i>thinks you should say good-bye now.</i>

517
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:08,903
- I don't think I can do this.
- I can go in with you.

518
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,439
No, no.
L- I need to be alone with him.

519
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,884
But Nicholas should be here.

520
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,445
He needs to say good-bye to him.

521
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,942
Hi.

522
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,572
- Hey.
- Hey.

523

I love you... so much.

Always.

527
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,761
It just doesn't seem fair.

528
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,329
We have so much to do.
We have so much more to share.

529
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:13,103
Shh.

530
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,608

Oh.

I'm glad I was of some comfort to you.

544

What now?

545

Well, I go home and try to get on

A good life.

Good-bye, Sydney.

Until we meet again.

549
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,195
I never thought I could feel
more alone than I did...

550
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,998
when I heard my father was dying.

551

- I was wrong.
- Time's a great healer.

552
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,174
Time. Is that how you got over
losing your family?

553
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:00,748
I will never get over that...

Who shall I say I am,

Well, a man can't ask

00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,895
And I owe any chance I have
of knowing my son to you, Jarod.

Well, everyone deserves to have a family.

Yes.

00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,231
Yes, you did.
