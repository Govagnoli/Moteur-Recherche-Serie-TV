1
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,466
See, to cap a motherfucker,

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,501
you put a pistol to his head,
say, "pow," and he tagged.

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,070
- But when Chris and them do it--
- Yo, it ain't working, Na'.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,812
- I know you making this up.
- Word to my mother, yo. Lex ain't dead.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,685
I seen him creeping in an alley
last night near the playground.

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,348
Everybody know Lex is dead.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,950
Nah, there's dead,
and there's special dead.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,256
Yeah, Chris working
that juju shit.

9
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,660
Nah, man, what I'm saying
is they zombies.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,258
Why you think he take them into vacants?
He need time to change them.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,825
You don't believe me,
yo, it's on you.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,428
Yo, they funnin',
ain't they, Michael?

13
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,598
I don't know about
that voodoo shit, man, but Chris

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,098
is definitely doing something--
get a nigger to walk up in there

15
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,907
knowing he about
to get capped, man.

16
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,743
Chris, he different. You can tell
by them coon-ass country clothes

17
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,977
that nigger be wearing.

18
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,383
Nine?

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,786
Nah, too much bark.

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,084
Probably a.40-cal.

21
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,725
Yeah, man,
this is serious business.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,523
So you saying
Lex is a zombie?

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,962
Pookie, Byron,
all them niggers.

24
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,831
- And Chris?
- Yeah, Chris-- Zombie Master.

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,134
I knew this
wasn't going away.

26
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,197
That's what we've been trying
to tell you, yo. Chris got the power.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,003
He tell them to come,
and they gotta come--

28
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,442
Iike the devil do
with the damned.

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,945
What you think
Chris got them doing?

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,244
They're probably
spies, man.

31
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,808
Can't figure any other way
Marlo knows so much.

32
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,185
Yeah, that's what it is. Like in this
movie, "Zombie Killer" or something.

33
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,122
They came out at night, hunting.

34
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,057
- Hunting?
- Yeah, man. They--

35
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,357
Yeah, and in that movie they was
snatching people up,

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,425
stealing their warmth.

37
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,327
St. Jude, patron
of lost causes.

38
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,665
Tell me you ain't
been on bended knee

39
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,365
whispering in his saintly ear
each and every night

40
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,997
before you close
those peepers.

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,009
I know you have, Tommy,
catch a break like this.

42
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,136
Stan, you're sure
about this?

43
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,771
On my mother's soul.
It's a lock.

44
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,873
Assigned a rookie--
a broad, no less--

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,850
as lead detective.

46
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,476
Pulled a good man off,
too, I heard.

47
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,113
Hmm. Tom.

48
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,851
Tommy, remember--

49
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,291
anything you need.

50
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,597
He's a piece of work.

51
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,966
Valchek?
Comes with the territory.

52
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,766
You want the First District
council seat,

53
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,863
you make nice with whatever Polish
or Greek commander

54
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,670
- they dump in the southeast.
- Not ltalian.

55
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,176
No, there ain't enough of us left
down there.

56
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,805
- You think he has this right?
- That Royce tampered with the case?

57
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,213
No way the mayor knows.

58
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,683
You're right. This one has Ervin Burrell
written all over it.

59
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,686
Fuck if the mayor knows or not.
If it's true,

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,347
we get it out there quick
and bang him hard.

61
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,414
- I go public?
- They can't spin this.

62
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,516
They sabotaged
a criminal case.

63
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,120
No spin on a knuckleball, you still
can't tell how it's gonna break.

64
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,472
We feed it to Tony Gray. We keep
ourselves out of the line of fire,

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,941
sting Royce,
and as an added bonus,

66
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,603
give Gray's campaign
a boost

67
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,374
which comes at the expense
of the mayor's base.

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,413
I'm a devious motherfucker
once I get going.

69
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,081
So all told,

70
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,989
we're looking at 13 warrants
and six locations.

71
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,550
And given my staffing
situation...

72
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,459
Not a problem.

73
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,397
I can give you my D.E.U.,
Flex, and Ops squads.

74
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,799
- A sector of uniforms if you need it.
- Great.

75
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,430
The problem is, you're wasting a wiretap
on street-level arrests.

76
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,497
We do these raids right,
we might catch Marlo

77
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,907
or one of his lieutenants
at one of these locations,

78
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,241
- get them with dope on the table.
- Marlo Stanfield--

79
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,770
in a room,
with dope on the table?

80
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,307
I've kicked down doors
and surprised bigger players than him.

81
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,047
Well, let me warn you,
Lieutenant--

82
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,487
I am not about
to litigate a wiretap

83
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,149
for a handful
of street rips.

84
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,285
Well... that's on you,
Counselor.

85
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,318
No, it's not.

86
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,923
Major, see you tomorrow.

87
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,802
Floaters--
you had any more?

88
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,505
- No more than usual for the season.
- What about decomps?

89
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,206
What do you got
in the decomp room?

90
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,442
- Two or three unidentifieds.
- Found in Baltimore?

91
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,144
No. Actually,
two from Prince George's,

92
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,209
- one from Dorchester.
- Nah, he wouldn't drive that far.

93
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,777
Let me get
this straight:

94
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,119
You're looking for extra bodies,
no one in particular,

95
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,785
other than this one kid you already
put out on the teletype.

96
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,623
Yeah. You on it.

97
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,754
You fellas
don't have enough work?

98
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,566
If you do your classwork,
homework,

99
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,229
you earn stickers.

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,000
Dag, yo, every day
you be changing it up.

101
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,769
You got us confused, Mr. P.

102
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,835
Behave in class,
that's another sticker.

103
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,339
At the end of the week, the four
with the most stickers get a prize

104
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,750
and are eligible for a grand drawing
at the end of the month.

105
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,551
Don't do your work,

106
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,523
misbehave in class...

107
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,161
...your name goes here.

108
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:14,030
Detention-- a full hour after school,
no exceptions.

109
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,001
So it's up to you--
stickers for prizes

110
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,698
or stay with me
after school.

111
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,003
Yo, Mr. P., why you do me
detention, huh?

112
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,736
You interrupted
the class, Namond.

113
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,768
Yo, when you first came in here,
you was all treating us straight up,

114
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,145
and now you just dog me
before I even know the rules.

115
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,173
That ain't right, man.

116
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,755
When you're right, Namond,
you're right.

117
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,124
Hey, Mr. P., I want me
some of them stickers.

118
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,288
Zenobia,
you have to do your work.

119
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,595
I want to,
but I ain't got no pencils.

120
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,137
I don't want
no damn welfare pencil!

121
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,917
It seems to me

122
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,655
there are two kinds of kids
walking in this building--

123
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,425
stoop kids
and corner kids.

124
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,398
- Excuse me?
- You know, stoop kids

125
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,027
stay on their front steps
when their parents tell them.

126
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,764
The others go down
to the corners.

127
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,898
They can't sit still in the class.
The others can and do.

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,932
- So separate the two.
- That's tracking.

129
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,377
- Excuse me?
- Tracking students.

130
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,607
It's a nasty phrase
in educational circles.

131
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,674
It refers to the grouping of children
based on expected performance.

132
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,744
- What's wrong with it?
- It says you have reduced expectations

133
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,314
for certain students, that you expect
less from them academically.

134
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,423
So you pretend
to teach all these kids,

135
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,452
and the truth is,
you ain't teaching any of them.

136
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,293
But what if
the stoop kids

137
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,595
could be in classrooms
where there was no disruptions?

138
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,727
- And the corner kids?
- They're the ones you're after, right?

139
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,498
That's why you got
the grant money.

140
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,132
As long as this doesn't involve
warehousing children,

141
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,437
I'm for anything that
allows me to do my job.

142
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,535
Every teacher here
will tell you the same.

143
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,046
The trick for you is
to come up with a program

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,344
that actually addresses itself
to the corner kids.

145
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,716
We start pulling kids out of regular
classes-- won't they be stigmatized?

146
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,449
There's not a stigma in being
booted out of class every other day?

147
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,252
Question is,

148
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,088
how do we identify
the corner kids?

149
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,593
That won't be a problem.

150
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,131
Okay. Okay.

151
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,605
You understand the work?

152
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,713
Come on, this is easy.
I know you can do it.

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,514
You're not giving me a choice.
You have detention.

154
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,820
Yo, Na', Mrs. D.
shaking bushes.

155
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,224
Back to your seats.

156
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,631
What the fuck?
She got my blade, yo.

157
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,690
I said,
"Back to your seats."

158
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,667
Yo, Mrs. D. be stealing shit.

159
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,940
I ain't never gonna
get my blade back.

160
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,211
Yo, what are you all up on me for?
I do my work.

161
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,151
I'm not your yo.
Show me your work.

162
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,955
Yeah, I see.

163
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,327
Yo, my hand hurting from all this
learning. You got some Tylenol?

164
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,065
What I got for you
is detention.

165
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,830
Oh-hh!

166
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,667
- You know what? Fuck you, Prezbo.
- Oh-hh!

167
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,900
Fucking gimpy-assed,
big-grill motherfucker.

168
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,772
That's it.
You're out of here!

169
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,373
Go!

170
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,882
Get your police stick
out your desk and beat me.

171
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:03,793
- You know you fucking want to.
- Oh-hh.

172
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,061
Everyone, back in your seat.

173
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,090
The fuck you
looking at, bitch?

174
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,237
Oh-hh, Ms. Sampson, l--

175
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,138
Namond Brice, if you weren't headed
to the main office,

176
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,904
- you are now.
- Yeah, I was just--

177
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,116
One of the corner
kids, huh?

178
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,744
Yeah, they do step up
when you need them, don't they?

179
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,688
Look, what? You want me to say
you right? You right.

180
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,089
I should have had protection
at the card game.

181
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,683
Done is done.

182
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,695
Now we need to decide what we're
gonna do about Omar.

183
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,219
You make the price right,

184
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,631
somebody gonna get a whiff of that
bushwhacker's ass.

185
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,931
Now you take it
from there.

186
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,698
You think so?

187
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,265
I ain't saying Omar can't be got.
Any nigger can be got.

188
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,935
But once we put
word to ear

189
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,739
and he learn that
we pricing out his head,

190
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,803
he's gonna be trying us
like we're trying him.

191
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,910
- You saying I should let it slide?
- Nah.

192
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,977
Nah, we get at him
another way,

193
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,683
get at him without no bounties,
no bullshit like that.

194
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,249
Barksdale turned this town upside down
hunting him,

195
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,261
and all he ended up looking
was weak.

196
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,455
I ain't no Barksdale.

197
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,987
I'm just saying
talk is cheap.

198
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,830
We sit on it, we gonna figure out a way
to get that faggot.

199
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,804
But till then we don't
say a mumbling word.

200
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:29,207
I got me six now, and I'll give you
the four later, all right? Come on!

201
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,808
- Nah. I'm gonna need the whole 10 now.
- Sherrod!

202
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,620
- You ain't in school?
- I'm half a day-- teachers' meeting.

203
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,089
Come on, I told you about
those lame excuses, man.

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,117
- I was talking to him first.
- Ain't no need for physical contact--

205
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,753
You got $4 for me?
I'm short $4.

206
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,424
What the fuck
are you talking--

207
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,025
Got a cart full of shit, nigger.
What you got for me?

208
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,002
I know you holding.

209
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,936
Where's it at?
You ain't hear?

210
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,303
Okay.

211
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,002
It's in my shoe--
my shoe.

212
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,446
Don't need
the four now, son.

213
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,323
Damn, yo, where the shovel at?
Bury that nigger, man.

214
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,821
Here you go, sir,
thank you.

215
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,883
- Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
- Good luck, Tommy.

216
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,554
- Hey, Mr. Carcetti, you got my vote.
- Thanks.

217
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,153
- Tom Carcetti.
- Hey, thank you very much.

218
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,562
- Here you go.
- Good luck, Councilman.

219
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,429
How you doing?
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.

220
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,435
Okay, Councilman,
time to hit the West Side.

221
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,775
Pretty motherfucker--

222
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,513
he's gonna make me go
to my game face.

223
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,916
Okay, I'll take 25 of the honeysuckle
incense cones--

224
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,893
they'll keep me
healthy for next week.

225
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,488
- Tommy!
- Excuse me.

226
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,299
Tony Gray's people say
20 minutes at their place.

227
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,636
Shit, Clarence.
Look like you did in '98

228
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,904
when you surprised
the hell out of everyone.

229
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,570
Just bring 'em on.

230
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,380
Why give it to us? Why don't you
stick it to Royce yourself?

231
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,442
Because after what Tommy did
at the debate,

232
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,546
it'll seem like more of the same
if it comes from him.

233
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,923
And if we use it to take four
or five points out of Royce's base,

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,791
it helps him as much as us.

235
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,990
Once bitten, twice shy.

236
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,761
With Tommy Carcetti,
I got to always think a step ahead.

237
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,634
Look, Tony, you ain't gonna win.
So the only question is

238
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,265
whether you wanna lose
with 24% of the vote

239
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,207
or 28%.

240
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,142
You bring the numbers up,

241
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,338
you look good
for the legislature--

242
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,577
maybe a congressional run.

243
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,311
- Albert Stokes.
- Here.

244
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,946
Mr. P., can I go? My moms told me to go
straight home after school.

245
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,047
Mine too.

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,615
You should have thought of that
before you smeared ink

247
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,287
all over my desk.

248
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,852
Weren't my fault.
My pen exploded.

249
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,428
Michael.

250
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,161
Michael Lee?

251
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,431
Mr. P., please,
can I go?

252
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,462
I ain't eat no lunch, and my stomach
making all these noises.

253
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:46,001
Look, I won't ever disrespect
your pencil again, I promise.

254
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,013
Zenobia, it wasn't
about the pencil.

255
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,039
Please, Mr. P.

256
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:04,260
- Okay okay, all right.
- All right.

257
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,491
Just this one time,
I'll make an exception.

258
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,667
But next time, expect
to stay the full hour.

259
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,915
- Why are you here?
- Came to say sorry.

260
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,546
I didn't mean to get
all up in your face like that.

261
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,516
I appreciate that, Namond.

262
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,152
It takes courage
to admit when you're wrong.

263
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,357
What I can't understand-- I've seen you
in Ms. Sampson's class doing your work.

264
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,560
- Why can't you do the same in here?
- I mean to, I do.

265
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,127
It's just the evil get in me and before
I know it, I go off.

266
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,097
Well...

267
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,075
tomorrow we'll see
if we can do better.

268
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,772
Can't tomorrow.
Mrs. D. put me out.

269
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,145
I gotta bump.
Later, Mr. P.

270
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,586
If you can wait
outside...

271
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,612
It's okay.
He can stay.

272
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,616
Thank you.

273
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,623
Mr. P., you know
Michael can't make it to detention.

274
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,691
I know he didn't.
Now it's doubled.

275
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,568
- He's got two days to serve.
- Nah, I mean, he can't.

276
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,937
He got to go pick up
his little brother from school.

277
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,169
Well, he'll just have to
find somebody else to do that.

278
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,206
It-- it ain't like that.

279
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,874
I mean, Michael would come
if he could,

280
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,850
but wouldn't have nobody else
to pick up his little brother Bug.

281
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,115
You know, his mother,
she on that stuff.

282
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,761
We walking home.
You coming?

283
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,357
Oh, no, I'm waiting on Alpo.
Ms. Sampson got him doing detention.

284
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,697
- You gonna be here till, like, 5:00.
- Yeah, she a hard lady.

285
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,600
She don't ever give
a brother no play.

286
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,505
- All right. I'll holla at you later.
- All right, yo.

287
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,237
So you're not gonna be
in the NBA?

288
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,180
Then it must be the NFL?

289
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,843
I thought all the boys in class
were gonna join the pros.

290
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,442
Nah, that's just
something we say.

291
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,718
So what about you?

292
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,986
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

293
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,425
I'm gonna own
my own store.

294
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,555
That's smart. You're gonna need
to know a lot of math.

295
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,499
You left them in there.

296
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,135
- Oh-hh.
- Hey, don't worry, Mr. P.

297
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,165
We got you.
Hey, Donut!

298
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,838
- Yo, yeah.
- Donut's crazy with cars.

299
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,346
He can open anything.

300
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,711
- Hey. What up, man?
- Hey.

301
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,876
Yo, he locked
his keys in there.

302
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,853
It's okay,
I can call AAA.

303
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,518
Oh, no problem, chief.

304
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,666
Feel the need
to work them corners, huh?

305
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,469
I'm just asking 'cause you don't need
to be doing what you're doing.

306
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,442
I need to learn some shit
on my own.

307
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,310
I'm trying
to help you, Sherrod,

308
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,439
but you making it
so I can't.

309
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,416
I didn't even know
the man who beat on you, Bubs.

310
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,077
He was short money
on the corner.

311
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,053
I swear he wasn't
nothing to me.

312
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,318
Yeah, but when the shit start,
there's nothing to be done, right?

313
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,292
What would I have done
if he started whaling on you?

314
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,320
Same kind of nothing, see?
That's how the corners be.

315
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,097
They going to use you up,
Sherrod.

316
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,572
You welcome to stay tonight, but you
ain't in school tomorrow morning,

317
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,670
this partnership need
to be done.

318
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,269
These two precincts
are the bellwether for the Fifth.

319
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,747
If you can take even 18%
out of Carcetti in these,

320
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,249
it's a good guess he won't
have the numbers citywide.

321
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,377
And who are we ticketed
with over here?

322
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,479
The N.D.O.,
I hope, because...

323
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,716
...this amid allegations that
high-ranking police officials intervened

324
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,754
to have a veteran police detective
removed from the controversial case.

325
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,029
The Braddock murder became
a focal point in the mayoral campaign

326
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,400
when Councilman
Thomas Carcetti alleged

327
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,428
the West Baltimore man
was killed

328
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,703
because he was
a witness in the case.

329
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,642
...Because they were afraid
the police would prove

330
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,770
what they most fear, that
Fredro Braddock was murdered

331
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,077
because he was a witness,
and the city failed to protect him.

332
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,782
It's on all three channels.

333
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,515
And "The Sun" and "The Post"
are both calling for comment.

334
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,454
And my sources within the department say
the rank-and-file officers

335
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,896
are simply appalled by this blatant
political manipulation.

336
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,558
Damn, turn it up.

337
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,296
Hey, Greggs, you're famous.

338
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,600
...is to remove
a highly-decorated veteran

339
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,698
with 15 years' experience as a murder
investigator without reason...

340
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,538
- That'd be me.
- Then replaced with a rookie

341
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,510
who has yet to handle a single
homicide investigation...

342
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,911
- That'd be you.
-...then we need to rethink...

343
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,244
- The fuck I ever do to him?

344
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,345
You gonna make it
too heavy, yo.

345
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,219
It might work
if we make it bigger.

346
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,282
It would work if we
had balsa wood, you know?

347
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,090
- It's really light and strong.
- Man, you so full of--

348
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,562
oh, shit.

349
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,428
Zombie Master.

350
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,435
Need to take us
a little walk.

351
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,614
Nah, I'm good here.

352
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,243
Yo. Young'uns need
to move along.

353
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,217
Sure, Chris, we'll bump.

354
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,921
- Yo, Snoop, your sister in my class.
- What the fuck?

355
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,555
You high
or something, nigger?

356
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,967
You boys be
smoking that shit?

357
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,636
Hearing good things
about you.

358
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,836
Say you straight up,
take care of your people,

359
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,402
not begging no handouts.

360
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,710
Motherfucker, you hear the nigger
talking to you,

361
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,310
giving you praises and shit. You
standing here looking fucking stupid.

362
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,650
Yo, chill.

363
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,417
Sometimes
she get a little hot.

364
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,482
I'm just saying
the boy ain't right!

365
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,461
Yo, we always in the market
for a good soldier.

366
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,897
When we see one we like,
we take care of the situation--

367
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,129
take him in, school him,
make him family.

368
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,932
And if you're with us,
you're with us,

369
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,667
just like we'd be
with you all the way.

370
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,299
You have a mind,
you're in.

371
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,971
Look, man.
I already got a family--

372
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,640
my moms
and my little brother.

373
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,582
Yeah, heard that.

374
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,609
But think on it.

375
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,121
We'll be around
if you need something.

376
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,207
He saw me, yo. I knew it.

377
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,141
I knew Chris was asking Michael
about me.

378
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,804
I knew it, man.
I'm dead.

379
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,181
- Yo, man, good looking out.
- Yeah.

380
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,184
- I thought they was gonna--
- Yeah, I know, I know.

381
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,550
What-what he ask about me?
I know he asked about me.

382
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,487
- What'd you say? What'd you tell him?
- Calm down,

383
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,114
- it weren't even about you.
- Yo, for real,

384
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,751
you need to tell me.
What did he ask you?

385
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,653
Yo, you right, man.
Chris was all up in your business.

386
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,962
He down on you
for some deep shit, man.

387
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,696
I don't even know what.

388
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,466
Nah, I'm just fucking
with you, man.

389
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,203
He didn't even
speak your name.

390
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,874
Oh, man.

391
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,724
So, Erv, what's next? Your officers
gonna shoot a couple of tourists?

392
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,659
Maybe fly a helicopter
into Harbor Place?

393
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:00,563
What can we expect the last week
of my re-election campaign?

394
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,464
Sir, I did what you asked--
no more, no less.

395
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,696
Hamsterdam--
legalized drug zone?

396
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,499
Oh, he takes responsibility
for that.

397
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,836
- The subpoenas all over town.
- That, too.

398
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,002
Well, then the leak about the witness
murder. That was his shop too, right?

399
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,568
- Hell, yeah.
- And now this last thing,

400
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,380
transferring detectives off the case--
what is that? What is that?

401
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,885
- Scuttling the investigation.
- Yeah, right.

402
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,684
- Yeah, that's awful-- Jesus!
- Mr. Mayor, you asked me

403
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,521
- to slow that investigation down.
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

404
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,823
Subtle, Ervin. Hmm?

405
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,159
You hold a few facts
for a few weeks.

406
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,166
You put a report or two
in a desk drawer.

407
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,532
But the transferring
of people off a case?!

408
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,436
Look, you told me...

409
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,303
you specifically
wanted me to not--

410
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,433
Ervin, you may leave.

411
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:49,175
- Mr. Mayor--
- That will be all, Commissioner.

412
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,588
Nuh-uh.

413
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,426
No, I need a word or two
with your deputy, Ervin.

414
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,437
Have a seat.

415
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,186
I tried to warn him.

416
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,688
I mean, if it leaked out of Homicide
about the dead witness,

417
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,748
why wouldn't it leak that we
bumped a detective?

418
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,350
Why didn't you come to us
beforehand?

419
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:40,359
I'm a loyal subordinate,
Mr. Mayor,

420
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,265
and Ervin is a good man working
under considerable pressure.

421
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,700
He's a hack.

422
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,170
You're not bothered
by the pressure, Deputy?

423
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,196
Not in the least.

424
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,877
I need you to make this
go away, Bill.

425
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,679
I won't forget,
believe me.

426
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,431
Another thing-- Slim Charles
got up with me.

427
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,297
Said the fat man
want a sitdown.

428
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,359
Nah. I did that already.

429
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,271
Well, Slim say the fat man knew
the card game was gonna get took.

430
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,242
He did, did he?
Set it up.

431
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,767
Why you always
be back here?

432
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,042
Quiet. And I can see
what comes.

433
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,413
But you out in the weather
and shit.

434
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,010
- I don't like to speak in no rooms.
- Yeah.

435
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,953
Yo, oh-oh,
you ain't staying long.

436
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,889
So you know,
I almost got that for you.

437
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,519
I just need
a couple of days more.

438
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,496
You can keep my money
for now.

439
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,762
- I got something that needs doing.
- Anything, Marlo-- your call.

440
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,498
Omar gonna come in your store,
stick it up, rob you.

441
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,907
You gonna call the police,
make a report. You feel me?

442
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,706
Yeah, that'll work, but, uh,
you know when he get out,

443
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,179
he's coming right at me,
I ain't scared or nothing.

444
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,375
- I'm just saying, you know?
- He ain't gonna get out.

445
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,418
A man make bail on robbery.

446
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,985
Make it no bail.

447
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,399
If you have a problem,

448
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,335
Iike you can't make it
to detention,

449
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,361
you need to tell me.

450
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,032
That's your responsibility.

451
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,872
People will be more than willing
to help you out,

452
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,901
but it's up to you to ask.

453
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,304
You can go back
to the cafeteria...

454
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,144
or hang up here.

455
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,497
Duquan,
could you come here?

456
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,376
I thought maybe you could help me out--
I packed too much.

457
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,327
Take this down
to the cafeteria

458
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,427
and get yourself something to drink
from the machine.

459
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,665
Thank you.

460
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,717
Crystal,
you got a second?

461
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,852
What's up with Duquan?

462
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,323
I gave him some new clothes.
I was expecting--

463
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,451
He might have lost them.

464
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,484
That fast?

465
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,259
It weren't that.

466
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,495
His people take his clothes,
sell it on the corners.

467
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,469
- You're kidding.
- No, sir.

468
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,494
Everybody knows.

469
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,039
Which brings me to
what we're proposing--

470
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,840
different kids,
different approaches.

471
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,473
You tell us who we need to touch
at North Avenue to get the go-ahead.

472
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,244
The "Puzzle Palace"?

473
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,913
Look, if y'all still wanna jump in
and help, I'm fine with it.

474
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,979
That's about all the okay
you need in my house.

475
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,292
The Stricker Street situation is
waiting in the office.

476
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,393
Neighborhood squabbles,
and my babies bring it in here.

477
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,028
Two fights yesterday-- all because
the mothers can't get along.

478
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,833
I gotta go.

479
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,534
Mrs. Donnelly will work out
the nuts and bolts.

480
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,910
But just so you hear it,
thank you.

481
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,609
It'll be the only time anyone
in this system will think to say it.

482
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,077
He's a good man.
You need to protect him.

483
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,214
- Protect him?
- Principal Withers

484
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,884
just went out on a limb for you,

485
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,053
and in this system they know
how to handle a chainsaw.

486
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,824
Excuse me?

487
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,889
Anyone has a problem
with what we're doing,

488
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,900
it's on him.

489
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,903
So you specified
eighth-graders?

490
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:17,169
We have 256 on roll.

491
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,403
241 attend
on a regular basis.

492
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,709
Of those, 40 or so would fit your bill
of corner kids.

493
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,647
40?

494
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,478
Pretty workable.

495
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,714
Ahem.

496
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,485
- What would you suggest?
- Start with 10 or so.

497
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,151
Ms. Sampson has enough
to get you going.

498
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,957
- One of them named Namond Brice?
- Pick of the litter.

499
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,396
But you'll have to wait.
He's on a three-day suspension.

500
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,025
Tilghman Middle School.
Can I help you?

501
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,570
Remember when I was a cadet,
I was up here on a cadaver search.

502
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,375
Instructor gets
on the radio to say,

503
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,848
"We're looking for
one body in particular.

504
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,250
If you go grabbing
everyone you see,

505
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,482
we'll be here all day," he says.

506
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,820
Leakin Park...

507
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,292
where West Baltimore
brings out its dead.

508
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,125
Not anymore,
from the look of things.

509
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,324
Not by the roadside,
anyway.

510
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,398
If he's dumping them here,

511
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,301
he's dumping them
deep in the woods.

512
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,838
Come on.

513
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,710
At each raid site,
we're anticipating dope

514
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,044
or cash or guns.

515
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,448
All warrants are
for prime locations

516
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,975
Iinked to high-level
violators.

517
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,046
Weeks-old addresses linked
to low-level corner boys.

518
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,456
We'll also be sweeping drug corners
at these locations.

519
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,188
Wagons will hold
in this location here.

520
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,822
Jump-off time--
1500 hours.

521
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,197
We take our position
10 minutes before the assault here.

522
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,202
The go is on my say-so.

523
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,131
Questions? Excellent.

524
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,938
We'll hold in the rec room
till it's time to stage.

525
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,181
Warrants are one thing,

526
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,948
but street sweeps on Marlo Stanfield's
crews? Are you guys serious?

527
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,956
Carv, you give these hoodleheads
too much credit.

528
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,651
Trust me on this, Boy Wonder.

529
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,854
Never mind this horseshit.

530
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,828
So what've they got you
doing for your man?

531
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,990
Who, the lieutenant?

532
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,195
No, Royce. Herc, the mayor's
your meal ticket.

533
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,829
He gets another four years,
you're liable to wear the gold braid.

534
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,431
Shouldn't you be out
waving a campaign sign or some shit?

535
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:38,273
And so ends the last crusade
of the Major Crimes Unit--

536
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,250
with a whimper.

537
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:44,721
Lester would cry to see his wiretap
cannibalized for that crap.

538
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,919
Street sweeps
on Marlo Stanfield?

539
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,627
- So what else you got cooking?
- Narcotics cases?

540
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,862
C.I.D. has the Burman indictment
coming in. Nothing past that.

541
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,463
As wars go, this drug thing
seems to rate less and less.

542
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,034
If Demper wins and manages
to forgive my trespasses,

543
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,102
maybe I'll go in and beg
for something new.

544
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:12,412
I don't know. Just feels like
enough's enough.

545
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,653
Crutchfield, line two, lntake.

546
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,225
- Sergeant, you were looking for me?
- I was, yeah.

547
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:27,197
Curly fry?
Chicken doohickey?

548
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,665
Sit down.

549
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,865
Norris is back
on the Braddock case.

550
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,875
It's by order
of the deputy ops.

551
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,970
In fact, we're gonna go
with a story that says

552
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,073
he was never off the case,
that you and he are partnered,

553
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,812
a task force of two,
working it together.

554
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,189
Fuck you, fat man.

555
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,091
Not original, but succinct.
I like your approach.

556
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,789
Y'all humiliate me once
by dropping me into this thing,

557
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,890
and now you're gonna shame me again
by bringing Norris back.

558
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,971
This is Homicide, Detective.

559
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,813
This is not some boiler room unit
where no one pays attention

560
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,843
to whatever the fuck it is
you call police work.

561
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,685
The bosses?
They know our names up here.

562
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:29,318
Now I didn't like it
when they came to me

563
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,295
and told me to dump Norris,
but dump him I did.

564
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,298
And it's not like I wanna
carry water for them

565
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,892
now that they're pretending
they never told me to do any such thing,

566
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,368
but carry the water I will.
And in the end,

567
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,600
when everyone else in this unit
is buried and beshitted,

568
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,132
this detective sergeant
will still be standing.

569
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,138
So get the story straight:

570
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,877
Norris was always
the primary,

571
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,976
and you are now assisting
on an investigation

572
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,817
which is progressing
even as we speak.

573
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,686
Does the colonel
know about this?

574
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,619
He's in the hospital--

575
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,652
chemo didn't work.

576
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,894
Press conference is upstairs
in half an hour.

577
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,063
- So don't be late.
- Press conference?

578
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,266
Mm-hmm.

579
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,776
I ain't mean
to laugh at you none.

580
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,909
I know it sound crazy,
but I ain't joking.

581
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,852
For real, Lex a zombie.

582
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,787
I knew it way before
what Na' and them was saying.

583
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,416
Listen,

584
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,120
they had me tell Lex to go up
to the playground.

585
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,061
I told him to go up there
and see some girl.

586
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,259
He ain't never come
back down.

587
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,167
So what they gonna do to me
when they get mad at me?

588
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,694
It makes sense Chris taking them
into the vacants--

589
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,968
to change them.
And you know what else?

590
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,634
That ain't
what he doing--

591
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,736
Chris in the vacants.

592
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,542
Changing them?

593
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,310
He ain't changing them,
he killing them.

594
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,510
That's all.
They're getting killed.

595
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,542
How you know?

596
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,189
Can't tell nobody.

597
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,256
I seen it.

598
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,855
I seen them walk
a boy up into one house

599
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,525
over there on Calhoun.

600
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,557
You seen that?

601
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,901
Yeah.

602
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,462
That's just false.

603
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,667
Detective Norris has been
working in this case nonstop.

604
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,836
And given her narcotics
expertise,

605
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,402
Detective Greggs
was assigned to augment

606
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,142
rather than to replace him.

607
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,946
But for two days sources
inside the department were saying--

608
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,647
I'm inside the department,
and I'm telling you that's not true.

609
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,747
We do not play politics
with a criminal investigation.

610
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,418
And how do you explain
Councilman Gray's allegations?

611
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,156
I think you should ask
Councilman Gray that question.

612
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,436
- Police! Search warrant!
- Take the back.

613
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,203
- On the ground, now!
- Police! Search warrant!

614
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,937
Two upstairs.

615
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,542
- Don't move!
- Check that backroom.

616
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,810
I said, get your ass
on the ground.

617
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,874
- Get down!
- Get down!

618
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:21,120
- This is the 1300 block, right?
- No, this is the 12.

619
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,894
Are we on the right corner?

620
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,900
- We had this as a stash house?
- According to the wiretap.

621
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,905
How long ago?
They move them around, you know.

622
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,741
- Zeroes on the warrants.
- Minor arrests

623
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,445
- on the designated corners, sir.
- They were tipped!

624
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,510
- You think?
- For us to come up this empty

625
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,044
at all these locations,
it has to be.

626
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,353
This cocksucker Marlo thinks
he's smarter than us?

627
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,189
He is not. Sergeant, I want
to know where he hangs.

628
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,320
You mean like him personally?

629
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,388
He moves around,
Lieutenant. He floats.

630
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,662
But I have seen him
in the concrete park behind Fulton.

631
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,362
- In a park?
- If the weather's right, he sits

632
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,733
out there in some lawn chairs,
holds court.

633
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,601
He's got people covering
every approach

634
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,472
so there's no creeping up on him. My
guess is that he likes to talk outdoors

635
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,237
so no one can drop
a microphone on him.

636
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,974
Sergeant, what can
we do with that?

637
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,749
I admit I've made
some mistakes,

638
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,621
Burrell being
one of the biggest.

639
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,719
But he's got a job
for about 10 more days.

640
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,596
After the primary,
he's gone, believe me.

641
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,726
And that last stunt--
pulling a detective.

642
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,670
- What'd you expect?
- Not that-- huh-uh.

643
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,567
Hey, I had nothing to do
with that nonsense.

644
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,636
Now, that's a straight-up lie. I was
at that damn meeting when you told him,

645
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,308
- "Slow the case down."
- I didn't mean--

646
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,375
Who the hell knows
what you mean anymore, Clarence?

647
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,410
Look at this.

648
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,719
Look at it!

649
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,522
You gave me
your word on this--

650
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,619
your word, Clarence.

651
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,927
But here you are ticketed up
with Eunetta in her best precincts

652
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,434
and then ticketed up
with my girl Daniels

653
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,095
where she's
running strong.

654
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,401
Odell, this is the first
I've seen this.

655
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,136
Come on, now! This is probably
Eunetta's people pulling this shit.

656
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,576
With a "Citizens for Royce"
authority line?

657
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,309
Eh, look at you, Clarence.
Just look at you.

658
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,080
You've forgotten your agenda.
You've forgotten your base.

659
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,087
You think a shave

660
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,351
and some Marcus Garvey posters
are gonna get you over?

661
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,449
Do you think that's gonna
make up for jumping in bed

662
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,153
with every damn
developer?

663
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,324
Shit. You're even
on Clay Davis's tit.

664
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,357
Now don't you go getting
all self-righteous with me, Odell.

665
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,835
Campaign runs on dollars--
you know it.

666
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,135
Whose dollars?! Those sons of bitches
you got around your card table

667
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,302
every month feeding your kitty?
Oh, yeah,

668
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,439
I know about that too.
You-- trouble with you--

669
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,975
fuck you, Clarence. I'm gonna
sit what's left of this one out.

670
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,544
- I'm gonna sit it out.
- Sit it out.

671
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,557
- The primary?
- Sit it out!

672
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,458
Odell!
Odell!

673
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,689
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

674
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,163
Come November, I'm still gonna be
the only game in town!

675
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,793
Odell, turn your back on me now,
I won't forget!

676
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,998
We can't afford this.
We need his organization on Tuesday.

677
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,006
- Go after him!
- Fuck that

678
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,838
holier-than-thou
motherfucker!

679
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,409
Delegate Watkins.
Delegate Watkins!

680
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,177
Wait, sir.

681
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:29,277
I-I'm sure we can
work this out.

682
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,083
You and the mayor
can talk this through.

683
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,823
Deputy Rawls, please.

684
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,496
It's Lieutenant Hoskins
at the Hall.

685
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,885
You're gonna use the hole
in the wall, right?

686
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,795
Yeah, I'm gonna rub some dogshit
on the front of this thing.

687
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,822
I don't want nobody
touching it.

688
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,464
Got it?

689
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,077
You need
to raise it a bit.

690
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,785
Yeah, that's good.
Right there, that works.

691
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,464
- Thought I heard something.
- Rats.

692
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,195
- How we doing?
- We need to go.

693
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,969
He ain't nothing
but a skanky-ass bitch to begin with.

694
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,639
And besides,
he ex-police.

695
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,410
So you know what that like.

696
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,315
I'm going to the ladies' room.

697
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,786
Bey, you need to talk to him.

698
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,450
Visiting hours
end in 30 minutes.

699
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,618
- Visiting hours...
- Yo, Daddy, don't even go there,

700
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,686
with you all the time telling me
how you dropped out in the sixth grade,

701
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,561
went up on the corner
with Avon and Stringer,

702
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,930
earned cheese for the family, saying
how it made you a man--

703
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,901
All right, all right.
You right.

704
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,302
Can't throw rocks.
But I'm just saying,

705
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,806
you know how your mother be,
with all the fussing.

706
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,743
Maybe you just need to slow it up.
You know what I'm saying?

707
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,973
Yo, you heard
how Marlo punked Bodie?

708
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,414
Said he either got to work for him
or give up his corner.

709
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,917
Don't you know?
His sorry ass buckled.

710
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,011
Oh-hh, you'd have gone
about it different?

711
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,682
Yeah, I'd have
stood tall, like you.

712
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,520
Got my nine--
fuck Chris and them.

713
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,391
Listen to you,
all spit and fire.

714
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,328
You'd have gone to the mattress
all by your lonesome

715
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,888
and went up against
half of the West side.

716
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,424
You got it where it counts,
and I respect that more than anything.

717
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,996
But shit out there now ain't like
it was when we was coming up.

718
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,601
Back in the day, a punk nigger
like Marlo steps out,

719
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,010
breaking the rules and shit, he find
himself in the back of a car trunk

720
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,311
on the way to Leakin Park.
No doubt.

721
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,182
We did that shit right.
Word was your bond.

722
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,346
Man looked out for his own,
knowing he in a family.

723
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,083
Dig where
I'm coming from?

724
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,286
But today
it's all fucked up.

725
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,075
These steps.

726
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,410
- Thank you, baby.
- You're good to go.

727
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,131
Say "Omar."

728
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,699
Omar.

729
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,582
Nothing?

730
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,593
We checked both sides
of the street

731
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,686
- from here up to Monroe.
- Nothing?

732
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,663
Nothing that don't
belong in no sewer.

733
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,290
Thanks.

734
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,099
Other ideas?

735
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,803
Whoo!

736
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:27,109
Blood, bump me off that nigger
up the "skreet."

737
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,119
Motherfucker
in the "Bruick"?

738
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,018
That be him.
I be saying,

739
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,818
no motherfucker gonna
run off with my "hairon."

740
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,722
Oh, this is
fucking great.

741
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,456
Get somebody who reads lips,
this motherfucker's history.

742
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,192
Is this legal-- I mean,
intercepting what they're saying?

743
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,826
Don't go Freamon on me.

744
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,404
Shit. I got to run.

745
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,169
Hey, man, what about some
fucking relief? I been here all morning!

746
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:17,991
You heard?
They making movies.

747
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,833
Yeah. How you
wanna play it?

748
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,238
I ain't sure.
Let's see the fat man.

749
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,670
How'd the other thing
turn out?

750
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,702
All good.

751
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,852
- Yo.
- What up, boy?

752
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,979
- If you want some, I got Reeses.
- Nah, man.

753
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,717
You trying to make
some real cheese? $5?

754
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:45,023
- What you need?
- Me and Paul gonna get it on with Tiff.

755
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,394
Keep an eye out. I don't want Mrs. D
creeping up. Feel me?

756
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,332
I feel you, but I got some sixth-graders
waiting on a special order.

757
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,962
Let them wait, man.
It ain't like we gonna be all day.

758
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,966
All right.

759
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,846
No, ma'am, it says right here--
His Honor had the Bureau of Solid Waste

760
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,543
conduct a clean sweep
along Tivoly.

761
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,778
But it took six months
before they showed up.

762
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,810
Well yeah, okay,
but nobody's perfect.

763
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,414
But hey, listen. I wouldn't be
sitting here if I didn't believe

764
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,255
Clarence Royce wasn't truly committed
to this city and its people.

765
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,056
What about the crime
in our neighborhood?

766
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,722
I admit that's another
good point.

767
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:23,358
But, lady,
between you and me, I can tell

768
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,267
from your voice you're black and
you can tell from my voice I'm white.

769
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,271
So I gotta ask you,

770
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,001
when do you think the last time
a white man voted for a black man

771
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,032
when there was another
white man in the race?

772
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,976
I don't know, but you must
really believe in him.

773
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,448
Well, ain't that what I been saying?
He's just the best candidate.

774
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,110
- So you'll go with my man?
- I'll think about it.

775
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,085
All right, that's great.
Thank you for your time.

776
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,350
- Goodbye.
- All right.

777
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,032
- I have a hall pass.
- Yeah, good for you.

778
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,239
- Mine's down.
- Attaboy.

779
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:50,076
You need bodies, Lester?
Here you go.

780
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,692
We got a warrant and a teletype
for my boy Lex.

781
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:00,060
So dead or alive, he's on file.

782
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,156
And beyond that,
it's time for you to shine

783
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,429
that mighty intellect of yours

784
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,992
on some real murders, hmm?

785
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,937
Give up the hypotheticals
and shit.

786
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,372
Yeah, I suppose.

787
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,540
This is my issue-- crime,

788
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,672
and I understand completely
what you're saying.

789
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,581
And if you give me the opportunity,
I will be able to do something to--

790
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,381
to help you out and, you know,
other people in this neighborhood.

791
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,051
Mr. Ricks,
thank you for your time

792
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,685
- and for your attention.
- No problem.

793
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,196
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

794
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:37,325
Pretty brazen, shaking hands
with the enemy in broad daylight.

795
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:41,394
- Werner's Deli this isn't.
- Definitely not.

796
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,963
Though here you are, Councilman,
leaving no door unopened.

797
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,838
Shoe leather--
our secret weapon.

798
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,242
You surprised me.
You've made this a horse race.

799
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:51,839
So uh, what makes me think you didn't
just happen by and find us here?

800
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,946
Watkins is breaking
with the mayor.

801
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,285
How do you know?

802
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,258
I know. I've carried the mayor's water
because I had to, Councilman.

803
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,761
I'd love to see some new blood
in this city.

804
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,196
And I'd love the chance
to do the right thing

805
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,563
for this police department
for a change.

806
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,677
Wait until he turns
the corner.

807
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,192
District office for Watkins--

808
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,854
Gilmore Street.

809
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,863
And fuck
them red lights, man.

810
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,334
Not a place you expect
to find any gangsters--

811
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,673
police, for that matter.

812
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:58,613
- Heard you knew something I didn't.
- Told you before--

813
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,412
I make it my business
to keep an ear to the ground.

814
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,612
I make it my business
to do business.

815
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,985
We doing business,
or are we just talking?

816
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,683
And if it's talk,
I'ma walk.

817
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,124
I heard the people pulling
security at the card game

818
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,651
weren't too keen
on their wages.

819
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,664
I figured it was
only a matter of time

820
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,565
before they found a way
to get their due compensation.

821
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,501
And you didn't think
to tell me?

822
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,334
A man learns best
when he get burned.

823
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,535
How do I know you ain't
making this shit up?

824
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,635
You don't.
Things happen on the street.

825
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,545
Proof is hard to come by.

826
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,682
Go ahead, open it.

827
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,691
Off the street,

828
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,456
there's all kind of proof.

829
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,521
They planning on executing
those Friday--

830
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,533
time it with the election,
I guess,

831
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,434
show they doing their job,
cleaning up the city,

832
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,631
taking down a kingpin.

833
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,106
- How did you come by this?
- Told you before--

834
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,439
I keep my ear
to the ground.

835
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,945
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Maybe nothing.

836
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,777
Charlie's not part
of the co-op.

837
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,384
Or maybe
I tip him for a fee.

838
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:13,321
What do you think a man
with a whole lot of money

839
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,655
would pay
for his freedom?

840
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,787
You know, lately

841
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,526
I come to find out someone trying
to take pictures of me.

842
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,398
Pictures?

843
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,198
Video.

844
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,866
You heard anything about me
through your travels?

845
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,034
Had no incentive to listen.

846
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,977
You do now.

847
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,961
It's one thing
to sit out the primary.

848
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,727
It's another

849
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,996
for me to turn
on Clarence Royce.

850
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,629
- Granted.
- And if I did jump,

851
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,435
why not land
behind Tony Gray?

852
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,738
At least he's from
my side of the tracks.

853
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,939
Tony can't win. I can.

854
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,208
Look, the truth is,

855
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,310
whatever I can do for you,
the mayor can match or double.

856
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,583
I have a pretty good
grass-roots organization,

857
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,613
but nothing even close
to his kind of money.

858
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,217
Now, I'll ticket up
with anyone you want me to.

859
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,525
I know you want Daniels in the 11th
and Stokes in the 10th.

860
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,259
I'll keep away from any tickets
you think I might harm.

861
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,462
I know I'm not everyone's idea
of a bargain on your side of town.

862
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,800
- Hmm.
- But right now,

863
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,829
a week from the primary,

864
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:40,468
the fact is,
Royce and I both need you.

865
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,810
After the election, the equation changes
for him but not for me.

866
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,874
I'm a white mayor
in a majority-black city,

867
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,885
and if I'm gonna
do anything--

868
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,444
and, Delegate, I am so serious
about fixing this city--

869
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,480
I'm gonna have to govern
by consensus.

870
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,322
And if you support me, you will have
a voice within my administration

871
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,920
simply because
I'm gonna need it.

872
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,434
Last poll that
Clarence showed me,

873
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,129
he was up
by seven points.

874
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,601
Bullshit.
I'm within four.

875
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,214
- You won't be needing that.
- I know.

876
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,948
- Here?
- Yeah, here.

877
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,390
Dag.

878
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,395
Yo, turn it off-- the bulb
might have got too hot.

879
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,090
Or the battery's dying.

880
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,223
We should go back.

881
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,965
- Yo, man, it stinks, man.
- Ain't like it was.

882
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,721
See he ain't move.

883
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,827
Yeah.

884
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,264
Blood still stuck to his hair.

885
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:47,793
- He dead?
- He dead.

886
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,032
Lex too?

887
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,770
He dead. They all is.
Feel better?

888
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,475
Donut wrong, yo.

889
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,277
Ain't no special dead.

890
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,852
There's just dead.
