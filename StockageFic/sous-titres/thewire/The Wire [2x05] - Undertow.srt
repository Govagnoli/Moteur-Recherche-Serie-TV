1
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,537
My man.

2
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:50,746
Ain't but $290 here.

3
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:55,449
Goddamn it, Frog,
when you work a g-pack for a guy...

4
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,349
a kickback's supposed to be $500.

5
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:58,853
Stash got hit, yo.

6
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:01,789
I ain't hearing that shit!
I want my fucking money!

7
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,853
You'd best know
I ain't playing, motherfucker.

8
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,131
Okay, that's how you want it? Fine!

9
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:16,303
But when I roll back past here tomorrow,
money gonna be right, or you gonna see.

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,904
You gonna see who you're fucking with!

11
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,344
Do I look like a fucking punk?

12
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,239
Yo, shorty.

13
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:30,548
Get me a Snapple
and a bag of crab chips from the corner.

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,192
What the fuck is your problem, asshole?

15
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,292
Fuck, this is bad shit!

16
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,494
Fuck, this is really bad.

17
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:49,530
Shit.

18
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:51,969
Get your ass out that car.

19
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,070
All right!

20
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:56,279
Shut up.

21
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:02,074
Where the money at? Check his socks.

22
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:04,880
You got something for me here, Zig?

23
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,287
You got some dough for me, man?

24
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,955
Jesus, jackpot.

25
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,322
Man, hold up, man.

26
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,490
Ain't enough here to really
call this shit money, man.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,161
Cheese, take it easy, I'm working on it.
But my people, you know....

28
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,500
What the fuck you think this is, man?

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,203
What, you think this supposed
to get played some other way?

30
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,574
Is that what you think, man?

31
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:36,215
Damn it, son of a bitch, that hurt.

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,584
Yeah, I know it did.

33
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,021
All right, look, how about the coat?

34
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,717
Take the coat, all right?

35
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,661
I paid two large for it...

36
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,700
so that, plus the cash I gave you...

37
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:54,168
and then I can get $700 more
by the end of the week.

38
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,931
You know I will!

39
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,406
You know right there, you can fix that.

40
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:01,808
$2,000?

41
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:03,580
For this?

42
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,907
Not even a black man could style that shit.

43
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,918
You know what I'm saying, man?

44
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,251
What you laughing at, man?

45
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,060
Chill, be cool about it.
I'll get your money by Friday.

46
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,928
Then you'll see there's no need
to get all fucking dramatic out here!

47
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:26,402
Look, man, if I ain't paid by Friday,
you dead by Saturday, man.

48
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:29,064
Yo, take my man's ride.

49
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,239
Fuck, I need that! I fucking need that!

50
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,191
Fuck you!

51
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,056
Why me?

52
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,132
You don't want the posting,
I'll take someone else.

53
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,242
Valchek gave me the pick of his district.

54
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,979
I'm not saying I don't want it.

55
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:54,914
I'm asking why you would choose me
after what happened last go around.

56
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,420
Yeah, I thought about that, too.

57
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,119
Looking at the list of names
on the southeastern roster...

58
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,818
I'm saying to myself:

59
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,791
"Why take a man
who already burned you once...

60
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:11,129
"who already proved himself disloyal?"

61
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,730
Now, why would I do that?

62
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,501
I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.

63
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:25,343
Because if I caught him once...

64
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,647
he might be the last
son of a bitch to try it twice.

65
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,283
I'm guessing you got enough
shame from the last time...

66
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,290
so that it won't happen again.

67
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:36,991
No, sir, it won't.

68
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,322
One other thing...

69
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,929
as far as I'm concerned,
those stripes on your sleeve aren't earned.

70
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:48,334
Your paycheck may say "sergeant,"
but on this detail...

71
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:50,406
Det. Greggs runs your team.

72
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,778
Same as it ever was.

73
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,698
Well?

74
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:29,879
I'm in.

75
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,371
Come here, you sweet bitch.

76
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:33,449
Motherfu--

77
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:37,752
Don't be grabbing my dick, faggot.

78
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:43,823
I raised him on the radio.
He's on his way in right now.

79
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:46,427
Appreciate that, Officer. Nice day.

80
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,027
Summit Silver 450.

81
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,765
Top of the line, right here.

82
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:58,466
Over there?

83
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:10,946
Yo, Bubs.

84
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,780
McNulty, the sailor man? Watch the front.

85
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:20,922
Here. Stick that on that thing there,
will you?

86
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:24,158
The cleat? Ain't you know nothing?

87
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,965
Look at you, I don't know,
maybe it's just me...

88
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,706
but something's way the fuck
wrong with this picture.

89
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,636
What the hell is that?

90
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:38,845
A Baltimore knot.

91
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,685
What the hell is a Baltimore knot?

92
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:45,584
I don't know, but it's never
the same thing twice.

93
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,785
What can I tell you?
My detecting days are over.

94
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,025
What the fuck you have me
hunt up Omar then for?

95
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,058
That's old business. You remember Bird?

96
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:58,396
His trial's up next week.
Omar's got some witnessing to do.

97
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,997
He said you can reach him
here at this number.

98
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,663
You can leave a message.

99
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,475
Good work, Bubs.

100
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,011
As always. Here.

101
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,508
Cab fare.

102
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:25,550
You say tit-for-tat,
and we let slide on a little county caper.

103
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:29,022
I got to think that, you know,
you need to think about...

104
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:31,566
what you had me
endeavoring to accomplish.

105
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,130
I mean, what the fuck, man?

106
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,967
I'm not out there asking about
no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.

107
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:40,866
No, sir. I'm making inquiries in your behalf...

108
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:45,209
in regards to that fucking unforgiving,
motherfucking Omar, man.

109
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,674
Why? He play you hard?

110
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:50,910
I go at him respectable...

111
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,512
he put that goddamn
shotgun in my face, man.

112
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm looking at two tubes
of the harbor tunnel...

113
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,384
staring right at me, each one about yea-big.

114
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:00,854
I damn near pissed in my pants...

115
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:03,091
and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.

116
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,462
It ain't funny.

117
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,501
McNulty, I know I'm paying
taxes on some things...

118
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,366
I got to believe this
is more aggregation than:

119
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,965
"Good work, bubs," and a little bit of this.

120
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,141
For your pains.

121
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,781
Where are we at with the Jane Does?

122
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:23,614
Taking a hard look at the port,
we're gonna drop a grand jury summons...

123
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,655
on every stevedore who worked the ship,
keep rattling cages.

124
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,418
How's the port police broad
working out for us?

125
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,058
She knows the docks okay.

126
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,685
No detective, though.

127
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:36,832
In that case, you need someone fresh.
Cole, maybe, Massy or whoever's up.

128
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,462
You need to get over
to the southeastern today.

129
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,366
You're detailed temporarily.

130
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:46,840
Colonel, respectfully,
did you just fuck me over...

131
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:50,037
without giving me even half
a chance to clear this case?

132
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:55,306
Let's be clear, Det. Freamon.
When I fuck you over, you'll know it.

133
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:59,047
You'll be so goddamn certain,
you won't need to ask the question.

134
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,387
And you, Det. Moreland,
are now all alone with 14 red names.

135
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,258
How's it feel?

136
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:16,036
And the parking pad in the rear
is invaluable for Federal Hill.

137
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,732
The deck has a harbor view?

138
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:19,433
Yes, in two directions.

139
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,205
Go on up, take a look. I think you'll love it.

140
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:26,982
-This ain't Federal Hill.
-Excuse me?

141
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,880
This is the Point, Locust Point.

142
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:33,684
As far as real estate goes,
anything that is below Montgomery Street...

143
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,452
and above the water
is now called Federal Hill.

144
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,122
Are you two house hunting?

145
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,422
We just started.

146
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,124
If you're interested in this area,
I could run some listings for you.

147
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,793
-This particular house--
-Is my aunt Treesey's.

148
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:49,804
Really, your aunt?
ls she a relation to the McDonalds?

149
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,501
Nope. She's a relation to me.

150
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:57,743
She died, like, four years ago.
The family sold the house right after.

151
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:00,673
Is that the price?

152
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,718
That's the listing, yes.

153
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,689
They ain't gonna get that much, right?

154
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:14,662
I can't say for certain, but one just like it...

155
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:17,289
in the 1 200 block
sold for $340,000 last week.

156
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,392
$340,000?

157
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,564
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

158
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,038
Maybe we should rent.

159
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,951
We're here because Valchek wants us here...

160
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:49,225
because he believes this man
and his down-at-the-heels union local...

161
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:50,560
has too much money.

162
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,397
To start with, you and Freamon
are gonna put some DNRs...

163
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,970
on the union hall phones.

164
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:58,370
Also, run what you can on the
union finances and on Sobotka personally.

165
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,638
We put that together, copy it to the major
to show him we're on it...

166
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,542
and buy ourselves a little time.

167
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,911
Meanwhile, you three, do what you do best.

168
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:08,644
Find out where port folks like to cop
on a Friday night...

169
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,947
set up some hand-to-hands,
maybe a reverse or two.

170
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:13,147
A lot of these port guys are white,
aren't they?

171
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,656
I mean, some of the southeast
street dealers, too.

172
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,727
So that means
you're gonna need a white boy...

173
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,728
to go down to some of these
southeastern corners, right?

174
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,789
So Kima, Carv on the rooftops.
It's my time to front.

175
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:27,395
I'll show you how it's done, homes.

176
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:30,468
Cool Lester smooth.

177
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,006
What's happening?

178
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,702
Same fuck-ups in the same shit detail...

179
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,680
working out of the same
shithouse kind of office.

180
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,251
You people lack for personal growth,
you know that?

181
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:45,583
It's a temporary posting.
Rawls gets you back at the end of the run.

182
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:48,453
If he wants me.
Last I looked, I was high on his shit list.

183
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:51,391
-Then we did you a favor.
-I wouldn't go that far.

184
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:53,391
But fuck it. Who we chasing?

185
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,164
Frank Sobotka?

186
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:01,300
-How fucking good is he?
-You know the man?

187
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,872
Me and Bunk Moreland
were fucking with this guy last week...

188
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,066
working that case about
dead girls in the container.

189
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,165
He a suspect?

190
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:10,371
No, just someone who know what's
getting done on the port terminals.

191
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
-Why are you on him?
-My father-in-law hates his guts.

192
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,280
Which, in the southeastern,
goes for probable cause.

193
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,546
Valchek thinks he has too much cash.

194
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:19,949
So you're thinking drugs?

195
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,386
In this fucking town,
what other crime is there?

196
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:28,088
You know I would've been
down here sooner, it's just...

197
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,325
with Terrell being sick and all....

198
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:35,065
But, Dee, I got everything we need paid for.

199
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,872
When you come home, Stringer's
saying they gonna hook you up...

200
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,875
with something out of the mix.

201
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:44,504
Like running a club,
or straight business, like.

202
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,875
String say they gonna
keep you apart from it...

203
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:50,111
and give back some time for family.

204
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,817
For you and me and Terrell.

205
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,748
Family?

206
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,816
They thinking about
how they can do for you.

207
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,258
They making all these plans...

208
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,161
even though you been
playing cold with your uncle.

209
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,737
Stringer says so, anyhow.

210
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:10,930
Why you be like that?

211
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:14,072
Throwing them off
when they looking to do for you?

212
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,504
They playing you with that
"We're family, and it's all about love."

213
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:18,774
That's how they do.

214
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,783
When they got no more use for you,
that family shit disappears.

215
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,978
It's just about business, Donette.

216
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:28,020
Dee, they gonna be there for us.

217
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,327
What's up, man? You got that Death Grip.

218
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:37,797
-You know Stony got that check.
-Slow down, fool.

219
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,835
I'm saying you need to spend that shit here.

220
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:42,905
-Death Grip be the fucking bomb, yo.
-I ain't got no ends.

221
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,371
Motherfucker said it ain't shit.

222
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,135
No, I ain't say that.

223
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,545
That's enough, yo, let that shit be.

224
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:58,243
-Fuck you all.
-Yeah, motherfucker?

225
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:11,056
Yo, B.

226
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,468
Shit jumping off in the Pit, yo.

227
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,332
Damn.

228
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,346
What the fuck was that?

229
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,323
Fiend badmouthing our shit,
saying Death Grip ain't all that.

230
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:38,656
Now we're beating niggers
over speaking the truth?

231
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,527
I ain't hit him, the young'uns, yo.
You can't tell these fools nothing.

232
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,300
We stomping niggers over bullshit, man.

233
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:52,507
Somebody got to pull Stringer up on this.

234
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,055
Zig, what's up?

235
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:14,258
Jesus, Zig, what the fuck happened?

236
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:17,132
Fucking niggers got me.

237
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,234
What?

238
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,803
Took my money, and they got Princess, too.

239
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,198
You hear me? They got my fucking car.

240
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,138
If I had a gun, I swear to God...

241
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,710
I would've capped every one
of those motherfuckers.

242
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,836
-You call the cops?
-Can't.

243
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:32,772
It was over some dope.

244
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,910
You bought a fucking package, didn't you?

245
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,880
Serves you right, you stupid fuck.

246
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,959
From who? White Mike?

247
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,694
This nigger Cheese,
up on Wolfe and Ashland.

248
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,496
-A few ounces, you know?
-Why not White Mike?

249
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,236
Fuck Mike, you know how he be.

250
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,098
Why the fuck would I know how he be?

251
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:05,974
Nicky, it ain't my fault, all right? It ain't.

252
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:10,650
Look, business has been slow,
package ain't turned around yet.

253
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:14,120
But the fucking hoodleheads ain't hearing it,
so I get jumped.

254
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,226
They got Princess, man.
They're holding her for fucking ransom.

255
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:19,761
And now they're telling me...

256
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:23,059
if I don't have the money by Friday,
they're going to kill me.

257
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,495
I need $2,700.

258
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,539
So?

259
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,971
You're a drug dealer,
go sell some fucking drugs.

260
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,706
You fucked up the package, didn't you, Zig?

261
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:50,489
I ain't giving you the money.

262
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,054
They're gonna kill me.

263
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:58,163
I gave my money to Aimee for an apartment.

264
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:02,163
Security deposit and some
furniture over at Littlepages.

265
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,604
I ain't got it for you, Zig.

266
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:20,780
You cocksuckers.

267
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,358
-Major in?
-Yeah, just knock.

268
00:19:58,494 --> 00:19:59,552
Yeah?

269
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,356
We're about to make some
hand-to-hands around the port.

270
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:07,630
Lt. Daniels said I should see you about
a surveillance van.

271
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,704
The van?
The van's on loan to the southwest.

272
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,601
Okay.

273
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:23,714
Fuck with my ass, will you?

274
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,616
Bringing us back to our old friends,
supply and demand.

275
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,159
All right, your research papers are here.

276
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,394
Remember Friday, take-home test.

277
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,626
Well done, Mr. Bell.

278
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,664
-Mr. Lucas, you got five minutes?
-Absolutely.

279
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:49,301
There's something
maybe you can help me out with.

280
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:50,401
I'll try.

281
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:56,741
What are the options
when you got an inferior product...

282
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,844
in an aggressive marketplace?

283
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:03,223
If you have a large share of the market,
you can buy up the competition.

284
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:04,657
And if you don't?

285
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,625
Reduce price to increase market share.

286
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,322
That assumes low overhead.

287
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,923
Of course, otherwise,
you operate at a loss...

288
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,798
and worse, as your prices drop...

289
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:18,264
your product eventually
loses consumer credibility.

290
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:23,144
You know, the new CEO of WorldCom
was faced with this very problem.

291
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:27,512
The company was linked
to one of the largest fraud cases in history.

292
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:30,308
-So he proposed--
-To change the name?

293
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:31,876
Exactly.

294
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,497
Which one?

295
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,428
He's got a weenie in his hand.

296
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,700
On this case, ain't that you?

297
00:21:56,846 --> 00:22:00,145
Thomas Pakusa, come on down.

298
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:02,677
What the fuck is that?

299
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,218
Grand jury summons.

300
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:05,714
Grand jury?

301
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:07,550
You lie to us, you hurt our feelings.

302
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,852
You lie to them, it's perjury.

303
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,558
And one more I just dropped
on your barbecue chef outside.

304
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:21,697
You used to be a lot more fun,
you know that, Bea?

305
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:24,538
That's John Spamanato right there.

306
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,343
Johnny Fifty. How you doing, Officer?

307
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:30,239
Johnny Fifty?

308
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:33,739
What the fuck is that?

309
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:37,147
Son of a bitch drinks 53 beers
on his 25th birthday.

310
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:41,516
So as to be, what do you call it,
poetical, we rounded it off.

311
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,225
"Grand jury for the circuit
court of Baltimore City."

312
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,592
You worked the Atlantic Light, right?

313
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:50,761
Everybody on that ship testifies.

314
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:51,992
About what?

315
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:53,931
About them girls in the can.

316
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:58,065
The detective here thinks
we know something about that mess.

317
00:22:58,174 --> 00:23:00,199
He thinks we'd leave them there
on the dock...

318
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,971
in a box, dying there in the dark because....

319
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,709
Because why, Detective?

320
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,646
What reason would we have
to want girls to die like that?

321
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:16,821
Why would any of us leave them in there
if we knew anything about it?

322
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,120
I got a wife and three sisters.

323
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,122
And they got daughters.

324
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,830
And I got too much respect for women
not to be pissed off...

325
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:28,426
at what's in your heads right now.

326
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,836
Of all the cans on the terminal,
that's the one you lose in the stacks.

327
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:33,704
We didn't know shit, goddamn it!

328
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,505
You want us to dance
with a grand jury, we will!

329
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,546
What do you say, Johnny?
What do you say to any question?

330
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:40,946
I take the fifth commandment.

331
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,349
And if they offer you immunity
to testify against your union brothers?

332
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,387
-I don't remember.
-Don't remember what?

333
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,513
Nothing.

334
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:52,018
What you're forgetting
is that every I.B.S. Iocal on the East Coast...

335
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:55,529
has had its ass in front of a federal
grand jury two or three times already.

336
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:57,826
You want to throw your summonses?
Throw them.

337
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:01,061
You want to subpoena our records?
You don't need a subpoena no more.

338
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,968
Our books were open
to the Justice Department for eight years.

339
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:06,507
We're here through
Bobby Kennedy, Tricky Dick Nixon...

340
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,340
Ronnie "The Union Buster" Reagan,
and half a dozen other sons of bitches.

341
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:13,381
We'll be here
through your weak bullshit, no problem!

342
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,526
These four ain't working today.

343
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,562
You wanna leave the papers here...

344
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:30,598
I'll make sure they get them
and go downtown on them.

345
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,163
Come on.

346
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:36,332
-Today?
-Now!

347
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,048
You described the weapon
used to kill Mr. Gant...

348
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,089
as a .380 semi-automatic.

349
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:58,758
You provided the size,
and even suggested the manufacturer:

350
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:02,189
"Australian, or one of those 'A' countries."

351
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,026
Is that correct?

352
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,293
Indeed.

353
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:08,836
And you were approximately
50 feet from the shooter?

354
00:25:08,938 --> 00:25:11,406
Yes, ma'am, you know, give or take.

355
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:15,274
Mr. Little, at that distance
how were you able to determine...

356
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:16,675
who manufactured the weapon?

357
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,207
I wasn't.

358
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:21,281
Then how were you able
to relate that information...

359
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:22,749
to the detectives?

360
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,409
Bird showed it to me.

361
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:28,012
He showed you the weapon
before the murder?

362
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:33,989
Which murder we talking?

363
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:37,061
Bird committed more than one murder?

364
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,802
Fish got to swim,
you know what I'm saying?

365
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:44,131
Like I said before, Bird was
showing that thing to everybody...

366
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,504
talking about this deed and the next.

367
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:50,368
I didn't pay him no mind until you all came
and showed him some interest.

368
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:55,108
Mr. Little,
if you wouldn't mind waiting outside...

369
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:57,777
I'd like a few words with Officer McNulty.

370
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:10,131
I thought he did good.

371
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:12,393
Imagine the mileage
Maury Levy gets out of me...

372
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,662
putting that sociopath on the stand.

373
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:16,931
You got to admit, it'll be different.

374
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,472
Dress him up at least.

375
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:21,270
I can't have him on the stand
looking like that.

376
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:25,303
Here's a voucher for court clothes.

377
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,445
Anything with a tie.

378
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,095
I'm saying, Dirt...

379
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,727
you wanna be my nigger,
you got to be with me for real.

380
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,772
You see what I'm saying, yo?

381
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:52,306
Well, I'll be.

382
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,205
All the time I be telling you, be on post.

383
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:58,610
But damn, homes,
you all the time up in some damn crib...

384
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:01,080
trying to play house with them bitches.

385
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:04,277
I'm saying, you all be seriously
fucked up because I'm out here...

386
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,752
getting done what needs done.
Feel me, nigga?

387
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:10,055
Thieving motherfuckers
take everything, don't they?

388
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,649
You know what I'm saying, Dirt.

389
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,092
You wanna be my nigger,
you gots to deliver for real.

390
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,038
How'd we do, Charlie?

391
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:27,199
I've almost got one of them ready to swear
that the docks are actually near the water.

392
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:30,308
They don't scare, them guys.

393
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:33,109
What now?

394
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:38,485
You telling me you never had
a CI down there, right?

395
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:40,181
A Cl?

396
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:43,086
An informant.

397
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:46,593
You ain't got no informants on the dock?

398
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:50,821
Someone you could go to on this?
Someone you got a history with?

399
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:58,502
They say a police is only
as good as his informants.

400
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,376
Meaning, we ain't about much.

401
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,882
The voucher says $150.

402
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:14,050
Look on the clearance rack.

403
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,185
-It's a look.
-No, it ain't.

404
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:26,593
You figure it out for yourself. I'm going
across the street to the federal building.

405
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,499
I'll see you in about a half-hour.

406
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,065
Look, man, if I ain't here, I'm round
the way on Howard Street, Liddell's.

407
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,442
Either that, or I'll be with Muffy at the club.

408
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,487
Where's he at?

409
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:51,516
Said he had to go get his props.

410
00:28:59,602 --> 00:29:00,591
1 2-08.

411
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:02,025
12-08.

412
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,363
Request lateral with 1 2-10.

413
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,835
KGA, he can meet me on 6.

414
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,204
Do you copy, 12-08?

415
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,005
10-4, on 6.

416
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,505
Yo, dickhead, where you been at?

417
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,279
When you're working deep cover, Carv,
you got to get into the part.

418
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:32,158
What's up? You need a little help?

419
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:34,829
Maybe, bro. You got any raw up in here?

420
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,299
-You got it to spend?
-For sure.

421
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,609
All right, then we good.
Go and holler at my niggers round back.

422
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,112
Yo, Carv. You copy this?
It's all in the props, baby.

423
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:50,879
All in the props.

424
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,870
Feel any different? Me neither.

425
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:18,144
-Special Agent Cleary.
-Jim McNulty, from the city.

426
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,771
How can I help you?

427
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:21,747
Found floating off the Key Bridge.

428
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,445
We think she's linked to the dead girls
found in the container at Patapsco.

429
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:28,352
Your people were just here,
asking for a trace on the can.

430
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:31,915
-Homicide fellows.
-Black guys, Moreland, Freamon?

431
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:34,894
-Yeah, you working with them?
-Sort of, I fished her out.

432
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:37,693
I kind of feel like it's on me
to find her people.

433
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,697
You're kidding, right?

434
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,602
No, I thought maybe
if you guys have, you know...

435
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,606
been pulling in any women who've
been over here on the circuit.

436
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,869
Step into my world, Virginia.

437
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:54,681
A grand jury?

438
00:30:56,385 --> 00:30:59,582
They snatched up some of our guys,
drove them downtown.

439
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:01,383
But you know nothing.

440
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,321
Yeah, no shit, we know nothing.

441
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:06,986
The only guy they got that even knows
you had a can that day was Horse...

442
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:09,496
and he ain't gonna say shit to nobody.

443
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:14,262
You sure?

444
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,134
Horse is a rock.

445
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:19,340
Don't ever worry about him.
My uncle neither.

446
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,012
But you say he wants to stop.

447
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,543
Yeah, for a little while.

448
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,183
He wants you to stop moving
cans through our docks...

449
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:32,276
at least until this shit chills.

450
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,622
These were local police, right?

451
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,757
Yeah.

452
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:37,715
Their interest is in the girls.

453
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:40,260
That happened on the ship,
the ship is gone.

454
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:41,556
A dead end.

455
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:44,890
The malaka they want,
we already got to in Philly.

456
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,660
Another dead end.

457
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,634
The police are going nowhere.

458
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:55,006
But, more important,
we address Frank's concerns.

459
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,904
You tell your uncle I will meet with him.

460
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:01,380
He says he wants to meet with the Greek.

461
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:05,749
Anything he can say to the Greek,
he can say to me.

462
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,923
Says he wants the Greek.

463
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:11,417
Says you tell him when and where.

464
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,918
Niko.

465
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:19,595
About that other business, the chemicals....

466
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,866
What do you need them for?

467
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:27,931
It's just business.
Everything is just business with us.

468
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,977
Buy for a nickel, you sell for a dime.

469
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:32,781
Yeah?

470
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:36,951
Who wants a dime's worth
of fucking chemicals?

471
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,884
So these are undocumenteds
from just this field office?

472
00:32:43,992 --> 00:32:45,391
Maryland and Delaware only.

473
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:47,519
Any of them still in your custody?

474
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:50,189
I'd love the chance to show
some photos, maybe get lucky.

475
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:51,891
Everyone in that book was deported.

476
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,161
You can guess,
some of them are already back.

477
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:56,533
Any field office have anything active?

478
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:58,602
That's what I'm looking at right here.

479
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:02,143
You got some girls in custody
in San Diego, also Seattle.

480
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:03,643
Anything I can drive to?

481
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:06,475
Closest is a case up in Jersey,
Hudson County.

482
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:09,983
Raid on a couple clubs up there
put 1 2 in their bullpen four days ago.

483
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:11,245
That'll work.

484
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:16,222
So you really gonna go up there
on your own time?

485
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,792
I'll take a day, yeah.

486
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:19,952
What's between you and this girl?

487
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,662
You seen what happens down
at the morgue, when they can't ID a body?

488
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,890
I have.

489
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:37,906
Mau. How you been?

490
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:41,544
-Same old.
-Yeah?

491
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,014
You getting some days?

492
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,579
Pretty much.

493
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:48,617
I'm in the tower now, working the lanes.

494
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,291
You want to come in?

495
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:57,191
I got, I don't know, some beers,
maybe some Bacardi around.

496
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,933
Maybe we could just go
for a cup of coffee and talk, you know?

497
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,136
Let me get my jacket.

498
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,413
So I tell him,
"Dee, why you acting like that?"

499
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,888
He just sit there
like I didn't say a damn thing.

500
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,453
He off the damn hook.

501
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,491
You tell him about the plans, right?

502
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:32,665
I told him you all was gonna
set him up and everything.

503
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,760
And he know how you all been
doing for me while he away.

504
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,206
He knows some.

505
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:43,700
I mean, damn, he don't need
to know about it all, right?

506
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:52,280
Anyway, I'm saying I'll
get down there next weekend...

507
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:55,716
and he look at me like I ain't saying shit.

508
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:57,985
He say just leave him alone.

509
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:04,791
Got to turn that roast.
You gonna see, String, for real.

510
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,198
Little Donette know how to burn.

511
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,537
Your father bucking us, little man.

512
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,474
What you think about that?

513
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,508
Yeah. I think you're right.

514
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:30,791
What you looking at?

515
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:35,958
Fucking Ziggy, man.

516
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,464
I'm about to get my ass
shot behind his bullshit?

517
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,467
We're reasonable, they're reasonable.

518
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:42,833
Fuck that, maybe on your side of town.

519
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,836
What's up?

520
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:51,879
Came to see a man about a car.

521
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,751
Maybe tell Cheese we're here.

522
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:02,179
Yo, Cheese. White boy.

523
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,227
Yo, you got my money, man?

524
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,223
That's what we came to talk about.

525
00:36:10,665 --> 00:36:12,360
Yo, you got to a lot of heart...

526
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,594
coming up in here
without my fucking money.

527
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:17,001
We thought maybe
we can work something out...

528
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,732
so you can get what's yours.

529
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,364
How you plan to do that?

530
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:23,137
You give the car back,
I'll get him to sell it off.

531
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:26,578
Camaro with a 350 in it,
it's got to be worth more than $3,000.

532
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:30,082
That's right clever. Right clever, I got to say.

533
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,247
And I appreciate you all
coming all this way so much...

534
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,620
I'll give the boy another week to pay.

535
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,590
Of course, that ride ain't
worth nothing near $3,000.

536
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,391
You don't believe me?

537
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:49,635
Have a look.

538
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:18,388
You show up at my door,
I'm thinking better thoughts than this.

539
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:23,104
And you counted on that?

540
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:24,763
Who else am I gonna ask?

541
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,568
I ain't no snitch, Beadie.

542
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:29,010
Not even for you am I a snitch.

543
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,645
I'm not thinking about it like that.

544
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:36,742
I'm thinking, here's a guy,
and we had some times together...

545
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:40,413
and even though, you know, it didn't
get to where he might have wanted it...

546
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:41,819
he's still a good guy...

547
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:43,982
someone I can talk to about this.

548
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:49,257
How come it didn't go nowhere?

549
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,302
You did good. Who knows?

550
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:58,829
I don't know, you never know.

551
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:06,937
I could show you pictures of how they died.
Broken fingernails, blood on the walls.

552
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:08,948
All of a sudden, you're a cop.

553
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:12,417
Help me with this, Mau.

554
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:18,115
You didn't get shit from grabbing up
Horseface and them, did you?

555
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,295
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

556
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:26,458
I mean, you running around
like your head's all chopped off...

557
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:28,695
Iooking for someone to clue you in...

558
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:32,335
when a lot of what you're asking about...

559
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,906
is right there for the taking.

560
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,170
How so?

561
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:41,777
Used to be us checkers did
everything with paper and a pencil, right?

562
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:45,410
Every move on a ship, we wrote it down.

563
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:49,451
When that ship sails,
and there ain't no problems...

564
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:51,651
then that paper gets tossed.

565
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,759
That don't happen today, right?

566
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:58,132
Nothing gets tossed anymore.

567
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,803
The computer.

568
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,841
Thanks, Mau.

569
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:34,359
Well?

570
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,104
Good news and bad, Zig.

571
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:41,337
Those fucking niggers.

572
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:43,239
Give me the bad.

573
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:47,406
They're still gonna kill you.
They're gonna wait a week.

574
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:51,809
What the fuck can be good?

575
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:56,355
You can cancel your car insurance.

576
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:10,564
Let me get two red tops.

577
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:16,433
There we go.

578
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,975
I hope you guys are taking notes.

579
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:52,605
Shit.

580
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:06,992
One-and-one.

581
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:20,271
One more time with that toothpick,
I'm going to stab his eye with it.

582
00:41:35,223 --> 00:41:38,659
Ashamed he should be to be Greek
and call this a diner.

583
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:45,559
A talk would ease his mind.

584
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:47,731
Ease my mind first.

585
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:51,130
This business with the grand jury.

586
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:54,573
We checked the courthouse.
There is nothing special.

587
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,843
Just the regular panels.

588
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,504
They're trying to scare
the men on the docks.

589
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:01,907
-And?
-Nobody talks.

590
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:05,782
But Sobotka, as I said, he's upset.

591
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:09,419
It is more attention than he expected.

592
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:12,054
He will need money for his lawyers.

593
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:16,529
Double his fee.
But I don't need to meet with him.

594
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:18,999
Let the money talk.

595
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:24,705
Everything we get from
Atlanta been walked on.

596
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,364
Each one weaker than the other.

597
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:29,204
And this nigger Roberto
is on the shelf to us right now.

598
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,642
I mean, it's getting hard
to hold onto the Towers...

599
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:34,874
without our name all over
the product is what I'm saying.

600
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,008
Who got the good shit?

601
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:38,242
Eastside.

602
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:40,150
Eastside, who?

603
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:43,789
This nigger Milton got a small cut,
Prop Joe...

604
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:46,861
this Jamaican cat who got
the strip off Gay Street.

605
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:49,555
You talking about Petey, Petey Dixon.

606
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,564
You go over to the expressway
at lunchtime...

607
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,998
you can watch the fiends
traveling from west to east.

608
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,069
Damn!

609
00:42:55,336 --> 00:42:59,670
I mean, I'm cutting shit with shit right now,
trying to cheat, but sooner or later.

610
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:03,773
I hear you, man, I'm on it.

611
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:08,578
You working it out with Dee?

612
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:12,882
Boy got to find his own way.

613
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:15,751
I'm saying, you know...

614
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:17,984
I think we should keep
reaching out to this kid.

615
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:21,858
Give something to him and his girl.
I don't know, show them we got a plan.

616
00:43:21,963 --> 00:43:24,454
Take some real estate, put it in Dee's name.

617
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:26,925
He has something to come home to.

618
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:28,334
Do it.

619
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:33,564
Thing is, String, what happened happened,
you know what I mean?

620
00:43:34,075 --> 00:43:37,272
Push come to shove,
I've been fair to him, ain't l?

621
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,473
You've been fair.

622
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,678
Too fair.

623
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,728
-Where's the Greek?
-He sent me.

624
00:43:58,199 --> 00:43:59,689
Fuck you, and fuck him.

625
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:03,960
Frank, he sent me to tell you
that we're doubling your fee...

626
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,596
to help with any legal troubles.

627
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,572
He also told me to tell you he regrets...

628
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:10,735
that you're still having problems
on our behalf.

629
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:15,479
They're throwing my people
in back of police cars...

630
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,609
and this asshole can't even talk
face to face?

631
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:21,249
I'm done. I'm out.

632
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:23,153
I need nothing more to do with you people.

633
00:44:23,258 --> 00:44:26,955
I don't need the trouble or the money.
I got a union to run.

634
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,600
They used to make steel there, no?

635
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:41,905
Smoke from the stacks.

636
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:44,211
But inside....

637
00:45:07,368 --> 00:45:08,801
Potassium permanganate.

638
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,200
Spell "permanganate."

639
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:14,867
F-U-C-K.

640
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:23,347
You even know what the fuck
you're doing there, Zig?

641
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,851
I'm in the checker's local, right?

642
00:45:25,987 --> 00:45:28,182
You know, while you Local 47 boys...

643
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,553
were having bulk cargo
dropped on your heads...

644
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:33,559
we was out grabbing the future by the balls.

645
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,766
So you just type that shit in there
and ask it for an answer?

646
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,529
Let me ask you:

647
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:49,042
Why do we give a fuck what the shit is for?

648
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:50,701
If they want it, they want it.

649
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:53,212
I mean, besides,
if I don't get some money soon...

650
00:45:53,314 --> 00:45:55,043
I'm fucking toasted.

651
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:08,594
I don't know who you've been talking to...

652
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:11,859
but we don't have
that kind of stealing going on down here.

653
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:14,264
-It's not like the old days.
-No?

654
00:46:15,303 --> 00:46:18,670
A little here and there,
but for the most part...

655
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:21,537
the new technology
has changed everything.

656
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,307
Look, see this little box right here?

657
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:28,473
You fucking mind?

658
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,551
Ring's a little stressed right now...

659
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:33,746
having misplaced a frozen can
full of Japanese tuna steaks...

660
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:36,983
supposed to be at the Jessup
wholesale market by yesterday.

661
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,115
Bite me.

662
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:41,024
-Frank, these officers are--
-I know who they are.

663
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,858
Frank here helped set this system up.

664
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,956
He probably can explain it better than I can,
if he doesn't mind.

665
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:47,694
No problem, chief.

666
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:52,862
In a nutshell, what this shows...

667
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,135
is the Aqua Verde at Berth 4.

668
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,378
The plan calls for 85 moves.

669
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:01,846
That's cans, containers, coming off the ship,
and others going back on.

670
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:03,075
Now, look at the screen.

671
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:06,381
Every time a can goes on or off,
the computer creates a record...

672
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,955
and puts it in the permanent database.

673
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:12,220
He was saying the computer makes it
hard to steal off the docks.

674
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:14,419
Did our port manager tell you
that right now...

675
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:18,056
we got 160 boxes missing
off the Patapsco terminal alone?

676
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:20,865
Or that last time
we inventoried the truck chassis...

677
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,731
we came up 300 light?

678
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:25,431
No, I suppose not.
That's management for you.

679
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,666
160?

680
00:47:26,774 --> 00:47:28,105
Not that all of them are stolen.

681
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:30,200
You can lose a can by accident, no problem.

682
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:35,044
For one thing,
these hand-helds use radio waves.

683
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:37,640
With all the equipment
and container stacks out there...

684
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:39,151
sometimes waves get knocked down.

685
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:40,948
That happens, a can don't get entered.

686
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,615
Or, just as easy,
a checker makes the wrong entry.

687
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:48,560
Either 'cause he's lazy, he's sloppy,
or he's still shitfaced from the night before.

688
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:52,789
Or, simpler than that, you got fat fingers.
No offense.

689
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:55,228
So imagine February on the docks.

690
00:47:55,336 --> 00:47:58,499
You're wearing Gortex gloves,
trying to punch numbers on that thing.

691
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,665
You're saying
that's what happened to the can...

692
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:02,333
with the girls in it?

693
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:05,469
Beadie, darling,
I don't know what happened there.

694
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,514
I'm just saying, if you go by the computer...

695
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:09,810
it might look like
there's some dirt going down...

696
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,010
when it's really just a glitch in the system.

697
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,216
The customs seal was broke on that box.
Shouldn't that get noticed?

698
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:19,888
You're offloading a ship
the size of a small town.

699
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:23,029
You might notice a broke seal,
you might not.

700
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,159
Look, you wanna keep
pulling our chain, you can.

701
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:30,396
But it ain't like it's just
that one box that went missing.

702
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:33,099
We lose them sons of bitches all the time.

703
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:40,845
-Frank give you everything you need?
-He did, thanks.

704
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:43,478
They're playing us.

705
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:52,754
You drove all the way from Baltimore
on a hope and a prayer?

706
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,589
Yeah, I'm dead-ended on this.

707
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:57,357
Is there anything we can offer
any of them for cooperation?

708
00:48:57,465 --> 00:49:00,263
You could marry one of them,
make her an American housewife.

709
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:03,030
Short of that, they're going back the fuck
where they came from.

710
00:49:03,137 --> 00:49:05,037
-Where do you hold them?
-County detention.

711
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:07,835
We keep the undocumenteds
out of gen pop.

712
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,178
You all heard of WorldCom?

713
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,448
All right, let's try this.

714
00:49:14,649 --> 00:49:17,049
You all get jacked by some knockos.

715
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:18,844
But you all clean.

716
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:21,717
You all got an outstanding warrant,
like everybody in here.

717
00:49:21,823 --> 00:49:23,313
What do you do?

718
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,819
Give another name.

719
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:29,954
Why?

720
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:33,991
Because your real name ain't no good.

721
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:36,968
All right, it ain't good and....
Follow through.

722
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:42,505
All right, Death Grip ain't shit?

723
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:45,905
Then change up the name.

724
00:49:46,013 --> 00:49:47,275
What else?

725
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:50,782
Yo, I got it, change the caps
from red to blue, right?

726
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:54,178
Make it look like we got
some fresh shit, boom.

727
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:58,553
You know what else we might could do?
Give each tower its own name, right?

728
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:01,127
And then we do, like, some fake competing.

729
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:05,165
So, a fiend gets some bad shit from one,
he'd go back to the other.

730
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:07,131
There's a thinking man, right there.

731
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:10,398
See, nigger,
ain't that what the fuck I just said?

732
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:14,237
You and my uncle talk?

733
00:50:15,443 --> 00:50:16,808
How'd it go?

734
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:18,709
No problem.

735
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:26,317
Three boxes.

736
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:30,388
All of them on the Wilhelmina.
And you should tell your uncle...

737
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:34,120
that it's three times the usual fee for each.

738
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:41,865
We checked on those chemicals.

739
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,464
We looked into that.

740
00:50:44,572 --> 00:50:46,506
I was worried, you know?

741
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:53,543
Before I deliver, I wanna know
what you need it for.

742
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:55,844
A bomb or some shit?

743
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:59,082
I ain't down for that.

744
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:03,657
You use that shit
to process drugs, don't you?

745
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,819
Cocaine.

746
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,894
You still want it,
I got it on the Fairfield piers.

747
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,332
No problem.

748
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:16,494
When?

749
00:51:17,204 --> 00:51:18,762
End of the week.

750
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:25,606
Maryska.

751
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:29,315
She's good with English.

752
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:35,813
They're dead.

753
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:39,051
All I'm trying to do is
get word to the families.

754
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:09,180
What did she say?

755
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:13,553
She wants to know,
if she knows a girl, does she get to stay?

756
00:52:45,126 --> 00:52:48,892
You want a good restaurant for dinner,
or are you headed right back?

757
00:52:55,636 --> 00:52:56,728
A computer?

758
00:52:56,837 --> 00:53:01,069
To run a trace on the missing containers
in the port administration's database.

759
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:02,233
You're looking for what?

760
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:06,302
A pattern for our case. We need to know
who left those girls on the dock and why.

761
00:53:06,414 --> 00:53:09,440
We're supposed to be on Sobotka
and the checkers union anyway...

762
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,178
so folding one investigation
into the other makes sense.

763
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:14,049
Not to me, it doesn't.

764
00:53:14,422 --> 00:53:15,980
I'm not bringing your open murders...

765
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,524
anywhere near this detail,
that's a loser for us.

766
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:19,684
Lieutenant!

767
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:23,457
We bring in a few drug rips,
and show that we gave Sobotka...

768
00:53:23,564 --> 00:53:26,795
and his union a quick, fair look,
it's more than enough for Burrell.

769
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:29,131
He returns the favor,
and I'm out of the basement...

770
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:31,033
and running an investigative unit again.

771
00:53:31,138 --> 00:53:34,266
You dirty me up with murders I can't solve.
It doesn't play like that.

772
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,776
Homicide's not the place
to sprawl a case, Lieutenant.

773
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:39,879
Rawls, Landsman...

774
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:44,013
they have no patience for anything
but a quick shake.

775
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:47,147
We got enough room for it here, anyway.

776
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:01,299
You can set up here at the off-site...

777
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:02,835
and we can share information.

778
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:05,405
But the murders stay with Homicide.

779
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,969
Unless, of course, you find a suspect.

780
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:43,936
Three ROIROs, four containers.

781
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,535
I got all my cards up,
including long numbers...

782
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:47,944
and we're still short.

783
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:50,016
-A good day.
-That it is.

784
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:57,022
Everybody works today,
even you, my little j-series wonders.

785
00:54:57,124 --> 00:54:58,352
Even you.

786
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:06,358
Is Horse working the Wilhelmina today?

787
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:09,965
I told that motherfucker we were done.
I told him!

788
00:55:10,504 --> 00:55:14,463
He said he talked to you.
He said it's triple-rate for every can.

789
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:16,169
Triple?

790
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:29,086
Call Horse in the tower.
Tell him he's working the Wilhelmina.

791
00:55:29,857 --> 00:55:32,485
It's now or never for us, I got no choice.

792
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:35,460
Today we got ships, Uncle Frank. Today.

793
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:39,391
But the writing's on the fucking wall.

794
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:45,405
Fuck the wall.
