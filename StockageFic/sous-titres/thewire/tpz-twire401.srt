1
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,881
Anybody in plumbing,
please go to aisle four.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,960
God damn!

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,962
Ah, I see you got
the DeWalt cordless.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,560
Your nail gun--
DeWalt 410.

5
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,968
Yeah. The trouble is,

6
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,131
you leave it
in a truck for a while,

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,107
need to step up
and use the bitch,

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,007
the battery don't hold up,
you know?

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,012
Yeah, cordless'll do that.

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,810
You might want to consider
the powder-actuated tool.

11
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,648
The Hilti DX 460 MX
or the Simpson PTP--

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,778
these two
are my Cadillacs.

13
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,484
Everything else on this board
is second-best, sorry to say.

14
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,119
Are you contracting, or just doing
some work around the house?

15
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,562
- No, we work all over.
- Full time?

16
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,361
No, we had about
five jobs last month.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,799
Ah. With that rate,

18
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,895
the cost of the powder-actuated guns
justifies itself.

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,099
- You say "power"?
- Powder.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,631
- Like gunpowder?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,339
The DX 460 is fully automatic,
with a.27-caliber charge.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,577
Wood, concrete,
steel to steel--

23
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,642
she'll throw a fastener into anything.
And for my money,

24
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,985
she handles recoil better than
the Simpson or the P3500.

25
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,923
Now, you understand
what I mean by recoil?

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,858
Yeah, the kickback.
I'm with you.

27
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:37,385
- That's right.
-.27 caliber, huh?

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,863
Yeah, not large
ballistically,

29
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,229
but for driving nails,
it's enough.

30
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,996
Any more than that,
you'd add to the recoil.

31
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,995
Man, shit. I seen
a tiny-ass.22 round-nose

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,440
drop a nigga
plenty of days, man.

33
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,876
Motherfuckers get up
in you like a pinball,

34
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,003
rip your ass up.

35
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,274
Big joints, though--

36
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,544
big joints, man,
just break your bones,

37
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,178
you say, "Fuck it."

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,621
I'm gonna go with this right here, man.
How much I owe you?

39
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,954
$669 plus tax.

40
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,293
No no, you just pay
at the register.

41
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,959
Nah, man, you go ahead
and handle that for me, man.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,695
And keep the rest
for your time.

43
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,636
- This is $800.
- So what, man?

44
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,505
You earned that buck
like a motherfucker. Keep that shit.

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,490
- We good?
- Yeah, man.

46
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,495
The man said if you
want to shoot nails,

47
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,690
this here is
the Cadillac, man.

48
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,824
He mean Lexus,
but he ain't know it.

49
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,334
- Hold the charge better?
- Man, fuck the charge.

50
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,930
This here is gunpowder-activated,
.27 caliber,

51
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,499
full auto, no kickback,
nail-throwing mayhem, man.

52
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,135
Shit right here is tight.

53
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,669
Fuck just nailing up boards.

54
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,511
We could kill a couple motherfuckers
with this right here.

55
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,110
You laughing. I've been schooled, dog.
I'm trying to tell you.

56
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,313
- All right, all right.
- For real.

57
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,691
Seven and counting.

58
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,960
All of them
caught on the wire.

59
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,467
We're not above the corners yet,
but we soon will be.

60
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,130
- They're not dumping phones?
- Every month or so.

61
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,731
Sloppy enough that we may be able
to track a phone or two

62
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,742
up to Marlo or the people
he keeps close.

63
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,903
Truth is, if they're
still using cell phones

64
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,878
in this day and age,
they're mine.

65
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,881
And if Marlo Stanfield
is on a cell,

66
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,440
- he'll be mine too.
- Cool Lester smooth.

67
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,248
That's not trash talk, darling.
That's simple fact.

68
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,620
Marlo Stanfield may have a lot of heart
and a lot of corners,

69
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,919
but he's a babe
in the woods

70
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,755
when it comes
to this right here.

71
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,991
I was proud to be chasing those
Barksdales, but this Stanfield kid...

72
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,827
Not as fierce
as we thought.

73
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,698
For months now, there hasn't been
a body we can put to him.

74
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,000
- Hmm.
- You two sound disappointed.

75
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,269
This unit needs good, hard targets,
or it'll go soft.

76
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,276
Be that as it may,
I'll assume you want

77
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,403
- another 30 days on your taps.
- At least.

78
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,971
And we've got subpoenas
to go out this week as well.

79
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,678
- Subpoenas?
- Asset investigations.

80
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,552
- On Marlo Stanfield?
- Come here.

81
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,017
All this is
from the Barksdale money trail.

82
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,892
We've been running
down all the paper

83
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,727
we pulled out of
Stringer's apartment

84
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,596
and the B & B
office downtown.

85
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:12,036
- I miss Prez, man. I do.
- I hear you.

86
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,733
The truth is, those guys had
money going everywhere--

87
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,642
investments, political donations,
consulting fees...

88
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,975
You want to do this now?

89
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,606
I wanted to do
this a year ago,

90
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,616
but fresh cases
got in the way.

91
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,244
And your lieutenant's gonna
okay this kind of paper?

92
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,449
Our lieutenant has
a fearless heart.

93
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,753
- This will get you started.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

94
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,523
Wait wait wait.
Wait right there.

95
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,258
My coupons.

96
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,163
You were gonna give
this lady my coupons.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,428
Been clipping them
for two days,

98
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,368
and you damn near sent them out
with your mess.

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,928
Well, why are they
in my pile?

100
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,496
Why is your pile
in my workspace?

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,030
Because I'm doing
real work!

102
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,305
Working my nerves
is what you've been doing.

103
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,813
Four weeks before
the Baltimore City primary,

104
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,287
you hand me a stack
of drug-money subpoenas

105
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,984
that hit a dozen
key political figures.

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,361
There's an election:

107
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,454
Who's running?

108
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,328
...and they think I can't.

109
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,301
Shit, I don't think we can
take four more years of this guy.

110
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,893
This city's in the toilet.

111
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,996
That's what they said
during my term, too.

112
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,734
Yeah well, you got
dealt a bad hand,

113
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,174
- I mean, with the riots and all.
- Yeah, sure.

114
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,768
Anyway, I think
I'll squeeze in

115
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,803
if Tony Gray draws off
25%, 26% of the vote,

116
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,838
because most of that's
out of Royce's base.

117
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,908
25% is a big number for Gray,
don't you think?

118
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,182
I don't know.
Royce's negatives are up--

119
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,155
even among black voters.

120
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,317
Yeah.
In a minute, Norman.

121
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,019
You know what
I think, Tommy?

122
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,153
No matter what,
you got your name out there,

123
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,857
and it'll help you
down the road

124
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,229
if you ever want to step up
to the legislature.

125
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,359
But as one paisan to another,

126
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,394
the day of the white mayor
is over in this town.

127
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,905
Excuse me,
Your Eminence.

128
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,101
You're due at the Baylor-Edison
Senior Center,

129
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,235
and I don't want to be lying
to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters

130
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,336
because you wanted to talk shop
all the damn morning.

131
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,109
Seniors, huh?
They vote, Tommy.

132
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,049
Got to run. Sorry.

133
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,020
The candidate's on your clock.
Don't ever let him forget it.

134
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,217
No, indeed.

135
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,995
Need your sig
on vehicle logs

136
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,727
and a corrected court report

137
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,167
and office memo
subpoena requests

138
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,366
and a requisition due
to City Purchasing for a large fan.

139
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,964
A fan, huh?

140
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,839
Caroline says it stays hot

141
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,004
in the wire room
with the door closed.

142
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,511
Oh. It's beautiful,
Lieutenant.

143
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,575
- I've never seen a beach house so fine.
- You think so?

144
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,610
Shit. Makes me think
about retirement,

145
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,849
and I only got
nine years on.

146
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,858
When do you break ground?

147
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,087
Next March,
if I have my permits,

148
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,856
which reminds me--
on Tuesday,

149
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,262
I have to get over to Delaware
and see my contractor.

150
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,356
Oh, no problem.

151
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,960
Me and Lester, we'll cover for you
on that. No problem at all.

152
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,950
Cake.

153
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,425
You know what
I'm saying, yo?

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,724
That's my baby's mother
we talking about, yo.

155
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,560
But y'all been broke up,
right?

156
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,156
Man, I ain't living
with her or nothing,

157
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,531
but I still be giving her
a couple dollars here and there,

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,196
you know,
stop and pass.

159
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,229
Pandemic! Pandemic!

160
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,468
Look at this.

161
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,477
Hey, Nay.

162
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,308
- Namond!
- Hmm:

163
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,712
What the fuck am l
paying you for, nigga?

164
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,841
Oh, my fault, B.

165
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,317
Damn!

166
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,513
Yo man, and do something
with that ponytail.

167
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,545
Cops can make his ass
from a mile away.

168
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,117
Braid it or something!

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,186
Yeah, you know, me and Patrice
been together for a long time.

170
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,027
Yeah, but you say she running
with the boy Fruit now, right?

171
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,694
Yeah. If he don't back
the fuck off,

172
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,795
I'm gonna fill his ass
with some hot ones, yo.

173
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,500
Shit. You don't
think I will?

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,304
I got that pandemic.

175
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,440
Man...

176
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,947
do what you gonna do.

177
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,609
- Bodie.
- What's up, big man?

178
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,914
You ain't real with us
all week, man.

179
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,717
You stepping
on that package or what?

180
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,223
Yo, man,
everything's slow.

181
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,090
It been slow since we moved
down here from Fayette Street.

182
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,357
Yeah, well,
Marlo wanted Fayette.

183
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,490
Man, I do not like backing down
from niggas, man.

184
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,830
I feel like a punk.
I feel like doing shit.

185
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,995
Ain't like
the old days, dog.

186
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,369
Mayor Barksdale left.

187
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,465
You out here
on your own, dog.

188
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,435
Give it up.

189
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,913
B, let's roll.

190
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,950
Hey, Lex, man,

191
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,923
I'm gonna give you the truth
because you need the truth.

192
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,017
That boy Marlo got
the world by the ass.

193
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,051
And Fruit,
he work for Marlo.

194
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,359
So I'm saying,
fuck that bitch.

195
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,990
Pfft.
And move on.

196
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,161
- That's just the way it is.
- Yeah.

197
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,171
- That's just the way it is, man.
- Pandemic!

198
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,465
Thank you, sir.

199
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,303
Just one moment,
ma'am.

200
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,331
You seen Hoskins?

201
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,072
Lieutenant went
upstairs already.

202
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,574
Step through, please.

203
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,557
Madam President.

204
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,691
Council president's
hot as balls.

205
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,728
- I'd fuck you to fuck her, man.
- Yeah?

206
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,138
You'd fuck a guy for a chance
to fuck a hot broad?

207
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,574
You don't think that makes you
a faggot or nothing?

208
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,544
It's just
an expression, man.

209
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,554
Been on this detail
how long?

210
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,754
Eight months.

211
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,195
Eight months
with Clarence Royce.

212
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,661
So let me ask,

213
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,932
are you ready to take a bullet
for the Mayor of Baltimore?

214
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,208
Lieutenant, sir.

215
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,220
Is the truck okay,
or do we want to call one?

216
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,551
No, the truck works.

217
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,552
He said he needed
just 10 minutes.

218
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,254
No, not now.

219
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,663
Maybe tomorrow.

220
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,298
Is that Krawczyk again?

221
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,894
Every time he writes
another check,

222
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,872
he turns around
and calls for something

223
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,067
just to see that he can.

224
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,303
Getting calls
from Carcetti's people, too.

225
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,539
They want one debate
for crime and safety,

226
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,810
the other on economic stuff
and schools,

227
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,441
Tony Gray crying
the same blues.

228
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,179
Like they're gonna
get the whole night

229
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,743
to smack me
with the crime rate.

230
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,948
I told "The Sun" paper
we're open to any format,

231
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,616
which we'll be
for another couple days or so,

232
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,422
in which time we'll say,
"Fuck you. One debate."

233
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,485
Two debates. Shit!

234
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,096
That lost-ball-in-high-grass
motherfucker Carcetti.

235
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,661
He needs to get used to
life in the wilderness,

236
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,332
and not just
the downtown areas,

237
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,604
but your communities here
on the East Side.

238
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,043
We stand
or we fall together,

239
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,276
and I'm here today to ask
for the chance to stand with you.

240
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,442
Thank you
for your time.

241
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,214
Questions?

242
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,316
Yes, ma'am?

243
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,887
Is it the Salisbury steak
for lunch today,

244
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,296
or is they doing tacos?

245
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,967
Because it's developments
like this one,

246
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,441
planned residential towers

247
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,741
with waterside retail space
and restaurants

248
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,113
that grow Baltimore's tax base
and help rebuild our city.

249
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,608
I want to thank Ed Bowers
for his vision,

250
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,646
but more important,
for his commitment--

251
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,090
for his commitment
to the City of Baltimore.

252
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,320
Ed.

253
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,428
Mr. Mayor,

254
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,634
I want to thank you
and your administration,

255
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,472
for making this next stage
of redevelopment

256
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,274
for Baltimore's harbor
a reality.

257
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,951
You talk about vision
and commitment--

258
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,816
Mayor Clarence Royce.

259
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,032
Pandemic! Pandemic!

260
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,800
What up, Nay?

261
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,865
Yo, what up?

262
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,173
- What you got?
- Nothing.

263
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,679
It's just a story about
A.J. from North & Woods.

264
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,739
Yo, you know
they gave him 700 years?

265
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,842
Read this shit, son.

266
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,013
This corner is dead, man.
You still working?

267
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,216
Yeah, because we was gonna
gonna go under the road

268
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,316
- and catch some fresh birds.
- I don't know.

269
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,224
Let me see if I can bounce.
Hold up.

270
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,666
- Hey, B.
- What's up?

271
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,225
I wanted to know
if I could leave early

272
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,032
because me and the fellas
want to go down to Mondawmin

273
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,470
for some back-to-school stuff.

274
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,268
What you need
back-to-school stuff for?

275
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,774
Your ass stay suspended.

276
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,299
Come on,
stop playing, B.

277
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,039
Hey, if it wasn't
for social promotion,

278
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,604
your ass would still be
in pre-K, motherfucker.

279
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,014
Probably daycare
up this bitch.

280
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,608
Pandemic right here!

281
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,749
Fuck it.
Hey, yo, man.

282
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,121
Pay this late-to-work, early-to-play
nigger out for five hours, yo.

283
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,184
Yo, you owe me extra time
tomorrow, though.

284
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,026
Lex! Did you hear me?

285
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,397
Damn, y'all!

286
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,130
Young'uns don't got a scrap
of work ethic nowadays, man.

287
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,331
If it wasn't for his pops,
I wouldn't even bother.

288
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,468
Yo!

289
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,067
Make sure you come
early tomorrow

290
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,636
because it ain't always
gonna be this slow.

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,478
Pandemic!

292
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,381
At least
I hope it ain't.

293
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,579
Mr. Mayor.

294
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,383
Mr. Mayor, excuse me.

295
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,287
I just want to make sure
we're still okay

296
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,122
for that median cut
on Boston Street.

297
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,958
I really need that access
to make the site viable.

298
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,226
Right. I'll get
my people on it.

299
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,596
Thank you, sir.

300
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,331
Something going on
with his median?

301
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,004
Not once he ponies up.

302
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,209
I think he can do a lot better
than the 4,000,

303
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,807
don't you?

304
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,750
I don't even
want to know.

305
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,246
No, Chris, please, man.

306
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,225
We're low
on quicklime, man.

307
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,921
Doesn't matter.

308
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,828
We got vacants on both sides.
He'll stink is all.

309
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,165
Chris, please.

310
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,604
Don't fret, boss.
I got you covered.

311
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,336
Quick and clean,
I promise.

312
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,278
Chr--

313
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,497
Man, shit like that don't even
work in them cartoons.

314
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,059
The roadrunner just snatch
the birdseed and book.

315
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,503
- We ain't in no cartoon.
- Yeah, you is.

316
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,336
Shh! Be still.

317
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,001
Yeah, you scaring away
the birds.

318
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,135
I'm talking to both y'all.

319
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,703
Took me off the clock
for this craziness?

320
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,341
- What the fuck is you thinking?
- We're serious, Nay.

321
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,975
This bird could be worth
like 300 or 400.

322
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,576
Nigga, please.

323
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,952
Yo, you know the boy Nemo
who worked Marlo's pigeon coop?

324
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,219
Said he got 400
for a white homing bird.

325
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,624
- And that's a homer?
- I mean, it's white.

326
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,595
- So that makes it a homer, right?
- It could be.

327
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,530
Damn! Son, you need to put
some hamburger meat in that trap.

328
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,964
That shit would've been got.

329
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,399
Shut your mouth,
it'd have been got.

330
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,876
I'm gonna fuck
this nigga up.

331
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,714
Hey yo, what the fuck
is wrong with you,

332
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,739
throwing bottles
and shit, huh?

333
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,341
You just cost us cash money,
you know that?

334
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,943
I ain't done nothing.

335
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,614
You're a seriously backwards dude.
You know that, right?

336
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,248
Playing with bugs
like he's still in Pampers.

337
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,849
That wasn't even necessary.

338
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,587
Nah, you don't want
any Pampers.

339
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,889
Put them over
that mouth you got.

340
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,260
Catch all that shit
you be flushing.

341
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,356
- Ohh!
- Ooh!

342
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,394
Y'all be stinking
like rat fart.

343
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,460
There you go!

344
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,166
- Oh oh!
- Get him!

345
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,835
All right, all right.

346
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,106
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

347
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,772
Y'all acting like
little bitches.

348
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,337
Yo, you seen
my man Duke?

349
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,905
Clocked him, got him
upside his head.

350
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,747
Only because I didn't
want to get too close

351
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,218
and touch
the dirty motherfucker.

352
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,084
Could have come up with AlDS
or some shit like that.

353
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,986
Dukie fight
like a bitch, yo.

354
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,620
I would have whipped that ass
if I didn't feel sorry for him.

355
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,694
Duke, man,
you scared away the birds.

356
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,960
I blew me up
a bug bomb.

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,592
You want to come
and see the pieces?

358
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,035
Nah, I'm good.
I got to go.

359
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,868
All right.

360
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,635
Hey hey, Randy.

361
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,437
That pigeon
wasn't a homer.

362
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,774
Homers got them metal things
around their leg.

363
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,110
That way you can tell them
from the other birds.

364
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,671
How you know that?

365
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,581
You know Nemo let me clean
out his coop sometimes.

366
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,415
So... he was schooling me.

367
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,360
...which leaves us
a total of 54.

368
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,166
No surprises on who's coming back--
all the regulars.

369
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,503
We lost Mr. Parker
and Ms. Bowles.

370
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,872
- Gregory's leaving?
- Hired by the county.

371
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,036
And Bowles, I knew
she wasn't coming back,

372
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,774
the way they tore up
her classroom.

373
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,874
So we're short two in math
and four in science.

374
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,310
Man at the door.

375
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,151
No system l.D.,
but says he's new here.

376
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,953
Well, buzz him in before
something changes his mind.

377
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,629
All the way
on the left.

378
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,292
Pull it hard.

379
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,202
- Hard!
- It's locked.

380
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,830
All right.
I'll be right down.

381
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,967
Not a goddamn thing up in here
works like it should.

382
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,170
Well, you turn to
the cafeteria assignments,

383
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,736
and you see that's gonna leave
Ernest alone for second period,

384
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,408
and he can't handle it alone.

385
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,952
You tell them, because I ain't even
gonna try to pronounce it.

386
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,854
Roland Pryzbylewski.

387
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,052
Everyone just
calls me "Prez."

388
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,061
Claudell Withers.
I'm principal here.

389
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,653
New in math.

390
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,995
I won't have my certificate
until next year,

391
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,624
but with the resident
teachers' program,

392
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,635
they said I'd be
getting classes

393
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,863
because of staff shortages?

394
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,271
Jesus.
Lambs to the slaughter here.

395
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,266
What did you do before you decided
to teach, Mr. Pryzbylewski?

396
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,280
I was a police...
in the city.

397
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,643
Marcia Donnelly,
Assistant Principal.

398
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,882
Welcome to
Edward Tilghman Middle.

399
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,824
That leaves Tullman,
as I see 'em, for the 12th.

400
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,828
You think he can handle
the whole shift?

401
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,420
Now, which one's
Tullman, again?

402
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,126
Goofy redhead, kind of
looks like Opie from Mayberry,

403
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,463
but less fierce.

404
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,262
Jimmy,
Major wants to see you.

405
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,875
Jimmy, come on in.

406
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,212
I know I offered
when I first came over here,

407
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,776
and I know your answer then,
but I'm still asking.

408
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,549
Can I get you
out of a radio car?

409
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,147
No thank you, Major.

410
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,052
McNulty, I'm short
two men in Ops,

411
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,120
and my follow-up squad
couldn't make a case to save its life.

412
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,428
You're too damn good
to be humping calls.

413
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,024
Thanks for the offer,
though.

414
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,032
You don't think I asked him 10 times
when I was acting commander?

415
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,908
He's in the wrong
fucking place.

416
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,344
For us, yeah.

417
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,782
For him...

418
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,822
Yo, po-po, man.
Po-po. Shut it down.

419
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,554
Where is the love, Bodie?

420
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,464
Where is the motherfucking love?

421
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,298
I go back so far
with this kid,

422
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,860
I was chasing him
through juvie.

423
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,805
But does any of that matter
when we roll up here?

424
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,001
I get so much as a wave,
a nod, a smile?

425
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,031
Nothing.

426
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,775
- How about just hello?
- Hello.

427
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,284
See? That wasn't
so hard, was it?

428
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,054
Lex, my man,
how's your day going?

429
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,680
Not to criticize
or anything,

430
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,520
but I think you missed
a spot there.

431
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,618
Little Kevin,
how's it hanging?

432
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,822
Reesey, you look like
someone just shot your dog.

433
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,728
You all right, man?
You okay?

434
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,630
Reesey still messing up
the count?

435
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,793
You hear what he said?

436
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,894
Yo, dog, you send him up
to Lamelle next month.

437
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,928
I'll make sure Ms. Davis
puts him in remedial math,

438
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,234
and we'll have done
some good here today.

439
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,503
Fucking cop, man.

440
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,941
Everything good?

441
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,712
Yeah. Just words.

442
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,276
Mr. Entrapment,
how you doing?

443
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,222
Don't look like that.
I'm still dining out on that story.

444
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,055
You know how he beat
the wiretap a year ago?

445
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,551
Claimed entrapment when he was clocking
in Bunny Colvin's Hamsterdam.

446
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,155
Shit you not.

447
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,291
Smart kiddo.
I loved it.

448
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,666
When I roll back in an hour,
this corner's bone-dry.

449
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,500
Your people are done
for the day.

450
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,168
Okay.
So let's try this again.

451
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,236
I say, "Have a good evening,
Mr. Broadus."

452
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,206
And a good evening to you,
Sergeant Carver.

453
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,379
See?
We're right here.

454
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,420
And a very good evening
to you, Officer Colicchio.

455
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,587
Fuck yourself with a 40,
shitbreath.

456
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,794
What the fuck
was all that about?

457
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,302
- You can't bust every head, Tony.
- I can't?

458
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,464
Bust every head, who are you
gonna talk to when the shit happens?

459
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,745
Hi, Rachel.

460
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,089
- Tim, thanks for doing that yesterday.
- Yeah, no problem.

461
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,029
You ran late all morning--

462
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,828
Late for the seniors, late for
the Stonewall meeting with Della.

463
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,494
Late for the Gay-Lesbian Alliance.

464
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,503
Them seniors,
they talk slow.

465
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,937
Bullshit. It was breakfast
with Young Tony

466
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,203
when they sat there swapping
stories over cold coffee.

467
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,904
- Young Tony, huh?
- I was getting sage advice--

468
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,072
- From a one-term mayor?
- It wasn't his fault.

469
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,445
He takes over in '67,
sees the city burn.

470
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,881
That was an opportunity.

471
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,477
Spiro Agnew made his whole career
on the '68 Riots.

472
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,112
- Agnew?
- One man's shithead's

473
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,713
another man's vice president.

474
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,088
- True today as it ever was.
- Hey, is that polling data?

475
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,184
Raw numbers.
It's incomplete.

476
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,321
Right now, you need to be
in the call room dialing for dollars.

477
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,128
Aw, fuck!
I can't do it anymore!

478
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,761
I hate it. I hate it
more than anything.

479
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,896
- I fucking hate it!
- You don't do this,

480
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,963
you don't have the money to pay
for the damn TV spots

481
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,201
in the last two weeks.

482
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,472
Aw, mothersucking
cockfuckers.

483
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,309
Oh, Jesus.
I fucking hate this.

484
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,539
Hey there, Jim.

485
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,677
Tom Carcetti here,
remember me?

486
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,244
We met at your sister's house--

487
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,916
you know, the one that's married
to that Republican cunt.

488
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,083
I know you
don't remember me.

489
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,391
I know you don't have any use
for fucking politicians,

490
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,057
and frankly, I don't give a flying fuck
about what you think

491
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,828
or what your concerns are.

492
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,097
But I do care about what
your cute little blonde wife

493
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,626
thinks about so many things.

494
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,935
But, Jim, the reason
I'm calling is because

495
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,204
I want you to write me out
a check for $4,000,

496
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,040
the maximum allowed by law.

497
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,308
Because we don't trust you
to actually mail that check,

498
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,872
we're gonna send over a couple
of furloughed DPW workers

499
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,214
to beat the check out of you.

500
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,016
All finished?
You need $30,000...

501
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,580
in the next three hours.
No bullshit, Tommy.

502
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,149
You hit your number
or die in this room.

503
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,751
Yeah, whatever.

504
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,011
So what are you
watching, then?

505
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,543
Anything on the tube?

506
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,451
No fucking way.

507
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,923
They got enough power
in the middle of the lineup.

508
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,721
What they need is pitching.

509
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,225
What you looking at?

510
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,358
Fucking crazy.

511
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,733
Oh, like I'm really gonna give
that motherfucker a ride to Woodlawn.

512
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,261
Shit.

513
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,532
Help! Somebody help!

514
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,974
What's up, Patrice?

515
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,748
You're letting it ring,
right?

516
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,723
You're not hanging up
after a ring or two?

517
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,384
I'm making
the calls, Terri.

518
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,552
I don't know what to say.
Nobody's home.

519
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,619
30,000, Tommy.

520
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,703
You mean Lex, the boy
who used to go with Patrice?

521
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,270
Lester!

522
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,372
He her baby's daddy.

523
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,746
He ain't the first one
to get his spurt.

524
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,546
You ain't got to
talk like that.

525
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,986
Nigga just walked up to him outside
of the Paragon and served him up.

526
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,546
One to the face.
Whap!

527
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,491
Shoot.
He was real cute.

528
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,586
Lex and his nine took all the cute
out of that lazy-eye motherfucker.

529
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,096
Anything on Fruit's phone?

530
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,827
Nothing. I've gone
for two hours.

531
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,835
- Sure.
- It's no problem, though.

532
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,929
Sure. I really
need your help.

533
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,169
- Put me down for four.
- Yeah.

534
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,506
What about your wife?

535
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,170
Think she can
come up with four?

536
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,339
- I don't think we can do eight.
- The kids?

537
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,938
They're in strollers.

538
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,472
I know they're in strollers.
I was kidding.

539
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,643
That's funny.

540
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,312
Yeah, never mind.
4,000 is good.

541
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,445
- Thanks.
- No problem.

542
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,149
One to the left temple.

543
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,055
Close range in a lot
full of club trash,

544
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,425
- but of course, nobody sees a thing.
- Hmm.

545
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,954
- We hear your shooter goes by "Lex."
- Lex?

546
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,160
We were up
on your victim's cell phone, too.

547
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,692
We'll go back through the calls,
send you whatever's there.

548
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,103
Got this from his pocket.

549
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,040
You can pull the numbers from that
as a consolation prize.

550
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,307
This fucks you guys up, don't it?
Losing a guy you had wired?

551
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,281
Nah. We're up on several phones
on the street level.

552
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,648
With or without Mr. Fruit,
we're on our way.

553
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,448
You know, it's strange.

554
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,819
We're not seeing bodies.

555
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,222
This is the first drug hit
in months,

556
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,227
and it's Marlo's boy who falls.

557
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,628
- I thought Marlo was the new power.
- He is.

558
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,430
Shit, he's got everything
from MLK to Fulton now.

559
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,436
How do you hold
that much real estate

560
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,405
without making bodies?

561
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,431
You hear anything more about
this murder on your wire, Lester,

562
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,273
the Bunk expects a call.

563
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,302
Yeah, I know he does.

564
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,213
Oh! The hell with Norris.

565
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,116
You're my real partner, Lester.
My life partner.

566
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,120
Don't tease, bitch.

567
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,781
Look at that
bowlegged motherfucker.

568
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,315
I made him
walk like that.

569
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,898
So who the fuck
is Lex?

570
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,477
Dontrelle's cousin.

571
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,104
Used to be with
Cantel's people.

572
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,775
He working some corner
over the Hilltop now.

573
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,841
He ain't more connected
than that?

574
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,375
And he coming near
one of mine?

575
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,081
Wasn't about no business.

576
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,089
Pussy, man.

577
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,648
Yo, Fruit was into something
that Lex thought was his own.

578
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,560
You say the word, we take off
that whole motherfucking corner

579
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,960
every last one
of them bitches.

580
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,090
What corner are we
talking about, again?

581
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,032
Rag-tag shit up
on Pacer.

582
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,763
Man, they get
their shit from Joe,

583
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,668
but they're
mostly independent.

584
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,798
They gone, Marlo.
Just say so.

585
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,604
That what you think?
Just do them all?

586
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,338
And take their
fucking corner, too.

587
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,241
What do I want with
some off-brand Hilltop corner?

588
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,652
And why I need
to be stacking bodies

589
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,952
when there ain't no one
trying to war with us?

590
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,619
Just Lex.

591
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,821
He did one of ours,
so he got to fall.

592
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,348
Get out, Tommy.
You're done.

593
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,680
Get up, Tommy!

594
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,395
Come on, pretty boy.
Come on.

595
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,659
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

596
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,292
- Come on. Let's go.
- That's home?

597
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,859
Yeah. That's it.

598
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,371
There we go,
little trooper.

599
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,771
6:30 tomorrow morning.

600
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,114
Don't make me drag you out of bed
like you did yesterday.

601
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,642
Mm-hmm.

602
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,795
Damn, boy,
what happened to you?

603
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,098
Terrace Boys banged me

604
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,365
coming across the tracks
over there by Ramsey Street.

605
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,703
Teron, Manny, Herbie.

606
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,470
Man, all them
Terrace niggas.

607
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,340
They can't whoop on
Dukie like that.

608
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,812
Yeah, I know. Only we can
whoop on Dukie like that.

609
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,781
We've got to step it up,
even this out.

610
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,216
Nah. Fuck even.

611
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,185
We gonna hurt them
twice as bad.

612
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,450
Give 'em a whoop-ass
they ain't gonna never forget.

613
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,150
If we straight-up fight them,

614
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,490
there's as many of them
as there is us-- more even.

615
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,358
So what you saying?
You scared?

616
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,488
Nah, I'm just saying.

617
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,431
If we're gonna hurt them,
we need to think on it.

618
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,594
Do something go past
beating on each other.

619
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,933
You talking guns and shit.

620
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,802
Nah, I ain't talking guns.

621
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,735
What?

622
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,474
Aw, shit.

623
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,379
Randy got an idea.

624
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,685
Hey, Norman.

625
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,813
You know what I had
for dinner last night?

626
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,847
Tuna sub.
I ate in the car.

627
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,688
When I'm finished
writing my memoirs,

628
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,284
that shit'll be in there,
no doubt.

629
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,592
You see what I just ate?
In the car?

630
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,461
A fucking tuna sub.

631
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,694
In order to prevent distemper,
Norman,

632
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,634
you must vary
the candidate's menu.

633
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,034
If you're done chewing,

634
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,631
Iet's give these new
radio spots a listen.

635
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,278
We've seen what Tommy Carcetti
can do at City Hall

636
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,644
as a councilman.

637
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,478
While the current administration
bent to special interests,

638
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,984
Tommy Carcetti
sponsored legislation...

639
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,748
- What?
-...that is protecting jobs at the fort

640
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,085
by preventing the overdevelopment
of our waterfront.

641
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,489
300,000. Great.

642
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,618
Thanks for sharing.

643
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,295
...that prevented budget cuts
to vital city services...

644
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,492
Three and five zeroes--
mayor's latest TV buy,

645
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,126
and it's four weeks out.

646
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,603
- Turn that shit off!
- You don't like the spots?

647
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,266
I read the copy before the studio mix.
I think they're strong.

648
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,241
They're bullshit!
Weak bullshit!

649
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,107
I wouldn't vote for me.

650
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,044
Fuck!

651
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,910
Fuck Royce!
Fuck Tony Gray!

652
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,779
Fuck me!

653
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,776
Where am I going again?

654
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,913
One of those neighborhoods
between Oliver and Middle East.

655
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,255
Middle East. Now, that's
a good name for it-- fucking Fallujah.

656
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,955
Command performance.
Ms. Victorina Simmons.

657
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,020
She holds sway over
two big vote precincts,

658
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,998
no matter who the EDC
is lying down with--

659
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,434
Fucking Royce!
300,000 like it's fucking water.

660
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,437
Then there's also
the Reverend Garnett.

661
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,302
What are they complaining
about today?

662
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,501
Fucking shithole of a city.
Whining bastards,

663
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,205
bitching about the trash
or the crime or this or that.

664
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,271
It's my fucking fault
it went to shit.

665
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,543
These motherfuckers.

666
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,381
- Boss.
- They can bite my bloody ass.

667
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,953
Ms. Simmons.

668
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,725
Reverend Garnett.
Good to see you again.

669
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,229
I had a meeting going on,

670
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,630
but I'm here now, and I know
there's things to see.

671
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,497
We called
and called downtown,

672
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,298
and ain't nothing gets done.

673
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,463
Okay. Show me.

674
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,096
Right this way,
Councilman.

675
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,902
The first thing I want you
to take a look at...

676
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,941
See, you've got to drink a lot.

677
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,779
Think about
the water running.

678
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,284
And that way,
you know--

679
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,752
How the fuck you know what
water running be like, Duke?

680
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,278
Water been off in your house
since last year.

681
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,918
- Man, that's cold.
- Yeah, that's cold, Nay.

682
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,655
Oh, shit.
I'm ready.

683
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,607
Can't go with
niggers watching, yo.

684
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,553
When we call,

685
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,116
he'll send somebody,
most of the time,

686
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,618
and they write it all down
just like he doing now.

687
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,292
But nothing ever gets done.

688
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,166
Come here, Councilman,
I want you to see this.

689
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,999
Now, see them drug boys?

690
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,801
They block
the alleys like this

691
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,466
so the police won't
chase them down there.

692
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,100
- All this trash.
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,304
Rats everywhere.
Houses vacant.

694
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,678
We keep trying to get them
down here and clean this up.

695
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,343
I guess that's
too much like right.

696
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,717
Well, truth is,
Royce won't let the city agencies

697
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,052
take any of
my constituent calls.

698
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,956
But let me see
what I can do.

699
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,759
Come on, let me show you this
down here. Come on.

700
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,233
Yo.

701
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,737
Y'all Terrace niggas know that boy
who go by the name "Deez"?

702
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,906
- Deez?
- Yeah, Deez nuts.

703
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,041
- Aw, fuck.
- Shit.

704
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,915
Yo yo, come on,
come on, come on.

705
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,688
Yeah, come on, get him!

706
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,673
Damn! I knew those bitches
was gonna set us up.

707
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,741
Yeah, fucking say it, bitches.

708
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,582
Don't ever disrespect Terrace.

709
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,614
Damn!

710
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,216
- I fucking pissed myself.
- Fuck!

711
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,331
Over here!

712
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,170
Kick him right behind.

713
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,272
Randy!

714
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,175
This way.

715
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,551
Hey yo,
he went in there!

716
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,460
Remember that phrasing
is a cornerstone

717
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,865
in communicating
with your students.

718
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,996
This applies not only
to the questions you ask

719
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,336
or their comprehension
of the lesson,

720
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,775
but how they perceive
you as an educator.

721
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,438
And where does that begin?

722
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,710
Out loud
and enthusiastically.

723
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,311
I.A.L.A.C.

724
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,754
Let's go.
Once again.

725
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,420
I.A.L.A.C.

726
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,124
And what are we
telling ourselves?

727
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:12,033
I am lovable and capable.

728
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,401
Now I see
those smiling faces.

729
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,100
...where the listing
on the lower half of the page

730
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,440
indicates some typical
soft-target locations.

731
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,107
An officer alert to the terrorist threat
must ask himself,

732
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,639
"Do I know the location
of my soft targets,

733
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,814
those where large numbers
of civilians congregate?"

734
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:35,815
--Train terminals,
office buildings, stadiums.

735
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,489
Another hot zone in the classroom
is the pencil sharpener,

736
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,623
where children tend
to congregate and--

737
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,293
I had a pencil sharpener
in my class once.

738
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,964
Antoine Granderson ripped it
from the wall and threw it at me.

739
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,200
I'd like to know what
your lesson plan suggests

740
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,641
when Harold Hounchell sends
a full set of textbooks

741
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,668
through a closed window.
Thank you.

742
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,748
Settle down, everybody.

743
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,947
And for emergency procedures

744
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,719
in the event of
biochemical agents,

745
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,124
you can refer
to Appendix B.

746
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,128
No disrespect
to your appendix,

747
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,426
but if them terrorists
do fuck up the Western,

748
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,127
could anybody even tell?

749
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,226
Some Al-Qaedas were up
on Baltimore Street

750
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,238
planning on blowing up
the chicken joint.

751
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,399
But Apex's crew jacked them up,
took their camels and robes,

752
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,600
buried their ass
in Leakin Park.

753
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,542
At least
that's what I heard.

754
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,740
Hey, y'all want some real terrorists?
You go up on Pencey and Gold.

755
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,141
Hey, guys,
let's maintain our--

756
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,548
You're doing
one heck of a job.

757
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,056
Not another fucking word.

758
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,184
Thank you.

759
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,627
Ahem. So...

760
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,960
Mmm.

761
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,495
You beast.

762
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,661
I can't help it.
You stirred my manhood.

763
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,466
Little Boy Blue.

764
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,405
What the fuck
are you doing here?

765
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,702
I caught one.

766
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,801
Got a street dealer
who goes by the name of Lex.

767
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,175
Lester heard it
on the wire.

768
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,804
Lester's up on the wire:

769
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,338
Shit, boy, you are
out of the loop.

770
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,510
You know this mutt?
Goes by Lex?

771
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,816
He is familiar.

772
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,187
You know who
you should ask? Carver.

773
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,660
- Naw...
- He'd love the job, man.

774
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,289
All right.
Carver it is.

775
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,231
I still feel the need
to pull your coat.

776
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,225
- For what?
- The taste, Jimmy. The taste.

777
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,501
How about you and me hit
a few of our favorite spots?

778
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,475
You know, me on the Glenlivet,
you on the Jamey?

779
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,500
Go see if that train
is still on the track.

780
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,105
Why don't you come round
some night for dinner?

781
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,412
Say hey to Beadie
and the ankle-biters.

782
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,611
Dinner:

783
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,881
...Iocated
in high-rise structures,

784
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,947
as well as residences

785
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,925
are detailed alongside...

786
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,187
Thanks, Santy.

787
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,396
This horseshit?
You serious?

788
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,524
Back to school
for the kids.

789
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,301
Hey. Yo, Namond,
I'll pay you back.

790
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,973
You ain't never
gonna have no money.

791
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,510
Yo, Michael,
they got you?

792
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,952
Ain't nothing
but a scuffle, man.

793
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,853
Everybody made it back,
though, right?

794
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,825
Naw, man, he had to the boss
to get some stitches.

795
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,088
He got hit with a brick.

796
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,527
I see you changed
clothes already.

797
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,359
He had to.
Yo, he was stinking.

798
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,492
Yo, Randy, man, that was
the stupidest thing you ever thought of.

799
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,729
But it was kind of funny
when it happened, though.

800
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,397
You know what I'm saying?

801
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,235
Yo, you want something
before he bounce?

802
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,801
I'm buying.

803
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,710
One for every soldier
that stood tall.

804
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,375
- I was down there.
- Yeah, fuck you, Duke.

805
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,952
So you get out
all right?

806
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,897
Yeah. Hurt my ankle going
around the corner, but--

807
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,331
But you got away, then?

808
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,402
The lieutenant governor
is up in arms

809
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,004
because two Democratic
National Committees...

810
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,104
I know we're way late--

811
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,240
Ain't no thing.
You did good here.

812
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,410
Turn that bullshit off.

813
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,853
You really think they're gonna
vote for the white guy?

814
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,092
Black folk been voting white
for a long time.

815
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,795
You come correct,
we listen.

816
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,430
It's y'all that don't ever
vote black.

817
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,406
Shit, you got
my vote, anyway.

818
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,566
I don't have your vote,
Norman?

819
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,943
You're my deputy
campaign manager,

820
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,415
and I don't have your vote?

821
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,977
Last white man I could vote
for was Bobby Kennedy,

822
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,989
and you ain't no Bobby K.

823
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,547
I thought you just said--

824
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,652
I was speaking in general about
the kindly nature of black folks.

825
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,596
In particular,
I ain't all that kindly.

826
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,792
So you're gonna take
my fucking check

827
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,630
and run with
my fucking campaign--

828
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,499
Well, I do know
who pays me.

829
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,903
Yes, sir!
Oh yes, sir, boss!

830
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,966
Who are you gonna vote for?
Royce? Tony Gray?

831
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,468
One of them brothers.

832
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,180
Yeah yeah yeah.

833
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,792
Don't make me
tell you again.

834
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,593
It's 9:00 sharp, boy.

835
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,533
And I'm smelling
what has to be urine.

836
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,230
What you been at, boy?

837
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,866
Well, we were playing
with Dukie today.

838
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,376
You know how he be
with his clothes and all.

839
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,039
Well, it's good that child
has friends, I suppose.

840
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,605
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get in there.

841
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,446
Come on, now,
give me a break--

842
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,852
Come on, Dougie.
I know it's late,

843
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,446
but I got to come
backdoor like this,

844
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,718
or the agencies
won't do shit.

845
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,123
You know that
as well as I do.

846
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,251
Come on, Tommy...

847
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,489
Come on, Tommy.
Hustle.

848
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,962
This is ridiculous.
Come on, give me a break--

849
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,430
Look, Dougie. Yeah.

850
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,558
I'm sorry to bug you at home,
but this asshole Royce

851
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,296
won't handle a thing
out of my office,

852
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,065
and I need a couple
of alleys cleaned.

853
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,902
Yeah. 1200 block of
Federal Street, both sides;

854
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,602
and then Chester
and Collington

855
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,372
- run in either direction off that.
- Jesus, Tommy.

856
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,380
I know, you're gonna be out
there again in a couple days.

857
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,438
Can you call Frankie
in Special Services

858
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,846
and have him send
a cold patch truck?

859
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,510
Federal street's
a fucking tank trap.

860
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:35,540
Yeah yeah yeah.

861
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,520
Great. Thanks.
Love to Denise.

862
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,613
Hustle up, Tom.

863
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,214
How you doing?
Good evening.

864
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,384
Hi.

865
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,189
You're over
two hours late, Tommy.

866
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,890
You ain't gonna win
disrespecting your base.

867
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,261
Hold up, Tony.

868
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,397
Look, man.
We got to talk.

869
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,902
I feel the bad about the way
things have turned out,

870
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,631
but right or wrong,
if you're elected,

871
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,662
then I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help you,

872
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,574
and if I get in,
I'm gonna need your help.

873
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,875
I mean, it's not
personal, Tony.

874
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,881
Fuck you, Tommy.

875
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,111
So this is me?

876
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,278
This is you.

877
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,931
Pandemic!

878
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,963
Pandemic! Got that
pandemic right here!

879
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,580
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

880
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,106
I got all this from the Koreans
today at a discount.

881
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,779
When school start, I'll be selling it
for three times that.

882
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,685
Tell you what,

883
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,314
Iet me get them Skittles.

884
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,233
Naw. Do me a favor
for the rest.

885
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,758
Go up the block
and tell Lex

886
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,600
there's a girl
that want to see him

887
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,333
- at the playground behind Fort.
- Girl?

888
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,467
Tell him Patrice say he should come
to the playground after 8:00.

889
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,737
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

890
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,438
Look, dog,
I don't want to be taking

891
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,674
none of Bodie's shit today
about cutting work.

892
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,683
All right?
Just do me that favor.

893
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,618
Pandemic!

894
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,053
Pandemic right here!

895
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,286
For a skinny motherfucker,
he sure do sweat some.

896
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,952
We got to keep
an extra change in the car

897
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,326
so we don't have to come home
in the middle of the day.

898
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,695
Well, we're way past
late now, so...

899
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,995
- Damn it!
- Here, let me.

900
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,069
Hey, Norman.

901
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,769
Maybe I'll go to clip-on
for a while.

902
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,800
Hey, Terri got in
new polling data.

903
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,574
Did you get a bump?

904
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,706
She won't show me anything
till it's all broke down,

905
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,081
but, yeah, I deserve
a bump, don't l?

906
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,252
Four more weeks, Jen.

907
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,661
Quality time
with the wife and kids.

908
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,298
That's what,
four minutes?

909
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,241
More like six.

910
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,800
Six.

911
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,471
Shit, I could have got laid.

912
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,170
Yo. Yo, Chris, l--
I didn't--

913
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,677
Yeah. It's good.

914
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,214
Pandemic!

915
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,052
Pandemic right here!

916
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,958
No Lex.
Where's that skinny mope?

917
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,517
He was here earlier.

918
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,859
Well, fuck it.
We'll come back,

919
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,659
Jack him tomorrow,
no problem.

920
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:42,824
All right.

921
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,543
Share the sodas, too.

922
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,851
- What's up? What's up?
- Hey.

923
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,589
What's up?

924
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,390
Let me holla at you
real quick.

925
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,657
What up?

926
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,693
- You did like I said?
- Yeah.

927
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,326
Yeah, you must have,

928
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,893
because the nigga
went up the block.

929
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,666
He ain't never
coming back down.

930
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:26,403
Chris and Snoop-- pow!

931
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,432
What?

932
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,607
Look. Just be cool,
all right?

933
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,082
Our heroes
back from the wars.

934
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,951
Those poll numbers
tallied up yet?

935
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,581
Not too bad, either.

936
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,718
Royce, 35;
you, 26; Gray, 20.

937
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,058
19% undecided.

938
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,122
We're fucked if we haven't moved
any more than that. I need to be at 30,

939
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,430
and I need Tony taking
25 of his points.

940
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,197
Royce's negatives
are way up.

941
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:56,637
Like what, 34% unfavorable
to 43% favorable?

942
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,662
He's vulnerable.

943
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,572
Geri, understand this.

944
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,338
In order to win,
I need Tony Gray

945
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,744
to take a huge bite
out of Royce's lead-- huge.

946
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,145
Tony's moved, what?

947
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,843
Two points
in the last month:

948
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:10,341
That poll says one in five voters
hasn't decided anything yet.

949
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,618
Yeah. The first batch of radio spots
worked magic, didn't they?

950
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,352
How much money
we piss away on those?

951
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:18,122
Look at these First District figures.
I mean, that's my base,

952
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,597
and I'm polling 37%
with 24% undecided?

953
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:22,962
Fuck me! I'm done!

954
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,796
Tommy, nobody's focused
on this race yet.

955
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,131
We're gonna own
the First.

956
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,932
Christ, look at what Royce
is polling in the Fourth.

957
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,565
No doubt, Tony's got to get
some traction in West Baltimore.

958
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,939
Yeah, he needs
to be rounding 25%

959
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,809
and headed for 30.
And, by the way,

960
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,611
who can tell me when the fuck did
the Sixth District become 64% black?

961
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,083
About five years ago
in the last redistricting,

962
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,107
mostly as I recall,

963
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,586
to give your ass
more white votes

964
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,350
over there in the First.

965
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,687
What the fuck
was I thinking?

966
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,559
A hell of a lot can happen
between now and election day.

967
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,030
I've been ahead further
than Royce is and lost.

968
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,003
I can't win this.

969
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,207
Tommy, where the fuck
you going?

970
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,210
I'm your ride home, man.

971
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,614
The man can
read a poll.

972
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,121
You been drinking?

973
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,625
I'm fine.

974
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,457
Well, you need to be fine
somewhere else.

975
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,985
Park curfew
is midnight.

976
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,554
City's averaging
a murder a day,

977
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:39,056
and here you are with
Rec and Park rules?

978
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,399
What are you,
a smart ass?

979
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,565
Sorry.
I didn't mean nothing.

980
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,141
Don't I know you?

981
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,343
I'm running for mayor.

982
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,819
Tommy Carcetti,
First District.

983
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,549
I'll be coming back through
in about 20, Councilman.

984
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,023
Do me a favor
and take it down the road.

985
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,146
Randy?

986
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,984
Yes, ma'am.
