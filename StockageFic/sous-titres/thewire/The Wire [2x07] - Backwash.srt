1
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,044
Something in particular?

2
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,213
-Funeral.
-I'm sorry.

3
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:27,790
No, funeral, you know?

4
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,985
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

5
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:31,425
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,494
That's a popular one.

7
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:42,164
-Who was it that passed, a relation?
-No, we worked together.

8
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:47,108
-I see. A professional relationship.
-Yeah, professional.

9
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:52,008
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

10
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:56,180
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

11
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,125
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,528
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

13
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:11,931
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

14
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:15,130
-Pink?
-Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

15
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,036
No, he wasn't all that.

16
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,668
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

17
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,712
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

18
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:25,213
True that. How did your boy fall?

19
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,514
Hung himself.

20
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,987
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,752
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

22
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,993
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

23
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:43,066
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

24
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:47,194
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

25
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:54,971
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

26
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,173
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

27
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,876
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

28
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:04,113
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

29
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,779
Hell, yeah.

30
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:09,750
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

31
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:13,124
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,064
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

33
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:19,660
Like what?

34
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,568
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

35
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:25,733
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

36
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:30,837
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just....

37
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:38,543
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

38
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,124
All right. Thanks.

39
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,660
-You cloned a what?
-A computer.

40
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:29,857
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

41
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,095
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

42
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,036
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

43
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:41,703
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

44
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:45,475
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

45
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:48,983
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

46
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:51,418
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

47
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:54,116
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

48
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:58,058
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

49
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,760
-Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:07,302
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

51
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:11,272
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

52
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,478
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

53
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,054
I don't know.

54
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,250
What's next?

55
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:32,226
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

56
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,821
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

57
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,401
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

58
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,333
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

59
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:42,632
How are they gonna think that?

60
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,699
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

61
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,902
It ain't.

62
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,708
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

63
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:55,512
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

64
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,951
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

65
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:01,388
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

66
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,291
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

67
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,623
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

68
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:10,063
Hey, Frog.

69
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,833
Come here.

70
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,272
No, seriously. Come here.

71
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,214
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

72
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,476
without hurting you deeply...

73
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:31,782
first of all, you happen to be white.

74
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,383
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

75
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:38,120
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

76
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:41,629
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

77
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:44,400
Second, I'm also white.

78
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:49,099
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...

79
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:52,698
but Locust-Point-l.B.S.-Local-47 white.

80
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:56,007
I don't work without no fucking contract...

81
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:59,276
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

82
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:02,284
Iike my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

83
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:06,789
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

84
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:12,126
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

85
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,720
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

86
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,834
you can work my package.

87
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:23,270
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

88
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,708
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

89
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,578
All right.

90
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:39,447
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

91
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:42,286
-Keep it real.
-Whatever.

92
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:30,097
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yeah, you on it.

93
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:35,876
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

94
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,274
Seems so.

95
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,846
My cousin always works clean.

96
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,653
None of my business, I know...

97
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:50,688
but did your man Avon even know about it?

98
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,900
You're on your own here?

99
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,300
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

100
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,538
And if I were you...

101
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,310
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

102
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:18,180
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

103
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,189
All y'all.

104
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:32,928
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

105
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:41,902
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

106
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:46,413
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

107
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,282
Man, fuck him.

108
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:54,913
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

109
00:09:55,192 --> 00:10:00,027
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

110
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,464
He knew that.

111
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,831
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

112
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:12,335
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

113
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,506
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

114
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,604
I tried to bring him up, bring him along--

115
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:22,048
-You were real good to him.
-I was.

116
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,821
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

117
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:30,754
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

118
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:34,353
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

119
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:37,365
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

120
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,328
I'm just saying...

121
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:43,036
it might've been for the best, you know?

122
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:54,209
His name is Head. Dick Head.

123
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:01,453
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

124
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:05,121
-Nice.
-Nice, right?

125
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,362
-Fellows.
-We need a bug.

126
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:10,763
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

127
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,994
of the modern urban crime environment.

128
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,661
Let me show you.

129
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:23,104
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

130
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,772
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

131
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:30,444
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

132
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:33,284
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

133
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,324
-How much?
-$1,500.

134
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:41,729
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

135
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,067
-You in?
-Am I in?

136
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,535
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

137
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,669
Can we give it a test run?

138
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:56,007
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

139
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:59,638
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

140
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,274
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

141
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,979
-Let me consult my partner.
-Of course.

142
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:08,621
You got a credit card?

143
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,654
-Don't you?
-It's maxed to the max, man.

144
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:14,624
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

145
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,461
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

146
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:22,300
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

147
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,436
I gave your man some room, that's all.

148
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,376
You gave him a home.

149
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,411
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

150
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,945
-No.
-Yes.

151
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,089
You could take these 14 homicides...

152
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,821
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

153
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,490
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

154
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:53,126
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

155
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:57,671
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

156
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:00,704
It's win-win for me.

157
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:05,140
-No.
-Come on, Lieutenant.

158
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,773
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

159
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:11,911
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

160
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:14,820
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

161
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:17,449
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

162
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,419
Sorry, Colonel.

163
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,692
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

164
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:37,176
Smarter than he looks.

165
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:56,354
-Where's your friend?
-Who's that?

166
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:01,163
-The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
-Case is done, for all I know.

167
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:03,630
Yeah?

168
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,899
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

169
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,802
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

170
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:14,941
-So you back to the usual then?
-Yeah, the usual.

171
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:19,019
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

172
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,222
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

173
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,485
Fairfield?

174
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,653
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

175
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,924
Because of terrorism, I guess.

176
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,825
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

177
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:35,427
You need to be uptown here with us.

178
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,550
You got stripes in the Southeast...

179
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:56,056
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

180
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,491
Man, I've never seen that thing.

181
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,625
-Snug.
-As a bug.

182
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,765
In a rug.

183
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:08,231
Let's go.

184
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,546
-This shit is hypnotic.
-Boring, too.

185
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,385
You make a show of it?

186
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:26,478
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

187
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:30,725
Is that the Valparaiso?

188
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:35,231
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

189
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,765
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

190
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,496
-Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
-Nothing's wasted.

191
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:45,768
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

192
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,742
-So when they lose a can--
-I see it go.

193
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,974
Gentlemen. Ladies.

194
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,188
The future is now.

195
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,457
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

196
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,461
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

197
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:11,227
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

198
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,928
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

199
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:18,133
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

200
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:21,768
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

201
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,813
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

202
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:29,248
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

203
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,282
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

204
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:36,916
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

205
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:40,186
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

206
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,025
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

207
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,192
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

208
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,793
It's like you in a store working the register...

209
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,066
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.

210
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:54,200
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

211
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,801
and I want to have the package
right for once.

212
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,645
Hey, Carver.

213
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,183
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

214
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,817
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

215
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,221
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

216
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:12,419
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part--

217
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:15,463
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

218
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:19,729
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

219
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,600
Ieaving Singapore a distant second.

220
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,765
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

221
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,038
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

222
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,745
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

223
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:35,784
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

224
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:38,115
-That's right.
-That's efficiency, Nat.

225
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:40,621
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

226
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,123
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

227
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:47,128
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

228
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,824
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

229
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,991
Question? Yes?

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
The GPS readings, are they exact....

231
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:55,696
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

232
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:58,899
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

233
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,202
Coming.

234
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,881
-Hey, Jackie.
-String. You, too?

235
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,347
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

236
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,210
How's Brianna? ls she back there?

237
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,021
What's up, little man?

238
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:23,292
How you holding up?

239
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,469
Bri.

240
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,564
-Nicky boy, you get days this week?
-No.

241
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:37,466
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

242
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:49,648
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

243
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,150
It's all there, cuz.

244
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,790
-What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
-Nothing.

245
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,794
What did Frog say?

246
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:08,769
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

247
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,198
The packages were my thing, Nick.

248
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,742
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

249
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,471
Zig, we're making money.

250
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,654
It's your move, Nicky.

251
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,629
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

252
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,568
Paternity?

253
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:49,467
Priscilla Katlow.

254
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:55,544
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

255
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:58,052
I only fucked her once.

256
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,788
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

257
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,419
How do you know it's yours?

258
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,027
You call this lawyer?

259
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:11,992
Figured I'd get drunk first.

260
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,298
That's a good plan.

261
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:43,192
-Russians?
-Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

262
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,435
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

263
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,167
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

264
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,640
You got the club people, I guess.

265
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:56,405
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

266
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:58,036
She looks a little bit older.

267
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:00,581
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

268
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,412
She looks about 40.

269
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,918
Grab any ass, Prez?

270
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,990
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

271
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,124
-I have.
-For us?

272
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:25,434
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

273
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,266
But once Burrell reached out--

274
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:32,109
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

275
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:36,448
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

276
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:42,015
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

277
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:45,457
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

278
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,325
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

279
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,996
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

280
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:56,965
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

281
00:22:57,073 --> 00:23:00,167
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

282
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,274
If I'm looking out for number one...

283
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,869
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

284
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:08,144
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

285
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:12,347
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

286
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,117
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

287
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:22,561
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

288
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:24,792
but now, you're asking too much.

289
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,265
One more year, Nat.

290
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:29,566
-Not for me, for the fucking union.
-The election's been scheduled.

291
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,072
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

292
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:34,734
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

293
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:37,836
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

294
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,744
It's our turn, Frank.

295
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,043
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

296
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:46,781
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

297
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,823
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

298
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:51,791
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

299
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:55,455
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

300
00:23:56,098 --> 00:24:00,034
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

301
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:02,794
Think about it.

302
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,209
-Hello?
-Brucie, baby.

303
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:22,087
-Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
-You talk to the presiding officers yet?

304
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:36,837
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

305
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,578
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

306
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:49,974
-When did you get served with these?
-I got them in the mail this morning.

307
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,514
-In the mail?
-Yeah, this morning.

308
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,454
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

309
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:03,362
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

310
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:23,714
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

311
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:29,051
-Who are you calling?
-The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

312
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:33,727
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

313
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,030
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

314
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:02,582
-He got you, Zig.
-Who got me?

315
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,058
Maui?

316
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:12,967
Love child, never meant to be

317
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:17,566
Love child, born in poverty

318
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:21,775
Love child, never meant to be

319
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:04,017
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

320
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,610
I just don't have the authorization.

321
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,149
Okay.

322
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,324
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

323
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,153
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

324
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,495
Sorry. Wrong building.

325
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,032
Sixth floor, all of them.

326
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,177
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

327
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:38,947
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

328
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:42,182
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

329
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,385
-So we're on.
-We're gonna need help with surveillance.

330
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:48,520
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

331
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:52,331
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

332
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,629
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

333
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:59,597
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

334
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,573
the happier he'll feel.

335
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,147
New truck?

336
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:13,020
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

337
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:14,953
-Hell, yeah.
-For real.

338
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:18,754
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

339
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:22,827
-You got more for me?
-I got ifyou got for me, right?

340
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:27,426
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

341
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,337
Fuck!

342
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,302
I'm with you on this, man....

343
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,440
All right, dawg.

344
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:03,894
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

345
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,837
Keep it fucking moving.

346
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,374
Jesus Christ!

347
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:16,549
No!

348
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:32,175
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

349
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:35,269
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

350
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,678
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

351
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:42,377
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

352
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,977
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

353
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:49,115
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

354
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:52,992
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

355
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:56,463
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

356
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,330
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

357
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:02,462
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

358
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:07,441
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

359
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:10,541
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

360
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:24,357
-Nothing's alive in these, right?
-If they don't go hot to a truck...

361
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:27,487
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

362
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:29,827
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

363
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:34,762
-How you hanging?
-Good. I'm good.

364
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:37,498
You ain't been working much.

365
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:43,637
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

366
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:53,580
Jesus on the main line

367
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,386
Tell him what you want

368
00:30:56,493 --> 00:31:00,554
Oh, Jesus on the main line

369
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:03,732
Tell him what you want

370
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:07,333
Jesus on the main line

371
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:10,406
Tell him what you want

372
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:15,542
Call him up and tell him what you want

373
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:18,808
Ifyou want salvation

374
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:21,509
Tell him what you want

375
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:25,611
Oh, ifyou want salvation

376
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,850
Tell him what you want

377
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:32,258
Ifyou want salvation

378
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:35,388
Tell him what you want

379
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:40,061
Call him up and tell him what you want

380
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,363
Oh, call him up, call him up

381
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,940
Tell him what you want

382
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:51,036
Oh, call him up, call him up

383
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:54,242
Tell him what you want

384
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:57,716
Call him up, call him up

385
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,790
Tell him what you want

386
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:05,960
Jesus on the main line

387
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,596
You did the 221?

388
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:17,996
Shit look tight.

389
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,529
Sorry for the loss.

390
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,928
You all sent him off right, though.

391
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,473
As good a homecoming as I been to.

392
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:54,738
-You been to your share, man, I know.
-No doubt.

393
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:58,906
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

394
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:01,984
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

395
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:06,482
-Got a proposition here.
-Go ahead to the car, man.

396
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:13,930
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

397
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,794
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

398
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,735
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

399
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:26,341
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

400
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:30,038
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

401
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:33,638
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

402
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,446
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

403
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:41,384
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

404
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:45,485
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

405
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:49,258
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

406
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:52,426
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

407
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:55,972
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

408
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:59,303
-You connected?
-This shit is straight off the damn boat.

409
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:03,175
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

410
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,013
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

411
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:12,553
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

412
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,681
so you see where this thing needs to go.

413
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,022
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

414
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:21,757
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean--

415
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:26,029
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

416
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:29,936
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

417
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,133
Later for all that bullshit.

418
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,013
-I'll talk to Avon.
-You do that.

419
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,861
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

420
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:04,702
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

421
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:08,073
-But the grain pier is still in there.
-And the rest is just talk?

422
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:11,238
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

423
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:13,908
Talk is your fucking job description.

424
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,644
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

425
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:20,389
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

426
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,954
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

427
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,799
-Jason's at Princeton.
-Princeton.

428
00:35:31,668 --> 00:35:34,466
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

429
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,463
-Whatever he wants.
-Right.

430
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:41,904
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

431
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:49,051
You know, back when we were kids...

432
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:54,216
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

433
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:57,885
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

434
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,728
-Tang?
-Just invented.

435
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,693
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

436
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:09,067
-You drink it....
-You could be an astronaut, too.

437
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:12,674
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

438
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:15,267
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

439
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:18,643
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

440
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:21,308
What do you think they grew up to be?

441
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:25,749
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

442
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,915
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

443
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:32,824
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

444
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,387
You're out of line, Frank.

445
00:36:39,703 --> 00:36:42,570
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

446
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:46,171
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

447
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,870
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

448
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:51,776
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

449
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:54,349
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

450
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,113
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

451
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,085
You're talking history, right?

452
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:03,452
I'm talking now.

453
00:37:04,094 --> 00:37:07,655
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

454
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,891
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

455
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:13,400
But after the horror movie I've seen today....
Robots!

456
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:16,567
Piers full of robots!

457
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,407
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

458
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,708
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

459
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:29,478
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

460
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:39,222
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

461
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:52,471
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

462
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:56,170
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

463
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:04,813
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

464
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:08,084
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

465
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:11,058
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

466
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,391
and we get some ships in here.

467
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:37,719
Bring it down!

468
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:10,008
-Got one that disappeared.
-Get the container number?

469
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,146
-1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
-Go ahead, Lester.

470
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:17,283
-We got one, you prepared to copy?
-Send it.

471
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,595
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

472
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:24,895
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

473
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:27,960
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

474
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:30,638
-1 1-99.
-11-99.

475
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:33,475
We got a live one. Be up.

476
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:36,170
-What am I looking for?
-Stand by on that.

477
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,544
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

478
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:41,116
blue overalls.

479
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:45,745
He's hooking the truck onto the....
What do you call it?

480
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,115
Copy that. What next?

481
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:52,758
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

482
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:56,491
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

483
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,296
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

484
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:03,934
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

485
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:06,466
1 1-37 to 1 2-14.

486
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:09,841
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

487
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:13,143
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

488
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,307
Copy.

489
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:24,589
1 2-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

490
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:29,562
-11-37 to 11-99.
-99.

491
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,531
Target's coming at you, you see it?

492
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,836
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

493
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:42,143
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

494
00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:45,544
-Target approaching your 20.
-1 1-34, copy that.

495
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,541
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

496
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,290
-He's all yours, Bunk.
-Copy.

497
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:12,971
-1 1-34, you got the eyeball.
-Copy.

498
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,326
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 34.

499
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:45,365
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

500
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,537
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

501
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,752
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

502
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:04,657
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.

503
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,327
Copy that.

504
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,871
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

505
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,905
Avon, you knew he was using?

506
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:29,349
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

507
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,054
I mean, he came up off that shit...

508
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:36,592
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought....

509
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:44,596
Fuck.

510
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:50,536
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

511
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:53,275
-Yeah?
-Yeah, everybody showed.

512
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,879
-How did Brianna do?
-Rough.

513
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:04,546
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

514
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:07,646
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

515
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:10,817
-you know what I mean?
-What are the prison people saying?

516
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,418
That he just hung himself like that?

517
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:19,264
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

518
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:31,810
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

519
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,882
What are you gonna do?

520
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:38,476
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

521
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:41,250
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

522
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,517
It ain't on you.

523
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:50,128
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

524
00:44:10,953 --> 00:44:13,478
What's up with that other thing, man?

525
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:17,548
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

526
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:22,264
-We gonna discount it.
-Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

527
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:25,425
-I'm saying, I mean--
-What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

528
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:27,730
Re-package it and sell it off.

529
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:31,170
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

530
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:35,068
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

531
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:38,841
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

532
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:43,016
-You know, it's a thought--
-It's not even a thought, man. No.

533
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,850
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

534
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:49,117
-I know.
-All of it.

535
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,395
Anything come out?

536
00:45:00,503 --> 00:45:04,633
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

537
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:15,282
-Your DNRs go where?
-Phones for dockworkers local.

538
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:18,410
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

539
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:23,254
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

540
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,255
On February 4th, and March 16th...

541
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:29,820
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.

542
00:45:29,932 --> 00:45:32,958
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

543
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:35,663
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

544
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:37,966
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

545
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,736
-Conspiracy to do what?
-Smuggle shit.

546
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:43,404
Smuggle what?

547
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:46,970
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

548
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:50,917
-That one we know about.
-You need to do better for a wiretap.

549
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:58,927
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

550
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:02,429
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

551
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:05,523
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

552
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:09,568
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

553
00:46:09,672 --> 00:46:11,902
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

554
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:13,498
That's the law.

555
00:46:14,977 --> 00:46:17,036
Honey, I'm home.

556
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,818
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

557
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:29,390
-We can pay.
-How?

558
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,085
-Got a new job.
-Off the docks?

559
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:40,734
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

560
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:44,868
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

561
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:48,641
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

562
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,234
How much, Nick?

563
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:54,540
Come here.

564
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:04,625
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

565
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:09,928
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

566
00:47:10,866 --> 00:47:13,334
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

567
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:16,496
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

568
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:20,132
for someplace nice out in the county.

569
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:31,381
$1,500.

570
00:47:32,722 --> 00:47:35,122
$1,250, with the police discount.

571
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:40,217
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

572
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:44,829
All right, slow up. This is it.

573
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:49,268
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

574
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:03,516
-Sobotka?
-That's what it says here.

575
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:07,278
That mean anything to you?

576
00:48:09,825 --> 00:48:13,352
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

577
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:14,952
Frank Sobotka.

578
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,156
But we got Nicholas.

579
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:22,533
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

580
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,938
-You know what this means?
-What?

581
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:30,742
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

582
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:34,373
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

583
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:37,452
-No fucking way.
-Are you out $1,250?

584
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,353
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

585
00:48:41,457 --> 00:48:43,789
has to be worth $200 for starters.

586
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:49,355
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

587
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:53,668
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

588
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,664
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

589
00:48:59,108 --> 00:49:01,736
-Me?
-We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

590
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:05,109
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

591
00:49:05,214 --> 00:49:07,808
And Daniels listens when you talk.

592
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,817
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

593
00:49:14,623 --> 00:49:18,218
-We all got roles to play.
-What's your role?

594
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:23,327
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

595
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,600
You give yourself too much credit.

596
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,535
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

597
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:52,961
I'll be goddamned.

598
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:16,141
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

599
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:18,117
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

600
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,848
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

601
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:23,550
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

602
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:27,459
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

603
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:30,632
You think I can take him?

604
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,092
You can take him.

605
00:50:38,507 --> 00:50:41,032
-Man down, berth five.
-Who?

606
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:42,542
New Charles.

607
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:53,248
-Ambo's on the way.
-Jesus Christ.

608
00:50:53,355 --> 00:50:55,789
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

609
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:58,621
-You guys gonna move this thing or what?
-Jesus. Fuck.

610
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:00,661
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

611
00:51:00,763 --> 00:51:02,924
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

612
00:51:03,032 --> 00:51:05,227
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

613
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:06,961
One, two, three.

614
00:51:10,472 --> 00:51:12,531
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

615
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:21,281
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

616
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:23,546
Right over there.

617
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:27,855
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

618
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:33,859
Frank, how does the leg look?

619
00:51:40,202 --> 00:51:43,933
-Which leg is that now?
-Sir, can you hear my voice?

620
00:51:45,507 --> 00:51:47,065
Squeeze my hand.

621
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:51,344
Let's get him into the ambulance.

622
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:53,979
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

623
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,717
-And you followed the can?
-Right to the warehouse.

624
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,914
-Surveillance set up?
-Kima is on it tonight.

625
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:04,590
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

626
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:07,025
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

627
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:11,589
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

628
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:16,429
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

629
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:21,004
Rawls came to me.

630
00:52:21,777 --> 00:52:24,974
-Asked if I would take the homicides.
-You should.

631
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:29,980
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

632
00:52:33,188 --> 00:52:36,453
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

633
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:38,423
But you let it pass...

634
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,563
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

635
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:42,291
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

636
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:10,591
From the guys in 15-14.

637
00:53:26,475 --> 00:53:28,340
He should be all right.

638
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,210
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

639
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:37,818
First day of work was the same day...

640
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,219
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

641
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,223
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

642
00:53:44,793 --> 00:53:47,819
Ever since then, New Charles.

643
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,299
He's gonna lose the leg.

644
00:54:04,346 --> 00:54:06,246
Where's the money from?

645
00:54:20,162 --> 00:54:24,326
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

646
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:28,035
No bullshit, no arguments.

647
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:31,071
No arguments.

648
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:46,080
-You're wasting all the batteries.
-So?

649
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:48,679
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

650
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:52,420
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

651
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:54,018
-Snitch.
-Punk.

652
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:56,088
-Squirrel.
-Mope.

653
00:54:56,598 --> 00:54:59,624
-Shut up.
-Who teaches them this stuff?

654
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:02,894
It's my turn, you just had it.

655
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:06,568
Elena.

656
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:09,537
No.

657
00:55:16,618 --> 00:55:18,245
I don't trust you.

658
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,522
I can care about you...

659
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:26,961
and I can want us to be friends...

660
00:55:27,396 --> 00:55:30,092
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

661
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:33,100
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

662
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,706
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

663
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:42,100
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

664
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:45,377
It's a big, hairy one.

665
00:55:45,647 --> 00:55:47,615
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come on, Mom.

666
00:56:07,302 --> 00:56:11,864
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

667
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,233
It could still work for me.

668
00:56:14,743 --> 00:56:16,540
Listen to yourself.

669
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,211
I love the job, Marla.

670
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:24,050
-I can't help it.
-The job doesn't love you.

671
00:56:26,588 --> 00:56:28,351
You know what I love?

672
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,794
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

673
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:37,489
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

674
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,193
That's what I fell in love with first.

675
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:44,496
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

676
00:56:46,174 --> 00:56:47,766
Your ambition.

677
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:51,878
Where did that man go?
