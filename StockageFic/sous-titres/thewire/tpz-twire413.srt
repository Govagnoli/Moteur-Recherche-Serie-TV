1
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,985
All that from overnight?

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,996
All that from Freamon.
He's out early today

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,861
rooting through empties.

4
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,059
You know what he is?

5
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,501
He is a vandal.

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,437
He is vandalizing
the board.

7
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,066
He is vandalizing this unit.

8
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,303
He is a Hun,

9
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,211
a Visigoth,
a barbarian at the gate,

10
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,874
clamoring for noble
Roman blood

11
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,884
and what's left
of our clearance rate.

12
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,113
And you sit here
doing what exactly?

13
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,418
A hot shot, maybe.
I got a sack in the box,

14
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,947
says he owns one from a couple days ago.
White Coat Alley.

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,893
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

16
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,919
Is everybody on a crusade

17
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,931
to make more murders
out of bullshit?

18
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,523
The mope's
confessing, Jay.

19
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,967
He walked up to
the Western desk to do it.

20
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,461
Well, at least when you
go to manufacturing a murder, Eddie,

21
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,497
you already have
a suspect in hand.

22
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,601
I respect that part
of your game.

23
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,407
Oh, that others might learn.

24
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,439
I need a witness for the statement
in box number one.

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,246
Yeah. Let me dump
my shit.

26
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,116
I'll be there.

27
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,787
Sodium cyanide.

28
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,158
You're telling me, if we do a full
tox screen on this kid,

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,288
he comes back
positive for cyanide:

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,391
Yeah. That's what
I'm saying, okay?

31
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,459
You need to lock me up

32
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,664
because I killed that boy,
I did.

33
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,536
I did it.
I did it.

34
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,337
So just-- just lock me up

35
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,673
and be done with it,
all right?

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,201
Where'd you get the cyanide?

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,944
You getting
sick there, Bunky?

38
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,979
When's the last time
you had your medicine?

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,161
No. No, I'm not
getting high anymore, okay?

40
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,187
Let me ask you again:

41
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,097
Where'd you get cyanide from?

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,295
If you're saying--

43
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,100
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.

44
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,540
- Shit. He got my fucking sleeve.
- Just calm down.

45
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,940
We'll get something
to clean this up,

46
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,467
and maybe a soda
or something.

47
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,538
- Get some sugar in you at least.
- I'm sorry.

48
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,477
He settles down,
I'll Miranda.

49
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,510
Yeah.

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,451
Fuck.

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,728
Steals like
my ex-wife's lawyer.

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,127
Jesus.

53
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,331
Get up there.

54
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,669
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Give me a sec!

55
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,819
Call 911. The mutt in box one
just tried to hang himself.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,662
No idea on this one.

57
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,676
Two on this block
and three off Lanvale.

58
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,201
- Hmm.
- They cluster.

59
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,736
And when they found a block they liked,
they came back on it.

60
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,577
One on the next block,
across Gilmore.

61
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,950
That makes nine.

62
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,081
Scary thing is we're only
looking at one district.

63
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,719
Shit. One sector.

64
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,695
How far you think
they might have roamed?

65
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,927
There's only one way
to find out.

66
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,869
Excuse me. Daniels.

67
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,637
How we doing with Forensics?

68
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,942
That's the colonel's domain,
but my understanding is

69
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,676
that we're sending
a lab team to every house.

70
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,651
So far we're finding
9-millimeter casings.

71
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,381
Once they start scoping
at the morgues,

72
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,446
we'll probably have slugs
to go with them.

73
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,891
Tracewise, we're laser-printing
around every body

74
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,326
and vacuuming every crime scene
for hair and fiber,

75
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,296
but, of course,
these are vacants.

76
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,527
It'll take our lab a year
to sift that many bags of dirt.

77
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,766
- Is this all from one drug crew?
- Probably.

78
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,604
- Marlo Stanfield's bunch.
- Where are we on them?

79
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,270
Major Crimes was working wiretaps
until three months ago,

80
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,577
- but we came down on those.
- Can we get backup?

81
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,983
Trying, but Stanfield's people
may have changed up the pattern.

82
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,648
Well, Colonel,
whatever you need.

83
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,120
Actually,
what I need is Patrol.

84
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,787
Patrol Division:

85
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,455
That was Detective Freamon
on the phone.

86
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,397
We found two more at Lafayette
and another on Lanvale.

87
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,424
Jesus Christ.

88
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,062
Now starting at the first scene,
we've been going door to door,

89
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,937
but there's no telling
how far the shooter wandered.

90
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,941
And with 15,000 vacants
in the city,

91
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,240
it'll take my people weeks
to cover that ground.

92
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,885
He brings this case in,
he'll be closer to the throne.

93
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,186
Look, I wouldn't worry
about Daniels.

94
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,022
He's a long way
from my chair,

95
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,358
as are you.

96
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,627
You made your move
too soon.

97
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,969
- I did.
- Politics doesn't suit you.

98
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,063
Stick to operations.

99
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,974
And don't you ever
cross me like that again.

100
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,577
Get it out
to all the bulletins.

101
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,847
Leander, go downtown.

102
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,549
Run a flier
for every roll call.

103
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,991
Show them the nails
and the screws in detail. All right?

104
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,859
You grab a couple of those nails
and hit all the hardware stores.

105
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,160
Find out exactly what the model is
that we're looking for.

106
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,224
- What do you need from me?
- Herc.

107
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,361
I'm serious.
Get hold of him.

108
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,467
- How's he looking?
- Pretty good, considering.

109
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,776
No worse than before
he hung himself.

110
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,480
The fuck are you going?

111
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,147
West Side.
Freamon found another.

112
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,712
Fucking Freamon.

113
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,922
He a transport:

114
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,051
Borderline.

115
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,527
B.P. and pulse are normal.

116
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,427
We gave him Ativan
for withdrawal.

117
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,599
Hey, you want to go
to a hospital?

118
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,006
Let me ask you something:

119
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,013
What kind of a fellow
rigs up a hot shot,

120
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,675
then walks into a police station
to talk about it?

121
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,617
Huh: Who does that:

122
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,985
- You want us to wait?
- No.

123
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,224
What is in your head, fella?

124
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,063
The hot shot was
for this motherfucker

125
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,540
that has been
beating on me.

126
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,672
And the boy?

127
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,711
He was dipping.

128
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,315
I knew he was. I--

129
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:00,762
I just didn't--
I didn't think...

130
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,763
The child had no one for him--

131
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,796
no mother, no family.

132
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,669
He in the street
like I'm in the street.

133
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,442
So I tried to...

134
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,288
Like I ain't know
who I am, right?

135
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,956
Like I'm pretending I ain't been
a dope fiend my whole damn life.

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,102
Just lock me up, man.

137
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,774
'Cause I killed that child.

138
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,008
The shot wasn't for the kid.

139
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,617
Let's throw this one back.

140
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,923
This sad-ass motherfucker's carrying
more weight than we'll ever put on him.

141
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,691
What about the clearance?

142
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,722
Fuck the clearance.

143
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,666
Cut him loose?

144
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,431
Shit, he'll go off
a roof or some shit.

145
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,028
My luck, I'll catch
that call too.

146
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,700
Maybe D ward
over at Bayview,

147
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,732
something with soft walls.

148
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,276
Is you out of
your mind, nigger?

149
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,679
You think I'ma pay you twice
for the same motherfucking package?

150
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,479
Hey, I'm in
the same box here.

151
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,417
Faggot took my shit
same as he took y'all's.

152
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,444
Man, but that's
on your own people.

153
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,547
Your guys was the ones doing
security on this shit.

154
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,581
Hey, they worked it
the same as we did

155
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,354
the last dozen shipments.

156
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,124
Y'all was fine with it
up until this, right?

157
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,528
Ain't no one have
a problem with it

158
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,032
till the motherfucker
gave us one.

159
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,864
Thing is, Joe, we called
a quorum on this,

160
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,030
took a vote that says it's your people
need to make this right.

161
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,200
No no, a co-op means
share and share alike.

162
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,767
You share the good
and you share the bad.

163
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,381
All right.

164
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,116
I'll dig deep and do the full shipment
if that's what y'all need,

165
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,717
But don't even think about coming
back to me for a re-up after this,

166
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,526
'cause when that good raw shit comes
straight off the boat,

167
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,828
it's gonna be mine only,
seeing as how y'all can't find the heart

168
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,926
to stand with me now.

169
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,273
You want to quorum up again,
think it over a little?

170
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,275
Yeah, I thought you might.

171
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,318
I'll get word back that we need
a fresh shipment, and right quick,

172
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,585
and you can think about what we need
to do to improve security,

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,252
make sure it only
happens the once.

174
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,469
What's up, young'un?

175
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,242
Which one of your people
was in charge of the stash?

176
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,346
I mean, I want to talk to him.

177
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,254
My nephew.

178
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,691
My sister's boy.

179
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,785
I can't give him up
like that.

180
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,491
I can't do it.

181
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,527
My connect had people there
when the shit went down.

182
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,537
If that's what you need
to make you believe,

183
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,301
you can hear it
straight from him.

184
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,569
We are rich.

185
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,008
That's what I'm talking about.

186
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,214
Butch.

187
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,514
My man. Mmm.

188
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,320
Right, now, girl, you set that off slow,
you feel me?

189
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,421
'Cause word gonna get around.
They gonna come back on you now.

190
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,728
Nah. None of that.

191
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,825
Yo, anybody ask about me
on another job,

192
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,928
tell 'em,
"Kimmy been retired."

193
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,404
All right?

194
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,340
Be easy.

195
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,937
How much you got left after splitting
with the Mexicans?

196
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,709
26 raw.

197
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,411
Mmm. Gracious.

198
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,419
Shit, only problem, man,
I'll spend the rest of my life

199
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,978
trying to put that
out on the street.

200
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,615
I ain't no drug dealer, Butch.

201
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,216
- You feel me?
- Hmm.

202
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,750
Shit, we just stole
too much this damn time.

203
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,966
So, what am l
gonna do, Butch?

204
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,336
Well...

205
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,933
you could come give
Joe a call.

206
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,536
Offer to sell the shit
back to him now

207
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,944
for 20c on the dollar.

208
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,114
Joe would have found
some humor in that.

209
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,382
I know you do.

210
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,088
I understand there's
a waiting list.

211
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,623
The thing is this kid has already
been in a foster home.

212
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,135
Right.

213
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,628
And now his foster mother's
been hospitalized, so--

214
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,665
Right. No.

215
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,105
Is there a supervisor
that I can talk to?

216
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,207
I'm gonna be a little late for
roll call. Gotta get this kid settled.

217
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,275
What's wrong with D.S.S.?

218
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,412
On the phone with them right now.
They're talking about a group home.

219
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,979
So? Either you come up
with a guardian,

220
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,423
or he goes to Social Services.
No two ways about it.

221
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,093
Hello: Hello:

222
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,033
Need your help.
Get dressed.

223
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,510
I'm suspended with pay,
pending a full trial board.

224
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,411
Can't do nothing
for no one, Kima.

225
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,745
Fuck what they say.
This here's police work,

226
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,774
and I'm asking
if you police.

227
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,553
All right. Listen up, you mutts.
This is complicated.

228
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,185
I mean, it isn't complicated
if you went to college or,

229
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,354
I don't know, your mothers actually
stopped drinking

230
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,159
for a minute
while they was pregnant.

231
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,463
But for Baltimore City Police,
this is complicated.

232
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,905
Anyway, this right here is for
the Major Crimes homicide investigation

233
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,999
into the bodies being found
in the vacant houses here in Western.

234
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,568
Command now wants
all the districts

235
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,705
to check every vacant
in the city.

236
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,342
That means you will need to go door to
door to every vacant house in your post

237
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,579
and look at what was used
to board it up.

238
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,588
Most will have the Phillips head screws
that H.C.D. uses,

239
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,489
Iike this here
on the flier.

240
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,686
But if you see a house
that's been boarded up

241
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,059
with nail-gun nails
like these shown here,

242
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,927
call your sector sergeant
immediately.

243
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,728
You can enter the house,
but if you find a body,

244
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:53,101
do not disturb
the crime scene. All told.

245
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,799
But what l
don't understand is

246
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,933
why they keep busting
my balls about this.

247
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,465
I mean, Daniels gave me
a slap on the wrist

248
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,273
for the thing
with the minister, right?

249
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,372
And Marimow got bounced just before
he could fuck me up on anything else.

250
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,610
You sure we
on the right block?

251
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,814
Yeah. Put them on the curb
right here, more or less.

252
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,549
And then you fired
the nail gun

253
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,420
into the asphalt,
right where they sat?

254
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,426
Yeah. Right next to
the little broad's leg.

255
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,758
So who tells
these l.I.D. fucks

256
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,422
to start running
through my paperwork,

257
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,954
Iooking for
who the fuck cares?

258
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,556
I mean, it's not like
they caught me stealing

259
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,933
or brutalizing motherfuckers,
right? Right?

260
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,938
Look.

261
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,839
Yeah. It looks like
it could be.

262
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,468
Is that about right?

263
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,310
Yeah.

264
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,382
Must have worked himself free.

265
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,585
I took them nails
to Ballistics.

266
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,424
Comparer said he could match
anything out of that gun,

267
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,987
and maybe the nail gun itself,
if we could get it.

268
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,731
I mean, I know they're
gonna take my stripes,

269
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,702
but you don't think they're
gonna go past that, right?

270
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,467
Herc, what'd you do exactly?

271
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,567
Lost the camera
I took from l.S.D.

272
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,441
without my
lieutenant's approval.

273
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,641
And what evidence
I got from the camera,

274
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,774
I put to a made-up
informant.

275
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,719
Son, they're gonna beat
on your white ass

276
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,655
Iike it's a rented mule.

277
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,627
Fuck.

278
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,656
Then make him sign it.

279
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,289
Did it to himself,
that cocksucker.

280
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,731
I hate that bastard.

281
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,826
He called him cocksucker.

282
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,744
You're gonna break
that call button.

283
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,475
Look, I'm sorry.

284
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,177
I don't mean to bother y'all,
but I don't get but four channels.

285
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,879
That's all you get.

286
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,387
What about my man
over there?

287
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,446
He has insurance.

288
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,617
And insurance pays
for his cable hookup.

289
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,355
Only reason you're admitted
is that fracture.

290
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,024
Soon as we can
discharge you, we will.

291
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,692
All you gangsters

292
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,031
wash up in our E.R.
Iike it's your due.

293
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,537
You could stand out there
slinging drugs

294
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,802
till you get shot or cut,

295
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,206
have us put you
back together free of charge

296
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,733
so you can do it again.

297
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,975
- Gangster, huh?
- Oh, you're not that?

298
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,244
I pulled your admissions.

299
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,150
You were here in '90
for a gunshot wound,

300
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,747
and three years before that, you were
here for chest surgery for a cutting.

301
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,315
Long time back, yeah.

302
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,453
And I see
you're still at it.

303
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,623
Dennis Wise,
I'm Howard Colvin.

304
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,599
Are you police?

305
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,273
I... used to be,

306
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,335
but now I'm a bit of
a teacher up at Tilghman.

307
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,745
I got a little problem,

308
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,443
and you know Carver
over at the Western,

309
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,681
he said that you might
be able to help me.

310
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,814
I went up to your gym.

311
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,086
They told me what happened.

312
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,458
What is it that
I'm supposed to know about?

313
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,292
It's Namond Brice.

314
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,390
Yeah. What's the problem?

315
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,798
Oh... shit.

316
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,134
Well, I've just come
to care about the kid.

317
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,077
You heard it was
Little Kevin?

318
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,911
I seen one of the police step out
the household with his necklace.

319
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,179
That's Kevin
up in there, yo.

320
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,112
This motherfucker be killing niggers
just to do it.

321
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,422
See?

322
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,087
Nigger killing motherfuckers
just 'cause he can,

323
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,120
not 'cause they snitching,

324
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,724
not 'cause it's business,

325
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,997
but 'cause this shit
just comes natural to him.

326
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,664
- Yo, Bodie, man--
- I mean, Little Kevin is gone--

327
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,195
this nigger
don't feel nothing.

328
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,174
And all them motherfuckers
in them rowhouses,

329
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,802
- nobody mean a fucking thing to him.
- Bodie, calm the fuck down.

330
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,368
Fuck Marlo, man!
Fuck him

331
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,747
and anybody that think
it's all right to do people this way.

332
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,251
You hear me?

333
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,775
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

334
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,481
Get the fuck off me, man.

335
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,719
That's his friend in the bag.

336
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,726
It's like that nigger
ain't fit, man.

337
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,165
You see that shit, yo?

338
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,506
Go on. Lock his
dumb ass up.

339
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,241
Attica! Attica! Attica!

340
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,748
...the number of victims

341
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,250
discovered shot to death
in the boarded-up buildings.

342
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,547
How flattering for us.

343
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,146
It knocks the school deficit
right off the front pages.

344
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,180
There's your silver lining
right there.

345
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,091
- Those bodies are on Royce.
- School deficit should be too.

346
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,960
Should be, but that's a problem that's
gonna play out in the next fiscal year.

347
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,429
By then
you're out of Teflon.

348
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,262
So I take
the governor's money,

349
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,928
and then two years from now
when I shake the hand of any voter

350
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,834
in the D.C. suburbs,
they say, "All right.

351
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,271
You're the guy
who needed my tax dollars

352
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,968
to bail out
your school system."

353
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,034
If you take his check, you lose votes
in Prince George's and Montgomery,

354
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,069
and you can't beat him statewide
without the counties.

355
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,776
But two years from now,
if you're governor,

356
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,613
you can help the city
from Annapolis.

357
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,949
He's the mayor now.

358
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,046
I agree we can't fix
the city schools,

359
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,057
but we can't let them
get any worse either.

360
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,025
Go back to Annapolis.
Eat his shit.

361
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,925
If we lose local control
of the schools,

362
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,452
Nerese and the teachers
will rip you,

363
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,365
but the rest of the city will see
you did it for them kids.

364
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,301
Kids don't vote.

365
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,024
Taking a risk
with our supply, ain't you?

366
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,793
I mean, setting up a meet
with anybody other than us.

367
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,357
Got to.

368
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,766
The boy craves
reassurance.

369
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,466
Boss, you get that boy Marlo
in line on our connect,

370
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,600
he might try to go round
the co-op, go round us.

371
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,167
You know what I'm saying?

372
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,442
Cautious as those Greeks be,
who you think they gonna trust?

373
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,041
They know us.
They don't know him.

374
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,353
Damn.

375
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,048
Look at this nigger
coming round.

376
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,489
Easy, son. Easy.

377
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,800
Yeah. I might have known
I'd find you boys in here,

378
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,097
burning that oil after hours.

379
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,502
Nigger, I'ma
kill you twice.

380
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,235
Oh? So you don't want
your shipment, huh?

381
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,375
Say your piece.

382
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,249
Well, it just so happens
I got some heroin for sale.

383
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,448
Marketwise, you fellas
look like buyers. You feel me?

384
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,548
This some shameless shit.

385
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,559
Oh, ain't no shame
in my game, dawg.

386
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,926
I'm here about the business.
Ain't that right, Joe?

387
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:01,421
- How much?
- 20 on the dollar.

388
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,559
10, nigger.

389
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,264
Don't make me say 25 now.

390
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,370
That's 400,000.

391
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:14,276
How about we take your
faggot ass in the backroom

392
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,679
and get into some
diabolical brutality,

393
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,684
find our shit
the old-fashioned way?

394
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,653
- Feel me?
- Oh, I feel you.

395
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,678
Sounds like a plan.

396
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,692
I don't know though, Joe.
You think Omar gonna give it up?

397
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,629
20 on the dollar it is.

398
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,103
Say, how's she ticking, Joe?

399
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,124
I'll be in touch.

400
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,305
And he thinks
I'll help the schools,

401
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,970
help the city a lot more

402
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,002
if I'm governor
two years from now.

403
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,946
I'm thinking that way
it wouldn't just be about me

404
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,282
if I don't take the money.

405
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,754
Are you asking me
what I think?

406
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,755
I think you'll do
the right thing.

407
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,245
For real, I'm telling you
the truth.

408
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,245
Tickles.

409
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,718
You sure you want
to do this?

410
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,356
I don't want to hurt you.

411
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,497
Detective Crutchfield,
do you have a moment?

412
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,092
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,497
Is something wrong?

414
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,133
I've got a question
on these reports.

415
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,040
Were they all found
in the basement?

416
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,568
No, ma'am. We've been finding
most in the basement,

417
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,240
but some are on
the upper floors too.

418
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,217
Can you be specific
in the 24s,

419
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,185
for my sake anyway?

420
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,881
- No problem.
- Thanks.

421
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,047
How many so far?

422
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,190
- 17.
- Christ.

423
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,663
That's a lot of red names.

424
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,359
It's your first "Red Bull."

425
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,368
Yeah.
I thought I'd get

426
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,870
a nice, quiet domestic or two
to start me off.

427
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,202
We got national press
on this already.

428
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,003
You'll be fine, Rhonnie.

429
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,067
Just don't let any of these guys
see you sweating.

430
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,680
Hey, I need
a case dropped.

431
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,877
To tell Mello to sign off,
I need a friendly A.S.A.

432
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,313
He kicks out
a radio-car window,

433
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,844
and you wanna
give him a walk?

434
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,452
What's the date range
as per decomp?

435
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,725
The one on Mount Street
looked about a week.

436
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,392
Some a few days,

437
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,163
some are skeletal
at this stage.

438
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,295
They all head shots?

439
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,669
Multiples, most of them.

440
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,765
- Black males, 1 5 to 25?
- Uh-huh.

441
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,276
No, some older.

442
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,370
We got one in a security guard's uniform
around here somewhere.

443
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,812
- You laser-print?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,782
Vacuum the rooms?

445
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,808
Yes.

446
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,185
Gluco for blood?
What's the geography?

447
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,191
13 on West Side, Baltimore to
Winchester, Schroeder to the Grove.

448
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,490
The Eastern boys found four more
in the houses on Monument Street.

449
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,622
- East Side?
- Yeah. That threw us.

450
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,599
We're casting a wider net now,
searching the vacants citywide.

451
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,761
My number's 23
in the office pool.

452
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,464
I still have hope.

453
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,996
Hell of a case, right here.

454
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,702
You know, if I was police,
I don't think

455
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,301
I could lean back
on it. You?

456
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,710
Not if I was real police.

457
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,146
Right.

458
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,047
Thank you, Detective.

459
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,688
Calvin, you done already?

460
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,714
Yeah, I'm done.

461
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,852
Attention, a reminder:

462
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,292
Answer sheets must be turned
into the office by you and only you

463
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,887
immediately upon
completion of the tests.

464
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,592
Thank you
for your cooperation.

465
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,726
Where are we
on the nail gun?

466
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,201
A Hilti DX model.

467
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,170
High end, but common
among contractors.

468
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,673
Is it what Sergeant Hauk saw
in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?

469
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,470
We showed him one,
and he thought so.

470
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,876
Then we dragged his ass back down
to the block where he did the car stop.

471
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,780
- Anything?
- We found what might be a hole

472
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,612
where he said
he fired into the street,

473
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,085
but no nail, even after sweeping
the block

474
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,587
with metal detectors.

475
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,351
Probably took a ride
in some bastard's radio,

476
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,222
but now it's
in a tire pile somewhere.

477
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,319
So our next move is a search
and seizure on that truck.

478
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,330
Along with a court order
for hair and blood

479
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,763
from Chris and Snoop both.

480
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,666
With everything we're
pulling out these houses,

481
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,329
we might get lucky
with some tracework.

482
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,305
- What's your P.C.?
- Herc sees the nail gun.

483
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,240
Nothing wrong with owning
a power tool.

484
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,005
What's the P.C. on Chris
and Snoop specifically?

485
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,036
A witness--

486
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,744
the boy who was told by a co-conspirator
who the murderer was.

487
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,185
The boy is a source.
He's not a witness.

488
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,780
If he's just a source,
you don't have enough.

489
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,688
No, but with the links that we got
between some of these bodies

490
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,159
and Stanfield and his organization,
we have a pattern.

491
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,493
Weak. Very weak.

492
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,862
Oh, fuck it.

493
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,325
Give me an hour.

494
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,872
You haven't left me alone
all week.

495
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,342
Every time I come out
of the pool,

496
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,368
you want to dry me off
without a towel.

497
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,008
- Dennis Wise.
- Hey, man.

498
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,713
Yeah. Were you able
to get some word?

499
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:15,221
On my say-so, he's willing
to sit and hear you out.

500
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,285
But what you asking him for--
I don't know.

501
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,398
Good luck, though.

502
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,832
If you see
my man Carver again,

503
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,632
you tell him
he owe me one now.

504
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,573
- All right, man. Appreciate it.
- You got it, bro.

505
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,002
All right.

506
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,639
Y'all coming back
with a warrant?

507
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,013
The roughneck
in room 232.

508
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,217
From what I know, he runs
a gym program for kids.

509
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,554
He got himself shot for trying to pull
a kid off the corner.

510
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,821
Look, you need to
speak up now,

511
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,389
or face the fact
that you never spoke at all.

512
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,337
They wouldn't let me
see my son at marches.

513
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,307
Said there wasn't much left
by the time y'all found him.

514
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,778
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

515
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,487
Word come to me
that a man named Chris

516
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,723
and a girl
named Loop or Snoop

517
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,492
or some such
took my son and killed him.

518
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,194
Told me I would never
see my boy again.

519
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,875
Why can't you just make
an exception in this case

520
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,877
and move his name
to the top of the list,

521
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,606
see that he gets
another foster parent?

522
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,409
The list is the list.

523
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,313
Some clients have been
in group homes for years.

524
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,146
He was in group homes
for years.

525
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,120
- Now he's gotta go back because--?
- Please don't raise your voice.

526
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,247
- If you're going to raise your voice--
- Please.

527
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,291
There's gotta be some way
that he doesn't have to go--

528
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,896
Yeah, there is.

529
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,597
There's gotta be.

530
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,709
How about--

531
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:16,235
how about if I take him
as a foster parent?

532
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,646
The screening process
takes three to four months.

533
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,913
This child can't be
in your custody, Sergeant.

534
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,388
He needs to come back under
our supervision per the juvenile order.

535
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,596
Think you all that for hassling niggers
and shit?

536
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,534
I know I'm all that.

537
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,696
I'm thinking
about some pussy.

538
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,535
- Yeah. Me too.
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,007
They dumped their tools.

540
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,274
Nothing under the seats.
Nothing in the glove box.

541
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,181
Registered to some little
old lady, no doubt.

542
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,518
These guys know the drill.

543
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,525
Can you see
these two riding tail?

544
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,661
Come on.

545
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,249
Aw, shit.

546
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,822
There it is.

547
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,962
Whoa.

548
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,730
Uh-huh.

549
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,259
It ain't even our truck.

550
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,277
But I need
to hear it from you.

551
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,214
From me:

552
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,809
This is not my affair, huh?

553
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,786
It is what Joe says.
I'm only here right now for Joe,

554
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,051
who I trust,
who I respect,

555
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,025
who I worked with
for many years.

556
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,757
You I do not know,
and I don't need to know.

557
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:17,427
But because this thing
goes wrong for Joe, then--

558
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:21,268
Well, how am I supposed to know
this ain't no setup?

559
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,298
How am I supposed to know
your people ain't in on it too?

560
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,313
You know because Joe says

561
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,339
and because I say.

562
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,146
And you trust
your people like that?

563
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,552
I talked to my driver.

564
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,954
I looked into his soul.

565
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,585
Chris and Snoop
just been popped

566
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,986
on a gun charge,
found in the truck.

567
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,184
Call the bondsman.

568
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,059
But first, put a follow
on him right there.

569
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,996
- Who, white dude with the hat on?
- Mm-hmm.

570
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,023
- What, he a problem?
- Nah.

571
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,570
I just need to know more.

572
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,504
- All right.
- All right.

573
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,841
Satisfied?

574
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,143
$90,000 to you
in the morning.

575
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,274
We'll put a hunt
on Omar later,

576
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,683
after the heat on them
empty houses gives way.

577
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,320
The fuck
are you doing here?

578
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,692
You think that charge
gets dropped without

579
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,530
somebody showing you
some special love?

580
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,630
You hungry?

581
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,439
Come on.

582
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,117
All right.

583
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,123
Might be surety bond
on this Chris Partlow,

584
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,920
given all of his priors.

585
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,554
Pearson woman--
not so much. All right?

586
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,741
What's this?

587
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,804
Court order.
We get blood and hair.

588
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,816
14 head hairs,

589
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,215
14 body hairs,

590
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,276
two blood samples each.

591
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,288
It's a lot of houses,

592
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,755
a lot of deeds.

593
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,258
Who knows what
you left behind?

594
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,262
We still
in the city?

595
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,365
Cylburn Arboretum.

596
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,400
Pimlico's right
up the hill.

597
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,438
This is nice.

598
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,313
I ain't no snitch.

599
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,017
I didn't say you were.

600
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,856
I've been doing this
a long time.

601
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,125
I ain't never said
nothing to no cop.

602
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,297
I feel old.

603
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,869
I been out there
since I was 13.

604
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,848
I ain't never fucked up a count,
never stole off a package,

605
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,147
never did some shit
that I wasn't told to do.

606
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,915
I've been straight up.

607
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,512
But what come back:

608
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,547
Hmm? You think if I get
jammed up on some shit,

609
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,889
they'd be like, "All right,
yeah. Bodie been there.

610
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,088
Bodie hang tough.
We got his pay lawyer.

611
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,289
We got a bail."

612
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,924
They want me to stand
with them, right?

613
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,867
But where the fuck they at, when they
supposed to be standing by us?

614
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,733
I mean, when shit goes bad
and there's hell to pay,

615
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,706
where they at?

616
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,707
This game is rigged, man.

617
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,076
We like the little bitches
on a chessboard.

618
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,946
Pawns.

619
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,249
Yo, I'm not snitching
on none of my boys--

620
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,348
not my corner,
and not no Barksdale people,

621
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,325
or what's left of them.

622
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,851
But Marlo-- this nigger
and his kind, man,

623
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,887
they gotta fall.
They gotta.

624
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,764
Well, for that to happen,
somebody's gotta step up.

625
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,241
I'll do what I gotta.

626
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,370
I don't give a fuck.

627
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,744
Just don't ask me to live
on my fucking knees, you know?

628
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,790
You're a soldier, Bodie.

629
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,815
Hell, yeah.

630
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,372
I remember you.

631
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,143
You used to be a roll-up
on Pennsie and Fremont.

632
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,843
Yeah. It was my old post.

633
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,150
- I came up with C.B.S.
- Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.

634
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,850
Yeah. I used to have to
bang up on y'all all the time.

635
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,917
I remember that too.

636
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:47,795
Yeah. I ain't a cop
now, right?

637
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,664
I mean,
like I told Cutty,

638
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,669
I'm sort of like
a teacher now,

639
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,398
and that's how I come
to know Namond.

640
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,202
Only reason I'm even here
is Cutty spoke for you.

641
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,505
He say what I'm asking?

642
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,243
Your boy...

643
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,841
is smart and funny

644
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,182
and open-hearted,

645
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,086
and he got
some flex in him.

646
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,091
And I ain't see it at first,
'cause he was always acting out,

647
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,559
always full up
of corner talk--

648
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,496
you know, just talking
shit to hide himself.

649
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,158
But he could go
a lot of places

650
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,167
and do a lot of things
in his life,

651
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,692
be out there in the world
in a way that, you know,

652
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:30,229
didn't happen
for you and me.

653
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,142
I mean, you know,
our kind? Shit.

654
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,841
Man, we both know we gonna go
to our grave forever knowing

655
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,315
what block Bentalou
dead-ends at,

656
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,445
or who got their liquor license over
at the Underground,

657
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,318
or what corner Tater man
got shot on

658
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,449
when he come out the Musical Lounge
back in '88.

659
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,789
It's a vision in gold.

660
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,099
The West Side we knew--

661
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,105
it's dead, man.

662
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,166
You know, people
in the game nowadays--

663
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,644
I mean, it's a whole
different breed--

664
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,273
no code, no family,

665
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,182
and damn sure no respect.

666
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,682
I mean, you send Namond
out on the corner now,

667
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,158
I'm giving him
maybe one, two years

668
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,319
before he
down at the morgue.

669
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,524
And maybe, if you're lucky,
up here with you.

670
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,465
Maybe, maybe not.
That's the game.

671
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,436
I'm talking about
Namond here, Mr. Brice.

672
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:39,500
He's a lot of things,
a lot of good things.

673
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,671
I mean, before you know, he might
surprise all of us given half a chance,

674
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,273
but he ain't made
for them corners, man.

675
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,648
I mean, not like we were.

676
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,654
That's why
I come down here--

677
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,020
because I gotta believe
that you see it,

678
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,515
being who you are
and all you've been through.

679
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,858
You know your son.

680
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,803
It's in your hands, man.

681
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,011
You asking too much.

682
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,710
Yeah, but I'm asking.

683
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,314
You sure it was
the boy Bodie?

684
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,447
Man, I seen him come from
out the Central Booking

685
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,684
over on Eager Street side.

686
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,125
Then he got in some car
with some white dude.

687
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,390
Police? What kind of car,
a Caprice?

688
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,626
No, a hooptie, I think.

689
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,070
They on you like
a motherfucker.

690
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,598
They jacking you up, pulling all your
work out them houses, right?

691
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,404
Man, we can't have nobody
snitching on us now.

692
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,437
We ain't sure it's that.

693
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,076
What, you wanna let it go?

694
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,813
Risk it:

695
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,321
Huh-uh. Send a message.

696
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,415
Maybe give it to your pup,
get him started.

697
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,790
You and Snoop,
y'all lay low

698
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,624
till this shit here
blow down.

699
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,391
Boy worked for Bodie.

700
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,661
First time, best be
someone he ain't know.

701
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,830
You hear what Joe said?

702
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,333
Joe's saying this cocksucker
who stole our shit

703
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,972
wanna sell it back to us
for 30 on the dollar.

704
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,918
Joe's saying it's another
90 to buy back our share.

705
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,824
Dag, yo.

706
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,630
Thought you forgot
about me.

707
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,432
Hey, why don't you
wait outside, all right?

708
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,067
You spoke to his father?

709
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,273
If it goes the way I think,

710
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,806
he'll be back with his mom
by tomorrow.

711
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,376
Big day all around tomorrow.

712
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,355
Delegate Watkins got us 30 minutes
at the mayor's office.

713
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,893
Icicles!

714
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,895
Get 'em while it's going!
Icicles!

715
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,794
Come on!

716
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,230
Yo, Spider,
what's the count?

717
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,699
I don't even think we gonna
sell out today, man.

718
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,169
Yo, Bodie.

719
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,407
Yo,
Bodie.

720
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,347
Icicles! Icicles!

721
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,593
Yo, Bodie,
you better run, yo.

722
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,653
Yo, this my corner.
I ain't running nowhere.

723
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,358
Bodie, is you crazy?

724
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,634
Shit is on!

725
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,611
Run with it,
motherfuckers!

726
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,080
I don't give a fuck!

727
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,606
I'm right here!

728
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,451
You ain't putting me up in one of them
empty-ass houses, neither.

729
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,355
Bodie, come on, man.

730
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,479
I don't know about this.

731
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,512
Mayor's office.

732
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,185
Yes. Actually, you want

733
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,786
the Department of Housing
and Community Development.

734
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,558
Look, I don't know
about this, man.

735
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,656
I just...

736
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,262
Ma'am...

737
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,098
if...

738
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,734
sorry.

739
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,745
If the mayor
prefers not to--

740
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:20,239
if he, like, feels more comfortable
with Dr. Parenti alone, you know,

741
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,309
because of the drug-legalization
controversy last year...

742
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,049
I don't think Mayor Carcetti
is in your meeting.

743
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,556
He's in Annapolis.

744
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,494
Okay. Thank you.

745
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,067
- What up?
- What up?

746
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,570
Still asleep?

747
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,603
Early bird get that worm.

748
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,444
How you liking the crib?

749
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,715
Fine, thanks.

750
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,222
Must feel good to be
on your own.

751
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,727
Yo, where you get
that ring from?

752
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,225
Took it from a nigger.

753
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,237
Why? You want it?

754
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,968
Nah nah.
You keep it, Shorty.

755
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,907
I'll go get Bug
ready for school.

756
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,112
You ready to put in work?

757
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,618
Two things then:

758
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:38,719
First, we're gonna give you
the corner up on Payson.

759
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,663
Used to be Bodie's old corner.
Now it's yours.

760
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,363
Crew that up.
Run that shit.

761
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,962
You get the points
on that shop.

762
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,501
Then we got
this other thing.

763
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,740
Yo, if I ain't
stepping on nothing,

764
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,772
who was that
who dropped for you, yo?

765
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:07,187
- Bug's daddy.
- Word?

766
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,307
That's not how you spell
"paraphernalia."

767
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,870
- How the fuck do you spell it?
- Hey, fellas.

768
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,644
Not like that.
McNulty. Hey.

769
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,150
You're here 4:00 to 12:00,
right?

770
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,210
- You heard about Bodie?
- What about?

771
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,983
- Bodie, from up Payson.
- Yeah yeah. What?

772
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,718
Shot dead on his corner.

773
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,386
Midnight shift caught it.
Check the readout.

774
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,328
Sergeant,
get your ass in here.

775
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,328
God damn it, Sergeant,
you're on the brink of insubordination.

776
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:08,279
You call D.S.S. right now
and ship him out. That's an order.

777
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,307
Lieutenant--

778
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:18,658
I got $235, if it helps.

779
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,061
How would that help:

780
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,294
Maybe we can get a foster spot
like that-- pay somebody.

781
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,546
This is tracking,
plain and simple.

782
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,310
No, it's a
socialization process.

783
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,147
But to any parent who complains,
you're still segregating them.

784
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,153
But I mean...
it's for their benefit,

785
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,655
and for the benefit of
the teachers trying to teach.

786
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,784
And you're proposing to expand this
to every middle school?

787
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,057
With enough grant money
and your support, yes.

788
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,825
By September.

789
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,059
But you wouldn't be teaching
test curriculum here?

790
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,228
These would be the children
left behind, so to speak.

791
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,760
Yeah, but as it is,
I mean,

792
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,739
we're leaving
them all behind anyway.

793
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,536
We just don't want
to admit it.

794
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,109
- What we mean to say is--
- Gentlemen...

795
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,342
we'll be in touch.

796
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,323
So what, that's it?

797
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,955
After a two-minute hearing,
they stick a fork in us?

798
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,398
I'm a liability
in there, man.

799
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,401
Seems like every time
I open my mouth in this town,

800
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,733
I'm telling people something
they don't want to know.

801
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,966
- It's not you. It's the process.
- The process?

802
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,135
When we get the grant, we study
the problem, we propose solutions.

803
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,803
If they listen, they listen.

804
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,211
If they don't, it still
makes for great research.

805
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,442
What we publish on this
is gonna get a lot of attention.

806
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,973
From who:

807
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,781
From other
researchers, academics.

808
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,787
Academics?

809
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,789
What, they gonna study
your study?

810
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,557
When do this shit change?

811
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,534
And you put him out, huh?

812
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,628
He need to get hard.

813
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,368
Well, if he out,
then he out.

814
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,467
Oh, no, you're not.

815
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,411
You ain't gonna take
my son away from me, not for this--

816
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,710
Remember who the fuck
you talking to right here.

817
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,148
Remember who I am.

818
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,709
My word is still my word.

819
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,948
In here, in Baltimore,

820
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,186
and in any place you
can think of calling home,

821
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,659
it'll be my word.
They'll find you.

822
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,222
Man come down here to say my son
can be anything he damn please.

823
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,235
Except a soldier.

824
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,572
Yeah, well,
look at me up in here.

825
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,268
Who the fuck
would want to be that

826
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,402
if they could be
anything else, De'Londa?

827
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,474
Hmm:

828
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,017
So...

829
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,918
did you cut me off too?

830
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,121
You still got me.
We'll get by.

831
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,762
But you gonna
let go of that boy.

832
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,459
Bet that.

833
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,067
Quien es?

834
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,270
It's Omar, baby.

835
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,904
For your bank?

836
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,173
That's for
your pain, Butch.

837
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,702
I be my own bank now.

838
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,682
Hmm.
They ain't follow you?

839
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,412
Nah.
Joe paid it my way.

840
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:06,286
He had to admit my word
was better than his. You feel me?

841
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,813
Let's go then.

842
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,460
He is in the van,
in the garage

843
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,905
in the back
of 2249 Polk Street.

844
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,806
The key gonna be
in the cinderblock.

845
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,754
You steal this much,
and this ain't over.

846
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,463
This ain't over.

847
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,490
Thing about that
Republican ass,

848
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,560
it's not the flesh of
his political fathers.

849
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,483
Jesus.

850
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,630
You left it
on the table.

851
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,632
Smug son of a bitch.

852
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:00,102
He was gonna
make me beg,

853
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,104
then call
a press conference

854
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,698
so the world could see me
on my knees.

855
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,539
Don't worry.

856
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,636
Two years,

857
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,670
and we'll make him pay.

858
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,749
Icicle, icicle!

859
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,116
Got those icicles!

860
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,853
Shakedown!

861
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,525
Corner's indicted.

862
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,294
Go on. Get.

863
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,824
Except you, motherfucker.
On the wall.

864
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,370
Sorry about Bodie.

865
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,933
I ain't jacking you up.

866
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,808
I'm trying to do right
for your boy.

867
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,178
- Who dropped him?
- Y'all did.

868
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,480
They took him out 'cause
he was talking to y'all.

869
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,386
Word is they seen him with the police
down at Central Booking.

870
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,983
So cuff me or kick my ass
off this corner

871
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,516
before you do me the same.

872
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,339
Hey, Duquan.

873
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,407
Don't you need
to be at Douglass?

874
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,213
I'm on my way there, yeah.

875
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,911
Where's your book bag?

876
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,648
Oh, it's-- I'm gonna stop
past the house and get it.

877
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,595
It's a present
for all you did.

878
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,159
It's for your desk.

879
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,102
That's great, Duquan.

880
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,901
Thanks.

881
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,639
Stop past anytime,

882
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,578
Iet me know
how it's going with you.

883
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,838
Okay.

884
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,858
- But I ain't want to go back.
- Program's ending, Zenobia.

885
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,830
Yeah, boy.
Back to gen pop.

886
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,026
Yes.

887
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,535
Pack my bags.

888
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,002
What about you?

889
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:18,439
I mean, this was all right...

890
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,735
but maybe it's time.

891
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,648
Why are you up?

892
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,180
You're working
4:00 to 12:00.

893
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,387
What's the matter?

894
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,089
Something with these bodies.

895
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,333
Lester and them
are getting up on it.

896
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,996
It's under Daniels.

897
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,972
He's got suction now.

898
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,668
He can deliver.

899
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,371
You want in.

900
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:58,005
I just feel like
I owe it now.

901
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,947
To who:

902
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,677
To this kid.

903
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,879
Corner kid.

904
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,718
Getting ready
to turn him, you know,

905
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,247
wrap him up and give him
to Lester as a present.

906
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,325
He one of the bodies
in the houses:

907
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,727
No, they dropped him
in the street.

908
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,760
Maybe I'd be different,
you know?

909
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,292
Different:

910
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,465
Yeah, no more of the...

911
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,476
drinking and the whoring
and all that.

912
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,000
All that anger.

913
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,513
'Cause I'm better now
here with you.

914
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,757
No more playing "Jimmy Bust Balls"
with the world.

915
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,785
"Jimmy Bust Balls"?

916
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,656
I swear to God, Beadie,
that son of a bitch nearly killed me.

917
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,581
It's okay.

918
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,827
- What?
- You tried.

919
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,353
You don't need to feel bad.

920
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,095
Thanks.

921
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,179
All right, Randy,
this way.

922
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,656
Take that top bunk
over there.

923
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,941
Five-0.

924
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,656
Are you sure?

925
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,960
I'm not asking
'cause I can't use you.

926
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:36,794
I'm asking for your sake.

927
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,322
I think I can do this

928
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,564
and keep myself
away from myself,

929
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,265
if that makes any sense.

930
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,641
But I gotta tell you,

931
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,676
we're not gonna get
Marlo Stanfield

932
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,018
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.

933
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,614
What do you suggest?

934
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,125
Either a wide C.I.
or a Title lll.

935
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,594
That's what makes this case.

936
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,154
You sure?

937
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,359
Maybe you do this fast
and clean and simple.

938
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,094
Then you don't
do it at all.

939
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,768
Chain of command, Colonel.

940
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,141
How in the hell do we
kick up percentages

941
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,009
in math
and reading both?

942
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,173
You believe the numbers?

943
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,514
38% proficient.
8% advanced.

944
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,543
What?

945
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,886
"Proficient" means they're
at least two grades below their level.

946
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:39,258
"Advanced" can mean
they're at grade level or a year below.

947
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,855
They score 'em
like that, and...

948
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,298
they say we're
making progress.

949
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,826
Okay. I'm still learning.

950
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,997
Nah, you're gonna be fine.

951
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,031
Albert, Zenobia, Namond,

952
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,872
good to have you
back with us.

953
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,470
Yeah. Your worst nightmare
come right back on you.

954
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,748
Say, no,
I'm just foolin'.

955
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,286
Okay.
Everyone open to 121.

956
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,598
Who figured out
the first problem?

957
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,294
- Kareem?
- 164.

958
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,565
Correct.
How'd you get it?

959
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,971
- Don't know.
- Come. Show us.

960
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,771
Just when you
think you're done.

961
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:34,146
- What's that one? 20?
- 22.

962
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,515
Anybody heard from Bunk?

963
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:40,454
Ballistics say the guns match
to nothing. Opened and closed.

964
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,218
And they cleaned
the prints.

965
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:46,092
Well, maybe
we find a witness.

966
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:50,189
Maybe trace lab gives us
a hair or splatter or something.

967
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,928
But short of that,
we're gonna have to go proactive.

968
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:55,027
Where are you
on the new body?

969
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,698
Back to square one.

970
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,707
We're in here
for the long haul.

971
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,574
Colonel, how'd you happen
to pick this place for us to stage?

972
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,010
- Lemel:
- Hmm.

973
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,014
They closed it
a few years back,

974
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,949
and I knew it was near
a lot of our crime scenes.

975
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,952
I went to school here

976
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,045
back in the day.

977
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,683
Got a decent education,
now that I think on it.

978
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,345
You try and talk to him?

979
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,046
Didn't know what to say.

980
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:48,545
Only heard from
my sergeant this morning.

981
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,388
Guess I missed
the 24 they wrote on it.

982
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,394
And he really tried
to do himself?

983
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,293
It wasn't just
for show or nothing?

984
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,562
Bub's got some problems,
but insincerity ain't one of them.

985
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,933
Shame's some
tricky shit, ain't it?

986
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,961
Makes you feel like
you want to change,

987
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:06,099
and then beats you back down
when think you can't.

988
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,201
When was the last time
y'all talked?

989
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,212
More than a couple of years,

990
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:13,647
since he last got
on the wagon, I think.

991
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,479
If he's up in D ward,

992
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,816
he's cleaner than
a motherfucker right now.

993
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,819
You coming?

994
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,224
Maybe later.

995
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,270
Can't believe he'd leave
that money on the table.

996
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:53,408
- Why not?
- School. Kids.

997
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,973
Shit.

998
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,212
You ain't done enough
of this here, I suppose.

999
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,848
They always disappoint.

1000
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:04,552
Closer you get,
more you look--

1001
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,720
all of them.

1002
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,125
Who you going with
next year?

1003
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,897
If he tries for Elijah's seat,
I might stay with Royce.

1004
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,997
If not, there's this young buck
out in Salisbury

1005
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,838
thinks he can snatch up
the First District seat.

1006
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,540
Hmm.

1007
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,980
Mistletoe. Come get 'em.

1008
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,624
Mistletoe!

1009
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,544
You can look him
in the eye now.

1010
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,622
No matter who he is
or what he's done,

1011
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,283
you look him
right in the eye.

1012
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,498
I'm still your father.

1013
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,136
What you want?

1014
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,282
Right to the body.

1015
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,819
That's right. Keep it moving.
Where your eyes at?

1016
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,586
Where you looking--
what you looking at?

1017
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,394
Hey!

1018
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:12,635
You cannot be out here.

1019
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,665
Y'all need to find
something constructive

1020
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,541
to do with yourselves.
Go on.

1021
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:34,220
Michael.

1022
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,357
Michael.

1023
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,428
The gun.

1024
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,764
Na', you're
gonna be late.

1025
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,002
Go on. Go.

1026
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,453
Boy, where's your plate?

1027
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,417
Yo, Tyrell, wait up.
