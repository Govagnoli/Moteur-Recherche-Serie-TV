1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,504
Thirteen bodies, all female...

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,976
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:19,140
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,945
From Eastern Europe probably.

5
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,246
So this is, what, an accident?

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:26,755
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

7
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,121
So, yeah, accidental probably.

8
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:31,621
But that's his call, right?

9
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,225
-Doctor.
-Frazier.

10
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,994
How're we doing here?

11
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:43,762
-How are we doing?
-I mean, what are we doing?

12
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,299
What's the plan with all this?

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,504
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

14
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:52,514
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

15
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,315
You got 13 for the price of one.

16
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,849
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

17
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:01,482
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

18
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:02,752
What identification?

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,693
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

20
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:08,959
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

21
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:12,524
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

22
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:15,301
Who's the investigating agency?

23
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:23,880
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.

24
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:26,882
-But they're dead, so they're cargo.
-Cargo, but no contraband.

25
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:29,282
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

26
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:31,445
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

27
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,420
-Yeah.
-That's a state thing.

28
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:35,355
We'll eat it.

29
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,623
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

30
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,798
Good enough for me, brother.

31
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,958
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

32
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,902
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

33
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,132
No crime, no investigation.

34
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,335
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

35
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,413
And then there was one.

36
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,823
-You don't have to do this.
-No?

37
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:23,188
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

38
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,454
You called him a Greek asshole?

39
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,632
You think we wanted this?

40
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:35,136
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

41
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:39,835
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

42
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,542
-This was a mistake.
-A mistake?

43
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:45,812
They fucking died in that can...

44
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,147
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

45
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,618
You know nothing.

46
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:54,987
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

47
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,152
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

48
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:01,857
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

49
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,626
you know, no Customs.

50
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,396
-He did not come off the boat.
-Why the fuck not?

51
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,971
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

52
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:12,633
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

53
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:14,973
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

54
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:16,841
I understand how you feel...

55
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:20,007
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

56
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:21,912
Nobody here wanted this.

57
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,147
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

58
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:31,453
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

59
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:34,087
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

60
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,529
in the stacks like I did, right?

61
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:38,430
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

62
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,969
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

63
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,003
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

64
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,233
Guns, okay?

65
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:51,504
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

66
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,516
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

67
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,846
-Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
-Boom.

68
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,225
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

69
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,056
But you don't ask...

70
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,993
because you don't want to know.

71
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,631
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

72
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:16,069
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

73
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:26,309
Give him a couple of days, you know?

74
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,111
So Roberto been caught?

75
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,949
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

76
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:07,590
Now the shit makes some sense.

77
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:11,252
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

78
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,659
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

79
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:16,961
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

80
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,867
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

81
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:24,270
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

82
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:28,037
-They saying you only got seven years, so--
-So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

83
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:30,443
They ain't saying they think it.

84
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,377
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

85
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,610
-So we on the outside.
-Yep.

86
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:37,620
Look...

87
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:41,280
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

88
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,951
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

89
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,526
A friend in Atlanta...

90
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,195
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

91
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:54,235
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

92
00:07:57,908 --> 00:07:59,876
You seen D'Angelo lately?

93
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,642
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

94
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:06,182
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

95
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:09,979
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

96
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,213
-I don't know what's what anymore.
-Now, what's up with Donette?

97
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,315
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

98
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:19,020
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

99
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,461
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

100
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,692
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

101
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,597
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

102
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:28,170
After all he has done for us...

103
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,671
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

104
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,298
-Promises were made.
-I know.

105
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,037
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

106
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,472
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

107
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,709
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

108
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:43,377
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

109
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:44,818
Adjustments?

110
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,686
Brianna...

111
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:50,825
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

112
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:01,070
-You got these off the boat?
-What, in winter?

113
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:04,939
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

114
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,436
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

115
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:10,976
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

116
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,639
every now and again.

117
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,449
-Need some air in here.
-Leave it.

118
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,988
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

119
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:28,724
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

120
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:32,268
-You're the special kind of asshole.
-I'm special, all right.

121
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:34,866
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

122
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,768
took that girl over the county line?

123
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,205
-Three hours.
-Three hours...

124
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,939
with your little harbor maps...

125
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:45,344
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

126
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,283
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

127
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:51,854
-That's collateral damage.
-Yeah.

128
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,624
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

129
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:02,127
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

130
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,509
-We need Omar, Jimmy.
-You see this.

131
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:25,220
-Thirteen girls?
-Yeah, I heard about it.

132
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,523
-Who caught it?
-It ain't ours.

133
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:32,025
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

134
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:35,359
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

135
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:38,434
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

136
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:42,232
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

137
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,739
It's time you show Bunk the love.

138
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:50,036
-You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
-Shit.

139
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,950
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

140
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,717
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

141
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,258
Can you fucking believe that?

142
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,523
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

143
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,961
Who got to it?

144
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,158
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

145
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,759
-What was it?
-Vodka, I think.

146
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,101
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

147
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,804
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

148
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:26,143
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

149
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,685
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

150
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,716
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

151
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:36,622
-A couple of cases?
-Yeah, it was four.

152
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:43,227
-What the fuck is up with the police?
-What?

153
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,230
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

154
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,215
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

155
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,981
You got the tow bar set high.

156
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,622
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

157
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:13,662
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

158
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,856
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

159
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:20,198
-It ain't me, it's my boss.
-Who's your boss?

160
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:23,431
-Valchek, Southeast district.
-Stan Valchek?

161
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,633
The district commander, yeah.

162
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,939
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

163
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,946
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

164
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,949
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

165
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,214
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

166
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,313
-You work for a gaping asshole.
-More than one actually.

167
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:44,655
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

168
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:49,289
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

169
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,565
It's chain of command.

170
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:56,397
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

171
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,182
-You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
-You talk when I say you can.

172
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:24,564
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

173
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,539
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

174
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,940
-Man, I ain't done shit.
-Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

175
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,714
Pets, too?

176
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,643
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

177
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,356
Clean this shit before lock-down.

178
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,419
That's four in a row, bitch!

179
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:10,309
Wait here, this won't take long.

180
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:15,378
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

181
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:18,545
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

182
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:22,182
-There ain't no union without it, brother.
-Your sweetheart's out there.

183
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,418
Who?

184
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:28,290
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

185
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,839
-Kind of empty in here.
-Everyone's working.

186
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:42,270
-You getting the message?
-The message?

187
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:46,644
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

188
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,978
you know that?

189
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,552
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

190
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,587
told them where it was gonna go.

191
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:56,056
-You tell Father Lewandowski?
-I was gonna surprise him.

192
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,186
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

193
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,662
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

194
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:06,634
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

195
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,965
-Good for you.
-No, good for you, Frank.

196
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:14,673
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

197
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,145
What's right?

198
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:22,382
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

199
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:25,386
Iike a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

200
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:28,082
But that's not you, it's not your way.

201
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,853
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

202
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,552
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

203
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:36,223
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

204
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,459
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

205
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:41,537
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

206
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:44,801
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

207
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:48,435
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

208
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,516
Fuck you! And your window!

209
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,398
Where are you gonna be?

210
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:16,495
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

211
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,767
-Give me an hour, yeah?
-Yeah.

212
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,776
-What the fuck is this?
-A knot.

213
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,982
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

214
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,349
So what else we got?

215
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:37,085
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

216
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:40,724
-Here's a letter, though.
-A letter? What language?

217
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,856
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

218
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:47,027
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

219
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,931
Can't figure the name or the address...

220
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,634
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

221
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:57,076
-Where's Magyar?
-What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

222
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,141
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

223
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,481
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

224
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,746
These yours?

225
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:08,722
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

226
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,191
She found them, she writes on it.

227
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,055
-I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
-Beatrice Russell.

228
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:19,191
-You got any IDs yet?
-No visas or passports.

229
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,034
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

230
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,466
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

231
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:28,976
-Yeah.
-Why?

232
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:33,506
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

233
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:36,050
There's no missing person report on file.

234
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,855
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

235
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,388
-Mine was a murder.
-A murder, you're kidding me?

236
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,394
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

237
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,058
I called the morgue this morning...

238
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,865
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

239
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:56,472
Overseas, they think.

240
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:57,461
Overseas, they think.

241
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,867
-Is that your girl?
-Think so.

242
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,237
Looks better here.

243
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:05,777
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

244
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,544
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

245
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,580
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

246
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:14,316
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

247
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:17,518
-What went wrong?
-Air pipe up top got crushed.

248
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:20,687
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

249
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:28,467
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

250
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,163
You had cartons stacked in front...

251
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:33,470
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

252
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,441
opens from the outside only.

253
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,816
-They're in here the whole trip?
-Probably not.

254
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,614
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

255
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:46,712
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

256
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:50,657
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

257
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,455
They were clawing at the wall for air.

258
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:57,089
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

259
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:02,097
-Where's the air pipe?
-That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

260
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,240
You get a lot of stowaways?

261
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:09,743
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

262
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:14,682
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

263
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:20,187
-Not so much from Europe?
-A bit more since 9l1 1, actually.

264
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,990
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

265
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,322
Iike they used to. There you go.

266
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,296
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

267
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,923
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

268
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:34,470
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

269
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,333
Where was this one?

270
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,103
-Look.
-What?

271
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,577
-That look right to you?
-What do you mean?

272
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,610
-You said you were with the Marine Unit?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:55,384
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

274
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,719
Not a thing.

275
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:00,962
What do you want me to do?

276
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:05,467
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

277
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,035
Switch the windows, maybe.

278
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:10,435
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

279
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,338
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

280
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:14,910
I thought you had suction.

281
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,673
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

282
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,614
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

283
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:23,742
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

284
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:25,946
Now, that's a good question.

285
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,158
I mean, the whole l.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

286
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,751
and there ain't 100 checkers.

287
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:36,093
They got the car ships coming in...

288
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,225
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

289
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,562
-That's all they got?
-Pretty much.

290
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:46,574
Past six months,
l.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

291
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,701
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

292
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:51,302
They've been good
with the political contributions.

293
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,109
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

294
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:55,150
-How can they?
-You tell me.

295
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:59,449
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

296
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:02,024
You know what I think?

297
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,389
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

298
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,829
You're the cop, not me.

299
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:16,427
The Grainery?

300
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:21,869
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

301
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,769
Yeah, I've seen worse.

302
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:36,914
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

303
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,620
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

304
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:43,062
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

305
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,258
See?

306
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,327
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

307
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,468
But yeah, from the look of it...

308
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:56,341
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

309
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:03,710
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

310
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,687
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

311
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,350
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

312
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,951
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

313
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:17,294
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

314
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,597
-They're pushing Shipley.
-See, that's racist.

315
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:25,062
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

316
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:28,871
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

317
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,137
You know what I'm gonna do?

318
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:34,011
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

319
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:36,641
That'll bring the First District in line.

320
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:38,151
That's very kind.

321
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:42,190
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

322
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:46,190
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

323
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:50,857
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

324
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:51,991
What for?

325
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:55,901
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

326
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:58,269
-Port guys, longshoremen.
-I.B.S.?

327
00:22:58,374 --> 00:23:00,899
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

328
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,410
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

329
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,912
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

330
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:09,311
-Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
-No.

331
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:13,015
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

332
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:16,550
-What's he to you?
-To me?

333
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:19,885
He's an asshole.

334
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,425
Six men for six weeks.

335
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:28,699
Rawls will pick them.

336
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,965
You ordered more than you ate.

337
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:40,276
It's cold out here.

338
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:47,252
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:56,857
You're right. You're always right.

340
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,596
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

341
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,934
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

342
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:06,639
In the basement.

343
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:12,879
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

344
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,279
Burrell won't be there forever.

345
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:18,410
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

346
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,882
But you've got the law degree.

347
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,324
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

348
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,123
You've got options.

349
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:31,297
-Just because they don't--
-You're right.

350
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,302
I'll put in my papers.

351
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,959
-Who wants breakfast?
-Christ, it's about time.

352
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,585
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

353
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:04,890
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

354
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,731
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

355
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:11,636
-Who got them?
-New Charles works for Mutt.

356
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:14,267
Yo, Zig. You working today?

357
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:18,108
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

358
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,978
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

359
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:25,144
-Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
-That's right, I'm thirsty.

360
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:30,115
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

361
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,104
-Nick.
-What's up?

362
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:48,606
Come here.

363
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,811
-I got a line on something.
-Oh, yeah?

364
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:58,714
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

365
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:03,257
-He's gonna stake me to a package.
-A package?

366
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:08,089
Dope, Nicky, dope.

367
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,327
I got work today, Zig.

368
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:15,234
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

369
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:19,137
-So why the fuck you coming to me?
-I want you to come in on it with me.

370
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,904
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

371
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,912
We turn it around, we both get paid.

372
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:27,380
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

373
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,351
-Fuck that shit, Zig.
-Time to work!

374
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,088
-Nicky, come on, man.
-Can I ride with you?

375
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,792
Will you think about it?

376
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:42,994
Dolores, can I get another shot?

377
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:12,984
-What's up?
-DWI checkpoint.

378
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:15,427
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

379
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,992
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

380
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,833
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

381
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,812
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

382
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:38,148
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

383
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:39,812
-That's not in dispute here.
-Good.

384
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:42,220
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

385
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:45,657
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

386
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:49,060
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

387
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:52,827
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

388
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:55,267
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

389
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,397
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

390
00:27:58,507 --> 00:28:00,941
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

391
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:02,806
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

392
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:06,348
-39.4%.
-Bill, like I told you--

393
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,883
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

394
00:28:12,988 --> 00:28:16,947
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

395
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,339
The man is a god.

396
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,580
Big chief.

397
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:27,023
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

398
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:29,029
Yeah. Come on in, man.

399
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,567
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

400
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,264
-No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
-What?

401
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:40,040
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

402
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:42,235
-Better get in this.
-No.

403
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:46,915
Look, man...

404
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,749
if he tearing your room down, man...

405
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:52,821
we keep bringing more stuff in.

406
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:56,254
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

407
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,223
He fucked with my fish though, I don't....

408
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:00,488
He ain't have to go there, man.

409
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:04,191
-What's up with this motherfucker?
-You remember Ladontay?

410
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,364
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

411
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:08,993
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

412
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:10,628
We did that?

413
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,606
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

414
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:17,201
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

415
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:20,509
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

416
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,812
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

417
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,319
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

418
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:29,619
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

419
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,853
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

420
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:37,289
-What's his name again?
-Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

421
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,800
I seen him around.

422
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:42,700
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

423
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:45,171
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

424
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:48,471
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

425
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:51,740
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

426
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:54,111
Don't fret. All right?

427
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,981
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

428
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:00,680
The city won't take it?

429
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,986
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

430
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:05,993
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

431
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,290
Case needs real murder police.

432
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,188
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

433
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,234
Absolutely. What can you give me?

434
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:18,034
-This is about fucking over your boss?
-If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

435
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:20,041
What do you need?

436
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:22,838
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

437
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,340
13 by 7 by 7.

438
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:33,553
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

439
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:40,455
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

440
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:41,788
per victim.

441
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:45,428
-He's a doctor?
-A State Bureau of Mines.

442
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:47,729
-Minds?
-Mines.

443
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:05,012
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

444
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,781
-Barksdale, right?
-Yeah.

445
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:10,024
-Listen, I want to know if you can help me--
-No.

446
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,790
-Pardon me?
-I said, no, motherfucker.

447
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,433
Off the steps.

448
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,991
What the fuck are you up to now?

449
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:56,960
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

450
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:03,506
This is bullshit.

451
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:05,045
Those computations were checked...

452
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:07,342
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

453
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:10,475
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

454
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:11,814
Yeah, so you say.

455
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,980
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

456
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,786
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

457
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:20,418
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

458
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:22,759
in American law enforcement.

459
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:26,232
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

460
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:30,265
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

461
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:31,964
then they were murdered on board ship.

462
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:33,666
That means Baltimore County...

463
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:36,005
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

464
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:40,275
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

465
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:42,441
This is not a city problem.

466
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,318
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

467
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:49,549
No, Bill.

468
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,387
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

469
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,462
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

470
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:58,191
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

471
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:02,968
-By the map, that's Baltimore city.
-And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

472
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:06,131
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

473
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,836
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

474
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:00,187
Mikey.

475
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:01,785
-What's up?
-No.

476
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:03,355
No, what?

477
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:05,330
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

478
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,629
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

479
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:10,034
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

480
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:12,599
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

481
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,233
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

482
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:18,375
Mike, I thought we was friends.

483
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,074
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

484
00:35:22,017 --> 00:35:24,178
-Sort of.
-Are you beat to shit?

485
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:27,114
-No.
-Take a walk, my friend.

486
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,213
-What's up, man?
-What's up, playboy?

487
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,625
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

488
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:06,626
So we got that, you know.

489
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:09,219
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

490
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:12,525
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

491
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:14,534
-Who?
-Name is Tilghman.

492
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:18,299
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

493
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,631
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

494
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:22,903
Tilghman? Right.

495
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,640
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

496
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,307
I know, I heard.

497
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,486
You need to get with Dee's girl.

498
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:38,718
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

499
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,125
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

500
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,526
All right.

501
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,529
How's Dee taking it?

502
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:49,760
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

503
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:53,102
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

504
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,574
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

505
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:58,771
-No, nothing like that.
-You sure?

506
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:04,314
-He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
-Stringer, he's family, man.

507
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,220
All right? He's family.

508
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:13,289
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

509
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,694
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

510
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:20,601
That's it.

511
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:21,828
There it is.

512
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,403
-One more, baby, come on.
-There you go.

513
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,566
-That's enough.
-No.

514
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,340
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

515
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:33,812
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

516
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:39,176
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

517
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:46,483
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

518
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:49,391
And Rawls!

519
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:53,660
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

520
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:57,499
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

521
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:02,600
-Careful, you're giving me an erection.
-Come on now.

522
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:06,272
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

523
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:09,612
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

524
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:12,710
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

525
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:14,789
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

526
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,124
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

527
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,096
All right.

528
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,733
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

529
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:33,307
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

530
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,601
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

531
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:40,977
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

532
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,640
And four months.

533
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:46,948
Fuck it.

534
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:50,686
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

535
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,497
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

536
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:57,829
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

537
00:38:58,233 --> 00:38:59,200
Fuck.

538
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:04,132
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

539
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,536
Go that way.

540
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,943
-Man, anybody still in there?
-They're keeping La-la.

541
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,537
He had an old warrant on him.

542
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:17,641
-For what?
-I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

543
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,087
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

544
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:24,090
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

545
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:27,821
-Jerking us around on the way to work.
-It's a beef I got with a police boss.

546
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:31,990
-Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
-You gotta get that taken care of, man.

547
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,627
-I mean, this shit is out of hand.
-I'm gonna take care of it.

548
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:38,305
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

549
00:39:39,808 --> 00:39:42,402
-I'll see you.
-All right, talk to you.

550
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:46,403
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

551
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:53,052
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

552
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,151
-Bunk, Lester.
-Yeah.

553
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:03,260
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

554
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:05,422
What? We're not up, Jay.

555
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,234
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

556
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:10,065
Cole's gonna take the double.

557
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:13,436
-You two got pussy in a can.
-Jay, that ain't right.

558
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,766
You know what ain't right?

559
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:20,409
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

560
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:31,148
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

561
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,195
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

562
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:37,561
so I got my best people on it.

563
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:40,692
Ray.

564
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,668
Lay it on them.

565
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:51,268
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

566
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:56,747
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

567
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:58,349
Motherfucker.

568
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:02,116
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

569
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:13,925
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

570
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,470
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

571
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:24,101
-What?
-A drunken lrishman.

572
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,941
But you're not really lrish, are you?

573
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,352
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

574
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,354
You're green, all right.

575
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:38,383
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

576
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:42,553
You're a child, McNulty.

577
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:52,605
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

578
00:41:52,707 --> 00:41:55,801
-I will call the cops.
-Why would you wanna do that?

579
00:41:58,513 --> 00:41:59,639
Jimmy.

580
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:07,721
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

581
00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:11,285
What the fuck am l, Jimmy?

582
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,821
We're good together.

583
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,965
Answer the question.

584
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,665
I've been pretty honest with you.

585
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:32,679
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

586
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:36,213
You know, what with the kids and all....

587
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,120
You got any aspirin?

588
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:51,532
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

589
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,935
A real police department
would have an elevator.

590
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:16,539
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

591
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:19,042
Lester Freamon.

592
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,151
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

593
00:44:23,258 --> 00:44:24,589
What do we know?

594
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:28,788
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

595
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:32,264
-I'm trying to get them to hold her.
-Anyone from your CID working this?

596
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:35,530
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

597
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:37,867
and your colonel made everybody mad.

598
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:40,907
-All you get is me.
-Still on hold?

599
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:45,577
We can call this in from the road.

600
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:52,415
You're with City Homicide?

601
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,717
-You must know Jimmy McNulty.
-Yeah, he's dead to us.

602
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:19,469
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

603
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:20,775
I've seen worse.

604
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:24,283
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

605
00:45:24,385 --> 00:45:26,512
-Furnace work?
-It does.

606
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,179
And the phone lines.

607
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,622
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

608
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:33,284
but somehow I got a feeling...

609
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:36,989
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

610
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:38,857
Now, this here...

611
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:43,202
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

612
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:47,968
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

613
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,903
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

614
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:55,881
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

615
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:59,515
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

616
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:06,123
So who signs the overtime slips?

617
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:15,001
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

618
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:17,537
-This is where our taxes go.
-I do good work, don't l?

619
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,266
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

620
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,274
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

621
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,943
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

622
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,881
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

623
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:35,853
Finishing touch, boys.

624
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,771
Bon voyage.

625
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:03,273
There she goes.

626
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:19,655
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

627
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:44,653
-Amir, why don't we sail?
-They're holding the ship.

628
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,750
-Who?
-Coast Guard, the Americans.

629
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:47,885
Why?

630
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:18,174
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

631
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:21,254
Bring him up!

632
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,106
-Have a good day, Officer.
-Okay, I'll see you.

633
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:01,588
Now get up in there.

634
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:03,891
Last call before lock-down.

635
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:07,967
Make it snappy now.

636
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,672
-How you like that?
-It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

637
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:17,444
Nice. Smooth.

638
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:18,910
Most def, man.

639
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:25,742
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

640
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:31,453
-What up, man?
-Yeah, he left that in here.

641
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:34,255
It's his.

642
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:38,022
-So how you doing?
-All right.

643
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:39,624
Yeah?

644
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:44,164
Me and you gonna need to talk.

645
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:25,245
-So who's on board?
-Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

646
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:26,643
Eight are Sri Lankan.

647
00:51:26,747 --> 00:51:30,649
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

648
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:35,116
-Anybody speak English?
-What you're asking them about...

649
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:38,123
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

650
00:51:40,594 --> 00:51:43,427
-Where's your captain?
-At the Coast Guard office.

651
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:46,829
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

652
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:48,367
You ain't gonna make it.

653
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:52,997
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

654
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:57,373
-The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
-The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

655
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:01,106
Don't try to play tough guy.

656
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,244
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

657
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:06,950
Talk to me!

658
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:13,187
Tell me what I need to know.

659
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,024
Get him up.

660
00:52:22,837 --> 00:52:26,671
-Talk about the girls.
-No girls, nothing.

661
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:28,305
No English.

662
00:52:28,676 --> 00:52:31,645
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

663
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:36,746
Why you run from ship?

664
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,048
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

665
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:48,693
They got him in Philadelphia.

666
00:52:48,796 --> 00:52:51,924
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

667
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:55,901
-What is he?
-Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

668
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:09,446
He don't know nothing.

669
00:53:10,618 --> 00:53:12,916
But you kept hitting him anyway.

670
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:15,145
Get his clothes.

671
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:28,434
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

672
00:53:47,755 --> 00:53:51,316
-Come on, let's talk.
-No English.

673
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:54,686
Tell me what happened to the girls?

674
00:53:58,432 --> 00:54:00,093
No speak.

675
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:02,965
What then? What do you speak?

676
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:06,932
Come on, talk to me, friend.

677
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:26,320
Turkish?

678
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,194
You got that little hook on your nose.

679
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:33,463
Don't worry, patrioti.

680
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:38,495
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

681
00:54:43,444 --> 00:54:45,105
Sam.

682
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,242
-I don't know nothing about--
-You know.

683
00:54:49,717 --> 00:54:54,086
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

684
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:56,820
you're done, I give you my word.

685
00:55:04,532 --> 00:55:07,330
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

686
00:55:08,068 --> 00:55:09,763
Get some fresh air.

687
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:16,432
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

688
00:55:17,778 --> 00:55:20,338
These girls, they looked pretty good.

689
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:24,215
-Katalavenis?
-Yes.

690
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:27,377
The men had cash to spend.

691
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:31,958
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

692
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:33,526
What happened?

693
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:38,458
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

694
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:42,227
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

695
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:46,238
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

696
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:51,271
-You kill one, then you kill them all.
-No, that was another man.

697
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:53,209
Another man, what man?

698
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:55,638
The one girl...

699
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,212
they saw, they knew.

700
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:09,190
Relax.

701
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:12,259
I gave you my word.

702
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:37,882
-Watch your shoes.
-Goddamn Turko.

703
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:40,454
Bleeds like a lamb.

704
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:47,396
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

705
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:49,264
$4 million.

706
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:50,594
Gone.

707
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:52,698
Malaka.

708
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:56,508
Anyway, there will be other girls.

709
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,909
This one...

710
00:57:01,515 --> 00:57:03,039
no fingerprints.

711
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:06,985
-No face.
-That's not a problem.
