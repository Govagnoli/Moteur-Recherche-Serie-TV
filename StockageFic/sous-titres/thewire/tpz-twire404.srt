1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,812
You been nipping
at me all night, son.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,644
Thing I got to figure is,

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,877
is you ready to
bite the whole ass?

4
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,908
Ain't me with
a mountain by my elbow.

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,477
Oh, so you
doing all right.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,520
You like the Town Car?

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,720
You young'uns, you

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,698
and hum-fucking VSU

9
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,599
fucking U-ray or some shit,

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,603
I don't know.
See, but me?

11
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,434
I like me a Town Car.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,168
Man look quiet and correct
in one of them.

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,074
So, I tell you what--

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,170
you win this,

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,273
you be sure to pick one
up for yourself, son.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,957
Bye-bye.

17
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,460
Showtime.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,470
Shit, nigger, turn.

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,971
Man got clubs.

20
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,473
One day soon I'm walking out
with a Rolls, hear?

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,712
Way you been going to school
up in this here room, son,

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,118
I suspect you're gonna
walk out of here

23
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,748
with Morgan-fucking-Freeman
to drive it for you, too.

24
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,299
See y'all
next time.

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,636
Yo.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,942
I'm up the grocery
on Monroe.

27
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,278
All right.

28
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,433
Water, $1.

29
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,887
What the fuck?

30
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,619
You think I dream of
coming to work

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,059
up in this shit
on a Sunday morning?

32
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,064
Tell all my friends
what a good job I got?

33
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,623
I'm working to support
a family, man.

34
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,703
Pretend I ain't
talking to you.

35
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,228
Pretend like I ain't
even on this earth.

36
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,468
I know what you are.

37
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,976
And I ain't stepping to,
but I am a man.

38
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,603
And you just
clip that shit

39
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,238
and act like you don't
even know I'm there.

40
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,748
I don't.

41
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,876
I'm here.

42
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,619
Look, I told you
I wasn't stepping to you.

43
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,888
I ain't disrespecting you, son.

44
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,363
You want it
to be one way.

45
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,025
What?

46
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,034
You want it
to be one way.

47
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,365
Man, I don't
know what you're--

48
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,836
- You want it to be one way.
- Man, stop.

49
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,431
Stop saying that.

50
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,835
But it's the other way.

51
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,471
I'm saying, man, the way she
was all, "aah" on Chiquan,

52
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,473
Iike, like,
like, like,

53
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,974
"Laugh now,
stanky bitch!

54
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,135
Laugh now, huh?

55
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,303
How you like this?

56
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,539
How you like I cut your
titties off, huh?"

57
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,773
Man, get the fuck
away from me.

58
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,042
"How you like I carve
your pussy to your chin?"

59
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,845
Yo, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

60
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,475
- What?
- He said leave him be, so leave him be.

61
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,042
- I'm just saying.
- You're just saying.

62
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,884
That's all you
ever do, just say.

63
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,480
Dude, shit was
fucked up.

64
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,888
So it was fucked up.

65
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,454
Her father killed,
like, three police.

66
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,362
- What?
- Nah, it's true.

67
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,867
Her father killed like three police,
and her mama boil cats.

68
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,961
- Nigga, please, man.
- It's what I heard. She boil cats and

69
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,471
serve 'em and shit.

70
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,872
Serve 'em to who,
boiled-cat-eating motherfuckers?

71
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,376
- Who want him some boiled cats, huh?
- Heard that's how she live.

72
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,844
Nigger, you been boiled.

73
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,177
Laetitia live up one of them
group homes off Edmondson.

74
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,342
In them places,

75
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,114
you don't need to eat cats
to make you crazy.

76
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,254
Hey, Coach!

77
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,391
If the boy not coming, you might as
well let me and Michael go in the ring.

78
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,164
Ain't none of y'all
seen Spider today?

79
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,500
I ain't seen him.

80
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,403
Now how in the hell
he gonna fight next week

81
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,771
if he don't
show up to train?

82
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,436
I tell you what--

83
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,775
until the boy shows up
for his lesson,

84
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,213
you can lace 'em up and
step on the mat one time.

85
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,876
Ha ha ha!

86
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,282
No no no no no.

87
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,014
Not him.
Me.

88
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,578
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

89
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,885
Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,892
I'm gonna show you as
gently as I can how much

91
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,985
- you don't know, a'ight?
- A'ight.

92
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,495
Yeah, nigger,
that's yo ass.

93
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,690
You about to get
yo ass whipped.

94
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,006
Your Sabbath best?

95
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,771
You hang around, you can see me
preach on some young'uns,

96
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,212
solemn left and
sanctified right.

97
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,772
Why you down here on
a Sunday, Deacon?

98
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,752
You need to see Ms. Donnelly
at Tilghman Middle.

99
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,583
She's got some custodial work,
you might call it.

100
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,486
Union wage.

101
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,219
- Custodial?
- See Ms. Donnelly tomorrow.

102
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,954
She can explain it
better than I can.

103
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,021
Tell me something--

104
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,861
how is it you got
so much wisdom

105
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,799
about who
should be where?

106
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,497
A good church man
is always up in everybody's shit.

107
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,869
That's how we do.

108
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,301
Yo, Coach,
you ready?

109
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,880
Who's winning?

110
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,476
No one wins.

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,954
One side just
loses more slowly.

112
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,585
Why don't we get
out of the house?

113
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,790
Take a walk.
It's a nice day.

114
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,061
I got this talk I got to
give to my first period...

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,660
about what happened.

116
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,432
An hour.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,808
I got--

118
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,810
I gotta say something
to those kids.

119
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,368
I mean--

120
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,243
Okay.

121
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,683
See?
Somebody's winning.

122
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,257
I didn't expect
you till tomorrow.

123
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,692
I heard my new squad
had the weekend shift.

124
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,697
And besides, I figured
if I got my shit

125
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,494
out of Major Crimes
on the Sunday,

126
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,229
I wouldn't have to run into
that cocksucker Marimow.

127
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,898
Marimow does not
cast off talent lightly.

128
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,703
He heaves it away
with great force.

129
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,369
Freamon got
here Friday.

130
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,208
Yeah, Lester's
quick like that.

131
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,874
There's the colonel's office.

132
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,181
This is my humble abode.
The board.

133
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,813
And over here,
this is your desk.

134
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,855
- It's clean.
- You'll fix that.

135
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,260
A clean desk is
the sign of a sick mind.

136
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,697
Homicide.

137
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,790
Damn.

138
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,028
I don't know where
your chair went.

139
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,400
Make that your
first case.

140
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,496
And put that down, will you?
You live here now.

141
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,709
Ooh, look.

142
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,335
Actual po-lice work.

143
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:49,383
- Any of these?
- He the one, right there.

144
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,946
Just put it
to Fruit's head,

145
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,254
and the next thing Fruit
on the ground flopping,

146
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,055
and his girl
all screaming,

147
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,359
and this pink shit coming out
the side of his head.

148
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,262
"The Bunk,"

149
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,926
working weekends.

150
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,731
The man's dedicated.

151
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,466
I'm gonna partner you with
Crutchfield to get started.

152
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,940
You won't catch anything
as a primary for the first few months.

153
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,274
Give you time
to learn the basics.

154
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,279
Our H files by year.

155
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,180
Witness dump.

156
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,117
Our cut necktie
mausoleum.

157
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,620
The coffee...

158
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,091
and the mailboxes, arranged
by shift and squad.

159
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,018
Lester.

160
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,291
I believe you two refugees
know each other well.

161
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,696
Still getting your
head around it?

162
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,291
A bit, yeah.

163
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,165
You'll do fine.
Just fine.

164
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,536
As tender as this moment may be,
Detective, you've got mail.

165
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,978
You got Lyon
on your ass already?

166
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,481
Another switch-up
on the methane probes.

167
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,109
I'd call that number.

168
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,312
Get on top of that shit
before you catch a case,

169
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,684
chair or no chair.

170
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,327
What the hell is
a methane probe?

171
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,067
Hello, Kathleen O'Shea.

172
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,102
- Yes, hello?
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,810
I need to speak with Mr. Lyon
about the protocols.

174
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,545
I beg your pardon?

175
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,280
Mr. Lyon, please.

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,447
You sound a little
old for this, hon.

177
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,219
Excuse me?
Who is this?

178
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,227
This is Detective
Greggs with the--

179
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,627
This is
the Baltimore City Zoo.

180
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,188
Fine, and this is
Detective Greggs--

181
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,564
and you're calling
for a "Mr. Lion."

182
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,830
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,238
I misdialed.

184
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,073
Hee hee hee.

185
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,976
Methane probe.

186
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,520
- Scarred-up faggot.
- Hmm.

187
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,922
I need to
hunt him down,

188
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,755
'cause there ain't no protection
against that shit.

189
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,226
Huh.

190
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,785
Can't plan
against that nigger.

191
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,525
It's like, like,
you know what he's like.

192
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,862
What he like?

193
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,264
He like one of them
terrorist motherfuckers.

194
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,292
Just blowing up
shit just to.

195
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,497
Don't care who get hurt,
what kind of sense it makes.

196
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,835
He got a point.

197
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,603
And the government, right?

198
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,667
If they have one of
them terrorist attacks,

199
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,508
they cut Delta or
whoever some slack.

200
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,071
The insurance companies,
the banks,

201
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,916
the whole NASDAQ and shit get some
time to pay back what they owe,

202
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,784
because the government know
ain't nothing they could do.

203
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,220
Huh.

204
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,588
Yeah, I know you see it.
You see the big picture.

205
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,059
Problem with niggers today,
they always see the narrow view.

206
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,527
That's nice.

207
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,893
What?

208
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,593
Oh, you like that?

209
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,431
I had it for
a long time now.

210
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,959
It's got some
sentimental values.

211
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,268
- Just a thing.
- What's the real value?

212
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,968
- Huh:
- Real value:

213
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,704
I ain't much
for sentiment.

214
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,371
Oh, you know.

215
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,243
It's been a while
since I checked.

216
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,444
I mean, the fluctuation
in the global economy and all.

217
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,577
- I'll find out for you.
- You don't have to.

218
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,645
I'll find out for you.

219
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,590
Finger's swelled
over the years.

220
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,390
- Need some help?
- Yeah, man, you need help?

221
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,555
Nah, I got it,
I got it.

222
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,929
- Maybe use some spit.
- I don't want the man's spit.

223
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,456
No, I got it now.

224
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,634
Omar ain't no terrorist.

225
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,404
He just another
nigger with a gun.

226
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,934
And you ain't no
Delta Airlines, neither.

227
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,674
You just a nigger
got your shit took.

228
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,511
So, bring me
what you owe

229
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,951
and talk that global
economy mess somewhere else.

230
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,681
Feel me:

231
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,621
Yeah.

232
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,488
I got another game.

233
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,795
How much you
down already?

234
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,064
Learning their ways
requires some patience.

235
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,729
Some money, too.

236
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,329
How much you need
this time out?

237
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,999
A hundred and a half
ought to do.

238
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,100
A hundred and a half?

239
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,704
I take that chicken-nose
fool one day soon.

240
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,476
Take Super Stick, too.

241
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,451
Take 'em all.

242
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,319
Else, maybe I get bored,
send you to take 'em.

243
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,584
And my point,
Colonel Foerster,

244
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,288
is that your man Norris,

245
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,763
he's fucking the dog
on this, way I hear it.

246
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,823
Sir, this is
a top priority case,

247
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,858
and Norris knows there's a possibility
of a murdered state's witness.

248
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,733
We don't even know yet

249
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,465
if that was the motive
for the murder.

250
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,132
This is my point.

251
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,573
Norris is a pro, sir.

252
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,701
His clearance rate this
year says otherwise, Colonel.

253
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,585
Sir, Norris is
good police.

254
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,452
Look Ray, we need someone
who can work it hard,

255
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,048
work it around the clock,
work it till it falls.

256
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,652
And I understand we just pumped
some fresh blood into Homicide--

257
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,162
female, took one in
the line a few years back.

258
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,755
She's never
worked Homicide.

259
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,823
Fresh eyes, then.

260
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,391
But with all
due respect, sir,

261
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,096
if I could guarantee that
no further information

262
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,536
on this case would be
leaked to the press,

263
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,267
certainly not before
election day,

264
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,774
would it be
possible to keep

265
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,400
veteran investigators
working it, sir?

266
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,536
I resent the implication.

267
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,174
My apologies, sir.

268
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,449
You killing my time
coming up here.

269
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,050
And if you ain't noticed,
it's costing us money.

270
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,323
How am I gonna trust you
if you keep telling lies,

271
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,954
saying one thing
and doing another?

272
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,988
I just missed Friday,
that's all.

273
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,625
Look, think on it
like this--

274
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,932
School is work. They're the
same thing right now.

275
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,666
So, you skipping out on school
is like not showing up for work.

276
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,107
And I done heard, made up,
and tested every excuse invented.

277
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,737
So, unless you dead or dying,
there ain't none you can use.

278
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,337
I told you I'm-a go.

279
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,211
Yeah, okay, I know.

280
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,412
For school or out the business,
you are gonna go. Come on.

281
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,783
Falling behind now isn't the way
to start out a school year,

282
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,155
particularly after
a three-year hiatus.

283
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,989
We haven't seen you
since you enrolled.

284
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
Is there a reason
you haven't joined us?

285
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,194
Look, I know you reaching out
for Sherrod.

286
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,762
I want to apologize
for the boy

287
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,139
because he's been working hard
at helping me get a business going.

288
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,666
But he need
to be here though.

289
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,372
Ain't no
bout a-doubt it.

290
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,845
It's up to him,
isn't it?

291
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,472
That's what I've
been trying to say.

292
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,607
That's it right there.

293
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,277
What about it,
young man?

294
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,309
I'm good.

295
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,447
Okay.

296
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,687
One thing though been
bothering me, ma'am--

297
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,287
if Sherrod already missed
the last three years,

298
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,320
should he maybe be back in
the fifth or sixth grade,

299
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,026
instead of up with his age:

300
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,397
I mean, so he can
follow the work.

301
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,867
Social promotion.

302
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,563
Excuse me:

303
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,004
We don't have the resources
to repeat grade levels,

304
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,203
and we feel to place the older children
in the younger classes

305
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,872
is unfair to teachers who are
responsible for maintaining order.

306
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,041
Your nephew has been
socially promoted.

307
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,244
He's an eighth-grader,
headed to high school.

308
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,385
Sorry, but Ms. Johnson's
here about Qadriyyah.

309
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,655
Excuse me for a moment.

310
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,627
- Bill, this is nuts.
- I told him that.

311
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,190
You know if this gets out, who
do you think it's gonna land on?

312
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,466
I got two years to make
40 and a pension bump.

313
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,473
Look, I don't agree
with the call either,

314
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,374
but it's his call,
not yours, not mine.

315
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,399
He's the one
over at City Hall

316
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,378
every day getting
his ass chewed.

317
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,658
I don't care about
nothing you say, man,

318
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,161
'cause if you start
shit, you can't

319
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,164
complain how somebody
finish that shit.

320
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,166
Man, she was on her
from the beginning

321
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,725
with the mirror
and everything, man.

322
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,532
I wouldn't have waited.

323
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,539
Mr. Pryzbylewski,
this is Sherrod.

324
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,841
- And he's all yours.
- Okay.

325
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,143
Take a seat, Sherrod.

326
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,852
Okay, listen up.

327
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,348
I'd like to--
everybody--

328
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,918
everybody,
I'd like to talk--

329
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,123
Listen up!

330
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,468
Now, we all know
something, um,

331
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,630
unpleasant happened
here Friday,

332
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,299
and, look,

333
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,173
I know some of you are still trying
to get your heads around--

334
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,973
Ain't my head
got a big old gash.

335
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,804
And, uh, l'd
like to discuss--

336
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,818
- Yo, is it true that you police?
- What?

337
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,912
Miss Carmandy up in the office say,
"Mr. Prezbo, he police."

338
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,253
- Yo, you police, man?
- You ever shoot somebody?

339
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,757
I think we should
talk about--

340
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,352
He ain't shot no one.
Look at him. Yo,

341
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,589
you ever bust a man
named Ashanti Graham?

342
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,461
Sometimes when
something bad happens--

343
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,467
- That your dad?
- Nah, my brother.

344
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,594
Why can't you tell us
if you shot somebody or not?

345
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,069
- What kind of gun you carry?
- You Narco?

346
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,799
I used to be police.

347
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,330
Now I'm a teacher.

348
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,172
But being a police isn't
just about carrying a gun.

349
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,201
Yeah, right.

350
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,873
It's about working
with the community.

351
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,314
The community?
Y'all ain't been up in my community

352
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,181
in a long time except
to whale on people.

353
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,810
Yo, Mr. P,
you ever been shot?

354
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,548
I mean, like, bah.

355
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,157
Namond,
that's enough.

356
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,060
Get up.

357
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,588
Get up.
Get back in your seats.

358
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,362
Thank you,
very entertaining.

359
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,460
Sit down.
Get in your seats!

360
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,097
Sit down, sit down.
Kwaneese, sit down.

361
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,629
Sit down, now.

362
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,939
Yo, Mr. P, you ever
choke somebody dead like--

363
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,514
Yo, you ever
get videoed?

364
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,218
Mr. P,
Ashanti Graham.

365
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:00,027
You gots to know him.
He was a player for real.

366
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,410
He work Sunday
to Thursday,

367
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,479
7:00 early to
5:00 late.

368
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,083
So, it ain't no
moonlighting thing, then.

369
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,956
Nah, he ain't
no real police.

370
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,360
He full-time on this
Mickey Mouse shit here.

371
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,864
What he do again?

372
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,924
Talked back.

373
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,293
Go over Hilltop now?

374
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,965
Yeah, we got
that, too.

375
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,943
See ya.

376
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,058
Decision time, son.

377
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,684
Yo, what's your play?

378
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,559
Well, I told Little Kevin
right there

379
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,094
to shoot y'all both
in the head twice.

380
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,266
But seeing as he
done walked away...

381
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,071
Oh, you funny.

382
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,772
Yeah, I guess
I'm on your package.

383
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,077
Where the boy at--
Michael?

384
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,447
Well, he ain't
no regular.

385
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,509
He's just working
off a debt.

386
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,715
- Why? Why you care?
- Never mind you why.

387
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,917
"Why" ain't in your
repertoire no more, nigger.

388
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,079
60-40 split on that.

389
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,104
Do not be messing
with Marlo's money.

390
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,289
Randy Wagstaff,

391
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,955
you aren't a sixth-grader,
are you?

392
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,987
Uh, hey, Ms. Reese.

393
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,022
If you were
a sixth-grader,

394
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,967
it would mean you
and the rest of the knuckleheads

395
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,664
would still be in my
first-period English class.

396
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,502
And that would mean
it was two years ago.

397
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,304
And that would mean time stands
still at Tilghman Middle,

398
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,743
and that would
be a catastrophe.

399
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,746
I just forgot and
wore my old shirt today.

400
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,769
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,908
Well, if this isn't your lunch,
then where is your hall pass?

402
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,586
Why not just write
it in crayon?

403
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,354
Come on.

404
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,857
Deacon says you're
a good man.

405
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,058
Good enough to swing
a mop, I guess.

406
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,263
- A mop? More like a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

407
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,771
I get a few fellas like you
to help me out every September.

408
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,397
You go out
on the street,

409
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,408
you find these kids,
you drag them in.

410
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh, a truant officer.

411
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,309
The system
hasn't been funded

412
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,405
for truant officers
in 20 years.

413
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,575
Where the hell you think you are,
Montgomery County?

414
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,677
Nah, I keep a couple
custodial positions

415
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,086
unfilled every year
just for this.

416
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,684
Those kids? You haul 'em in,
you cross 'em off the list.

417
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,217
Each kid, one time,
clear the list.

418
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,923
Come October,

419
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,228
you start on
the list again.

420
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,530
Job's yours if you want it.
Pays $12 an hour.

421
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,129
Excuse me, hon.
Sit.

422
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,317
Why'd you
leave class?

423
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,845
I got hungry,
couldn't concentrate.

424
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,087
Maybe, Randy, you had another
reason for running the halls, huh?

425
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,593
Tagging walls, maybe?

426
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,255
Uh-uh.
You know I don't.

427
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,457
I don't know anything.
I know it's the second week,

428
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,466
and I got walls
covered with tags.

429
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,196
Does that make you feel good,
walking past that?

430
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,601
- I don't know.
- Maybe you don't know,

431
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,037
'cause you're the one
doing the marking.

432
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,132
- I'm not.
- Then who is:

433
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,918
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes, ma'am?

434
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,250
Could you get me the number for
Randy Wagstaff's foster mom?

435
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,085
- Not a problem.
- What you want to call Miss Anna for?

436
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,114
Because you're skipping
class, running the halls,

437
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,921
maybe worse. She's
got a right to know.

438
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,087
- Is this her work number?
- Yes, ma'am.

439
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,189
Hold on. Wait.

440
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,632
The new girl, Greggs--

441
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,161
Sir, if I may,
respectfully--

442
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,833
Norris has
a full plate, okay?

443
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,001
The Braddock case
goes to Greggs.

444
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,034
His plate is fine.

445
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,138
No, it's not. His plate's a pile of
shit, okay? Listen to me.

446
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,173
Burrell wants this case
stalled until everybody votes.

447
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,186
And Rawls?

448
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,619
How the fuck I know
what Rawls wants?

449
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,622
He never said shit.

450
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,715
And let me tell you something,
even he knows this is fucked up.

451
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,726
I have this correct:

452
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,025
We are pulling a veteran off
a pending case and giving it to a rook

453
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,658
so as not to make timely
progress on said case?

454
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,362
The Braddock case
to Greggs.

455
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,232
- A pilot program?
- For one of your middle schools, yes.

456
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,836
- A $200,000 grant is attached.
- Free money.

457
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,044
- I'm just trying to help, Mrs. Conway.
- Help how?

458
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,051
You say that
your target group

459
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,077
is repeat violent
offenders.

460
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,918
Are you in any way
suggesting that

461
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,583
the system's lost
control of the school?

462
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,559
No no no, that's not what
I'm suggesting at all.

463
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,857
The system's fine.
The system's great.

464
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,490
I mean, this isn't
about the system.

465
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,523
We're just gonna
try to find a way

466
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,125
to get to some of
the troubled kids

467
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,295
who won't be in the
system too much longer.

468
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,141
Well, look, just make sure
there's no fuss.

469
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,872
I mean, nothing that gets
anyone upset, you know?

470
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,211
There's an election going on,
and we don't want to put our schools

471
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,979
- in the middle of that mess.
- No, indeed.

472
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,657
Humping a radio car
like a young sprite.

473
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,126
I'm a little bit
proud to know you,

474
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,288
- Officer McNulty.
- Just a little bit?

475
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,696
Well, it ain't like there aren't better
things you could be doing.

476
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,633
- Like what?
- See, I told you, Lester,

477
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,636
the worm has
turned for my boy.

478
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,104
So, I heard they
torpedoed your wiretap.

479
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,130
Yeah, they sent us
a new lieutenant.

480
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,506
- Marimow from E&T.
- "The Unit Killer."

481
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,773
Lester and Kima already
bailed to Homicide,

482
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,372
and now Sydnor's looking to jump
at the first good opening.

483
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,507
So, Major Crimes
is dead, huh?

484
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,574
Yeah, Lester
killed it good.

485
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,085
Went looking
for the money.

486
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,452
Guys like you,
you never learn.

487
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,457
- Guys like me?
- Yeah, 13 years--

488
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,051
- four months.
- Four months.

489
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,062
- Ha ha ha.
- You guys call for backup or what?

490
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,757
Yeah.

491
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,493
We got arrest papers
on a murder

492
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,501
for one Curtis Anderson,
aka "Lex."

493
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,298
He's been on the wing
for a couple of weeks,

494
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,135
so I don't expect him at
his mama's, but you never know.

495
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,801
- What's the address?
- 643 Harlem.

496
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,936
How about you taking the door
with me for old time's sake, Jim?

497
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,173
I'll take the back, gents.

498
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,147
- Oh!
- The back?

499
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,343
Damn, junior, the worm
has turned for you.

500
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,045
You know what they
say about the man

501
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,451
who volunteers
to take the back?

502
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,114
He buys.

503
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,953
B&O Tavern,

504
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,458
tonight at 9:00, son.

505
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,517
- I throw myself out after one.
- Shit.

506
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,085
You don't believe me,
ask Bunk.

507
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,490
True.

508
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,336
The bedroom's clear.

509
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,004
Yeah, basement, too.

510
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,637
Clear.

511
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,113
Yeah.

512
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,019
Clear.

513
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,993
9:00 tonight, McNulty,

514
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,519
B&O Tavern.

515
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,700
He's not here.
I told you.

516
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,269
Is he coming home again?

517
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,681
Ma'am, is
your son alive?

518
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,356
Because if he's not,

519
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,255
we can end
this right now.

520
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,624
Otherwise, we've
got a witness.

521
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,061
That gives us
a murder warrant,

522
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,657
and that warrant says that we
can come through your door

523
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,964
as many times
as necessary.

524
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,733
I don't know
where my son is.

525
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,773
It's like them birds
of yours.

526
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,779
They go out, and they
fly around the city.

527
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,280
They free to do
as they do.

528
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,181
End of the day,
they come back here,

529
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,844
get water, get fed,

530
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,353
'cause they know
you got this place

531
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,582
set up regular
as the rain.

532
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,591
No surprises, 'cause
at the end of the day,

533
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,422
a man don't want
no surprises.

534
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,655
You know,
birds neither.

535
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,253
Same as what
I'm offering.

536
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,026
You part of
a co-op,

537
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,262
a whole lot of surprises
you never worry about again.

538
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,532
You just do
as you do,

539
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,402
knowing the product
will always be there

540
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,929
and be
the finest quality;

541
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,102
knowing that if one
of yours takes a pinch,

542
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,544
he got a lawyer
and a bondsman

543
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,105
waiting for him before he
even step out the wagon.

544
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,776
I know how to
hire lawyers.

545
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,547
It ain't just
about the lawyers.

546
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,315
It's having a connection
so that you know

547
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,322
before the bust
even go down.

548
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,620
What I got to give up
to get that good dope?

549
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,127
Muscle.
You got muscle.

550
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,992
You stand with us,

551
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,998
we run these New York boys
right out of East Baltimore.

552
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,159
Fuck I care about
East Baltimore:

553
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,602
The point of the co-op
is we stand together.

554
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,766
We share information,

555
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,935
and no one fucks
with any of us.

556
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,308
No one fucks
with me now.

557
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,176
Well, that don't
mean there couldn't be

558
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,841
some unforeseen cir--

559
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,385
No one fucks
with me now.

560
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,159
African colors. Subtle.

561
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,228
Tony Gray is
pulling 24% now.

562
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,400
You need new colors and
a new message, Clarence.

563
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,501
You need to
rally the base.

564
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,808
You want me to start
wearing dashikis?

565
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,973
Go all Marion Barry
and shit?

566
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,312
I'll tell you what
I would like--

567
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,148
another 75 in cash
for walk-around money.

568
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,279
75, huh?

569
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,925
Call another game.

570
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,086
It's a waste of time,

571
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,858
and right now,
time is everything.

572
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,298
They're gonna spit in your eye
and endorse Royce.

573
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,767
They only waited this long out
of respect to Tony Gray.

574
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,736
Otherwise, they give
it to Royce months ago.

575
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,363
That's not the point.

576
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,806
You go there uninvited, and you're
only gonna piss them off.

577
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,367
Am l? Or do I piss them off
even more

578
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,504
by pretending that
they don't exist,

579
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,036
that I don't need them?

580
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,276
I've door-to-doored every
neighborhood in this city,

581
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,251
saying I'm ready to be
mayor to all of it,

582
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,550
not just my base,
but all of it.

583
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,215
What does it say I don't
go see these guys?

584
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,746
He's right.

585
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,555
They endorse Royce, fine.
The hell else they gonna do?

586
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,425
But what they say
and don't say

587
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,056
from the pulpit that Sunday
before the primary,

588
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,622
we still got a dog
in that fight.

589
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,862
I do this right,
they'll respect it.

590
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,598
And if they don't,
at least they get to see

591
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,731
a begging-ass
white man on his knees.

592
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,073
Always a feel-good
moment for the folks.

593
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,841
And as to my attendance
at council meetings,

594
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,216
those who know
the job understand

595
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,245
there is more to
being a councilperson

596
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,916
than just the meetings.

597
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,550
Yes, Charles?

598
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,494
Yeah, they putting a halfway house at
the end of my block. Addicts and such.

599
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,760
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

600
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,460
Where you living
at, sir?

601
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,990
800 block North Carrollton.

602
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,367
Oh, I'm gonna take
a look into that.

603
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,701
Is there anyone
with a question

604
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,299
for any of
the other candidates?

605
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,175
Anyone with an issue,
a concern?

606
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,645
Well, I would say
that with regard to

607
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,205
the gentleman's concern
about the halfway house,

608
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,149
that while I share
your concern,

609
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,709
it's also true
that the city has

610
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,948
thousands of drug
addicts in recovery,

611
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,890
and those halfway houses
and shelters have to go someplace.

612
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,088
Though not in
white neighborhoods.

613
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,465
Ma'am, could I see that,
that Royce flyer?

614
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,866
- Thank you.
- Well, that is a fair point as well.

615
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,301
But these are people--

616
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,305
our brothers and sisters,

617
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,500
our children, our friends.

618
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,634
And they are trying
to change their lives,

619
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,339
and so it's up to us to
be responsible for them.

620
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,373
Feel good to miss
a hand, huh?

621
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,044
What's the point?

622
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,315
Eventually, we all
got to ante up.

623
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,015
Yeah, we do.

624
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,080
But I can't believe he
had the balls enough

625
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,149
to call two games
in one month.

626
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,318
I mean, please.

627
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,157
He's loading up on
walk-around money.

628
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,527
He wants cash on the street
come election day.

629
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,929
Carcetti got to him.

630
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,991
Called it a war chest.

631
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,434
Maybe we got us
a war this time.

632
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,304
I wouldn't mind if he wasn't
so fucking ugly with it.

633
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,641
That two pair he bet on,
right into Roger's trip nines.

634
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,647
I folded on a flush.

635
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,205
Full boat, four hands ago.

636
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,014
It's immoral,
what it is.

637
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,120
So, what's
the game, gents?

638
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,490
Clarence's deal.

639
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,894
Texas Hold 'Em.

640
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,296
I begin to understand
the popularity of this game.

641
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,768
No limit.

642
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,237
Oh, peachy.

643
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,067
I was beginning to
think you'd lost it, son.

644
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,079
That living room
shrine of hers

645
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,981
would have shamed
Elvis and Tupac both.

646
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,507
Her son's deader
than both of 'em.

647
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,144
She's just too scared
to say so.

648
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,779
That shit wasn't
there the first time

649
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,847
I talked to her.
I'd have seen it.

650
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,291
- You being a detective and all.
- Mmm-hmm.

651
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,090
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

652
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,764
Hey, look,
she got a friend.

653
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,234
She too young
for you, boy.

654
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,261
Young?

655
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,332
They get younger, William.
Skinnier, too. We don't.

656
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,639
Younger, skinnier--
where's Jimmy?

657
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,408
That's just the nature of
things. Age is age,

658
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,642
fat is fat,
and nature is nature.

659
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,311
- Aw, pitiful.
- And pitiless.

660
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,081
Nature don't care.

661
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,487
Nature just is.

662
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,219
Now my boy Marlo, I thought
he was skewing that.

663
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,954
Screwing what?

664
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,827
- The boy's a young lion.
- "Hello, is Mr. Lyon home?"

665
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,027
And a lion has
to have his kill.

666
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,763
"Methane probe
for Mr. Lyon."

667
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,738
- So then where are my bodies?
- Hmm.

668
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,172
Here I am over here
on the one hand

669
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,436
without a body
in six months,

670
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,444
and here you are
looking for a suspect

671
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,002
who's most likely dead,

672
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,504
and most likely for
dropping one of Marlo's.

673
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,246
Then again, if he's dead,

674
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,120
where's that body?

675
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,091
You know what
the plural of pussy is?

676
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,184
Puss-i.
Jimmy taught me that.

677
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,195
Where's he putting
the bodies, Bunk, huh?

678
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,696
In the sewers:

679
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,358
Rogue funeral
home, maybe?

680
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,696
Yeah, they teach
that fancy-ass Latin

681
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,224
at them Catholic
schools, they do.

682
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,702
- You remember the Eddy Crane case?
- Mmm-hmm.

683
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,762
Word was they put
him in an acid vat

684
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,136
down near Curtis Bay.

685
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,869
Oh, they're coming
up on us now.

686
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,106
Now, for a West Side boy
like Marlo Stanfield,

687
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,875
that would be the traditional
dumping grounds,

688
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,075
- Hey, girl. How are your doing?
- Right?

689
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,084
- Hey, girl.
- Right?

690
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,054
What?
Oh, man.

691
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,919
Jimmy.

692
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,455
Jimmy.

693
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:40,931
Tying to get some
of that puss-i.

694
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,499
What the hell you still
sitting here for?

695
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,471
Fucking Huxtables
and shit, right?

696
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,373
There they go
right there.

697
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,777
He's still
with school.

698
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:59,874
Shit. Just so they can
spring out that shit pile every day.

699
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,181
Make a good run
at that boy,

700
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,313
he'll be on a corner,
no problem, man.

701
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,119
Yeah, we gonna see.

702
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,620
You hung-over?

703
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,597
Just saying you
look like shit.

704
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,123
You know what you need
at a crime scene?

705
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,898
- Rubber gloves.
- Soft eyes.

706
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,132
Like I'm supposed
to cry and shit?

707
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,303
You got soft eyes,
you can see the whole thing.

708
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,141
You got hard eyes,

709
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,840
you're staring at
the same tree,

710
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,575
missing the forest.

711
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,084
Oh, Zen shit.

712
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,087
Soft eyes, Grasshopper.

713
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,792
Lividity puts the time
of death at 7:48,

714
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,962
- give or take.
- Noted.

715
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,471
You're gonna want
to get a chemstat.

716
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,200
- You think?
- Couldn't hurt.

717
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,832
A CDC, too?
Splatter distance?

718
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,137
Yeah, definitely.

719
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,872
You know, where the hell
did my Q-tips go?

720
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,539
Don't sweat it.
I got mine right here.

721
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,378
Oh, good. It's cool.

722
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,849
You want to take a look?
Won't bite.

723
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,221
Hey, uh, don't forget
the, uh, stippling.

724
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,589
I'm a rookie:

725
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,685
There's something
in his hand.

726
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,717
Oh, yeah?

727
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,129
Give her some
tweezers.

728
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,838
"Tater killed me."

729
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,110
Oh, is it typed?

730
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,413
'Cause that would hold up
a lot better in court.

731
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,851
Phone number in
the other hand.

732
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,522
A standard
confidentiality agreement.

733
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,668
And this one?

734
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,366
Oh, that one
indemnifies us

735
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,874
should you or any of
your staff be injured.

736
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,785
- Who wants to get some learning today?
- This way. Move.

737
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,092
- I roll up front with you?
- You got dibs in the back, little man.

738
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,562
- Come on. Hey...
- Don't worry about him.

739
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,536
- We'll catch him later.
- Yeah, little man's so excited

740
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,131
about what's on that blackboard,
he gonna race us.

741
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,640
What's the line
on us so far?

742
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,979
In the teacher's
lounge, I mean.

743
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,678
They're saying you're
this year's Band-Aid.

744
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,708
Is that how
you feel?

745
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,154
I was hoping for
more than that.

746
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,089
This year's
splint?

747
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,116
Hey, Miss Sampson.

748
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,718
Yo, he police.

749
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,397
I mean, the school
system seems benign.

750
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,096
And I get the sense
North Avenue

751
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,731
might give us some
latitude, if not support.

752
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,402
- You think so?
- You sound doubtful.

753
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,909
You can tell the days
by their faces.

754
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,040
The best day
is Wednesday.

755
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,812
That's the farthest
they get from home,

756
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,785
from whatever's going
on in the streets.

757
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,811
You see smiles then.

758
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,618
Monday is angry.

759
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:30,388
Tuesdays, they're caught between
Monday and Wednesday,

760
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,262
so it could go either way.

761
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,391
Thursdays...

762
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,301
they're feeling
that weekend coming.

763
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,998
Friday, it's bad again.

764
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,563
This is where
I leave you.

765
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,937
Oh, your class.

766
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,571
Language arts, huh?

767
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,241
Yes.

768
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,150
Anyway, you should
see it without me.

769
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,154
They behave differently
when I'm around.

770
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,715
No doubt.

771
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,769
What do you think
this 20 stands for?

772
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,474
No, it's not the number
of days you've been suspended.

773
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,483
It's not the number
of years you'll spend

774
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,485
in prison if you
don't shape up.

775
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,852
It's 50% below average.

776
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,357
It's 30% below
failure even.

777
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,292
But, really, it stands
for the amount of interest

778
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,023
you're taking in
your own future.

779
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,372
The next question
is worth two points.

780
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,874
Who can tell me why was

781
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,968
Clarence Mitchell, Jr. important

782
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,275
- to the civil rights movement?
- I know. I know.

783
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,940
And I can tell by
Shalanta's smile,

784
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,382
she's gonna win
for the blue team.

785
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,620
Hey, yo, did you see that one
over there? Hey.

786
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,323
Anybody here
DeShawn Price?

787
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,129
Never heard of him.

788
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,691
And what's your name?

789
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,000
Herbert Brown. This
the roundup van, right?

790
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,699
Oh, yeah,
here you go, my man.

791
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,729
Come on.

792
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,241
Oh, no, yo, no.

793
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,904
Yeah, see, "Howard Brown."

794
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,709
That's my brother. He over
on McHenry Street if you want him.

795
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,238
I was just in
school on Friday,

796
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,810
so I'm phat till
October. Sorry.

797
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,913
- Whoa, hold up, my man.
- Nah, he's right.

798
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,890
School gets a certain
amount of money

799
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,894
for each kid that shows
up one day in September

800
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,396
- and one day in October.
- One day?

801
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,660
After that, they don't
lose the government money,

802
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,189
so we done with it.

803
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,202
Nah nah, man.
School is school.

804
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to
school you, brother.

805
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,506
All right,

806
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,235
which one of y'all still
need your September day?

807
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,176
Get it over with now,

808
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,645
we won't be messing
with y'all later.

809
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,622
What up, Butch?

810
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,236
How do we begin?

811
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,212
You the one
called the meet.

812
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,647
Why don't we begin by you
respecting my time and getting to it?

813
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,082
First of all,
I heard you may be

814
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,111
under the impression
I was somehow involved

815
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,713
with the late Mr. Bell,

816
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,282
in his play against you
with Brother Mouzone.

817
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,395
I was no way involved.
Stringer came at me

818
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,591
to set up the parley
with you.

819
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,863
He used me like
he used y'all,

820
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,391
I feel the need to say.

821
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,405
It's said then.
Tip out on it.

822
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,066
Businessman such as myself

823
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,769
does not believe
in bad blood

824
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,141
with a man
such as yourself.

825
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,908
- Disturbs the sleep.
- Oh, I bet it do.

826
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,313
By way of amends,
a proposition.

827
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,754
I know of a card game
on the West Side--

828
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,653
high rollers,
lots of cash money,

829
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,988
boxcar-sized.

830
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,653
You trying to
set me up, Joe?

831
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,991
You ever known me
to be stupid?

832
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,691
I'm trying to make things
right here with you.

833
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,426
How much we talking about?

834
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,229
If there ain't at least
a few hundred K in that room,

835
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,896
I wish myself blind.

836
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,495
Serious, Joe.

837
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,938
I say again,

838
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,999
have you ever known me
to be a stupid man?

839
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,069
- What are the strings?
- No strings.

840
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,808
- What's your cut then?
- Quarter of the take.

841
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,151
I scope this and it
don't look right,

842
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,848
I'm gonna come back
on you now, Joe.

843
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,889
Where did everybody go?

844
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,865
- Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?
- Sir.

845
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,309
- And you must be Dozerman.
- Yes, sir.

846
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,711
Welcome to Major Crimes.
I'm Lieutenant Marimow.

847
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,117
I see you just made
sergeant after driving

848
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,746
the mayor around for less
than three months.

849
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,415
You must be
a hell of a driver.

850
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,656
Anyone here?
Greggs? Freamon?

851
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,025
Sydnor and Massey.

852
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,860
And they're on the street,
making rips.

853
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,456
That's what we
do here now.

854
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,936
We get on the street
and we rip and run.

855
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,097
Can you get
with that, Sergeant?

856
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,232
The Western
District way, sir.

857
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:54,045
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

858
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,398
Thanks for seeing me.

859
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,371
I understand you've
already heard from

860
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,236
Mayor Royce and
from Councilman Gray,

861
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,741
and I'd like to thank
you for being able

862
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,266
to join in this process.

863
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,378
I don't expect to walk out
of this room today

864
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,541
with an endorsement from

865
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,813
the lnterdenominational
Ministerial Alliance.

866
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,376
I don't.

867
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,479
But the point is...

868
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,287
I think I can be a better mayor for
Baltimore than the present one.

869
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,691
I voted for Clarence Royce
eight years ago.

870
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,128
I voted for him four
years after that.

871
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,725
I felt there was
promise in the man.

872
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,167
But now
I'm disappointed.

873
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,103
I'm disappointed
and I'm angry

874
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,867
at the crime
and the waste

875
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,068
and the damage done
to so many neighborhoods.

876
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,940
Not just in my district,
but here on the West Side--

877
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,445
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.

878
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,948
Wherever I go, people
want the same things.

879
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,382
They need the same things,

880
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,943
but they're just
not getting them.

881
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,454
I'm gonna change that.

882
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,890
I'm not gonna ask
for your vote now.

883
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,416
Maybe I haven't
earned it yet.

884
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,860
But I am here to say
that when I am mayor,

885
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,364
my door is open to you, regardless
of who you endorse.

886
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,196
And I want you to remember

887
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,794
that I came here today
to say these things.

888
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,733
Thank you.

889
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,678
Councilman.

890
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,682
Thank you for coming.

891
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,112
Okay, I'm gonna need an APB
on a motherfucker named Tater.

892
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,661
"Call Mr. Sweet ASAP"?

893
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,259
Let me guess--

894
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,031
The Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.

895
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,064
Uh-oh.
She's catching on, boys.

896
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,003
Oh, and what do you want?

897
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,012
Another methane probe?

898
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,571
Or some other
"CSl" bullshit that don't exist?

899
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,478
You're the primary
on the Braddock case.

900
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,544
The dead witness.

901
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,419
Norris is back
in the rotation.

902
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,617
What?

903
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,688
You caught your first murder.
Kudos.

904
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,868
Come on, man, damn.

905
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,140
Bam bam, yeah.

906
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,043
Do that to whoever
be snitching.

907
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,479
Who snitching?

908
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,983
Don't know,
but kids be snitching.

909
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,576
Rashid got suspended
for tagging walls, yo.

910
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,348
Y'all ain't heard?

911
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,253
How you know he ain't just
get caught with a paint can?

912
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,952
'Cause Ms. Donnelly came and
pulled him out of the classroom.

913
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,721
Bam.

914
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,058
Yo, I'll see
y'all later, man.

915
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,255
Yo, you going
past the gym?

916
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,390
All right, man.
Peace, peace.

917
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,726
I ain't gonna tell
you again.

918
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,263
Give me the remote.

919
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,868
Did y'all learn
something today?

920
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,637
Y'all learn
something today?

921
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,649
Yeah.

922
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,742
What y'all learn?

923
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,186
I said give me
the remote.

924
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,985
- Mmm-mmm.
- Give it.

925
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,425
Math your favorite, right?
Start with it.

926
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,452
I like math.

927
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,329
Yeah, you good
at it, too.

928
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,926
Watched this show
five damn times.

929
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,174
Hey, you good?

930
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,875
All right now.

931
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,584
So, it turns out
the one girl...

932
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,853
200-something stitches
to close her up.

933
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,588
She's looking at a lot of rehab
and maybe more surgery.

934
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,619
The muscles in her face
don't even move right.

935
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,723
How's the class seem:

936
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,394
Like it didn't
really happen.

937
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,666
They're still processing. I know
it doesn't seem so, but they are.

938
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,970
What about Laetitia?
What happens to her?

939
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,170
Nothing worse
than she's already seen.

940
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,179
She'll probably go to
a juvenile facility,

941
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,080
which is only a little
worse than her group home.

942
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,447
She was in a group home?

943
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,974
She grew up
in the system.

944
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,486
Monday-to-Friday angry.

945
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,715
Last year, she was
suspended twice,

946
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,348
and then expelled.

947
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,086
Chiquan wasn't
positive though,

948
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,787
if you're looking for
a silver lining and all.

949
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,351
Excuse me:

950
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,660
She didn't have HlV,
in case you were worrying.

951
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,272
Marcus. Boy, what are you
trying to do?

952
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,568
You trying to
get knocked out?

953
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,633
Drop your head, son.

954
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,803
Left up! Get that left up!

955
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,507
Pick your hand up.
Damn!

956
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,778
Man, that boy
listen to anyone?

957
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:57,642
All right, all right.

958
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,211
Time, time.

959
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,554
Not bad, y'all.
Not bad, Justin.

960
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,424
Marcus, you got to concentrate,
man. Think.

961
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,395
All right?

962
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,661
Listen, I got tickets
to the fights tonight,

963
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,462
Pikesville Armory.

964
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,526
Now, I was gonna
take Justin and Spider,

965
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,037
but Spider ain't
been hanging out,

966
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,903
and, Marcus, I know you
got your mother, right?

967
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,738
So, Michael,

968
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,073
you want to see
the fights?

969
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:26,078
- You going?
- Yeah, I'm in.

970
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,446
Yeah, all right.

971
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,680
All right.

972
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,415
Come on, get this
headgear off.

973
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,559
What the fuck
is that?

974
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,160
Souvenir.

975
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,431
What?

976
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,567
Trouble with doing
it this way,

977
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,371
disappearing
'em and shit--

978
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,775
Nobody knows.

979
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,083
I remember when
I was a kid,

980
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:06,078
if you had a map
of the world,

981
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,091
the playground over
at Baker and Moreland

982
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,593
would be at
the center of it.

983
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,618
And as I got older,

984
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,426
the playground just
kept on getting bigger,

985
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,023
went beyond
the neighborhood.

986
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,929
Everything changes,
you know?

987
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,269
One minute
the ice cream truck

988
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,399
be the only thing
you want to hear.

989
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,313
Next thing, them touts
calling out the heroin

990
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,083
be the only thing
you can hear.

991
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,292
What's that?

992
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,768
Workbook I need
to use with this.

993
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,906
So you read from
the small one

994
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,469
and answer questions
in the big one?

995
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,777
Yeah, ain't no thing.

996
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,551
Yeah, I see that.

997
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,471
I see that.

998
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,801
All right, you see how
he keeping his hands up?

999
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,803
Look at his feet.
Look at their feet.

1000
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,270
See how they keep
their feet moving?

1001
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,901
See what I'm saying?

1002
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,672
See how he stay
in close?

1003
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,771
That's how you take
away his power.

1004
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,679
Yo, dude is cut.

1005
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,240
Yeah, man.

1006
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,717
That's discipline.

1007
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,653
You take care your body,
your body take care of you.

1008
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,389
Yo, I bet his woman
is fine, man.

1009
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,327
Yeah, I bet
she is, too.

1010
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,469
Flush to the queen.

1011
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,165
Full house.

1012
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,441
All right, everybody,

1013
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:42,911
Iet me see them
hands, yo.

1014
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,436
Hands.

1015
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,641
Hey, yo, big man,
back up.

1016
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,650
I don't know about cards,

1017
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,051
but, uh, I think these four-fives
beat a full house.

1018
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,351
Hey, yo, banker,
cash me out, yo.

1019
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,358
Boy, you want a head on
that body, you best hop to.

1020
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,624
That's my money.

1021
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,633
Man, money ain't
got no owners,

1022
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:06,931
only spenders.

1023
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,030
I tell you something else--
I like that ring, too.

1024
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,607
Boy, you got me confused
with a man repeats himself.

1025
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,616
This ain't over.

1026
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,528
Oh, that's how you
carrying it, Shorty, huh?

1027
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,054
'Cause I can find
your peoples

1028
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,363
a whole lot easier
than they can find me.

1029
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,931
Wear it in health.

1030
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,708
No doubt.

1031
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,282
You see what I'm
talking about, Justin?

1032
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,724
That's what I'm saying.
That's the real deal.

1033
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,194
You keep training, I'm telling you,
boy, you can get there.

1034
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,959
See, the last fight
was the best.

1035
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,125
The Puerto Rican boy
had a good left.

1036
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,032
Yeah, shit was tight.

1037
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,468
Oh, this is it,
right here on the right.

1038
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,165
All right.

1039
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,474
- All right now.
- All right,

1040
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,374
- I'll see you tomorrow, Coach.
- All right.

1041
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,322
All right, now,
so you live over on--

1042
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,518
Hey hey, my boy,
what you doing?

1043
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,857
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, no, thank you.

1044
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,864
Michael, come on now,
serious.

1045
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,298
Nah, no thank you.
I'm good from here.
