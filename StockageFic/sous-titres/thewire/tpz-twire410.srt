1
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,225
You've got
to be shitting me.

2
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,127
Oh, shit!

3
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,860
Get out of the way!

4
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,736
- Driving all crazy.
- Damn.

5
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,368
16. I've got a foot chase
on a number-one male.

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,638
Maybe 13 years,
short, with braids,

7
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,111
in the alleys
eastbound from Fulton.

8
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,774
This kid has bailed out!
Bailed out!

9
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,149
Motherfucking fuck fuck
fuck fuck!

10
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,653
Officer, what
are you doing?

11
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,587
What, you need
bifocals or something?

12
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,489
What?

13
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,288
0-9. I'm responding.

14
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,988
16, 200 north.

15
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,894
I'm gonna need your name.

16
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,695
Listen. I'm very sorry,
ma'am, all right?

17
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,360
Give me the hat.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Nah, see, them Expeditions
are hard to handle.

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,002
But with a Lexus, man
I wouldn't have no problem.

20
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,873
You little motherfucker.

21
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,680
- You know how many cars you hit?
- What?

22
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,979
Don't even think
of bullshitting.

23
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,649
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,168
You know what kind of fucking
paperwork I got now, huh?

25
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,106
You know how many hours
of my life you owe me, you little shit?

26
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,006
Damn, yo! That hurt!

27
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,772
You think that hurts...

28
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,608
No, no. Aah!

29
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,474
You're so smart,

30
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,918
- see how easy you boost a car now.
- Aah!

31
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,295
You imagine Rawls
sitting in this chair?

32
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,095
Never happen.
In this town: Uh-uh.

33
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,399
Yeah, well, we weren't supposed
to have a white mayor, either.

34
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,531
He already overreached
putting Rawls in charge.

35
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,404
De-fucking-facto.

36
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,103
Motherfucker ain't
even sworn in yet.

37
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,044
Already, he's got
feelers out.

38
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,344
I know for a fact he called
the deputy chief in Pittsburgh--

39
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,406
Friend of mine--

40
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,283
promised him pie in the sky.

41
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,185
Shi-it, partner.

42
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,190
All you got to do is show
Carcetti and everybody else

43
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,454
that they already got
the man for the job.

44
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,155
They ain't got
to look no further.

45
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,720
The indispensable man.

46
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,494
It was Royce
holding you back, Ervin.

47
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,229
Now out from under,
you shine.

48
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,603
Clay, he's saying everything
goes through Bill Rawls.

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,631
Any move I try to make--

50
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,404
You're still
the commissioner, ain't you?

51
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,809
You give an order,
they gonna jump.

52
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,405
- Yeah, but Carcetti--
- What he gonna do, fire you?

53
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,178
He just showed you
he don't have balls enough.

54
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,050
You just need to give
Carcetti a little something.

55
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,616
Make him start seeing
you in a new light.

56
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,058
Like what:

57
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,654
Some kind of police shit.
Hell, I don't know.

58
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,460
Something that
looks good to Carcetti,

59
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,400
so he can say it was his idea
to keep you all along.

60
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,096
Hmm.

61
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,434
Police shit:

62
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,441
Well, whatever it is
y'all do for a living.

63
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,239
Well-- just take care
of your end

64
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,212
and let your friends
handle theirs.

65
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,616
Good morning.

66
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,591
I just dropped my stuff
in my room,

67
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,060
and maintenance and Donnelly
are in there checking the heat.

68
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,689
It must be
80 degrees in there.

69
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,699
90-minute classes.

70
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,223
Excuse me:

71
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,998
This time of the year,
we go to 90-minute classes.

72
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,701
Concentrated prep in math
and language arts only.

73
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,404
I don't follow.
Why the heat?

74
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,381
It's the only way the kids will
sit through 90 minutes of anything.

75
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,214
- Make them drowsy?
- Right.

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,776
So it's about the tests.

77
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,984
From now until they're done,
everything's about the tests.

78
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,821
Damn!

79
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,298
I ought to go somewhere
warm for the winter.

80
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,198
Where?

81
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:20,569
I saw on "Animal Planet"
marlin fishing--

82
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,938
Iike, Florida,
the Bahamas.

83
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,443
That shit looked sweet.

84
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,744
The water was like this...
this color, man.

85
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,216
Man, it ain't gonna be
that cold this year.

86
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,981
- How you know?
- Global warming.

87
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,682
So why is it so cold already?

88
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,919
Yo, we just getting old.

89
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,655
Yeah. True that.

90
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,890
Yo. Where the fuck you been?

91
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,456
City jail
for a day and a half

92
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,797
till they recogged me.

93
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,498
Then my grandma got sick,
so I was over there for a while.

94
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,267
Po-Po hit you
with a charge, huh?

95
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,071
Just a humble--
false statement and shit,

96
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,168
for saying I wasn't
who I really was.

97
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,273
Damn, so why they was
asking about you like that?

98
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,374
Hmm-mmm.

99
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,475
They try talking to you?

100
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,486
Yeah, about some murder.

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,988
- Which one?
- It don't matter which murder

102
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,547
because I didn't say shit
to them bitches, though.

103
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,993
Yeah, well, I ain't the one
you need to convince.

104
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,597
Why I got to convince him?

105
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,896
You know, I'm saying, yo.

106
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,369
Po-Po come asking about you,
they snatch your ass up,

107
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,372
you out of pocket
for a few days.

108
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,842
Heh! Oh, yeah.
He'll definitely hear about it.

109
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,538
I didn't say nothing
to nobody.

110
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,375
That's why they
gave me the humble,

111
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,472
dumped my ass
in Central Booking,

112
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,643
because I ain't say
a fucking word to none of them.

113
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,481
Yeah, so go tell him
that shit.

114
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,047
Shit, man, if it were me,
I'd go to him first.

115
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,183
Yeah, Kev, you know, definitely
jump out in front of that, man,

116
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,557
because if they got
to come looking for you,

117
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,084
it's gonna look like
you got something to hide.

118
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,994
- Definitely.
- Got that "Plymouth Rock" over here.

119
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,556
Ghetto bird special.
Two for one...

120
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,229
What you want?

121
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,636
- Menu, yo. Give him a menu.
- Oh.

122
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,811
- What's good?
- Fuck if I know.

123
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,245
You ain't supposed to cuss
at the customer, motherfucker.

124
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,806
Kwame. Darnell.

125
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,442
All right.

126
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,953
Let me get... pizza.

127
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,285
Pizza. Anything to drink?

128
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,847
Grape soda.

129
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,825
Quiet, please.

130
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,454
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,259
Thank you. Say thank you.

132
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,856
Yeah. Thank you.

133
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,389
Menu:

134
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,925
Don't he got to say
"thank you," too?

135
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,994
Darnell.

136
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,131
What the fuck for?
He's supposed to give it back.

137
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,573
Because when you are polite
to people, they treat you better.

138
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,634
- Have a seat, please.
- May I see you?

139
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,374
Now you try being the waiter,
and Albert, be the customer.

140
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,714
What you want to eat?

141
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,310
Give me some crab cakes
and a coke.

142
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,549
Hurry that shit up, too.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,150
Been on the phone
nonstop with Fourth Avenue.

144
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,025
They're insisting every class
teaches to the test.

145
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,189
Oh, God.

146
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,061
Look. I thought
we were the exception.

147
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,158
I mean, that's the point
of the project.

148
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,227
- They know that.
- No exceptions.

149
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,899
And 90-minute blocks of math
or language arts only.

150
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,771
This class:

151
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,800
Kids can't do 30 minutes
without climbing the walls.

152
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,937
Look. Isn't there somebody
we can sit down and talk with,

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,641
face to face?

154
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,706
Actually, that's the second thing
they told me.

155
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,480
The area superintendent wants to see
the two of you tomorrow morning,

156
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,454
9:00 in the conference room.

157
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,652
Let's not panic... yet.

158
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,978
Business as usual.

159
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,577
Marlo.

160
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,554
You no know him
when we robbed the game?

161
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,683
He ain't that bad a deuce.

162
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,625
Boy's merely a name to me.

163
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,458
If you knew it was Marlo,

164
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,934
you'd still
go through with it, no?

165
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,496
I wish I'd have known. I'd
have enjoyed it that much more.

166
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,346
Bubs.

167
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,082
It's Herc. You hungry?

168
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,350
Yo, what you done
was fucked up, man.

169
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,622
You don't know how bad
I felt when I heard.

170
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,424
I mean, not only
were you late,

171
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,489
you just rolled right past.
Ain't you see me getting beat?

172
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,330
We rolled by?

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,029
I seen you with
the blue light on, man.

174
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,096
Whatever. Look, we had
a communication problem, I admit.

175
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,766
But I'm gonna
get you a phone today,

176
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,605
and that's gonna
solve it for us.

177
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,702
You'll see.

178
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,007
Thing is,
there's this camera--

179
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,711
police department video camera
disappeared a few weeks back.

180
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,721
And for various reasons
that I can't get into,

181
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,518
I got to get it back somehow.

182
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,888
Camera?

183
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,984
Yeah. This fella Marlo
probably took it.

184
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,619
I don't know if he
hocked it or if he--

185
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,823
You're bothering me
about a camera?

186
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,491
You supposed to have
my back, remember?

187
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,556
Five minutes, you told me.

188
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,932
I know. I owe on the deal.

189
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,663
It's Tyrone's, chicken wings.

190
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,971
Here's the thing.

191
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,984
I want you
to put it out there

192
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,851
that there's a $500 bounty
on this camera if it comes back.

193
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,118
No questions asked.

194
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,624
500?

195
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,684
Swear to God. I'm good for it--
if it's the right camera.

196
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,889
Here's the model
and serial number.

197
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,958
So it's 500 for the camera and
a chicken box for Bubs, huh?

198
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,936
It's another 100
to you if this happens.

199
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,166
But I need this camera quick,
or shit's gonna fly.

200
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,696
Look, man,

201
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,606
I told you, it's not about
the money for me right now.

202
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,110
All right?
This motherfucker,

203
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,669
he messing with
my livelihood here.

204
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,307
They're always
coming back, always.

205
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,112
He's like some
"Terminator" and shit.

206
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,675
I'm with you.

207
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,687
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you out with your problem,

208
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,689
and you're gonna help
me out with mine.

209
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,297
Who the fuck is Randy?

210
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,668
He's a little hopper
from around the way.

211
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,196
He ain't in the game, but he
be with Michael and them.

212
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,833
And he talking to police?

213
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,867
I know it.
I know he did,

214
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,506
because he was the one I told, "Go
tell Lex to go up to the alley.

215
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,913
Patrice is waiting."

216
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,143
You were supposed to do that.

217
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,651
Yeah, I know, but this way,

218
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,143
try to keep some distance
between me and Lex, right?

219
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,120
You tell this Randy
what happened to Lex?

220
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,527
No, I swear it.

221
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,867
Go, motherfucker.
The fuck you still waiting for?

222
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,408
- What the fuck y'all following me for?
- Easy, son.

223
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,780
No. Ain't nobody
walking with me nowhere.

224
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,500
What's up with this Randy?

225
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,566
He can't hurt us.

226
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,670
- He a snitch, though.
- Yeah. Put that around, then.

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,147
- Slim.
- Marlo.

228
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,879
- How you feeling?
- Can't complain, yo.

229
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,581
Getting to be
that time, though.

230
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,351
Joe wanted me
to check in, you know?

231
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,723
All right. Pull up
a chair. Let's chop it up.

232
00:14:56,595 --> 00:15:00,122
Now, that there
a Barksdale boy.

233
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,463
So?

234
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,128
Don't add up.

235
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,663
Interesting, though.

236
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,483
Got a burner, see?

237
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,059
If anything else
comes up, you call me.

238
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,725
If this guy robs you again, make sure
he's holding. The more, the better.

239
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,792
Shit, I ain't got
money for all that.

240
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,937
There's 40 minutes on that,

241
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,776
and my number's
in there already.

242
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:52,045
Watch. I'm gonna call you
today or tomorrow at the latest.

243
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,454
One and one.

244
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,083
Damn, son.
He did a number on you.

245
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,650
Who was it?

246
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,129
Officer Walker.

247
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,791
Walker be evil.

248
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,598
- What up?
- Four.

249
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,766
Yeah, we ought
to fuck him up.

250
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,275
Walker? Yo, he the police.

251
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,106
I'm just saying.

252
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,805
He said next time
I steal a car,

253
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,575
I'm gonna find myself dead.

254
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,842
You gonna do as he say?

255
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,315
Fuck no.

256
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,909
Soon as I get this shit off,

257
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,012
I'll be running his ass
all over town.

258
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,647
Yo, shit!

259
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,852
Told you, Namond.

260
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,556
Gave you fair warning, didn't l?

261
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,964
- I ain't done nothing.
- Get the cash. Got you cold.

262
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,992
Shit, with hair like that, I could
make you from East Baltimore.

263
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,698
- Get the fuck off of me, man.
- Shut up!

264
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,912
- Look what I found.
- That ain't fucking mine!

265
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,538
Hands on the car!

266
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,378
Spread your legs.

267
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,646
- I ain't fucking got--
- Shut up!

268
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,684
How you like it
so far? Having fun?

269
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,658
Guess what?
Gets better.

270
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,320
Give me your hands.

271
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,658
Watch your head.

272
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,700
Damn. Y'all not
wasting any time, huh?

273
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,209
Nerese was
good enough to let us

274
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,678
stage in the council suite
till the inauguration.

275
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,580
No doubt after your fine
showing in the general.

276
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,743
- No doubt.
- 81%?

277
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:37,279
82. In a city where Democrats
outnumber Republicans nine to one--

278
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,587
Anything less would have
been an embarrassment.

279
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,821
So...

280
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,160
what can we do
for you, Senator?

281
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,362
Well, first of all,
I wanted to clear the air.

282
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,768
If there are any hard feelings
over what happened

283
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,295
during the primary--

284
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,931
You gonna give
the money back?

285
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,446
Senator, it's been
a very long day.

286
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,609
I'll cut to the chase.

287
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,380
I understand
you have a problem

288
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,751
at the top of
the police department.

289
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,189
You asked Burrell
to resign. He declined.

290
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm looking
for a replacement.

291
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,563
The ministers like Burrell.
So does the council president.

292
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,556
We're confident that when we
identify a suitable candidate,

293
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:27,300
Ms. Campbell and the ministers will see
the wisdom of new leadership.

294
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,400
Except y'all need to get a
pay raise through the city council.

295
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,741
Pay raise would help.

296
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,579
I can ask Nerese about
that pay raise getting passed,

297
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,413
maybe convince
some of the ministers

298
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,648
they need to move on
from Burrell.

299
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,359
Situation would have to be resolved
sooner rather than later.

300
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,624
Do my best, partner.

301
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,929
And what do we do
for you in return?

302
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,135
I'm in Annapolis.

303
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,332
Word I'm hearing,

304
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,898
you may be there too,
in a couple of years.

305
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,311
We may find ourselves
working together closely.

306
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,178
Thanks for your time.

307
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,282
Jesus Christ.

308
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,845
He's slick.

309
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,450
Apologizes for the short con,

310
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,552
and then in the next breath
setting us up for the long.

311
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,222
He and Burrell are
as thick as thieves.

312
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,993
And do we know
what the long con is?

313
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,091
At least we know
he's running one.

314
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,659
Shiiiii...

315
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,470
Try calling again.

316
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,913
Man, I know she not
gonna answer.

317
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,383
My moms don't answer
when she go to A.C.

318
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,215
When she coming back?

319
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,811
She going to New York after.

320
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,289
What's she doing in New York?

321
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,951
Shopping.

322
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,653
Going to see some show,
"The Color Purple."

323
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,997
See, now this is where
my job gets good.

324
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,265
You could reach a guardian, we both know
the juvenile master's gonna recog you

325
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,169
on a first-time drug arrest.

326
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,766
But now you'd better have
a toothbrush on you, son,

327
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,106
because it's gonna be
baby booking tonight.

328
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,277
Namond, you scared?

329
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,649
I mean, if it was Cheltenham,
I don't blame you,

330
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,125
but baby booking's
just across town.

331
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,960
The East Side be beefing
with the West Side in there.

332
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,727
There's some dudes
be getting raped and shit.

333
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,069
I mean, that's
what I be hearing.

334
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,205
It's bad in there.
I don't know if it's that bad.

335
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,403
Well, I hear different.

336
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,252
You got no other family?

337
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,380
I got a aunt
down in P.G. County.

338
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,787
You got a number?

339
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,158
Well, I ain't driving you
this late, anyway, so--

340
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,254
Come on, man.

341
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,240
Tell you what:

342
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,573
two of my guys
are working a double,

343
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,601
working midnight shift
tonight.

344
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,114
If you can plant yourself
on that bench over there,

345
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,581
you can stay here
for the night.

346
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,050
But first thing tomorrow,
you got to raise that aunt

347
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,347
or raise your moms,

348
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,446
or I got to process you.

349
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,222
You don't move
off that bench.

350
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,230
You need the bathroom,
you go now.

351
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,562
Otherwise, just...
sit tight,

352
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,124
don't give anybody
any trouble,

353
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,931
or they'll process you
right then and there.

354
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,768
I'm cool. Thanks.

355
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,633
Fucking charity ward here.

356
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,244
I'll go tell
the shift commander.

357
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,040
Yo, Lieutenant...

358
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,458
He a 50:

359
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,793
No. Probably copping
it for my moms.

360
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,664
That's why?

361
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,169
Look. I told y'all,

362
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,932
I just want him gone.

363
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,201
I just want him away
from me and Bug.

364
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,367
The fuck he do to you?

365
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,509
All right.

366
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,247
We'll take care of it, boss.

367
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,298
Another church burglary
in sector two last night.

368
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,460
Madison Park Methodist.

369
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,732
This would be what
you'd call a rash.

370
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,398
And we could use
some ointment.

371
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,670
We need to arrest these fucks.
We getting anywhere on that?

372
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,176
Not yet.

373
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,838
Who caught the last one?
McNulty?

374
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,144
- Working it. We should talk.
- All right.

375
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,049
Speaking of arrests, word from
on high is to sweep corners.

376
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,315
They want arrests to double
over the next month.

377
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,821
How the fuck how:

378
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,323
Jesus, I thought
the election was over.

379
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,450
Bosses want quality-of-life
violations.

380
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,927
What are we talking about,
Lieutenant, loitering?

381
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,623
Disorderlies,
public indecency.

382
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,823
Oh, this is horseshit.

383
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,026
- Broken-windows theory.
- Worked in New York.

384
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,398
Case you ain't noticed,
this ain't New York.

385
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,424
But it could work here.

386
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,334
- Never has.
- Never been done right.

387
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,305
Open containers, too.

388
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,831
- What's wrong with writing a ticket?
- More of that, too.

389
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,811
The word is, the commissioner
himself wants to juke arrests.

390
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,972
Open container used to be
sacrosanct in this town.

391
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,276
Long as it was in a paper bag.

392
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,839
They gave you
that much respect.

393
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,580
Man's beverage
was his business.

394
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,349
You took them
to a restaurant?

395
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,117
Yeah. Ruth Chris.

396
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,715
Linen napkins.

397
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,022
Yeah. Silverware,
more than one fork.

398
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,254
How'd they do?

399
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,424
Eh, pretty well, considering.

400
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,297
Did they embarrass us?

401
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,565
Us? No, uh...
we're fine with it,

402
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,094
but, uh...

403
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,800
I mean, they were
intimidated, embarrassed,

404
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,433
and awkward as hell,

405
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,706
but they made it through.

406
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,576
Ms. Shepherdson,
these aren't the kids

407
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,911
that are gonna be able to sit
still for the statewide tests,

408
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,177
much less do well on them.

409
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,344
These were the kids
that were gonna make it impossible

410
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,512
for anyone else to do well.

411
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,749
So we're writing them off?

412
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,349
No, that's what
we're not doing.

413
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,758
You're not educating them.
You're socializing them.

414
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,354
They weren't being educated before.
There's no point in being obtuse.

415
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,093
- Excuse me:
- Hold on. Hold on.

416
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,657
Look. What he's
saying is this:

417
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,999
I mean, you put a textbook
in front of these kids,

418
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,265
put a problem
on a blackboard,

419
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,330
or teach them every problem
on some statewide test,

420
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,534
it won't matter, none of it,

421
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,670
because they're not learning for
our world, they're learning for theirs.

422
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,010
And they know exactly
what it is they're training for

423
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,675
and what it is everyone
expects them to be.

424
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,207
I expect them to be students.

425
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,279
But it's not about you or us,
or the tests or the system.

426
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,757
It's what they expect
of themselves.

427
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,727
I mean, every single one of them
know they headed back to the corners.

428
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,252
Their brothers and sisters--
shit, their parents--

429
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,266
they came through these same
classrooms, didn't they?

430
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,995
We pretended to teach them,
they pretended to learn,

431
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,230
and where--
where'd they end up?

432
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,331
Same damn corners.

433
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,036
I mean, they're
not fools, these kids.

434
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,342
They don't know our world,
but they know their own.

435
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,780
I mean, Jesus, they--

436
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,750
they see right through us.

437
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,552
I think we made that clear
when you approved the project.

438
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,921
Provisionally approved.

439
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,687
When you provisionally
approved the project,

440
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,558
we made it clear that we
would be addressing children

441
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,688
that required socialization

442
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,255
before they could be
properly educated.

443
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,961
We can't lie.

444
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,459
Not to them.

445
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,236
Captain, line three.

446
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,604
Roll call's over.

447
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,983
You get a line
on your mother yet?

448
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,285
Fucking neglect case
here, I want it.

449
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,651
How about that aunt:

450
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,826
Ain't nobody else you know?
No other responsible adult?

451
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:11,995
Like who:

452
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,299
I don't know.

453
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,272
I'm just trying to give you
one last shot here

454
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,740
because once I go
on the street today,

455
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,299
you're gonna
have to go to booking.

456
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,374
I got a teacher.

457
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,042
Mr. Colvin.
You know him?

458
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,846
He used to be police.

459
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,648
Tall: Bald:

460
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,086
Yeah.

461
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,417
Yeah, I know him.

462
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,854
What if you
get the one snitch?

463
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,725
The one with the cart.
What's his name?

464
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,252
Bubbles.

465
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,559
Bubbles. Yeah.

466
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,033
You get Bubbles to say
he's Fuzzy Dunlop.

467
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,832
Except Bubbles has been
a registered Cl for years.

468
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,703
Kima gave him a number back
when she was in plainclothes, man.

469
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,765
And, Herc, you worked
with him under that number

470
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,174
on the Barksdale stuff.

471
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,405
So how would you
fuck up the lD?

472
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,778
Fuck me, man.

473
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,978
Look. The only way
to get out from under this

474
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,646
is to stop fucking lying, okay:

475
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,554
You grab your dick,
you walk into Marimow's office,

476
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,388
and you say,
"Lieutenant, I made a mistake.

477
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,951
"l attributed
my PC to an informant

478
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,987
when in fact I had
it off a camera."

479
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,727
That I got from lSD without going
through the proper channels.

480
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,893
No no no.

481
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,926
He's gonna take
my stripes on this.

482
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,030
Maybe he does, but if you wait until lSD
comes looking for that camera

483
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,268
and he figures out
the lie for himself,

484
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,368
he takes your fucking balls.

485
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,983
Come on!

486
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,355
Let's go!

487
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,916
Around the corner.

488
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,159
Got you now, motherfucker.

489
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,401
In going over
some of my paperwork,

490
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,241
it occurs to me
I may have been neglectful.

491
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,839
Look at all this crap!

492
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,214
Every day,

493
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,186
more and more of Lester Freamon's
bullshit washes up with us.

494
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,117
What the fuck are you saying?

495
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,025
That my paperwork
may have been a little sloppy,

496
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,552
and as a result,

497
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,860
I confused myself
on some things.

498
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,527
No shit, you were sloppy.

499
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,059
I actually went back a couple
weeks on your run sheets.

500
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,164
Nothing there references
a meet with a Cl 238.

501
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,731
You went through
all my run sheets?

502
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,106
The best I could.

503
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,235
Sir, listen--

504
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,374
I don't care who it is.
Turn that fucking thing off.

505
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,212
I am starting to believe

506
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,714
that this Fuzzy fella
doesn't exist.

507
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,122
I am starting to believe

508
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,826
that you just followed
Stanfield into the train station

509
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,428
and grabbed the first broad
he brushed up against.

510
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,440
- That what happened?
- No. No, sir.

511
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,964
You lie to me now, Sergeant,

512
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,839
and I guaran-fucking-tee you
I will jam you up,

513
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,469
ship this whole mess to llD

514
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,140
and be there to pass out
sandwiches at your execution.

515
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,580
Yes, sir.

516
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,779
You haven't brought me
a case yet worth talking about,

517
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,220
not on Marlo Stanfield,
not on anyone.

518
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,750
You bring me something
other than llD complaints,

519
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,127
and I might have some reason
to let a few things slide.

520
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,534
Mad at me:

521
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,558
Come on, now.

522
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,071
Dukie's just mad
at everybody.

523
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,766
Ha ha ha!

524
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,434
Snitch bitch.

525
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,906
Yo, what the fuck was that?

526
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,469
I don't know.

527
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,554
I can't believe
y'all are doing this shit.

528
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,295
You're degrading the quality
of life in this neighborhood.

529
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,427
Malt liquor.

530
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,097
Oh, come on, man!

531
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,969
Brother, you got to
shake hands with a pilsner,

532
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,373
maybe a nice tail ale.

533
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,740
Hell, what-- oh, man!
My brew!

534
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,369
My shoes!

535
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,674
God! Man.

536
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,146
What's the violation?

537
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,946
Parking in a bus stop,
expired registration.

538
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,645
First-class
police work, Baker.

539
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,154
Yeah, well, this is
the word from up on high,

540
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,986
straight from the eighth
floor downtown.

541
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,720
Blessed bosses juking stats
for the new administration.

542
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,159
I know you think
it's bullshit,

543
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,095
but I spend my shift
where they tell me.

544
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,258
Baker, let me tell you
a little secret:

545
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,892
A patrolling officer
on his beat

546
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,733
is the one true
dictatorship in America.

547
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,602
We can lock a guy up
on a humble;

548
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,765
we can lock him up for real;

549
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,638
or we can say, fuck it--

550
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,474
pull under the expressway
and drink ourselves to death,

551
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,537
and our side partners
will cover it.

552
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:54,382
So no one-- and I mean no one--
tells us how to waste our shift.

553
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,679
Pulled the reports
on those church burglaries.

554
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,659
- Yeah?
- Yeah. There's a pattern.

555
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,594
Times and locations.

556
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,497
They're working west by northwest
through Sandtown-Winchester.

557
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,228
The last three--
here, here, and here--

558
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,133
these ones in blue are
the churches they haven't hit

559
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,569
closest to the ones
they have.

560
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,004
You got all this
from the incident reports?

561
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,631
That's why we do
the paperwork.

562
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,641
Giving me a motherfucking
ticket, man?

563
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,272
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind?

564
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,679
I live here, man!

565
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,445
This could get out of hand.

566
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,111
That's what we want,
isn't it? More arrests?

567
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,642
Come on.

568
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,486
No justice, no peace.

569
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,270
It'll only be for tonight.

570
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,242
Mama gets back from
New York tomorrow.

571
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,304
Your call.

572
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,919
The young man seems to
think highly of you, boss.

573
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,445
He invoked your name
with a measure of respect.

574
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,253
It wasn't but
a few weeks ago

575
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,659
I was in a room with him being
called everything but a child of God.

576
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,687
"Mr. Colvin, sir.

577
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,596
Fuck you."

578
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,601
Yeah, well, at least
I said, "Mr."

579
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,139
So what was the charge?

580
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,643
Slinging.

581
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,543
He'd been out there
a few weeks or so.

582
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,276
First pop,
second warning from me.

583
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,218
Maybe you should put him
on the juvenile bus.

584
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,278
He wants so bad
to be a gangster,

585
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,916
maybe it's time he get a taste of what
a real lockup's all about, you know?

586
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,222
Come on, Mr. C.,
don't do me like that.

587
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,024
I made him sleep on
the DEU bench last night,

588
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,930
if that counts for anything.

589
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,490
Isn't there anybody else?

590
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,331
Friend, relative, anybody?

591
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,530
You've always been good
with the knuckleheads, boss.

592
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,576
Ahh. All right.
Let me go call my wife.

593
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,127
Yeah. Go up
in that building.

594
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,012
Mmm, man,
that was delicious.

595
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,573
There's more.

596
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,448
Uh, no, ma'am.
Saving room for the cobbler.

597
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,215
A la mode?

598
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,778
Huh:

599
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,346
Would you like
ice cream on it?

600
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,554
Oh! Oh, yes, ma'am.

601
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,528
Nice manners.

602
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,792
From what you told me
on the phone, Bunny,

603
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,766
I was expecting
more of an adventure.

604
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,766
Bunny?

605
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,869
Only my friends
call me Bunny.

606
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:12,611
- Yeah, but why?
- You don't need to know.

607
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,381
And if you tell anybody,
I'll cut your balls off.

608
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,952
I'll cut them off, give 'em
to Donnelly in a jar.

609
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,188
Don't doubt me, boy.

610
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,168
You ain't got no kids?

611
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,900
Grown. They're at
college and past that.

612
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,313
You told me
these kids were rough.

613
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,512
Thank you, sweetie.
But don't be fooled.

614
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,250
This is his
Eddie Haskell act.

615
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,724
Eddie Haskell?
Who that?

616
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,354
You are, son. Trust me.

617
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,431
Take a seat.

618
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,268
Put yours against
the wall with the others.

619
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,271
Welcome wagon's on
their way back from booking.

620
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,296
- We need the key to the interview room.
- What the fuck for?

621
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,932
Felony burglary.

622
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,374
Felony?

623
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,476
Caught them coming
out of St. Martin's on Fulton.

624
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,038
Charging them with the one,

625
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,141
but we might work back
on a few more.

626
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,879
No shit:

627
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,547
Fucking knew there was still
some real criminals left in Baltimore.

628
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,927
Swear to God, I'm seeing
citations for jaywalking.

629
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,293
We're locking people up
for open container,

630
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,855
for disorderly,
for loitering.

631
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,025
The neighborhood people,

632
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,433
sometimes they appreciate
quality-of-life arrests.

633
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,494
Except we're locking up
the neighborhood people.

634
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,268
Some of my guys,
all they see are the stats.

635
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,104
I mean, the election's
fucking over, right?

636
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,667
Who are we doing this for?

637
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,839
Is this coming
from Burrell or Rawls?

638
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,473
We got it from
the chief of patrol.

639
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,711
It's rolling
downhill, for sure.

640
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,775
Morale:

641
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,116
Split down
the middle, I'd say.

642
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,179
The officers that love
the stat are jazzed.

643
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,281
The rest of them:

644
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,655
We don't know where to turn.

645
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,559
I thought a new hump as mayor
might change this shit,

646
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,085
not ramp it up.

647
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,259
Hey, you still
fucking that bitch?

648
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,927
Yeah. It burning
like hell, man.

649
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,963
When you gonna burn
the bitch back? Oh, check it.

650
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,803
Slim.

651
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,206
B. What up:

652
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,709
All right.

653
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,234
- Poot.
- It's good.

654
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,713
- Heard you're out.
- Yeah.

655
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,012
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, dawg.

656
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,951
And you with Prop Joe now.

657
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,783
Never would have thought.

658
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,982
Yeah, well, life's strange.

659
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,653
Yeah. Holler.

660
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,353
Bodie... how you and Marlo?

661
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,293
You okay with him?

662
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,532
As far as I know, yeah. Why?

663
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,631
What he did to your boy.

664
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,164
What boy are you talking?

665
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,574
Big boy,

666
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,771
the one rub his hands
together all the time?

667
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,610
Kevin: What about him:

668
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,115
You ain't heard?

669
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,517
Chris and Snoop walked
him down an alley.

670
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,716
He in a vacant now.

671
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,246
How you know that?

672
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,725
I seen them lay
hands on the boy.

673
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,887
And now the word out
on the street.

674
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,832
Sorry, dawg.

675
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,029
Let's roll.

676
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,509
Plymouth Rock.
Got that Plymouth Rock.

677
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,550
All right.

678
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,824
But now look at the next
example question on page 20.

679
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,455
As you can see...

680
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,968
if you turn to page 20,
they will sometimes ask you

681
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,166
for words that are the opposite
of words that are underlined.

682
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,401
Uh, thank you,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

683
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,341
Thank you.

684
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,038
All right, put away
your test notebooks.

685
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,640
Work on those tomorrow.

686
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,087
We have, uh,
45 minutes left.

687
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,817
We can do
"Last of the Mohicans"--

688
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,586
- No!
- No!

689
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,149
Or practice probabilities.

690
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,751
- Yeah.
- Yes.

691
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,628
- I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo.
- All right.

692
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,259
And I want to see
everybody's worksheets out.

693
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,326
Hey, Kareem, you want
to play dice with me?

694
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,963
Not with you.

695
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,872
And we're not just
playing games here.

696
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,432
We're doing math.

697
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,341
I'll roll with you, man.
Come on.

698
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,040
No kidding.
We are.

699
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,442
That's my boy
resting his head, see?

700
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,176
Mmm.

701
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,481
Hey, Renaldo,
you want one?

702
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,884
No.

703
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,822
They're from Faidley's, yo.

704
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,415
He might stay home
all day, you know?

705
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,393
We gonna find out, ain't we?

706
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,395
- Like to see about my DSS code.
- Do you have an appointment?

707
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,495
Why I need an appointment?

708
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,301
Zenobia, I don't think
she needs an appointment.

709
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,137
Sorry, just trying
to make it realistic.

710
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,540
So I get to see somebody?

711
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,135
You're gonna have to
take a number and wait.

712
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,941
I need to see
somebody right now.

713
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,574
Don't get angry. Anger doesn't help.
It just makes people defensive.

714
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,481
Tell her what you need calmly.

715
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,385
- Card didn't come this month.
- We mailed it.

716
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,185
- Maybe it got stolen.
- Heh. Sorry. Nothing we can do.

717
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,192
- Fuck you.
- Chandra!

718
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,126
- She ain't helping me.
- That's how they do.

719
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,890
Just tell her what you need.

720
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,863
- Need another card, bitch.
- Chandra.

721
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,025
And that's reality.

722
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,058
Fuck you for real.

723
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,969
- Oh!
- Oh!

724
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,597
Calm down.
Calm down.

725
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,540
Go with Ms. Mason.

726
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,373
- Get your hands off!
- Ms. Mason!

727
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,403
I'll get the school police.

728
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,616
She was like...

729
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,447
And then-- and then--
and then she was like...

730
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,975
Typical day?

731
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,183
I wouldn't know.
My first time.

732
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,282
Your first time?

733
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,418
Mrs. Donnelly
oversees this project.

734
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,657
Okay.

735
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,075
Good morning, ladies.

736
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,513
Help a man get
something to eat?

737
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,381
God bless.

738
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,483
Good morning, Reverend.

739
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,197
Yo.

740
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,466
Glad you finally answered.

741
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,939
Yeah, I was in
a meeting yesterday.

742
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,441
You got the asshole
pinned down?

743
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,967
Nah, I got Marlo's people--
getting ready to make a drop.

744
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,876
- Where?
- Edmondson, near Pulaski.

745
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,437
You eyeballing
them right now?

746
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,074
Yeah, he got the package.

747
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,016
Black bag, putting it
in the trunk.

748
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,282
- He getting in right now.
- What make?

749
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,415
Late model Lincoln.
You want the license?

750
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:38,417
- Yeah, give it.
- P-R-8-Z-G-O-D.

751
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,529
Yeah. Yeah, he pulling out now,
turning down Gilmore.

752
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,124
Dozerman,
get me Foxtrot.

753
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,863
Good job, Bubs.
We're on it.

754
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,838
Ladies, a cell phone?
It's got, like, a half hour on it.

755
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,775
No thank you.

756
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,989
What I saw today

757
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,721
wasn't education
as I understand the term,

758
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,527
and they didn't seem
very socialized, either.

759
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,294
You didn't catch us
on our best day.

760
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,925
Or your worst day?

761
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,402
On the whole, they've
actually made a lot of progress.

762
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,268
Look, I mean,
they come to class,

763
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,898
they're more engaged.
We're reaching them.

764
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,841
Fewer outbursts,
no suspensions.

765
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,367
But are they really
learning anything?

766
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,209
Yes. We believe they are.

767
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,714
Be truthful.

768
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,843
If this program
were to continue

769
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,785
through the rest
of the school year,

770
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,550
how many of your students
could realistically

771
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,457
be expected to return
to a regular classroom?

772
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,521
What do you think,
Ms. Duquette?

773
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,431
Namond, Darnell,
maybe Zenobia.

774
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,458
Yeah, look. I mean,
considering where we started

775
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,765
and considering
that those kids

776
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,203
ain't out there
tearing up other classes--

777
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,901
Okay. Mrs. Donnelly.

778
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,910
A tremendous achievement.

779
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,436
Mr. Withers:

780
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,807
I'll go along
with Mrs. Donnelly.

781
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,552
You haven't said anything yet.

782
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,886
I just don't see it.

783
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,483
Many of these kids
are profoundly damaged--

784
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,757
what they've seen,
how they've lived.

785
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:22,789
And I think any gain
or progress is temporary.

786
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,666
I think this project
may be flawed.

787
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,239
Foxtrot 23-30.

788
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,797
We have a visual
on the suspect.

789
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,036
Vehicle headed east
on Mulberry. Do you copy?

790
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,843
- 10-4. We're almost there.
- 10-4.

791
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,879
After your phone call,
I checked.

792
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,912
It came directly from Burrell.

793
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,754
He bypassed Rawls after l
specifically told him he was--

794
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,626
Burrell's making a play
for you to keep him.

795
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,723
By, uh, just--
what did you call that?

796
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,427
Juking the stats.

797
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,799
Guy is unbelievable.

798
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,703
It runs completely counter to
all my discussions with Rawls,

799
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,934
with you, with everyone.

800
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,566
He's also serving notice.

801
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,543
He's reasserting control
of the department.

802
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,479
He probably figures if you can't
fire him, then you can't fire him.

803
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,005
And does Rawls know?

804
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,779
My guess is, Rawls
heard about it days ago

805
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,513
from half a dozen
district commanders.

806
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,453
Why wouldn't
he come to me?

807
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,219
Talk to him.

808
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,452
Why did you come to me?

809
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,723
I mean, why not go to Rawls?

810
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,323
Because I need to know
if you're serious.

811
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,892
If Rawls already came to you
and this shit is still going on,

812
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,905
then you're okay with it,
which is for me a problem.

813
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,372
If he didn't come to you,

814
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,342
then either he's okay with it,
which is also a problem,

815
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,310
or he's letting it go,
trying give Burrell enough rope

816
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,576
for you to get angry and
fire the man for insubordination.

817
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,607
But I need to know
where you stand.

818
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,380
Well, I gave you my word.

819
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,753
Yes. You did.

820
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,289
Well, thanks for going outside
the chain of command.

821
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,494
Don't expect me
to make a habit of it.

822
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,670
Stay in the car!

823
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,707
Stay in the car.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

824
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,446
- Let's see those hands.
- What's the problem, Officer?

825
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,014
Step slowly out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up.

826
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,568
Son, be gentler than that.

827
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,403
Shut the fuck up.
I ain't your son.

828
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,303
This guy...

829
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,263
What's this, huh?
What's this?

830
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:25,343
Do you know what? I'm gonna damn
sure get your name and badge number.

831
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,785
Daniels. I don't
think I know him.

832
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,760
Oh, he hasn't
played much politics,

833
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,094
though he used to be married to
the new councilwoman in the 11th.

834
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,032
- Marla Daniels:
- Mm-hmm. That's the one.

835
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:48,197
This is the last man we want
as police commissioner, Nerese.

836
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,435
I mean, I squared off against
this fellow a few years back,

837
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,340
and he wouldn't
listen to me.

838
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,709
He's not gonna listen
to you or the ministers

839
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,338
or anyone else
in the community.

840
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,042
- Just Carcetti?
- Mm-hmm.

841
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,414
Oh, he's the mayor's boy,
definitely.

842
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,885
Carcetti is looking
for how much of a salary bump?

843
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,388
50,000, at least,

844
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,947
to make the position
competitive nationally.

845
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,152
Give him 25.

846
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,492
It'll be enough to make him
think he'll win you over eventually

847
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,225
but less than he needs
to entice anyone real.

848
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,393
Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna
have to give Daniels

849
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,995
six months in ClD
before he can bump him again,

850
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,562
for appearance's sake.

851
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,699
So we're buying time here.

852
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,073
Enough for Ervin to show the
new mayor who butters the bread.

853
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,479
And for events to take the
new-penny shine off Cedric Daniels.

854
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,417
I happen to know he's less
the saint than he pretends to be.

855
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:48,158
This is Senator Davis.
Is the Mayor in at the moment?

856
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,697
Well...you just tell him
his friend Clay

857
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:59,004
got the council president to un-ass a
salary bump for the police commissioner.

858
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,374
You tell him...

859
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,242
write this down, now.

860
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,843
You tell him that Senator Davis
has his interests at heart.

861
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,781
Right.

862
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,884
Thanks.

863
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,941
Hey, Ma. How was New York?

864
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,368
Hey, Ms. Brice.
How are you?

865
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,074
Who asking?

866
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:41,482
This is my teacher, Mom--
Mr. Colvin.

867
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,954
Why he here?
You in trouble?

868
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,387
He stayed at our house
last night,

869
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,448
with you being
in New York and all.

870
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,918
Tell her.

871
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,592
The cops picked me up,
saying I was slinging.

872
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,397
They was gonna send me
to baby booking.

873
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,927
But we took him in.

874
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,240
You leave my son
the fuck alone.

875
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,009
And you, you afraid
to go to baby booking?

876
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,780
The fuck is wrong with you, boy?
Get in the damn house!

877
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,034
Kid got the point.

878
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,231
all these drunk and disorderlies
and squeegee boys,

879
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,001
graffiti artists,
and public urinators,

880
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,100
and here we come in with
a pair of felony burglaries.

881
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,168
Nice of you to give him
the collar.

882
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,180
Well, he might turn out
a decent police.

883
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,682
Got to come from somewhere.
Young generation.

884
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,151
- Uh-huh.
- What about you guys?

885
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,279
You gonna follow
in your dad's footsteps?

886
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,448
Hello, I don't think so.

887
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,355
- Not.
- What, then?

888
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,190
- Video game designer.
- Rock star.

889
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,560
- Ahh.
- Ah, they want to make money.

890
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,930
- You schooled them well.
- How about you, Little Bunk?

891
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,696
You'll be a detective
like your daddy?

892
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,931
- Chief of police.
- Nah.

893
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,168
Why not? How about you?

894
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,645
Oh, he's still in that, you know,
pediatric neurosurgeon stage.

895
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,279
- Hi.
- Hey.

896
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,012
Hey! Elena,
how are you doing?

897
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,610
I'm good.
How are you?

898
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,120
Can't complain.

899
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,521
Hey, boys.
How are you?

900
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,390
Can you say hi?

901
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,624
Listen. They're fine.
They really do have manners.

902
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,324
It's all right.
My kids are the same way.

903
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,663
We're just finishing up.
Please sit down.

904
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,967
Oh-- okay.
Just for a minute.

905
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,836
Dad, five bucks
for the jukebox?

906
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,900
What? What happened to
three plays for a quarter?

907
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,312
Um... homework?

908
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,374
- Done, Dad helped us.
- Oh.

909
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,579
I got off early. Here.

910
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,146
You want to go, too?

911
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,454
So what are you drinking?

912
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,653
I'll have a white wine.

913
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:05,922
Mmm:

914
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,657
I'm good, thanks.

915
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:22,440
So it's true?
You quit drinking?

916
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,778
Well, I have a beer
now and again.

917
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,511
No big deal.

918
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,720
How's Dennis:

919
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,422
Dennis is... Dennis.

920
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,863
We're close, we're not.

921
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,923
You know, we'll see.

922
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,936
- How's Beadie?
- We're good.

923
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,563
The kids have my number, but...

924
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,006
Mmm.

925
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,673
Wow.

926
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:01,047
If I had known you were gonna
grow up to be a grownup...

927
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,849
Pssh, man.

928
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,585
And I'm the one that told
him to do the right thing

929
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,287
and go talk to the man.

930
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,161
It don't seem
that way now, do it?

931
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,564
I mean, yo, you got to look at
it from Marlo's point of view.

932
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,932
I mean, how this
different from Wallace?

933
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,267
Because Stringer said
Wallace snitched.

934
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,034
Yo. Kevin might have
snitched too.

935
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,669
- Man, but he didn't.
- And we had to do Wallace!

936
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,303
Yo, Marlo thought
he had to do Kevin.

937
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,144
- Man.
- But he didn't.

938
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,843
That's what I'm saying.

939
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,219
He's a cold motherfucker.

940
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,155
It's a cold world, Bodie.

941
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,158
Thought you said
it was getting warmer, nigger.

942
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:46,856
World going one way,
people another, yo.

943
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,991
Now, Elton Brand--
what you know about him?

944
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,367
Nothing. You see?

945
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,134
Bug, you seen your daddy?

946
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,335
Went to the store.

947
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,075
Where you going?

948
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,741
I'm gonna look for him.

949
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,249
You ain't gonna find him.

950
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:10,412
Why not?

951
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,216
Because he ain't coming back.

952
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,533
Thanks.

953
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,017
- What's this about?
- Like you don't know.

954
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,888
Man, I ain't been home long enough
to get in somebody's shit.

955
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,685
You like boys,
motherfucker?

956
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,822
What?

957
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,890
Boys. You like
fucking them?

958
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,528
Man, I like pussy.
All right? Booty.

959
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,197
Living with
a woman now.

960
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,067
She got kids?

961
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,736
I ain't touch them kids!
Who told you that?

962
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,375
I know what
you're saying,

963
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,440
but when you're on the inside,
ain't no pussy.

964
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,348
Well, yeah, shit.
You've been inside.

965
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,619
Man got to bust his nut,
know what I'm saying?

966
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,057
I do.

967
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,278
Damn.

968
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,147
You didn't even wait to get
the motherfucker in the house.
