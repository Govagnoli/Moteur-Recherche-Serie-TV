1
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,200
WA YE news time, 8:05.

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:15,974
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.

3
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,175
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,946
And here's one of my morning favorites.

5
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,560
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?

6
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,497
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.

7
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,560
76-72 KGA.

8
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,335
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.

9
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,774
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.

10
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,368
Copy that.

11
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,055
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?

12
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,820
He's not going back.

13
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:05,590
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.

14
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,325
He's off the cell phones.

15
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,594
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.

16
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,500
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.

17
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:17,065
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?

18
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,801
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.

19
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,470
But checked out right after.

20
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,639
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.

21
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,217
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.

22
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,786
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.

23
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,756
Maybe Sobotka knows him.

24
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:35,953
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.

25
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,487
Freamon here.

26
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,664
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.

27
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,060
All of them John Does.

28
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,232
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.

29
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,901
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.

30
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,411
-Fuck me.
-What can I tell you, kiddo?

31
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,482
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?

32
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,984
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?

33
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,452
-Run them over to Southeast.
-Okay.

34
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,304
-Have a seat.
-I can't.

35
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,510
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.

36
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,050
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.

37
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,986
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.

38
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,653
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.

39
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,296
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.

40
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,329
We got you, you understand?

41
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,367
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.

42
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,969
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...

43
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,631
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...

44
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,971
it's absolved, along with our agreement.

45
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,009
All I'm saying is--

46
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,172
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.

47
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,912
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.

48
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,017
Them?

49
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,650
Who came at you?

50
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,826
Thank you for your concern.

51
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:40,613
Easy, Nick. Easy.

52
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,818
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.

53
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,056
Get out of my fucking way!

54
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,219
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!

55
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,894
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.

56
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,092
What the fuck you gonna do?

57
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,169
Get a gun? Go play gangster?

58
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,034
Like your fucking cousin?

59
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,666
Let's go.

60
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,969
What was she firing, yo?

61
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,838
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.

62
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,304
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.

63
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,289
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.

64
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,513
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.

65
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,423
Good looking out, Johnny.

66
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,340
At least I remembered to call.

67
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,447
Stabbed repeatedly.

68
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,518
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.

69
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,453
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.

70
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,854
Defense wounds on both hands.

71
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,789
Ligature on both legs.

72
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,552
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.

73
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,655
One, two, three.

74
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,117
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.

75
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,123
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?

76
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,184
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.

77
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:13,890
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.

78
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,092
You sound like McNulty now.

79
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,636
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.

80
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,230
You know this.

81
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,307
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.

82
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,643
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.

83
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,807
What about you?

84
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,484
Don't know.

85
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,119
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.

86
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,695
I mean, he's there for his troops.

87
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:53,362
-You gotta be shitting me.
-I just came from the crime scene.

88
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,996
He was coming in as a cooperator.

89
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,235
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.

90
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,870
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.

91
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,345
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.

92
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,811
You were right about Sobotka.

93
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,289
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...

94
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,590
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.

95
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,864
If you are gonna charge him....

96
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,094
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.

97
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,865
You're gonna do your son-in-law?

98
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,341
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?

99
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,447
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.

100
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,283
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.

101
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:45,652
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a....

102
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,987
What was it? A shitbird?

103
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:51,021
Fuck you.

104
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,357
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.

105
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,568
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

106
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,126
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

107
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:02,965
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.

108
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,171
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBl....

109
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,611
You know how tight-assed they are.

110
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,884
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...

111
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,184
on midnight shift for two months.

112
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,224
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...

113
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,728
to everyone seen that punch throwed.

114
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,766
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...

115
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,767
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...

116
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:37,638
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.

117
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,906
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...

118
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:45,040
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...

119
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,380
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.

120
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,345
Lieutenant.

121
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,788
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.

122
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,729
-You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
-Officer.

123
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,464
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.

124
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,033
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.

125
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,075
Everybody talks, nobody listens.

126
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,778
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.

127
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,384
-Now what can I do for you, gents?
-You got a warrant on me for drugs.

128
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,720
-I'm turning myself in.
-A Southeastern warrant?

129
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:31,022
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.

130
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:35,699
-What name am I looking for?
-Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.

131
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,568
Morphine? From a city ambo?

132
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,205
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.

133
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,691
-The body came up.
-I saw, on the television.

134
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,958
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...

135
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,534
but the water just coughed him back up.

136
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,432
Bad luck, that's all.

137
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,799
Sergei would've done better, I admit.

138
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:19,842
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.

139
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,471
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.

140
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,609
I am thinking...

141
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,550
there's nothing to be done at this point.

142
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,052
What he says, he says.

143
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,353
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.

144
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,590
And you?

145
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,756
To them, you're only "The Greek."

146
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,268
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.

147
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,438
So we go.

148
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:57,374
But there's a little business to do first.

149
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,181
There's a shipment on the docks this week.

150
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,947
-One hundred and fifty kilograms.
-And no one to pick it up.

151
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,882
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.

152
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,088
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.

153
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,667
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.

154
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,430
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.

155
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,501
This is telling us something.

156
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,381
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?

157
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,514
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.

158
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,953
No, we go.

159
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,789
Call the others in.

160
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,696
Let them know there is no longer any point.

161
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,802
We don't wait?

162
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,676
Our friends are still there, no?

163
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,807
-Still here.
-Then go.

164
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,560
Sobotka was a cooperator?

165
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,206
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.

166
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:32,071
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead....

167
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,838
So what's left of the case?

168
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:37,676
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.

169
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,649
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...

170
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,947
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.

171
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,919
We have people on him?

172
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,591
He's out of pocket at the moment.

173
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:51,651
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.

174
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,454
And the union people?

175
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,127
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.

176
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,864
But the important thing for us is the union.

177
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,133
Either they jettison
their current leadership...

178
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,641
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.

179
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,645
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.

180
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,514
When do we get to that bit of business?

181
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:16,847
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.

182
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,657
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.

183
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,356
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.

184
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,358
-Sobotka came in.
-The nephew?

185
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,094
Yeah, he flipped.

186
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,233
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.

187
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,365
-How about some murders?
-How about them?

188
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:40,171
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?

189
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,302
Been quiet.

190
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,938
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...

191
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,574
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.

192
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,153
-How about that?
-I ain't got nothing on that one.

193
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,222
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.

194
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,985
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.

195
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,384
How you gonna talk about going to jail?

196
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:57,961
You hearing this, Johnny?

197
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,464
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.

198
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,501
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.

199
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,663
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"

200
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:11,503
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...

201
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,101
and you talking about jail and shit.

202
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,339
That's too cold, girl, damn.

203
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,681
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?

204
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,187
You remember that shit, right?

205
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,758
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.

206
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,987
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.

207
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,462
-Who you talking about?
-Boy named Cheese.

208
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,864
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...

209
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:39,664
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.

210
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,605
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.

211
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,198
And what happened?

212
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,505
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.

213
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:51,272
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."

214
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,975
But then he ain't come back no more.

215
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,746
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.

216
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,845
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.

217
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,948
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.

218
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,787
Sharing?

219
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,256
You guys are on all of it?

220
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,437
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.

221
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,167
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand--

222
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,038
They killed my uncle.

223
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,578
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.

224
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,773
How do you know they did it?

225
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,819
I told....

226
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,528
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?

227
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,599
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...

228
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,807
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.

229
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,773
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.

230
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,515
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...

231
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,681
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?

232
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,387
And now Spiros is saying that...

233
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:10,460
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...

234
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,462
the one that got shot...

235
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,398
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.

236
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,902
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.

237
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,672
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?

238
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,540
Under the Key Bridge.

239
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,116
I seen his car was still there this morning.

240
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,479
I seen that, I fucking knew.

241
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,053
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably--

242
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,853
Wanna kill me, too?

243
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:45,654
Shit!

244
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,031
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.

245
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,493
I was gonna go down there with him.

246
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,796
He wouldn't....

247
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,303
You were involved in the smuggling?

248
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,749
We didn't know about the girls.

249
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,812
Them girls that got found?

250
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,187
-We didn't know there were girls in there.
-You thought it was drugs?

251
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,658
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.

252
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:21,160
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.

253
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,396
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?

254
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,004
That's your cousin's signed statement.

255
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,100
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.

256
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,873
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.

257
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,076
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.

258
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,176
Your cousin was locked in.

259
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,323
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...

260
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,420
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.

261
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:57,490
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.

262
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,703
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...

263
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,501
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.

264
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,117
Spiros was the main guy.

265
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,648
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...

266
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:20,747
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.

267
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,886
The lsraeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...

268
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,830
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?

269
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,602
Guess you do.

270
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,603
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.

271
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,868
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...

272
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,069
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?

273
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,270
Her, I don't know.

274
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,547
My uncle, you know about him.

275
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,847
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.

276
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:53,890
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.

277
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,782
What about the Russian?

278
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,418
He drove for them.

279
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:01,123
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.

280
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,998
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...

281
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,901
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.

282
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,735
Why did you think that?

283
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,435
Sergei, he just carried it like that.

284
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,103
And also, after them girls died in the can...

285
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:20,112
they told me that whoever fucked that up...

286
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,951
they had already got to in Philly.

287
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,490
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.

288
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,692
And how did they say it?

289
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:32,861
They just said, I don't know...

290
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,765
that the guy that you all was looking for...

291
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,529
he was a dead end.

292
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,869
-A dead end?
-Yeah.

293
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,772
In Philly, they said.

294
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,237
Who's the suit?

295
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,449
You sure?

296
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:01,057
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.

297
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,753
Someone he was in communication with.

298
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:05,752
Yeah, The Greek.

299
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:09,890
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.

300
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,661
The man in the suit...

301
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,896
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.

302
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,768
That's not The Greek?

303
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:27,844
That's The Greek right there.

304
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,424
That the guy?

305
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,156
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.

306
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,565
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.

307
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,332
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.

308
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:51,135
-What's the verdict?
-He did good for us.

309
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,109
-So I'm out the stat?
-I owe you one, Sanny.

310
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,189
-Both of them?
-Yeah, that one's his valet.

311
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,393
Can I use your bathroom?

312
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,462
Fuck, no. Get out of here.

313
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:15,429
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?

314
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,393
It was shit, now it's right.

315
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,011
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.

316
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,381
But not in a bad way.

317
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,114
He's a K Street lawyer down there.

318
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,315
So the suit was only a suit?

319
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:44,391
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.

320
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,195
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.

321
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,468
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.

322
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,264
You people got reach.

323
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,431
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.

324
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,006
What's the plan for him?

325
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,307
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.

326
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,847
We're rounding up his girl and kid.

327
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:09,409
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.

328
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,240
It's for you.

329
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:42,912
Daniels.

330
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,218
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.

331
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,122
Okay, thanks.

332
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,927
FBl.

333
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,302
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.

334
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,875
-May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
-Who?

335
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,466
Agent Koutris.

336
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,570
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.

337
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,080
Where's he at?

338
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,880
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.

339
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,054
Counterterrorism? For how long?

340
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,619
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.

341
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:17,111
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.

342
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,478
I'm just saying, this is not the way...

343
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,816
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.

344
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,946
Not by a fucking long shot!

345
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,333
Either your son surrenders within the hour...

346
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,675
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...

347
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,874
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?

348
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,943
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...

349
00:30:57,054 --> 00:31:00,251
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.

350
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,419
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.

351
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,657
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.

352
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,708
-A detective?
-Motherfucker. Come on.

353
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,346
Don't use the phone.

354
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:32,684
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.

355
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,297
What a dump.

356
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,260
You wanted us to get a place, right?

357
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,672
If they got to him in Philly...

358
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,305
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?

359
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,318
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.

360
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,682
Good God.

361
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,520
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...

362
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,991
Iooking at a table full of heads right now.

363
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,030
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?

364
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:16,861
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.

365
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,491
They're at ECU.

366
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:26,538
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.

367
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,246
Where y'all been at?

368
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,452
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.

369
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,821
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.

370
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,655
So I just eased off.

371
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:47,429
-You think brother played me?
-No.

372
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,897
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...

373
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:53,401
then I'd be talking to a dead man.

374
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,106
You saying Stringer told you...

375
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,704
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?

376
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:01,869
Yeah.

377
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:05,574
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.

378
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,412
New York and Philly.

379
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:12,050
If Avon contracted him to get at you...

380
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:17,316
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.

381
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,190
It's my fault.

382
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:22,094
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.

383
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:25,498
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.

384
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,628
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.

385
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:29,933
I'm going hard after Stringer.

386
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,274
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.

387
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:38,645
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?

388
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:40,683
How you gonna get at him?

389
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,045
I don't even know, Butch.

390
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,320
Take some time and think on it.

391
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,394
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?

392
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,099
What you see, Butch?

393
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,809
Too much, boy.

394
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,068
Too damn much.

395
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,180
A lot happened overnight.

396
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,552
Not to us.

397
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,024
-Look, this isn't personal--
-Fucking-A, right.

398
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,153
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.

399
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:29,460
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."

400
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,761
That's part of the job.

401
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:34,395
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.

402
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,803
These cases are more than that.

403
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,842
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.

404
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,412
So you're saying we ain't up to it.

405
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,916
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.

406
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:52,455
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.

407
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:03,093
Eastside, Westside.

408
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,601
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.

409
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,436
Shit. I'm late for something.

410
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:38,959
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?

411
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,737
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.

412
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,468
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.

413
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,803
-What you asked for before--
-That's what we....

414
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:53,274
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.

415
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,225
Nope, all I got is usual.

416
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,386
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...

417
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,056
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?

418
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,133
What was that date again?

419
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:12,101
February 5.

420
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:15,603
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.

421
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,840
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.

422
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,676
Is he working tonight?

423
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,649
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.

424
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,350
What do you want Walt for?

425
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,751
See if he can make any of these.

426
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,449
Wouldn't do much good.

427
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,824
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.

428
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:47,868
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...

429
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,237
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.

430
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,684
$300 for a stroller?

431
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,821
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?

432
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,955
A hooptie, no doubt?

433
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,229
We're so gonna need one of these.

434
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,432
Look at this, Kima.

435
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,799
Blue's Clues juice box holder.

436
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:28,135
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.

437
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,155
Okay, listen.

438
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,227
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.

439
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:48,621
You understand?

440
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,729
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.

441
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,101
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.

442
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:26,026
Nick.

443
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,701
What's gonna happen, Nicky?

444
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,847
That can on the fifth wheel there.

445
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,320
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.

446
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:49,517
-Where's it from?
-Le Havre, France.

447
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,494
Fuck it, then. Dump her.

448
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,407
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...

449
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,342
before the warehouse phone came down.

450
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,380
Those were for steady re-ups, right?

451
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,974
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.

452
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,851
-How much?
-Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.

453
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:22,755
Last call to Eton's cell phone,
the re-up went to 1 2.

454
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,826
He doubles his re-up to 1 2 kilos?

455
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,335
That's her right there.

456
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,038
They ain't doing the dirt, though.

457
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,939
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.

458
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,237
Copy.

459
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:51,085
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.

460
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,053
Eton, too.

461
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,115
You lost some good people.

462
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,093
There'll be some new faces soon.

463
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,630
A week or so. They'll find you.

464
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,536
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.

465
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,799
A week?

466
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,972
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.

467
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,180
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?

468
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,241
The last shipment is lost.

469
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,587
Lost? How you mean?

470
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,158
The police may be sitting on it.

471
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:30,749
You ain't sure?

472
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,595
There's more where that came from.

473
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:35,928
Always, there is more.

474
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,659
All right, then.

475
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,731
I'm gonna let your new people find me.

476
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:45,100
Have a safe trip.

477
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,008
Where you say you off to again?

478
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,024
There's 1 2 in this, 15 in that.

479
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,394
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern....

480
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,194
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.

481
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,129
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.

482
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,138
And we are in the dark.

483
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,965
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?

484
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,907
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.

485
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,536
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.

486
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,671
You that lucky?

487
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:29,241
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.

488
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,653
It's on you.

489
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,318
Ambushed? ln his own goddamn room?

490
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,421
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he--

491
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:45,558
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.

492
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,201
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...

493
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,739
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.

494
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,207
He said that thing between us is....

495
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,710
How did he put it? Absolved.

496
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,109
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?

497
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:03,052
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.

498
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,678
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...

499
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,723
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?

500
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:10,486
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.

501
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,494
But Mouzone not saying who did this.

502
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,689
-You asked him who it was?
-Yeah, I asked him.

503
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,322
-Why?
-Why what?

504
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:22,433
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?

505
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,099
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.

506
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,268
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.

507
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,752
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...

508
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:42,086
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.

509
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:46,219
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.

510
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,500
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.

511
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,899
The street is the street. Always.

512
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,636
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.

513
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,581
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.

514
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,515
And that day gonna come, but until then...

515
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,588
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.

516
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,724
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.

517
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,419
I ain't gonna argue with you.

518
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:21,554
You run it as you see fit.

519
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,196
At least until I get home, you do.

520
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,529
No doubt.

521
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,001
Us, man.

522
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,668
Us.

523
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,950
-Tape is fucked up.
-It's multiplexed.

524
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,287
It's a way to save money.

525
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,388
Instead of one camera, one VCR...

526
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,558
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.

527
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,568
-Can you make sense of it?
-Not a problem, with this software.

528
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,161
-We just de-plex it.
-De-plex?

529
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,400
Let me show you the highlight reel.

530
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:15,041
-Is he flashing a badge?
-Looks like it.

531
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,177
That's something you don't see too often...

532
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,982
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.

533
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,818
That could be our boy.

534
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,915
Head still on.

535
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,930
Tell me we got cameras inside.

536
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,261
Jesus, my pants are wet.

537
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,529
Yeah. C'mon, baby.

538
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,338
Yeah.

539
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,990
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.

540
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,653
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.

541
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,729
A week?

542
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,991
No later than that, they say.

543
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:04,824
How it go with Avon today?

544
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:07,736
It's all good.

545
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,647
Our old friend.

546
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,089
What's the news?

547
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:32,252
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.

548
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,694
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.

549
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,265
I mean, about Frank.

550
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,062
-What's the district council saying?
-Gentlemen.

551
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,201
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...

552
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:47,333
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.

553
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,241
Ain't y'all got some place to go?

554
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,973
Just came to make it clear...

555
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,981
that if there's no cleaning up in here...

556
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,675
this local will be decertified.

557
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:57,150
Instead of your union
running out of this office...

558
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,781
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.

559
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,359
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...

560
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,724
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.

561
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,229
And you'll be outside, looking in.

562
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,742
One man, one vote.

563
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:46,124
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

564
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:49,295
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

565
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,873
You don't think that had anything to do...

566
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,302
with this mope?

567
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,049
You gotta do better than that, Lester.

568
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,489
This poor guy ain't got a face.

569
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,504
Did I mention the DNA matches?

570
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:31,113
This has nothing to do with me.

571
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,823
Is that the security guard?

572
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:54,593
Walt Stokes. A good man.

573
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,506
Keeps meticulous records.

574
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,701
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...

575
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,541
to get a clear look.

576
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,314
Yeah? Show it to me.

577
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,718
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.

578
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,557
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...

579
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:19,985
5-4-5.

580
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:23,031
That comes back to a BWI rental.

581
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:26,132
I wonder who rented it.

582
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,606
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.

583
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,433
In this state, it's a death penalty case.

584
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,408
I didn't kill him.

585
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,886
I was there, but I didn't kill him.

586
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,492
Vondas did.

587
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,357
He cut his throat.

588
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,665
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.

589
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,439
Instead, he used them to make money.

590
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:08,938
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.

591
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:14,015
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.

592
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,607
He had to die.

593
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,791
You want a coffee? Soda?

594
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,658
Vodka.

595
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,426
Coffee.

596
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,180
They're down. All 14 of them.

597
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,810
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.

598
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:53,716
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.

599
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,183
You wanna tell Rawls?

600
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,054
Let him stew a while longer.

601
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,865
One thing, though,
we should do right away.

602
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,902
Who's the man above Vondas?

603
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,510
The Greek.

604
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:20,773
What's his name?

605
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:28,051
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...

606
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,682
you're gonna tell me right now...

607
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,490
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.

608
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:37,299
A hotel at the harbor.

609
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,928
This one?

610
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,064
Another.

611
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:44,562
I can show you.

612
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:02,914
Go.

613
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,520
Clear!

614
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,247
Business or pleasure for you?

615
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:29,243
Business. Always business.

616
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,796
-What did you forget?
-Nothing important.

617
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,016
You come to the bar without me?

618
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,521
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.

619
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,889
-What happened?
-Case hit the wall.

620
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,155
How so?

621
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,891
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.

622
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,196
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.

623
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,736
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.

624
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,931
-How late?
-They skipped.

625
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,703
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...

626
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,107
these guys collect passports.

627
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,010
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?

628
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,608
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?

629
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:37,709
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.

630
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,254
See if they want
to follow through on their end.

631
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,584
I don't know.

632
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,751
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.

633
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:49,596
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?

634
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,278
Lieutenant.

635
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:11,583
I never told you this.

636
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:15,380
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...

637
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,756
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.

638
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,662
Excuse me, sorry.

639
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,628
The leak wasn't your people.

640
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,531
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...

641
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,166
I used the FedCom software, you know?

642
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,707
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.

643
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,006
The 9l1 1 boys in D.C.

644
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:44,145
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.

645
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:46,949
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?

646
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:55,790
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

647
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:08,106
World just keeps turning, right?

648
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,412
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.

649
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,451
It's on me this time.

650
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,419
Anyone?

651
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:47,043
Where are you going?

652
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,042
Work.

653
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:16,608
Frank, you cocksucker.

654
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,500
-I can take it from here.
-You sure?

655
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,235
No one fucks with us on our turf.

656
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:08,021
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?

657
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:11,692
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.

658
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,260
Nothing else today, really.

659
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,162
Seniority sucks.

660
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,468
If you ain't senior.

661
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:22,233
All right, man.

662
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,721
This is a great day for Baltimore.
