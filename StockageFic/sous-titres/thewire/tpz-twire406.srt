1
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:17,696
On this Sunday
before the primary

2
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,299
when we will go to the polls
to exercise our blessed franchise,

3
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,745
our lesson comes from
Exodus, chapter 18.

4
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,907
"And it came to pass
on the morrow

5
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,385
that Moses sat
to judge the people:

6
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,887
and the people stood by him

7
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,720
from the morning
unto the evening.

8
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,955
And Moses judged the people.

9
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:47,023
And he shouldered
this tremendous burden all alone.

10
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,728
And one day,
his father-in-law said to him,

11
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,500
'Moses, why do you carry this

12
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,634
awesome responsibility
by yourself?

13
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,010
You need other wise men
to help you rule

14
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,607
justly over the people.'

15
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,677
So Moses hearkened to the voice
of his father-in-law,

16
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,316
and chose able men
to rule over the people."

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,622
Can I preach it like I feel it?

18
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,290
Hey hey hey.

19
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,162
This Tuesday,

20
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,397
when we choose
the men and women

21
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,529
who will lead our city,

22
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,906
we would do well to keep
those standards in mind.

23
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,002
Men of truth,

24
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,141
who fear God
and hate covetousness.

25
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,241
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,624
Hey.

27
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,027
God bless you.

28
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,398
Good to see you.

29
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,424
How you doing?

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,766
- Just fine.
- How's Mama?

31
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,602
- Tell her I said hello.
- Fellowship committee at 2:00:

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,198
- If I'm late...
- We'll wait.

33
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,008
All right. Thank you for coming,
young man, young lady.

34
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,410
- Reverend.
- Councilman.

35
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,778
Mrs. Carcetti.
How are you?

36
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,407
Thank you so much
for having us.

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,111
- Thank you.
- lnteresting sermon.

38
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,709
Polls seem to think
you have a chance.

39
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,186
Well, we're within
the margin of error.

40
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,587
Margin of error.
That's an interesting phrase.

41
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,684
And I see you've got
Delegate Watkins working the crowd.

42
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,490
Well, I'm hoping
he's not going to be the only one.

43
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,257
I'll tell you what, Councilman.

44
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,165
I will keep an open mind
until I walk into that booth on Tuesday.

45
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,499
- And if you win--
- You're holding me to a high standard.

46
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,834
- Moses? I mean, Jesus, Reverend...
- Tommy.

47
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,238
I'm sorry. I can't believe I said that.

48
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,902
Moses will do for now.

49
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,003
We'll save Jesus
for your second term.

50
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,411
- Have a good one now.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,573
Thank you all
so much for coming.

52
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,901
- Signs o' life?
- Not even a lookout.

53
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,429
- Maybe they went to church.
- Our Lady of the Re-up.

54
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,032
He'll show up sooner or later.

55
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,341
- Call me.
- All right.

56
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,978
Vote for Carcetti.

57
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,319
Vote for Carcetti
on Tuesday.

58
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,757
Tommy Carcetti running
for mayor. Thanks.

59
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,454
- Hello, Councilman.
- Good morning.

60
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,894
I've been following
your campaign. I'm a teacher.

61
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,023
- Excellent.
- High-school biology.

62
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,000
- What? Here in the city?
- Baltimore County. I just wanted say

63
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,900
I think your position
on school-board reform

64
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,167
- is very encouraging.
- So you'd vote for me?

65
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,106
If I lived in the city,
I absolutely would.

66
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,542
- Good luck on Tuesday.
- Thank you.

67
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,012
They're all fucking county people.

68
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,845
We're almost
done here anyway.

69
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,716
- Thomas, look at this.
- What's that?

70
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,778
Check it out.

71
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,383
In your private practice,
you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?

72
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,949
The slumlord?
Fuck, no.

73
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,961
I don't remember ever
even meeting this guy.

74
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,622
"Carcetti got the most
serious charges dismissed

75
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,132
and the others reduced
to small fines.

76
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,600
The slumlord once again walked free
with a slap on the wrist

77
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,296
while hundreds of tenants
continue to suffer

78
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,964
substandard living conditions."

79
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,472
Last-minute smear.
They're running scared.

80
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,270
- Royce.
- Who else?

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,038
65% of the city rents.

82
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,409
Bobby Harrison's name
is dirt in this town.

83
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,437
Two days before the election
and they smear me?

84
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,473
Courthouse steps.
When the fuck was this taken?

85
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,883
- It's a fake. They photo-shopped me.
- We have time to prove that?

86
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,386
- We can try.
- Try, shit.

87
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,514
- I'm gonna lose behind this.
- Easy, Tommy.

88
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,081
We always figured they'd
pull some last-minute shit.

89
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,524
At least now we know
what it is.

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,357
Fuck.

91
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,592
I want you to remember,
you're representing your daddy.

92
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,065
Yeah, I know.

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,567
What she wanna
see us for, anyway?

94
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,695
Maybe she got somethin'
special in mind for you, boy.

95
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,706
- Cool.
- She's a Barksdale.

96
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,799
She know talent
when she sees it.

97
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,300
Besides, they owe
this family a lot.

98
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,337
Your daddy,
he stood tall for them.

99
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,042
I know, I know.
He a soldier.

100
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,382
- Like father, like son.
- No doubt.

101
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,251
- What time you got?
- 3:30.

102
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,056
Motherfucker late.

103
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,585
Yo.

104
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,562
It's for you, Marlo.

105
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,468
Yeah, speak.

106
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,439
You on it.

107
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,465
As long as she hit
her mark, we straight.

108
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,413
What time I gotta pick up
that skinny girl?

109
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,144
A'ight.

110
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,188
So what time they say?

111
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,851
Tomorrow night.

112
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,521
She be on the 8:45
from New York. Yeah.

113
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,656
We can take care of that.

114
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,461
No. I'll do it.

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,128
Don't want nothin'
to go wrong.

116
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,898
You sure about that?

117
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:36,102
It's a'ight.
You can hang back on this.

118
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,272
Yeah, I think I got
this one, too.

119
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,905
Marlo Stanfield.

120
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,610
He ain't so much.

121
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,346
Using cell phones and shit.

122
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,150
What's he sayin' now?

123
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,219
"What time I gotta
pick up the skinny girl?

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,033
I do it.

125
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,605
Don't want nothing
to go wrong."

126
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,609
Maybe he's picking up
a girlfriend?

127
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:15,478
"Skinny girl from New York"?
It's code. Cocaine.

128
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,006
Damn. For Marlo himself
to get near a package...

129
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,576
He's a mope. I told ya.

130
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,215
- So what do we do about it?
- We work up some counter lit.

131
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,985
That's why we have
a printer on retainer.

132
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,391
Best if we run down
the original photograph.

133
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,951
If we can prove
this one's a fake--

134
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,827
I didn't work at "Sun" Papers
for 22 damn years

135
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,354
not to know somebody.

136
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,196
I'm gonna call Paul McCardle
at the photo library.

137
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,701
And if we still
can't find it?

138
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,328
Then we put out
a fake photo of our own.

139
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,135
Show Royce in a motel
with a dead girl and a live boy.

140
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,698
We can't sling mud back.
Not this late.

141
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,540
Relax. I'm kidding.

142
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,342
You get back on your schedule.
Hit all your stops.

143
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,748
Go to that donors' dinner
tonight and make nice.

144
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,912
We'll take care of this.

145
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,854
You can't do this to us.

146
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,720
Bey took the weight
for all y'all.

147
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,487
And you've been
amply compensated.

148
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,790
- But time moves on.
- Not for Bey, it don't.

149
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,592
What I meant to say is there's
no more money coming in.

150
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,030
No more business.

151
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,534
Avon is gone.
So are his people.

152
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,365
Shit.

153
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,599
You seem to still be doin'
all right for yourself.

154
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,405
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

155
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,571
Bey know everything.
You forget that?

156
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,740
And what's he gonna do?
Who's he gonna tell?

157
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,307
And what do I care
if he does?

158
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,649
Bey never heard me say
a damn thing about business.

159
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,416
What about your brother?

160
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,356
Avon could be gone longer
if Bey gets to speakin' his mind.

161
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,450
I couldn't care less
about Avon.

162
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,494
The thing is I wanted
you both to hear it from me

163
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,936
so there ain't no lies
from here on in.

164
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,939
She even paid enough
over the last two years

165
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,306
that you should have enough
money going forward, son.

166
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,709
Your father has not been
disrespected here.

167
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,078
You both got
what was coming.

168
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,481
But ain't nothing
lasts forever.

169
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,655
Jailhouse snitch?

170
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,624
Called last overnight.
Worden talked to him.

171
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,354
Says for a deal,
he can give us the case.

172
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,488
- No shit.
- Gonna write up a writ,

173
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,293
send it over
to the State's Attorney's office,

174
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,698
get them to sign off on it
first thing tomorrow morning.

175
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,465
- What's the rush?
- We jump on this.

176
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,369
We cause a major shit stink
right before the election.

177
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,533
If this guy really knows
why the witness-- what's-his-name?

178
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,099
- Braddock.
- --was killed,

179
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,373
might be bad for the mayor.

180
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,107
If it's not bad
for the white boy, Carcetti.

181
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,444
You care, either way?

182
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,972
Fuck no. I don't give
a shit either way.

183
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,415
I don't even vote.

184
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,510
But it'll be fun to fuck
with them downtown suits.

185
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,214
Maybe get you on the 1 1 :00 news.

186
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,553
Get a little payback
for all that shit they put you through.

187
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,453
With only two days left
before the primary,

188
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,989
campaign officials
traded charges today

189
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,228
over a controversial
flier distributed

190
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,499
in some African-American
neighborhoods.

191
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,870
What seemed to be a secure lead
for the incumbent mayor

192
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,273
has evaporated in recent days.

193
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,743
The latest "Sun"-WQMD poll

194
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,509
shows the two men
in a virtual dead heat

195
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,675
with Councilman
Tony Gray trailing.

196
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,118
4% of the likely voters
are still undecided,

197
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,883
and with the prim--

198
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,293
I can't wait
for it to be over.

199
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,091
Yeah, me either.

200
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,121
Can that flier hurt you?

201
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,166
You know, we found
the original photo

202
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,000
in "The Sun"'s files.

203
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,007
They grafted my puss
onto some perp-walk shot

204
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,531
on the courthouse steps.

205
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,271
I'm standing where some
sheriff's deputy was.

206
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,972
Oh my God.

207
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,878
What a nasty business.

208
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,712
Royce is swearing
he had nothing to do with it.

209
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,810
Claims it must've been
somebody freelancing.

210
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,753
Well, Norman and Terri
say not to worry.

211
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,517
It's all in the game.

212
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,253
You know, when I was
15 points behind,

213
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,694
I was resigned,
you know?

214
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,357
A landslide,
I could live with that.

215
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,196
I mean, what else did
anyone expect, anyway?

216
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,203
White guy runnin'
for mayor in Baltimore?

217
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,864
But this:

218
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,567
Jen, if I lose this here
by two points, it's gonna kill me.

219
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,511
It's gonna just fucking kill me.

220
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,047
You gonna have to
step up now, Nay.

221
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,056
A'ight.

222
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,149
Be the man of the family.

223
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,059
You older than your daddy was
when he went out on the corner.

224
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,460
That's what I been sayin'.

225
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,191
Damn. He quit school.

226
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,893
You ain't quittin' school.

227
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,231
- Not yet.
- Ma.

228
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,066
But you are goin' out
on your own.

229
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,005
You gonna ask Bodie
for a package.

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,133
What if he say no?

231
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,474
I ain't take
no for an answer.

232
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,470
- Just did.
- What you mean?

233
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:47,383
- From Brianna.
- Hand me the damn phone.

234
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,654
What she say about you already
gettin' paid enough money?

235
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,922
She a lyin' bitch, Namond.
You see?

236
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,828
There's a lot about this world
you just don't know.

237
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,294
What it come down to is
she know you ain't gonna snitch.

238
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,465
- No matter what shit she pull.
- She got that right.

239
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,238
She takin' advantage of you, Bey.
She takin' advantage of you.

240
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,338
Sound like she got it all figured.

241
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,110
Bitch got it figured out, all right.

242
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,208
She cuttin' us loose
without notice. Nothin'.

243
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,516
Like comin' home,
findin' our shit in the street, Bey.

244
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,785
She don't give a fuck
about you, Avon, none of it.

245
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,792
She had the nerve
to talk to me on this,

246
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,192
Iike she gonna
set things straight

247
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,026
so I don't tell no lies.

248
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,442
Jen, I'm sorry.

249
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,104
He said he'd be up.

250
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,614
He's already gone
to the office.

251
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,208
Well, what's he doing there?

252
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,617
He couldn't sleep.
He's been there for hours.

253
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,053
Aw, shit. See ya.

254
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,291
And given that we still
have a shortage of officers

255
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,798
willing to work secondary
at the polling stations,

256
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,595
we're asking
for anyone interested

257
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,228
to contact Tactical
this afternoon.

258
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,795
Next order of business:
fresh warrants,

259
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,704
beginning with murder
and weapons charges

260
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,936
on one Omar Little.

261
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,968
Anyone know this mutt?

262
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,140
Oh, yeah!

263
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,548
- Who'd he kill?
- Some lady in a store.

264
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,882
- Reads like a taxpayer.
- A taxpayer?

265
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,979
From what this says,
he's charged with felony homicide,

266
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,922
to wit: murder in the commission
of a robbery.

267
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,152
About fuckin' time someone got
some paper on that motherfucker.

268
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,754
Anyhow, we got no fixed
address, no known abode.

269
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,161
But if apprehended,

270
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,826
contact Detectives Holley
and Crutchfield in Homicide.

271
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,164
You wanna find Omar Little?

272
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,500
You look for a corner boy
running away from a corner

273
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,129
with shit in his pants.

274
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,103
You ever know Omar
to do a citizen?

275
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,512
Anyway, pass these around.

276
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,255
- Jesus, Tommy.
- I spent a couple hours

277
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,261
going over the latest data,
rearranged the schedule.

278
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,489
Tommy.
A little bit of knowledge--

279
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,259
There's a bunch
of middle class black precincts

280
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,425
which are strong on Tony
but still have a high undecided.

281
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,059
I think we can
pick up some votes--

282
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,161
Those people hate the mayor.
You're gonna get those votes,

283
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,798
- and if you don't, Gray will.
- We go door to door today.

284
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,705
As long as they
don't go to Royce.

285
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,403
I need some black votes
if I'm gonna be mayor.

286
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,071
I need some kind of mandate
from that community.

287
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,205
If I sneak in with a bare plurality...

288
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,443
We might just win this thing.

289
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,780
What do you think
kept me up all night?

290
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,412
With all due respect
to your early-morning analysis,

291
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,049
we got three back-to-back
drive-time radio interviews

292
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,752
I wore out
my kneepads to get.

293
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,387
The people running your campaign
are professionals, Tommy.

294
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,092
Don't try this shit at home.

295
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,827
You know, there might
just be a job for you

296
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,835
in a Carcetti administration--

297
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,734
press secretary, chief of staff.

298
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,035
Oh, get in the fucking car.

299
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,842
Duquan:

300
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,540
Mr. Prez.

301
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,378
Can you come
with me, please?

302
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,475
What'd I do?

303
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,958
Get here early.
I'll let you in, and you can shower.

304
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,304
My dirty clothes?

305
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,967
Put 'em in this bag,
leave 'em in the locker.

306
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,444
I'll bring 'em home
and wash 'em.

307
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,937
Go ahead and get cleaned up.
You'll be late for class.

308
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,396
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Monnel.

309
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,734
Skanky ho.

310
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,170
Damn, she good, though.

311
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,730
Yeah yeah.
You right about that.

312
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,708
Hey, yo, Tiff, baby.
I got 50c too.

313
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,335
Fuck y'all.

314
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,744
Damn. All three at once?
You know she could.

315
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,078
I know you could.

316
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,018
- Sir.
- At ease.

317
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,587
Man, I hate it when the bosses
creep below the eighth floor.

318
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,325
Yeah, well, I need a moment
just to unclench my asshole.

319
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,732
- Sir?
- The Braddock investigation.

320
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,797
It's coming. Norris and Greggs
are wringing it out.

321
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,240
I fuckin' know it's coming.

322
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,267
Commissioner Burrell
had a visit first thing this morning

323
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,801
from State's Attorney
Demper himself,

324
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,280
asking why one day
before the primary

325
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,341
our detectives were trying
to writ out a jailhouse snitch.

326
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,012
The tip came when it did.

327
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,214
I didn't push it,
and I didn't hold it back either.

328
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,847
Let the chips fall
where they may.

329
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,448
Exactly, sir.

330
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,325
Sergeant?
Fuck your falling chips.

331
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,522
If Braddock was killed
because he was a witness

332
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,896
and we break the case
one day before the primary,

333
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,926
Royce hates us forever--
and Royce might win the election.

334
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,165
If Braddock was killed
for any other reason

335
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,605
and we break it today,

336
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,303
then Carcetti hates our guts--
and Carcetti could win.

337
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,869
I see your point.

338
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,210
Tactical tells me
we're still about 20 bodies short

339
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,048
for manning
the polling places.

340
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,021
I want you to detail
two detectives

341
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,217
to uniformed
election duty immediately.

342
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,749
Lemme guess:
Norris and Greggs.

343
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,318
Sounds good.

344
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,296
They're to report
to Tactical at 1 300 today

345
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,300
for election orientation.

346
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,666
They can pick up
their writ

347
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,001
and talk to their snitch
on Wednesday.

348
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,563
American democracy.

349
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,135
Let's show those
Third-World fucks how it's done.

350
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,805
Yes, sir.

351
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:55,283
I have what I think is
some very good news for all of you.

352
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,311
We're going
to be implementing

353
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,984
the University of Maryland
pilot program.

354
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,788
You're only taking
three of my knuckleheads?

355
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,852
A total of 10 children
from the eighth grade

356
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,023
in this first class--
eight boys and two girls.

357
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,363
- If things go well...
- It's a start.

358
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,494
- When?
- This morning.

359
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,266
Hallelujah.
Not a moment too soon.

360
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,142
- How was l?
- Good on Steiner.

361
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,508
Better on the A.M. talk shows.

362
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,945
I thought you handled that call
about the fliers well.

363
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,712
Fucking Royce.
If I lose because of this bullshit--

364
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,050
You lose, we can blame it
on 10 different things.

365
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,055
Same thing if you win.

366
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,421
Guess who I just
got off the phone with?

367
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,926
State Senator Davis.
He wants a meet.

368
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:40,159
Clay Davis? Why would I wanna get
into bed with that motherfucker?

369
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,825
He didn't actually
come out and say it,

370
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,357
but it sounds
like he's ready to follow Watkins

371
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,733
and jump the mayor's ship.

372
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,964
What's he want in return?

373
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,495
Shee-it. Same thing
he always wants.

374
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,407
At least 20k to his favorite
campaign committee is my guess.

375
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,502
Maybe even 30,
'cause you know Clay ain't cheap.

376
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,639
Well, I'm not promising him
anything policy-wise.

377
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,651
You think Clay Davis
gives a fuck about policy?

378
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,448
Naw, this is strictly
for services rendered.

379
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,317
He might be conning us--

380
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,084
taking the money,
then sitting on his hands.

381
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:09,059
Maybe. But then all
we have to lose is money.

382
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,086
Could be the extra little push
we need on the West Side.

383
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,690
Set it up.

384
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,496
I already did.

385
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,561
- lnvert the denominator--
- What invert mean?

386
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,072
The numerator
and the denominator switch places.

387
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,974
- Turn upside down.
- Why you do that?

388
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,478
Because it works.
That's the formula.

389
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,605
Excuse me,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

390
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:34,085
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson
and Zenobia Dawson.

391
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,349
Grab your things
and come with us, please.

392
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,687
- Ooh!
- Quiet, quiet.

393
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,716
Calm down, please.

394
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,194
- What'd we do? We in trouble?
- Just come with me.

395
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,720
Shit. It's the story of my life.

396
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,096
They ain't coming back.

397
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,124
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
they gettin' arrested?

398
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,499
No...

399
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,670
Yo, Nay,
can I have your Xbox?

400
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,368
'Cause you ain't gonna
need it where you are.

401
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,637
What'd they do?

402
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,271
Markeith, Kwame
and Latonya.

403
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,372
Bring your things
and come with us.

404
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,077
Ooh!

405
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,518
Again?

406
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,170
You know I can't
publicly endorse you.

407
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,800
Not at this late hour.

408
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,401
Then what are
we talking about?

409
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,608
I lay back and not do
what I usually do on election day.

410
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,172
I see you all get a push

411
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,081
in the Seventh
and Ninth Districts, say,

412
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,281
and maybe that piece
of the 1 1th west of Freemont.

413
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,255
I split some
of my tickets for y'all.

414
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,383
I split my walkaround money.

415
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,054
You know,
the usual to-and-fro.

416
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,603
Politics is
a good thing, pardner.

417
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,131
That's a minority opinion.

418
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,041
Let's order.

419
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,706
I'm hungry enough to eat
the horse you rode in on.

420
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,240
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy

421
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,345
- for a sit-down lunch.
- Oh, no doubt.

422
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,255
Just leave enough
for the tab.

423
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,316
Naw, she crazy.

424
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,822
She says you were there.

425
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,586
I wasn't. Besides,
it wasn't even rape.

426
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,820
- She wanted to.
- How do you know? You weren't there.

427
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,987
I saw her go in with them.

428
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,360
Go in with who?

429
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,864
This is no time
to play, young man.

430
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,163
You are in very serious trouble.

431
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,795
Who did you see her go
in the boys' bathroom with?

432
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,464
Paul and Monnel.

433
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,407
Paul and Monnel?
And what were you doing?

434
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,433
- Lookout.
- So you were involved.

435
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,671
But I didn't even see
what happened.

436
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,770
You were standing guard.

437
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,474
No, listen,
Monnel gave me $5

438
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,109
and just told me to stand by the door
and holler if someone came.

439
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,516
This isn't even fair.
I didn't even do nothing.

440
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,384
You stood lookout
while two eighth-grade boys

441
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,786
raped an eighth-grade girl.

442
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,847
But she wanted to.

443
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,825
That's not what Tiffanie says.

444
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,259
There'll be an investigation.
You'll be suspended.

445
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,058
You could very well be expelled,

446
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,531
maybe even face criminal charges.

447
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,033
Mrs. Donnely, please don't.

448
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,659
Mrs. Donnely, please don't
call my foster mother.

449
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,431
I'll tell you everything
I know about this.

450
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,699
I know all about it already.

451
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,206
No, but I know
some other stuff,

452
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,208
Iike who been thieving
from the teachers' lounge,

453
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,176
or tagging gym lockers, or even...

454
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,872
- Miss Jeffries, please.
- Miss Donnelly, please...

455
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,676
This is Mrs. Donnelly
calling from Tilghman Middle.

456
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,545
Listen... I know...

457
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,414
remember, the boy who cut
Mr. Philmont's tires?

458
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,612
I know who did that.

459
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,279
I know about a murder.

460
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,123
I do.

461
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,028
We've identified certain students

462
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,002
we feel will benefit
from the special curriculum

463
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,471
and the smaller class size.

464
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,667
We've chosen 10 students
from the eighth grade

465
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,370
to participate in this program.

466
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,742
You get chose,
you got to go?

467
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,805
- That's right.
- What if you don't wanna?

468
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,372
It's mandatory.

469
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,581
We feel that this program
will benefit everyone.

470
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,318
You'll get the attention you need.

471
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,791
And we outta
everybody else' shit.

472
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,527
My bad.
I ain't mean to curse.

473
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,155
Yeah, but you're right, though.

474
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,133
This class get tore up,
it's only on y'all.

475
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,605
- So we get put outta class.
- This is a classroom, too.

476
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,131
And every one of you
has proven time and again

477
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,306
that you're not ready
for a regular classroom.

478
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,647
But this is a new program
that if you work it

479
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,881
is going to make you ready.

480
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,786
Ready for gen pop.

481
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,623
This is prison, yo.
And we in solitary an' shit.

482
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,787
- Word.
- Solitary.

483
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,858
That's good, son.
This is solitary.

484
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,369
This is the hole
up in here.

485
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,638
He's a good kid.
He really is.

486
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,274
And once you make that call,
his name's gonna be in the system.

487
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,513
What can I do?
He says he knows about a murder.

488
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,918
I have to notify police on this.

489
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,423
At least let me call
someone I trust.

490
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,324
That's him right there.

491
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,850
Stand by. You don't wanna
be in on the collar?

492
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,830
Nah. If you take it, he'll think
it's a straight interdiction,

493
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,355
and I get to surprise him
at the bail review.

494
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,903
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,302
Can I have your attention?

496
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,796
Now boarding at
gate letter D, track 4,

497
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:35,745
the southbound
8:45 Acela Express from New York,

498
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,715
making station stops
at BWl Rail Station

499
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,016
and Union Station, Washington.

500
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,885
Sister, help you
with your bag?

501
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,653
- No, thank you.
- Don't be afraid.

502
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,092
What should I be afraid?
Who are you?

503
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,755
Just walk you to the door.

504
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,787
My husband
is waiting outside.

505
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,163
Like to meet him.

506
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,929
I'll wait with you,
make sure you're safe.

507
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,334
That really
won't be necessary.

508
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,998
- Amtrak police, sir.
- Could you step over here please?

509
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,907
- What is this?
- Give me the bag.

510
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,877
What is going on?

511
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,471
I don't know this man.
Where are you taking me?

512
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,083
- What'd he say about it?
- Nothing much.

513
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,215
Drugs?

514
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:23,125
I didn't question him
too close.

515
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,959
A murder.

516
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,362
I should
take it downtown.

517
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,025
Who knows
what he really knows?

518
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,197
I just-- I don't want to see him
get chewed up by the system.

519
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,036
Let me try
to keep this close,

520
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,566
give it to someone with
a little bit of discretion.

521
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,272
Appreciate it.

522
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,644
- Carver.
- Carver?

523
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,114
Ellis has come a long way.

524
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,142
I think he'd be right for this.

525
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:52,179
Why do you care?
And what's this kid to you?

526
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,815
I don't know.

527
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,055
He's one of my students.

528
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,425
Sergeant.

529
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,868
Clean. Both of 'em.

530
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,371
Say what?

531
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,600
Nothing in that bag
but ladies clothes.

532
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,735
Nothing dirty
on either one of 'em.

533
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,905
Unless you got another idea,
we gotta cut 'em loose.

534
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,044
From what he says,
he was just a go-between.

535
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,783
He delivered a message.

536
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,816
He told the victim to be
at a certain place at a certain time.

537
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,418
Then how does he know:

538
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,520
He says everyone knows
what happened to Lex.

539
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,691
It's in the streets.

540
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,324
This other thing at the school.

541
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,528
I swear I didn't
do it, Miss Anna.

542
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,333
I didn't do it.
You'll see.

543
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,636
School's gonna look into that,
we're gonna look into this.

544
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,543
As long as Randy cooperates,
tells everybody the truth--

545
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,480
- But if word got out--
- Understand.

546
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,416
That's why he's gonna go to school,
keep his mouth shut,

547
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,444
his nose clean,
go about his business.

548
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,787
Child's shown such bad judgment
in both instances.

549
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,315
Agreed.

550
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,352
But from what I can tell,
he's not a bad kid.

551
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,369
Dennis:

552
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,068
Where you goin'
at so early?

553
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,873
Oh, I'm gonna go run,
and then I got lawn work later.

554
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,675
You comin' back, right?

555
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,614
What you mean
am I comin' back?

556
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,879
It's gonna be
like that, huh?

557
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,150
What do you mean?
Like what?

558
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,732
- Where to?
- Highlandtown.

559
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,427
Flush out yo' base,
little trooper.

560
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:38,307
- What up, Spider?
- Hey, shorty.

561
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,180
Thank you, but I know
how I'm voting.

562
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,618
I'm gonna
be late for work.

563
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,086
Miss Anna, is it okay
if I stand out here

564
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,953
while you go vote?

565
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,788
- Don't you go nowhere, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

566
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,693
So, what up, man?
So, how much they payin' you for this?

567
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,789
They say like 40, but I gotta work
the whole day though.

568
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:55,890
Know what I mean:

569
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,798
Yo, Spider.

570
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,802
Yo, that was Spider, right?

571
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,241
- Yeah.
- Well, where'd he go?

572
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,279
No, thank you, man.
I can't vote.

573
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,909
Conviction? Felony?

574
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,543
Move on, man.

575
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,315
A'ight, man.

576
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,256
You see Spider again, you tell him
he need to come past my gym.

577
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,226
He ain't been round in weeks,
and we need to talk. A'ight?

578
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,821
A'ight.

579
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,627
- Where's the older kid?
- I don't know.

580
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,758
- Okay. You're hired.

581
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,269
Shove one of those
into every hand you can.

582
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,405
Thank you very much.

583
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,974
Why you ain't at school?

584
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,417
Ain't no school today.

585
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,388
- One them Jew holidays?
- Election.

586
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,153
- So what you gonna do?
- Dunno. Hang.

587
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,093
What'd I say
about steppin' up?

588
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,825
Brianna turn off the faucet.
We gotta make some rain.

589
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,698
I'm gonna get dressed.
We go see Bodie.

590
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,939
Kid, I got
something else for you.

591
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,310
Put one of these
in every door

592
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,871
between the expressway
and Winchester,

593
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,473
and from Freemont to Fulton.

594
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,678
You can do it by yourself
or you can get some friends,

595
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,244
but I'm gonna come past
this afternoon, make sure it's done.

596
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,755
Okay. One in
each door. Cool.

597
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,623
This is
for the day's work.

598
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,058
- Whoa.

599
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,790
That's your walk-around.
But don't you fail me.

600
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,628
Took forever.
What's all this, son?

601
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,033
Man said if I put
these fliers in doors, I can get paid.

602
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,163
I come right home after.

603
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,900
You right you will.

604
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,669
You ain't
in these streets no more.

605
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,940
No, ma'am.

606
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,379
Sounds like she mean it.

607
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,414
"11 :00 News," huh?

608
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,079
Shut up.

609
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,587
I'm on this shit detail

610
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,681
because you wanted
to stir the pot.

611
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,659
And tomorrow, if we bust open
the Braddock case,

612
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,490
nobody's gonna give a fuck.

613
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,655
Life is timing.

614
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,096
No shit, fucknuts.

615
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,000
Tommy Carcetti.
How you doing?

616
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,506
- He's a cute one.
- Thanks.

617
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,133
Hey, Tommy Carcetti.
Hope you're voting today.

618
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,609
I am.

619
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,168
Well, who's it gonna be?
Give me a hint. Come on.

620
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,440
Don't keep me
in suspense.

621
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,708
You don't have
to worry about me.

622
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,308
Appreciate it.

623
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,151
Tommy Carcetti,
running for mayor.

624
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,885
Nice to meet ya.

625
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,485
- How much longer?
- I think we can wrap this up.

626
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,086
We got a lot more
places to be today.

627
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,893
Tommy Carcetti.
I knew your dad.

628
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,490
First District Democratic Club.

629
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,331
- No kidding.
- Just wanted to say you got my vote.

630
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,963
- Thank you.
- They had their chance.

631
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,802
Look what shape
the city's in.

632
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,171
I'm hoping
to turn things around.

633
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,403
Anyway, thanks for your support.

634
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,468
I mean,
you expect politicians to steal.

635
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,777
- I don't, actually.
- It's part of the game. I understand.

636
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,182
But we took one dollar
outta every three, not two outta three,

637
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,880
Iike these moolies.

638
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,185
I mean, leave something
for the city, for Christ sake.

639
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,786
Am I right?
Best of luck, Councilman.

640
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,092
Moolies:

641
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,223
Sorry.

642
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,759
Election fliers:

643
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,828
Yeah, just run up,
stick 'em in mailboxes,

644
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,896
you know, screen doors,
whatever.

645
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,272
- What about the vacants?
- We ain't even got to do the vacants.

646
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,243
Shit. Some blocks
ain't nothing but.

647
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,109
That's what I'm saying.
This be easy money.

648
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,374
Don't wanna do it:

649
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,813
- I do it.
- Me too.

650
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,578
Yo, this shit'd
be easier if we had a car.

651
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,280
Dang, Donut. I'm in enough trouble
with Miss Anna as is.

652
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,311
So, what up, Mike?
You in?

653
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,790
All right, then.
I'll holla at you later, boy.

654
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,432
Look, Namond's been--
what's the word?

655
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,094
He been inconsistent.
You know sometimes he be doin' good,

656
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,625
then other times, he just--

657
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,104
We talked about that.
He gonna do better.

658
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,165
Ain't you?

659
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,870
Election day special,
two for two!

660
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,071
- I don't know.
- Oh, I do.

661
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,081
You gonna give this boy
his own package

662
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,208
or there gonna be some drama.

663
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,014
You want me to talk to Wee-Bey?
Maybe you wanna talk to him.

664
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,078
I give you his number.
He got a cellphone.

665
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,419
All that's not even necessary.

666
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,253
I got all the respect
in the world for Bey.

667
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,556
Then show some
for his family.

668
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,492
Make me proud, hear:

669
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,146
Damn, boy. Your mama's
what niggas call a dragon lady.

670
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,709
She don't blink.

671
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,186
Yeah, gimme some
insight, though.

672
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,214
- To what?
- Why you is what you is.

673
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,808
Yo. What up?
Where y'all goin'?

674
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,444
Hungry, man.
I need to eat.

675
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,954
Nah, come one.
Let's finish this.

676
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,149
Nah, yo.
This shit is boring.

677
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,421
- Fuck it.
- Listen, I ain't even gonna pay y'all

678
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,052
if you don't finish
the job, so...

679
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,960
You already
got the money?

680
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,725
Fool, if the motherfucker
paid you out already,

681
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,665
then why the hell
are we still here?

682
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,190
'Cause this is the job.

683
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,965
Shit, the man ain't got
nobody to blame but hisself.

684
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,471
It's his fault
for payin' up front.

685
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,599
Yo, you need to split
that money up or something

686
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,109
'cause time is a-wastin'.

687
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,676
Didn't even finish
the day's work.

688
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,579
Get me something
at least.

689
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,612
- Lake trout.
- Soda too?

690
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,887
- Yeah. Strawberry.
- A'ight. I got ya.

691
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,119
Hey. Where the crew at?

692
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,718
Randy got 'em all some job

693
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,422
handin' out election
fliers or whatever.

694
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,896
You ain't wanna do that?

695
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,890
Hell, no.
It's bullshit, man.

696
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,460
- I got a job too.
- Word?

697
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,268
Yeah, with Bodie.
I'm movin' the package.

698
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,276
You wanna go
in on it with me?

699
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,837
You sure?
We could work together.

700
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,075
Nah, man,
that's your thing.

701
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,311
Go do what you do.

702
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,115
Yeah, a'ight.
I'm gonna holler at you.

703
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,360
She a cute one,
ain't she?

704
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,668
Yeah, boy. You know
I love the women.

705
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,109
Hey, you seen Spider
around any?

706
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,811
I mean, he ain't been
'round the gym in like a month, man.

707
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,820
I leave messages,
he don't call.

708
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,845
I don't understand, man.

709
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,686
He was one
of my best welterweights.

710
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,988
Now, why would he just
quit like that?

711
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,927
Why don't you ask his moms?

712
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,261
Well, shit. I was locked up
a good while, right.

713
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,897
I mean
I ain't no angel.

714
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,100
Naw. You ain't that.

715
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,848
Thanks a lot, folks.

716
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,979
Good job. Keep it up.
We're almost home.

717
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,923
You're the best.
The best.

718
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,220
Heavy turnout all around.

719
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,125
Big lines on the West Side
might be bad for us.

720
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,719
- I dunno but--
- Shh.

721
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,993
We're out here
in West Baltimore,

722
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,433
- the heart of his political base.
- This is today?

723
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,198
This is live,
right now in Lafayette Square.

724
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,727
Clay Davis just said
his whole organization

725
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,967
was out going door-to-door
for Royce's ticket.

726
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,600
So much for laying back
on the mayor.

727
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,543
We paid $20,000
for this shit?

728
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,376
He probably went to Royce
and shook him down for another 30.

729
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,508
Motherfucker. Clay Davis
must know something we don't.

730
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,850
He knows just enough
to get paid twice.

731
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,912
Gotta blame ourselves
for payin' this thief up front.

732
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,821
Hey, it was
worth a shot.

733
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,418
Aides to the mayor have told me
privately that they are concerned...

734
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,795
Thanks, yo.

735
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,168
I'm-a get me a cold one.

736
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,668
Grab the wall.

737
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,041
Officer Walker.

738
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,222
I ain't gonna be
out here strapped.

739
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,197
Aw, you gonna
take that on a humble?

740
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,797
Boy, you don't know there's
rules to this here game.

741
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,102
- Rules?
- Yeah.

742
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,199
Ugh!

743
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,916
Where your shotgun at,
Mr. Omar?

744
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,183
What is wrong with y'all, man?
Y'all ain't got no charges here.

745
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,849
Charge is murder, motherfucker.

746
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,222
Murder: Who I kill:

747
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,193
Hey, Omar.

748
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,924
- McNulty. What the hell goin' on here?
- You tell me.

749
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,432
We got a warrant
for a robbery murder. In a store.

750
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,968
Wagon's here.

751
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,273
Hey, yo, McNulty,
I need a phone, yo.

752
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,407
Fuck your phone.

753
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,011
If I'm going to Booking,
I need to make a call tonight, yo.

754
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:59,026
410-958-6612.

755
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,361
An' let it ring.

756
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,960
Here.

757
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,096
- Hey.
- Yo, Butchie. I'm locked up, yo.

758
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,469
What you need?
I got your bail.

759
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,167
Nah, no bail.
They sayin' it's murder.

760
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,768
Murder?
Well, don't worry. I got ya.

761
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,880
You some
kinda Democrat or what?

762
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,119
Voter turnout was heavy
all day across the city

763
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,753
with some precincts
reporting lines

764
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,060
as soon as the polls opened
at 7:00 this morning.

765
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,329
Election officials, however,

766
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,665
reported few problems
throughout the day.

767
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,102
Now the polls have closed,

768
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,901
officials at the Board
of Elections downtown

769
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,432
have begun the tedious process
of tallying the vote,

770
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,378
prepared for what could be
a long night.

771
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,679
With just over half of the city's
316 precincts reporting,

772
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,619
Councilman Thomas J. Carcetti
has a narrow lead of 2%.

773
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,090
Traditionally, those precincts
that report latest

774
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,093
tend to be
from West Baltimore,

775
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,925
which is expected to favor
Mayor Royce in the late going.

776
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,636
- How it go?
- Good. Nothin' to it.

777
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,007
I'm countin' on you, Nay.

778
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,382
Exit polls done earlier
in the day in key precincts

779
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,757
show voters divided
over the challenges facing this city,

780
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,127
such as crime
and education.

781
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,136
...be quite an election.

782
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,941
Since this race tightened
in the last couple of weeks,

783
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,072
I've been saying
that this election

784
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,583
would be won on the ground.

785
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,085
And whoever has the best
field operations will take it.

786
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,645
It's all about the turnout,
and this is something--

787
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,281
What about Bond?

788
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,691
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

789
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,252
Yeah.

790
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:17,495
All right.
Talk to you in a few.

791
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,729
Bond's running really strong
against Demper.

792
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,534
Looks like we might have
a new State's Attorney.

793
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,507
What does that
mean for you?

794
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,338
Well, Demper's Royce's boy.

795
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,537
Dare to get
your hopes up, Tommy.

796
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,811
You know what? Let's get
outta here for awhile,

797
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,784
take a walk.

798
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,802
I'll get your ass.

799
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,933
- Pretty.
- A little ripe.

800
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,336
Well, can't do anything about
the way the harbor smells.

801
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,603
People are gonna
expect you to.

802
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,769
I guess.

803
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,175
You sound confident.

804
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,077
I have a feeling.

805
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,123
Could be a great city again.

806
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,126
Pull some jobs in here.

807
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,526
People move back,
fix up the houses.

808
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,860
It's ringing again.

809
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,626
Terri.

810
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,138
Maybe you should answer it.

811
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,003
I don't need an update
every five minutes.

812
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,236
- No, we should go anyway.
- Do we have to?

813
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,109
I'm sure they're frantic.
They don't know where you are.

814
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,407
Yeah?

815
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,249
Taking a walk with my wife.

816
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,687
On our way.

817
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,969
Royce is conceding.

818
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,939
The West Side
precincts came in

819
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,875
and we pulled two
outta five votes in some precincts.

820
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,276
We stole his base.

821
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:46,112
We won.

822
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,447
Are we happy about that?

823
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,522
I think so.

824
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,617
I think we are.

825
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,491
Yeah.

826
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,965
You sure?

827
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,852
Thank you.
Thank you.

828
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,465
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Please.

829
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:42,097
I want to thank you all
for your hard work and dedication.

830
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,437
Give yourselves
a hand. Come on.

831
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,509
I just got off the phone
with Mayor Royce and Councilman Gray.

832
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,380
They were very gracious.
I asked for their help.

833
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,409
I mean, we still have
a general election to win.

834
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,653
Is there
a Republican candidate

835
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,388
for mayor in Baltimore?
I don't know. I'm not sure.

836
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,522
But, assuming that we win,
we still have--

837
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,759
we still have a lot of work
to do to turn this city around,

838
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,701
and we need everyone--
everyone who's willing to join us

839
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,569
in making a better Baltimore
for our children.

840
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,603
I don't want to make
a long speech. Believe me.

841
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,170
You don't want to hear it.

842
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,511
I don't want to make
a long speech,

843
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,743
so I'll thank each
of you individually.

844
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,375
But for tonight,
let's celebrate.

845
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,617
Tommy! Tommy!

846
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,159
How you doin'?

847
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,034
Thanks. Hey.

848
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,039
Damond.

849
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,734
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Mayor.

850
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,299
Likewise.
And congratulations to you, too.

851
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,972
- Thank you.
- I'm going home.

852
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,605
No, come on. Stay.
I won't be long.

853
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,378
Yeah, you will.
It's your night.

854
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,916
Tommy. Tommy.

855
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,548
Look what washed up
on the beach.

856
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,422
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

857
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,620
Just came by to wish you well.

858
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,889
Looking forward
to working with you.

859
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,294
Shouldn't you be dead to me?

860
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,993
Sheee-it. I took it
easy on you, son.

861
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,501
I coulda had you
for twice as much.

862
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,527
You got off cheap.

863
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,598
He's right.

864
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,468
Butchie sent us.

865
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,513
What you in for?

866
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,419
I'm here on a 22-55.

867
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,919
I talked back.

868
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,332
- Moolie:
- Moolie.

869
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,595
He said that
in front of you?

870
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,569
He made a point of it, in fact.

871
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,538
You're the one said
I oughta shore up my base.

872
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,006
You didn't call him on it?

873
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,838
The ironies of democracy.

874
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,538
A vote's a vote.
And I never throw one back.

875
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,513
Speaking of ballots,
did you vote for me, Norman?

876
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,606
The sanctity
of the voting booth

877
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,777
is a cornerstone
of American democracy.

878
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,456
I gotta go.
You need a ride?

879
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,584
- Yeah.
- Come here. You're the best.

880
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,322
Thanks, Norman.

881
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,490
- Yeah, take a break.
- You got it.

882
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,090
One day.
Two days.

883
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,532
Come here, you.

884
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,627
- Be good.
- I'm gonna call you.

885
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,103
I have
a feeling you might.

886
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,674
Good night.

887
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,946
Ooh, I should go, too.

888
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,546
One for the road?

889
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,320
Sure. Scotch okay?

890
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,884
Sure.

891
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,501
You know, I gotta admit,
it feels good.

892
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,663
You deserve it.

893
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,572
You worked hard.

894
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,599
I did. I do.

895
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:43,374
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

896
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:54,282
You know, when I took this job,
you promised me a win bonus.

897
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,417
Well, you earned it.

898
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,485
I can't do this.
Not now.

899
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,750
Oh, come on, Tommy.

900
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,553
You haven't changed.

901
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,081
Hell, from what
Norman tells me,

902
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,720
you nearly fell off
the campaign trail for a blonde

903
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:36,254
at the Stonewall dinner
two months ago.

904
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,097
He had to drag you
out of the bar.

905
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,797
It's not that
I don't want to--

906
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,036
Oh, you're feeling
a bit mayoral. Right.

907
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:49,239
You're onstage now.

908
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,247
Well, Tommy...

909
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:55,377
four years is a long time
for a fellow like you.

910
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,717
This could be
your last chance for a while.

911
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,572
You sure?

912
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,578
Maybe you have
learned something.

913
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,459
Write me a check.
