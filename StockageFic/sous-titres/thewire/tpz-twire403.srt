1
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,852
Yo, Renaldo!

2
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,222
- Renaldo!
- Que?

3
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,991
Next time you finish up the box,
you need to holler on it, yo.

4
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,863
Sí sí.

5
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,636
Hey, y'all, it's Omar.

6
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,447
- Omar.
- There he is.

7
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,451
- Omar step, yo.
- Omar, yo.

8
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,737
Y'all ain't got
no Honey Nut?

9
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,501
Whatever you see.

10
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,007
And a carton of Newports.

11
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,208
Omar comin'.

12
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,741
Hey, y'all,
here he come.

13
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,552
Omar. Omar.

14
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,323
Omar strollin'.

15
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,440
They don't have
the Honey Nut?

16
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,552
- I don't even want this, dawg.
- Why not?

17
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,561
It ain't what you're taking,

18
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,529
it's who you taking it from,
you feel me?

19
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,464
How you expect to run
with the wolves come night

20
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,834
when you spend all day
sporting with the puppies?

21
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,377
- So you staying with Royce, I see?
- What you mean?

22
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,882
Oh, man.

23
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,722
Makes sense since I know
you got your fill of Carcetti.

24
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,349
They've been puttin' up
a crop of these things

25
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,827
on every lawn
on the block.

26
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,998
And as fast as I take 'em down,
they bring more.

27
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,197
That's what they do
this time of year.

28
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,536
I see you're
at your leisure.

29
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,207
I work two nights a week,

30
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,509
three day shifts
and no weekends.

31
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,847
I'm off till this afternoon.

32
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,511
You're good with it?

33
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,079
It ain't the Hopkins gig,
but it'll do.

34
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,992
Pullin' 52, good bennies,
got a take-home car.

35
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:39,020
I mean the hotel manager's
a pain in the ass, but still.

36
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,728
Well, if you was a bit free,
I heard something.

37
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,603
This thing over at University of
Maryland School of Social Work--

38
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,507
- they got a grant. Big money.
- Just stop.

39
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,034
Half a million to look at
repeat violent offenders,

40
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,377
clinical intervention--
all that mess.

41
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,212
So they gonna study
some shit, huh?

42
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,846
Melvin, I had me a good helping
of them downtown, tie-wearing,

43
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:06,154
come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well
college types last year.

44
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,717
You sure? 'Cause I sold 'em on it,
should you want it.

45
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,992
Bunny, you're a big man
down on the campus.

46
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,090
You the police
that legalized it.

47
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,328
The college boys
loved that mess.

48
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,961
Nobody else did, though.

49
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,973
Well, I tried.

50
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,841
You did.

51
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,938
Yo, blacktops, pandemic.

52
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,148
Pandemic,
got that pandemic.

53
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,679
Pandemic.

54
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,957
My mac, pandemic,
blacktops right here.

55
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,473
That's my boy, right?

56
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,873
Ain't taking no handouts,
but he workin' for it.

57
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,809
See what I mean?

58
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,573
This nigga's made
a little something out of this corner.

59
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,784
Now hold on, son.
We're just talking now.

60
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,779
- All right?
- Man, y'all did good with this spot.

61
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,724
You a rightful hustler.

62
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,092
What's your name again, man?
Boney? Biddy?

63
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,359
- What's it now?
- You know my name.

64
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,628
Yeah, but now
here's the thing:

65
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,965
With this spot
all built up and shit,

66
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,062
- we need it, yo.
- Yeah.

67
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,232
- What?
- Two choices:

68
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,538
You can start taking our packages
or you can step off.

69
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,374
My man Chris is
gonna holla at you, all right?

70
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,141
You tell him
what it need to be.

71
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,509
Don't wait for the pandemic.
It's right here, y'all.

72
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,578
Don't sleep
on the pandemic.

73
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,587
I want to know more
about that boy right there.

74
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,391
Got good signs on him.

75
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,454
Big paws on a puppy, huh?

76
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,956
Yeah, big paws
on a puppy.

77
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,492
To a "T."

78
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,402
Get that blacktop
before you flop.

79
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,607
Get that pandemic.

80
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,007
The truth is we don't know
why he was killed.

81
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,841
It could have had something to do
with him being a witness

82
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,848
or it could be unrelated.

83
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,373
Now, whoever leaked that shit
to Carcetti's camp,

84
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:17,219
- they lied on us.
- Yeah, well, that's it.

85
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,420
Eight points--
close as Carcetti gets.

86
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,554
He wants to go
big dick with me?

87
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,531
I'll show him
what he can't handle.

88
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,557
We put it out there:

89
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,762
Anyone contributing
to both sides

90
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,566
gets frozen out
of my next term.

91
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,233
- No one rides the middle anymore.
- Done.

92
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:39,973
Next, I want DPW and HCD
out there today

93
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,480
tearing down
all Carcetti's signs.

94
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,848
Any lamppost, median,
any city-owned buildings,

95
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,080
unless the homeowner's
out there arguing,

96
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,348
- tear it down.
- Done.

97
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,356
Third, I want transpo

98
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,984
camped outside of
Carcetti's headquarters.

99
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,122
Any car, any violation,
the meter flag goes up,

100
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,894
- inspection sticker-- tow it.
- Done.

101
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,926
Next, you two,
slow it down.

102
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,940
Nothing else comes out
about that murder

103
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,340
until after the primary.

104
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,934
And I want both of you

105
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,436
to go to the press
and talk down that witness angle.

106
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,473
Take the full weight
either way it goes.

107
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,509
Clarence, I'm running dead even
with Bond right now.

108
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,022
How are you gonna be running
if I drop you from the ticket?

109
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,421
Okay, that's it.
Thank you, gentlemen.

110
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,487
Go to it. Now.

111
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,021
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,642
- What?
- Carcetti has a point.

113
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,375
I went down to Annapolis,

114
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,576
got matching funds
for witness protection.

115
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,109
You didn't earmark a dime
to put 'em into play.

116
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,920
- Next fiscal year.
- Don't claim poverty on this.

117
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,016
We're only talking
a quarter of a million.

118
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,359
I match those funds now
and that motherfucker Carcetti,

119
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,365
he's got a campaign highlight:

120
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,391
"Tommy Carcetti expands
witness protection program.

121
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,232
Fought for
and won extra funds."

122
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,135
Hell with that!

123
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,733
I go after that state-match funds
after the election.

124
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,037
Naw naw,
I paid for three pills.

125
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,478
Look, blue shirt
gets two.

126
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,777
- Naw, I get two.
- White shirt gets one.

127
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,148
- Cheatin' motherfucker.
- I get four.

128
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,588
Look, blue shirt gets two,
white one, no shirt one.

129
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,182
Now y'all can take what
y'all paid for and walk away

130
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,125
or just walk away with nothing.
Motherfuck a refund.

131
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,957
No, nigga,
I paid for three.

132
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:14,022
You need to rethink what putting
a hand on me's gonna get you.

133
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,558
You can thank your friend here
for snatching away y'all highs.

134
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,637
Yo yo, hold up, hold up.
Can I get my two?

135
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,779
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

136
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,912
You don't rattle. Yo, you come up
under my wing, young'un,

137
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,922
you ain't gonna do nothin'
but rise, man.

138
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,584
I don't even know why
you thinkin' about quittin'.

139
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,217
Look, man,
like I already told you--

140
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,558
I'm all the way repaid,
and tomorrow's school.

141
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,531
Come on, man, what the fuck
do you want to go to school for?

142
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,534
What do you want to be?
An astronaut?

143
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,059
A dentist?
A pay lawyer, nigga?

144
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,402
Look, check it out:

145
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,705
Why don't you just come
down here after school

146
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,075
and just work
these rush hours for me.

147
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,079
How about that:

148
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,989
Hey. Hey.

149
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,530
That's great. Thank you.
I know that kind of money--

150
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,468
I said I know that kind of money
doesn't come easy to anyone.

151
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,638
No, it's just something
on my end here--

152
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,547
some construction
or something-- right.

153
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,143
Yeah, right.
Thanks again.

154
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,019
Two hours, 30 grand.

155
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,682
Am I getting the hang
of this or what?

156
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,123
What the fuck is that?

157
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,286
DPW's tearing up
the sidewalk

158
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,625
right outside our door.

159
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,291
You really pissed him off.

160
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,197
Yes, I did, didn't l?

161
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,395
Come on.
Door-to-door in lrvington.

162
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,997
- Right.
- And we got that dead witness tonight.

163
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,620
Yeah. Federal?

164
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,653
Naw, she ain't no federal.

165
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,427
That there a city girl.

166
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,833
I like shorty too.
She's all right...

167
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,804
as long as she don't
get in my way.

168
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,706
Re-up right there.

169
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,678
Por qué:

170
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,977
School ain't starting
till tomorrow, right?

171
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,178
The little one'll be all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

172
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,049
Yeah, you know it too,
don't you, girl?

173
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,353
The camera-- if you go
in front, they're gonna--

174
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,949
They're supposed
to know it's me, man.

175
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,984
I'm my own trademark.
You feel me?

176
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,791
Sí, but if they know
it's you, then--

177
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,127
What, you scared
on bein' made, huh?

178
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,133
Claro que sí.

179
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,625
How 'bout I put you
in one of them full-body bunny suits?

180
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,663
You'd be like a six-foot rabbit
putting a pistol in their face.

181
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,292
Let me get a pack
of Juicy Fruit.

182
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,406
You look like one of them
half-soul, half-Chinese types

183
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,375
from Vietnam and shit.

184
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,006
Come again now,
Mama-san.

185
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,761
Patience, girl.

186
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,667
More patience.

187
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,873
The guy drives a shit box.
He's got a two-bit minimart,

188
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,275
but the back door in there
is reinforced steel,

189
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,802
and the security camera
on the street is high-end.

190
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,510
Not only that, but I think
I made the re-up today:

191
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,679
Schoolgirl with
a heavy backpack.

192
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,780
Hmm. Well, I pulled
Andre's phone history

193
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,654
trying to find
Marlo's organization,

194
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,125
cross-referencing DNRs
to other cells.

195
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,424
This is Fruit.
This is Monk,

196
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,363
and there's three or four
other good probables.

197
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,333
Not likely to find a direct line
to Marlo that way.

198
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,666
Andre had to go through Monk
to get to him.

199
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,898
No, but we might get
a cell on Chris Partlow,

200
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,169
or for tote or for one,
of the top lieutenants.

201
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,176
- We're gettin' close.
- Uh-huh.

202
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,270
Deputy pulled me downtown.
You guys aren't into any shit,

203
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,541
- are you?
- No, sir.

204
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,552
Good he wasn't down
at the ocean today.

205
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,087
And the subpoenas?

206
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,593
You won't see
a page of anything

207
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,288
until after the primary.

208
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,796
After that,
if a document lands

209
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,559
and there's no one
there to read it,

210
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,658
will the mayor and his people
honestly give a shit?

211
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,328
Other than that,
what can I tell you

212
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,735
except to get that unit
back on the street where it belongs?

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,206
Lieutenant, you are relieved
from command of Major Crimes.

214
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,771
You've done exceptional work,
and in light of that,

215
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,680
we want you to improve
the performance

216
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,685
of another vital aspect
of our mission--

217
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,550
- Sir?
- Telephone Reporting Unit.

218
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,556
You report there
tomorrow, 0800.

219
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,787
Have I done
something wrong?

220
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,387
Lieutenant Marimow will be
taking over Major Crimes.

221
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,922
If you need to brief him,
do so promptly.

222
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,893
Yes, sir.

223
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,905
Jimmy, how's that
beach house coming?

224
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,204
Beach...
um, fine, sir--

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,676
Great. Sounds great.

226
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,089
Yeah, hand me
the colander, will you?

227
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,321
He's early.

228
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,487
You get the door.
I'll do that.

229
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,531
- Hey!
- Hey!

230
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,762
Come in.

231
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,703
- Ooh, smells good.
- Spaghetti-- nothing fancy.

232
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,296
"Côtes du Rhône"?

233
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,002
Yeah, the sommelier
behind the plexi said it was dry.

234
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,944
- Hey, Beadie!
- Hey, Bunk, how you doing?

235
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,413
Whoa, look at you!
Blonde and all.

236
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,609
- You like it?
- I do, I do.

237
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,174
Hey, kids.

238
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,847
This is Jack, that's Cary.
This is Detective Moreland.

239
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,150
- Hi.
- Hi!

240
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,282
- Call me Bunk.
- Let me open this wine.

241
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,260
Yeah, that's right.
Let that shit breathe.

242
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,762
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,960
- That's all right. They hear worse.
- Yeah, no doubt.

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,262
So, you want ice
in yours?

245
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,326
No, man, that's
a double-digit vino.

246
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,770
- Even has a cork.
- Swell.

247
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,674
- I like your binders.
- Thanks!

248
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,543
McNulty gave them to us.

249
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,207
- McNulty?
- Yeah.

250
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,580
- Not Jimmy?
- No.

251
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,710
Uncle Jimmy? Jim?

252
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,049
- No.
- No:

253
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,213
Daddy? Pops?

254
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,189
McNulty.

255
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,885
Oh, just plain McNulty.

256
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,887
And if I take
his weak-ass product,

257
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,832
that means I'll be makin' less money,
you know what I'm sayin'?

258
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,334
Only reason I could bring
any life to this strip

259
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,269
is because of the good shit
that y'all was givin' me.

260
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,602
then I'm standing here like
a asshole holding my Charles Dickens

261
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,301
'cause I ain't got
no muscle, no backup.

262
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,640
Shit, man. Yo, if this
was the old days?

263
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,408
Yeah, now, well,
the thing about the old days,

264
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,075
they the old days.

265
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,176
People I'm working with now...

266
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,016
So you want to bump with Marlo
over real estate?

267
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,322
You're on your own.
But if you want my advice--

268
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,851
I don't, man.
I don't.

269
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,865
Bodie. Yo, Bodie.

270
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,732
Me:
I lost the wholesale

271
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,704
to every crew
in Winchester homes.

272
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,639
Them horses takin'
Marlo's shit now.

273
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,667
He pushin' the independents
over hilltop, too.

274
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,545
I lost three crews
there this month.

275
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,981
What about the East Side?

276
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,677
There we got
a much bigger problem:

277
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,686
all those ugly-ass bitches
in Yankee hats

278
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,620
chasin' all
the locals away.

279
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,782
I heard them New York boys
ran off most of Delroy's people,

280
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,452
and those that stay
gotta take they package.

281
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,291
Man, all this theorizing
about how it be product,

282
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,264
not territory?

283
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,458
You can't talk that shit

284
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,194
if a nigga snatchin'
all of the territory

285
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,827
an' won't take
none of your product.

286
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,736
See, the thing is Marlo's
only takin' a little bite.

287
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,208
Them New York cats is like
Wal-Mart comin' to town.

288
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,474
Me, personally, I think
it's time Wal-Mart went home.

289
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,481
If we gonna bump with 'em,
it's got to be all of us.

290
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,575
I tell you what: I'd like to see
Marlo with us in on that one.

291
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,554
You know what I mean?
One big Baltimore team.

292
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,989
Yeah, Marlo can make an inconvenient
nigga disappear, can't he?

293
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,950
I heard he got
some kinda hookup

294
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,225
at this funeral home
in Westport.

295
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,630
Coffin goes in there
needs two pallbearers.

296
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,066
Come out, you need eight
to carry that bitch,

297
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,626
you know what I mean?

298
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,161
Nah nah. He usin'
them shut-up rowhouses.

299
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,972
Dump a body in there, no one
can tell one smell from another.

300
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,777
Well, whatever he doin',
he cold, but he ain't stupid.

301
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:27,148
Think it's time to try again
to talk to the boy.

302
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,211
I hope you got better shit
to say than Stringer

303
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:35,625
'cause young'un ain't given
no one an ear yet.

304
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,262
Dang, Jimmy, you're
a domesticated motherfucker.

305
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,458
Yeah, I guess I am.

306
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,399
Yeah, we're good.

307
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,992
How's everything
at the port?

308
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,300
- Quiet.
- It's quiet everywhere.

309
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,704
- Even the Western.
- Yeah.

310
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,765
I'm having a hard time
with it, though.

311
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,003
Somethin' ain't right.

312
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,443
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

313
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,946
- You working something?
- Yeah, I got this one case.

314
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,246
I know who the shooter is
but can't find him.

315
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,784
He'll turn up.

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,156
- Maybe.
- More?

317
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,987
Oh, mercy.
No, ma'am.

318
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,253
Dessert:

319
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,228
I was thinking we might
go out for a little taste.

320
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,198
Unless you got to
tuck in the kids.

321
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,429
- I don't know.
- Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go.

322
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,300
I'll tuck 'em in.

323
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,308
She trusts you.

324
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,744
Yeah.

325
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:37,021
Can't go to dinner without
catching a page, huh? What now?

326
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,821
Her john jumps in the shower.
She rummages his wallet.

327
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,419
He figures it out
and beats on her

328
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,056
till the people next door
call the front desk.

329
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,644
Sir, if she doesn't have
the money on her,

330
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,089
I don't know
what I can do.

331
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,786
Did you beat
that woman in there?

332
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,851
I just want
my money back.

333
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,089
Excuse me, Mr. Gergen.

334
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,598
I need a moment
with my director of security.

335
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,405
If she presses charges,
I'm cuffin' that motherfucker.

336
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,771
Mr. Colvin, this is
a delicate matter.

337
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,900
"Delicate"? Shit.

338
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,672
Mr. Gergen represents
a national consortium

339
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,146
of convention planners,
and he's been a friend of the hotel--

340
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,775
Mr. Colvin:
Mr. Colvin:

341
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,308
Now, you took his cash
and he beat you good, huh?

342
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,685
How much
he beat you for?

343
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,284
How much:

344
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,630
Give me the cuffs.

345
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,338
No, Mr. Colvin. I...

346
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,632
What the fuck is this?

347
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,578
She steals my money,
and you're gonna lock me up?

348
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,978
You're gettin' charged
with assault.

349
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,482
You wanna charge her
with the theft,

350
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,279
I'll put the cuffs
on her, too.

351
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,842
But you in a wagon,
shitbird.

352
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,046
Mr. Colvin,
this is not acceptable.

353
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,952
No. He's goin'
in a wagon.

354
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,752
Mr. Colvin,
I have to insist.

355
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,088
30 years
a police officer,

356
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,650
I never took cuffs
off a right charge.

357
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,184
Ain't about to start now.

358
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,493
You're not a police officer,
Mr. Colvin.

359
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,590
You work for us.

360
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,692
Naw, I'm good.

361
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,685
You nursin' that thing
like a baby bird.

362
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,565
You know those little corner joints
in the ghetto

363
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:41,038
that sell subs,
and fried chicken, lake trout?

364
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,233
Lake trout:

365
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,044
Like egg creams
in New York.

366
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,341
No eggs, no cream.

367
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,541
Exactly.

368
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,745
No lake, no trout.

369
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,050
They're pogies.
Whitefish, trash fish.

370
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,251
Exactly.
White trash fish.

371
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,894
I mean, "lake trout."
That's all marketing.

372
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,295
It's just all dressed up
like something it ain't.

373
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,367
You know
what I'm sayin'?

374
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,171
Sometimes it is what it is.

375
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,040
It really is.

376
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,206
That's deep.

377
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,919
I like the way
you think.

378
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,479
Yeah, you too.

379
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,397
Hold on.

380
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,901
Dang, Bug, if you can tie one shoe,
you can tie the other one.

381
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,666
You hear me?

382
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,834
Cookies all on your face.

383
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,105
Come on.

384
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,174
What up, shorty?
Ready for the first day?

385
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,184
Yeah, he can't wait
to be in the third grade.

386
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,846
Ain't that right, Bug?

387
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,821
'Sup?

388
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,585
Dukie.

389
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,229
Cool.

390
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:27,102
Look at all these big-ass
eighth graders out here.

391
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,512
Look like some sixth-graders
gonna get banked.

392
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,573
Yo, come in here.
I wanna show y'all somethin'.

393
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,278
Go ahead, Bug.

394
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,345
Yo, what up, boy?
That jersey's crazy, son.

395
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,380
Where you get that at?

396
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,199
Yo, check it.

397
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,929
This dude in the joint
with my father drew these.

398
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,527
I'm about
to get one on my arm.

399
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,800
Is this you? Why would you
get yourself on your arm?

400
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,466
In case you forget
what you look like?

401
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,907
Yo, what do
these mean, man?

402
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,000
A'ight,
this one means "heart"--

403
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,307
Iike, you know,
"He got heart"--

404
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,779
and that means "lion."

405
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,872
How you know that?

406
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,041
Word, the dude
could be playing you.

407
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,573
Like, this one,
instead of "heart,"

408
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,643
it could mean like
"bitch" or something.

409
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,555
And like this one, it could mean
like "pussy" or "clown."

410
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,888
Come on, man.
Fuck y'all motherfuckers.

411
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,156
- They probably do, too.
- Man, get outta my house.

412
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,685
Understand something
about me:

413
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,325
I may be wearing
these bars,

414
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,200
but I worked the bricks
to earn 'em,

415
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:29,400
and I am stone-cold police
first, last, and always.

416
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,965
Froze my balls off
in the winter,

417
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,307
sweated 'em in the summer,
ran, jumped,

418
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:38,145
rolled in the dirt with
the bad guys 24/7/365.

419
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,879
Now, I'm a great admirer
of this unit.

420
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,982
Avon Barksdale? That was
a 14-point buck you bagged.

421
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,322
However, we are
gonna do better.

422
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,589
And if there's a case
to be made out there,

423
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,357
we'll make it together

424
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,697
with good work
and good supervision of that work.

425
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:01,138
I want to be briefed
every step of the way.

426
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,002
Questions?

427
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,239
No:

428
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,737
Good.

429
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,691
Yo, who you got?

430
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,892
I got... "Prez"--
"Prez"-- what?

431
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,301
I got Mrs. Scott. Fuckin' hate
that foul bitch, man.

432
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,532
Man, she ain't that bad.
At least you ain't got Sampson.

433
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,561
Yeah, I know.

434
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,336
Yo, Michael,
who you got?

435
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,147
"Presborowski"?
"Prez"--

436
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,812
Yo, he new and white.
We got it made.

437
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,225
Uh-oh, look at this.

438
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,566
Where is your fine
take-home car?

439
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,670
Got took home.

440
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,271
We need to talk.

441
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,029
Sixth grade is
on the first floor!

442
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,632
Seventh grade is
on the second.

443
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,509
Eighth-grade homeroom
is on the third floor!

444
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,207
Don't go up
the down staircase.

445
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,648
Quickly and quietly,
people.

446
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,175
I see you, Quantell.

447
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,279
I see you too.

448
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,382
School's getting ready
to start. Come on.

449
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,460
Hi, dear.
Good to see you back.

450
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,395
Yo, what up, Turner.
You back for more?

451
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,026
Aw, damn, man.
I love the first day, son.

452
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,161
Everybody all friendly
an' shit.

453
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,967
Namond Brice.
Already, we're starting?

454
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,645
Damn, man.

455
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,478
Next time, they stay
in my drawer.

456
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,711
Yo, whatever, man.

457
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,652
I know, right?
Already, son.

458
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,558
I know, right?
We're seventh graders.

459
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,145
Yo, dang.
You see Neesy?

460
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,308
Yo, them bitches
is on steroids, word.

461
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,184
Word, son.
Send them bitches to lran.

462
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,155
That shit'd be over
in a heartbeat.

463
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,091
Okay, check the chart
to see where you're sitting.

464
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,030
Check the chart.

465
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,265
Hi, I'm Randy.

466
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,365
How are you doing,
Randy?

467
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,639
Check the chart.

468
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,257
Okay. Good morning.

469
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,660
Okay, good morning.

470
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,759
Yo! Shut up!

471
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,564
Good morning.

472
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,166
I'm your homeroom teacher,
obviously.

473
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,471
My name is
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

474
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,446
But you can call me
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

475
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,251
Okay. Let's find out
who you are.

476
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,116
This is Mrs. Donnelly.

477
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,649
Teachers, we had trouble
with first bells,

478
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,492
so expect the class change
to ring in one minute.

479
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,990
Students will walk, not run,
to classes in an orderly manner.

480
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,730
Okay, um, we'll, uh,

481
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,833
get to know each other
a little later.

482
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,620
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

483
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,956
Latifah.

484
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,096
Uh, sorry.

485
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,497
Where my bus passes at?

486
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,699
Crystal Judkins,
you're not listed.

487
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,208
Crystal? I look
like Crystal to you?

488
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,438
I'm Charlene.

489
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,279
Ronald Parker:

490
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,306
Ha. Karim Williams.
Ronald over there.

491
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,785
Aw Jeez.

492
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,220
Yo, Mr. Prez, I need a hall pass
for the bathroom.

493
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,450
It's an emergency.

494
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,287
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.

495
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,461
Hold on. Whoa.
Everyone, stay where you are.

496
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,487
Stay where--
I need those passes back.

497
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,261
It's an emergency.
Mr. Prez...

498
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,894
Everyone, I need
those bus passes back.

499
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:32,960
The kids that need them...

500
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,096
- Mr. Prez...
- What?

501
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,230
Just take one.

502
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,706
I need those
bus passes back!

503
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,766
No one leaves this room

504
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,904
until Mr. Pryzbylewski
gets those bus passes back.

505
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,437
Do I need
to say that twice?

506
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,478
Thank you.

507
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,714
Thank you.

508
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,592
You'll get the hang of it.

509
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,111
Come in.

510
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,352
Are you coming in
or what?

511
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,415
I'm coming in, okay?

512
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,571
You asked
to see me, sir?

513
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,541
I did.

514
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,252
Seeing as how I like to know
my boys in depth:

515
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,018
why'd you want this unit?

516
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,827
Honestly?

517
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,318
I took the sergeant's test,
scored pretty high,

518
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,355
but not high enough.
And Lieutenant Hoskins,

519
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,196
we went through
the academy together.

520
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,225
He said that this--
this is a good detail

521
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,669
for going up the ladder.

522
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,298
I mean I know
you have to do it for a while,

523
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,332
but maybe next year,
if I do good here,

524
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,040
they'll reach down for me.

525
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,275
Next year, huh?

526
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,648
I mean, for some things,
that's a long time to wait.

527
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,921
Excuse me:

528
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,924
I hear you're a good cop.

529
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,949
I also hear you recognize
who your friends are

530
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,121
and that
you're loyal to them.

531
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,562
Did I hear
all that right?

532
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,463
Absolutely.

533
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,460
Where are you
on the list?

534
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:51,066
32. They took 15, but--

535
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,077
Thirt-- man, I thought you were
gonna say something like 60,

536
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,045
or, you know, 95.

537
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,585
Hey, let me call
my man Burrell.

538
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,611
No need in wasting
good police like you

539
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,850
chauffeuring
around politicians.

540
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,381
I don't even know
what to say, Mr. Mayor.

541
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,884
This-- this is unexpected.

542
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,955
Don't mention it.

543
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,992
Today being the first day,
let's have some fun.

544
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,799
I'm gonna throw you
a little math puzzle,

545
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,433
see if I can get you
thinking on your feet.

546
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,444
Andre is leaving Baltimore...

547
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,072
Uh, Mr. Prezbo,
I need to change my seat

548
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,241
'cause this boy here
smells like a garbage can.

549
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,244
All right, you need to work a little
on your compassion skills.

550
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,585
Yeah, he needs
to work a little

551
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,217
on his soap
and water skills.

552
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,418
All right,
like I was saying,

553
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,658
uh, my friend Andre
is leaving Baltimore.

554
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,757
He's going
60 miles an hour--

555
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,462
Hey, what side of Baltimore,
east or west?

556
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,061
It doesn't make
any difference.

557
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,972
That's what you think.

558
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,999
Okay, east.

559
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,805
West, west, okay?

560
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,443
Okay.

561
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,477
Uh, and he's going, uh,
to Philadelphia...

562
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,988
Man, Philly's ass.

563
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,513
Yo, you think
Allen lverson is ass?

564
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,990
- Okay, stop.
- He only play for them.

565
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,186
He ain't from there.

566
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,489
Hey, I never play
for the Sixers

567
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,961
no matter how much
they pay me.

568
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,829
Nigga, they'd pay yo' ass
to go away. Ha ha.

569
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,357
Enough!

570
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,729
Okay, Andre's leaving Baltimore,
West Baltimore,

571
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,968
traveling 60 miles per hour.

572
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,602
He's going to Philadelphia
which is 80 miles away.

573
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,043
What kind of car?

574
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,478
Hey, he drivin' on l-95,

575
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,947
he need to watch out
for the state police.

576
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,609
They be profilin' niggas.

577
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,982
He ain't say Andre
was black, yo.

578
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,920
C'mon, Randy. "Andre"?
From the West Side?

579
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,389
- Hey, he ain't say he was black.
- Yo, you know he black.

580
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,290
Okay. Okay.

581
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,557
I said okay!

582
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,120
Mr. Prezbo.
You say he travelin' in a car.

583
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,998
Is he driving? Or is he
like in the back seat?

584
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,333
All right, you know what?
Fun is fun--

585
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,303
Hey.

586
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,745
Take your seats!

587
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,777
Everybody sit down!

588
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,255
Hey.

589
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,327
Everything okay in here?

590
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,966
Why isn't
Officer Massey present?

591
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,570
Working overnight
on the wire.

592
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,047
Attendance at all office
meetings is now mandatory.

593
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,982
Inform her.

594
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,884
And this Marlo Stanfield?
This is the best we can do?

595
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,412
- Sir?
- This is the guy

596
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,584
we're wasting months
chasing with a wiretap?

597
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,026
We could be on the street doing
a dozen other different things.

598
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,757
Stanfield is a comer.

599
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,163
He's got a lot
of West Side real estate.

600
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,757
How many bodies on him?

601
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,202
He fought a war against
the Barksdales last year

602
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,263
and dropped a few,
but nothing recent.

603
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,603
Nothing recent?

604
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,109
He owns West Baltimore
but with no bodies:

605
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,942
Maybe it's just me,
but in 18 years out there,

606
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,175
I have never seen
a carnivore eat a carrot.

607
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,739
He's been quiet
for a time--

608
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,252
"For a time"? This city's up
to its hips in blood

609
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,447
and you are sitting on
one guy with a history?

610
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,582
Okay, here's the new
world order, guys.

611
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,855
I want good, quick rips.

612
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,590
Six, 10,
12 felony cases a month.

613
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,191
That means no more long-ass wiretaps,
no more subpoenas,

614
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,825
no more mincing
around on shit.

615
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,995
We get out on the street
and come back with stats.

616
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,528
The Barksdale case
is closed,

617
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:45,337
and when the Stanfield wire
comes up for another 30 days,

618
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,435
we close out on that as well.
Understood?

619
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,911
You know,
to hell with this.

620
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,814
We got a wiretap up, and a judge
decides when it comes down.

621
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,513
Well, Detective,

622
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,216
the Deputy Ops is gonna
talk to you about that.

623
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,307
Table B.
Put those cards away.

624
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,609
Kareem Myers.
Sit down.

625
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,579
Yo, yo, listen, listen.

626
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,117
Kit Kats' $1,
Snicker bar's $1,

627
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,056
Warheads' $1,
Twizzlers' $1.

628
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,525
Man, Sour Patch 50c,
and gum 50c.

629
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,195
Anything you can get
at the store,

630
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,930
I can get in here
for y'all.

631
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,029
Gummy bears?
Gummy bears?

632
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,903
Ain't a problem.

633
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,237
I got Snickers, M&Ms.

634
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,766
Yo, check this price
and come holla at me.

635
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,301
Yo, I'm runnin'
a three-for-two discount,

636
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,643
and I'm taking personal
orders for tomorrow...

637
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,272
I'll be here tomorrow.

638
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,646
...so if you want something special,
just come holla at me.

639
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,154
There it is, yo.

640
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,788
Why not give me
a water pistol?

641
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,958
Hey, yo, Renaldo, you just
remember about how we gonna do.

642
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,195
It'll play.

643
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,373
Oye, Gordo.
The package.

644
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,850
Avanza, cabron!

645
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,377
With that raggedy-ass piece?
Nigga, is you crazy?

646
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,616
Loco or something?

647
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,181
Don't you know
the shit is bulletproof?

648
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,749
You don't understand--

649
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,957
You heard
what the boy said.

650
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,872
An' a box of Newports.

651
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,911
Where my change, yo?

652
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,115
Don't wild me.

653
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,123
Hey, yo, you see
the look on his mug?

654
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,830
That's the reason why
we get up every morning.

655
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,607
Okay! Okay okay.

656
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,946
Now, Andre's friend Yvonne

657
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,544
is supposed to meet him
in Philadelphia.

658
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,520
Yeah. Andre gonna
bone that skank.

659
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,251
Can you please shut up? Mr. Prezbo
is tryin' to teach us somethin'.

660
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,522
You shut up, bitch.
He ain't teachin' me nothin'.

661
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,791
Yvonne, though,
is coming from New York.

662
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,391
So my question
for you is--

663
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,570
A, who arrived in Philly first,
Andre or Yvonne?

664
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,510
And B,
by how much time?

665
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,416
And C...
who gives a rat's ass?

666
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,752
With this grant, the mandate
is not only to rethink

667
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,450
the way we utilize institutions,

668
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,153
but to help us start getting past
having to rely on jail

669
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,219
and drug rehab
as our only responses.

670
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,232
We're looking for a specific
target group to inoculate,

671
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,131
epidemiologically speaking...

672
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,864
Doctor, um, pardon me,
I'm not an academic.

673
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,337
Not by a long shot.

674
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:40,105
But, what exactly are you--
are you saying here?

675
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,772
He's sayin' he's got a lot of money
to come up with some way

676
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,214
to go at those boys out there
bangin' on the corners.

677
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,683
That's what I mean, yes.

678
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,879
So where do I come in?

679
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,717
Well, if the salary
arrangements are suitable,

680
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,883
your duties would be to
perform as a field researcher,

681
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,292
a liaison operating
in the, uh, urban environment.

682
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,727
You go out in the 'hood

683
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,460
and get him some
corner boys to mess with.

684
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,094
See? This is why
I need somebody like you

685
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,728
to be paired up with me.

686
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:08,965
I go out there
on my own--

687
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,065
And they sell
your tenured ass for parts.

688
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,042
In so many words.

689
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:17,275
Anyway, um, we're looking
for 18- to 21-year-olds.

690
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,975
This is where we see
the demographic peak

691
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,916
in violent behavior.

692
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,647
You excuse us
for a minute?

693
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,925
What happens when you
ain't around to translate?

694
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,862
Don't play ignorant
on me, Bunny.

695
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,161
You can back-and-forth
with any of these guys.

696
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,258
I've seen you work.

697
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,429
Besides, it's clear you ain't cut out
for the private sector.

698
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,632
18 to 21?

699
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,641
By that age,
they're deep in the game.

700
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,142
He's fucked on that.

701
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,542
So show him.

702
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:53,414
50,000, 80-20 health plan
and a take-home vehicle.

703
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,819
I'd be amazed if they
give you 30, an HMO

704
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,912
and a bus pass.

705
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,092
Peace.
See you later.

706
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,758
I go in there now,
you know what that makes me?

707
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,668
Some fucking asshole politician
who's running for office.

708
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,331
Watkins.
40th District.

709
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,639
You call the reporters?

710
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,941
All three channels
and "The Sun."

711
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,525
My condolences.

712
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,559
I'm Thomas--

713
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,764
I know who you are.

714
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,932
Thanks for your respects.

715
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,559
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

716
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,960
We shouldn't
be here today

717
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:49,955
just because your son
came forward as a witness.

718
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,467
What do you mean?

719
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,492
I know it's...

720
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,040
I'm just sorry for your loss.
That's all.

721
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,268
A parent's
worst nightmare.

722
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,972
I don't know how anybody
can go on after this.

723
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,844
Yeah, me neither.

724
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,906
Ms. Daniels.

725
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,383
Councilman.

726
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,943
How's things going over
in the 11th District?

727
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,150
Harder than I'd hoped for.
Even on the mayor's ticket.

728
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,454
Yeah. Eunetta's
pretty well entrenched.

729
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,051
Good luck
with it, though.

730
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,824
The council sure
could use you.

731
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,634
Councilman Carcetti,
can you give us a minute?

732
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,833
Councilman, over here.

733
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,273
Councilman, do you mind
doing a standup?

734
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,674
Look, guys,
I'm sorry, you know.

735
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,405
Now's not the time.

736
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,174
I don't really
have anything to say.

737
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,909
- I'm sorry.
- What, is he kidding?

738
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,577
What did we
come out here for?

739
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,813
You don't want the press coverage?
Are you out of your mind?

740
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,445
We'll get time on the 11 :00
from the visual alone.

741
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,150
But I start making speeches
right here? Now?

742
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,886
How's that
really gonna look?

743
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,486
Boss, as political theater,
this is pretty fucking lame.

744
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,521
Yeah, well, you know,
that depends on the audience.

745
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,970
This is Shawn Williams.

746
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,497
Lieutenant Mello,
please call shift commander.

747
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,635
Boss, you want me
to stay?

748
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,772
No. We're good.

749
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,384
So, Shawn...

750
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,914
You police. He ain't.

751
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,227
Shawn, how old are you?

752
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,630
18. How old are you,
you shinehead motherfucker?

753
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,102
You have
a sister, Shawn?

754
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,571
What the fuck
you want with my sister?

755
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,039
And what the fuck's

756
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,668
this Chuck E. Cheese-lookin'
motherfucker writing?

757
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,483
Let's say you hear that
your sister was assaulted.

758
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,178
Oh, who fucked
with my sister?

759
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,516
She wasn't.
I'm just saying--

760
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,815
Sayin' what?

761
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,254
Why you fuckin' with my head,
motherfucker?

762
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,120
And this bitch
is writing again.

763
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,523
It's a habit.

764
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,356
Now, what would you do
if you heard your sister

765
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,022
got beat up by some guy?

766
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,192
Which sister?
I don't know.

767
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,201
'Cause it's Cherise,
she probably had it coming.

768
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,533
All right,
another sister then.

769
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,097
Danielle?
I'd fuck that guy up.

770
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,302
I'd fuck his ass shut.

771
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,640
With you in jail.

772
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:48,905
I'd get my boy
to do it.

773
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,207
What if you didn't
have no boy?

774
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,874
Then I'd get the nigga
myself when I get out.

775
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,314
Well, what if you had
a life sentence?

776
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,181
Then I'll fuckin' escape.

777
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,583
And put
that fuckin' pen down

778
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,646
'fore I shove it up
your motherfuckin' ass.

779
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,359
What if you couldn't escape,
Shawn?

780
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,157
Fuck you.

781
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,461
Fuck you.

782
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,899
Would you go
to the police?

783
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,798
Just a question.

784
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,306
Son, thanks for being you.

785
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,185
Thanks.

786
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,156
Look, I'm ready
to acknowledge that, um,

787
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,591
18-to-21 might be
too seasoned.

788
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,001
How you fixed
for juveniles?

789
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,938
Right now?
Fresh out.

790
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,907
The van to baby booking
just left.

791
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,035
But are you looking
for kids in the system?

792
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,511
Or just kids?
'Cause if it's just kids,

793
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,276
you got Douglass right around
the corner, and school's in this week.

794
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,751
High school? That's what?
15 to 18, right?

795
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,209
Yeah, but I would, uh--
I'd go younger even.

796
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,124
Kima. 'Sup, girl:

797
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,396
Are you sure?

798
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,598
C'mon. I'm the one
who took you out of the Eastern,

799
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,333
sent you to the show.

800
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,308
You can't come back here;
you too good for a district.

801
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,776
I need a home, major.

802
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,746
If you need to make a move,
move up or at least lateral.

803
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,806
But a district is
you going backwards.

804
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,410
And you don't need to be
under my wing, either.

805
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,320
You're gonna be valued
no matter where you land.

806
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:43,258
Let me talk to people.

807
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,387
I especially liked the timing
for when you flew your paper.

808
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,659
Shrewd.

809
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,461
I couldn't see anybody
shutting us down,

810
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,094
not with the elections.

811
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,104
What asshole would
risk the headline?

812
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:58,471
But to gut us
from the inside out...

813
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,703
Charlie Marimow.
My Trojan horse.

814
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,912
And now, let me guess,
to save your wire,

815
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,921
you're prepared
to go to Judge Davis.

816
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,480
If my memory serves,
this isn't the first time

817
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,719
a Deputy Ops felt
the need to bury you.

818
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,228
You have a gift
for martyrdom.

819
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,724
I wonder, though, are your
disciples as keen for the cross?

820
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,233
In your final court report,

821
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,037
it would be prudent
to tell the judge

822
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,977
the investigation
hit a dead end.

823
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,550
I doubt you'll
believe it, but...

824
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,189
I respect the effort.

825
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,132
You're a hell
of an investigator.

826
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,432
It would be too much
to expect you

827
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,270
to serve under
Lieutenant Marimow?

828
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,301
The man's a virus.

829
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,813
Oh.

830
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,510
Homicide, then.
That's you, right?

831
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,080
Yeah.

832
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,580
I know it's hard
right now, Detective,

833
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,426
but try to think
of this as a favor.

834
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:58,223
This seems right.
Yeah.

835
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,498
So I understand my old unit's gone
to Lieutenant Marimow.

836
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,295
Yes, it has.

837
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,925
So that unit is--

838
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,960
- Yes, it is.
- That's a shame.

839
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,905
I need to ask if you could
take care of my girl Greggs.

840
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,408
She's a good cop
looking for a home,

841
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,604
and I think she'd
be a natural homicide.

842
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,637
Hmm. Well,
there was an opening.

843
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,819
Oops. Just filled
that last night.

844
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,983
Another fugitive
from Major Crimes, but...

845
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,185
for you, Major?

846
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,161
Let me see who
I don't love no more.

847
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:41,098
Okay, so, if a rocket travels
say, 1,000 miles an hour,

848
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,470
how far does it go
in an hour?

849
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,202
Darnell.

850
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,747
Chiquan?

851
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:58,447
As far as it wants. I mean,
it's a rocket ship, right?

852
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,422
Randy?

853
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,758
Is this a trick question:

854
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,763
Nope.

855
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,594
1,000 miles?

856
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,532
On the money.

857
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,765
Oh, Mr. Prezbo,
I was gonna say that.

858
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,906
Go 'head, bitch.
Laugh at me now.

859
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,649
What? You want some?

860
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,452
You on the fucking
floor, bitch.

861
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,151
Laugh at me now.

862
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:38,217
- Hey!
- I don't hear shit.

863
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,252
Oh!

864
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:43,663
Crystal, have the office call 911,
and get the nurse.

865
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,668
Everybody in your seats.

866
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,238
Just lay still.
Just lay still.

867
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,870
Holy shit.

868
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,971
Just keep putting
pressure on it.

869
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,485
You're doing fine.
Chiquan, you're doing fine.

870
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,953
Just hold on
for a couple more minutes.

871
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,721
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
