1
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:27,747
WMD. Got that WMD here.

2
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:29,758
I'm looking for what you had the other day.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,023
-This shit right here?
-The other day you was calling it bin Laden.

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,793
But now it's WMD.
It will mass destruct your ass.

5
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,662
So this the hi-test?

6
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,631
Same shit, new name.

7
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,671
You be all right.

8
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,316
Okay, get dressed.

9
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:03,084
I pressed you some clothes
and laid them out upstairs.

10
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,286
And don't forget that book bag neither.

11
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:10,793
You got your chrome, young one?

12
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,529
I'll take mine.

13
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,013
Y'all mind the crossfire, you hear?

14
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:24,273
Let's go.

15
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,481
They coming up the alley!

16
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,452
They coming back!

17
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,197
Aim for the chest, brother, you hear me?

18
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,627
Slide up.

19
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,808
You get down on that floor and stay there,
you hear?

20
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:58,074
-You hear me, boy?
-Okay, Mama.

21
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:02,175
Come on!

22
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,508
Fuck!

23
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,115
Shit!

24
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,988
-Why you running?
-What the fuck?

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,167
Oh, shit!

26
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,634
Hit that nigger cold.

27
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:22,666
Bitches!

28
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,809
Why you hiding?

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,967
Drama done with, boy.

30
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,374
You gotta get your bags
and get yourself to school.

31
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,309
Get in, damn it!

32
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,817
T.T., you hear me?
Come on now. The drama's done.

33
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,861
Get your bags and get yourself to school.

34
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,435
I told you, you gotta get ready....

35
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,843
No!

36
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,192
They're changing up?

37
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:33,627
Looking for my La-Z-Boys.
Five of them you got for me, right?

38
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:36,161
-That shipment is tomorrow.
-Got it.

39
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,258
That's what the Newkirk warehouse
was giving us a few days back.

40
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:42,566
Straight, to-the-point drug talk.
No muss, no fuss.

41
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,337
Now listen.

42
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,203
Pyramid, lnc. May I help you?

43
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,940
-You got them Davinas or what?
-I'm told we no longer carry that line, sir.

44
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,747
Between me, Kima, Herc and Carver...

45
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,011
we been sitting on that warehouse
every minute...

46
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,984
since we followed that truck off the docks.

47
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,114
No players coming in or going out.
No drug-related traffic at all.

48
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,717
To top it off,
Sobotka hasn't used his cell phone since.

49
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:09,491
-We tipped our hand somewhere.
-That second can, maybe.

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,092
The port police making a traffic stop
on their cargo must've spooked them.

51
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:15,933
If that's what did it,
we fucked ourselves over nothing.

52
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,667
They dumped that can as a misdelivery.

53
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,643
-What?
-They probably changed that up, too.

54
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,316
If they think we're onto them...

55
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,782
they switch the can themselves,
just to be safe.

56
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,319
And it goes off the docks
with some bullshit inside...

57
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:33,946
-just to see if we pull them up.
-Which we did.

58
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,715
Which I did.

59
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:39,255
No, they're not on us completely.

60
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,895
If they were, they'd be shutting
that warehouse down and rolling out.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,369
Instead, they're just sitting inside that place,
turning away calls...

62
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,405
waiting us out.

63
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:52,498
I, for one, am a patient motherfucker.

64
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,272
Don't waste film.

65
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:03,547
I been here so fucking long
that you're starting to look good to me.

66
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,682
Anything?

67
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:09,986
The drugs go in, they gotta come out, right?
I mean, what the fuck?

68
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,072
Little late.

69
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,144
When a 9-year-old kid hit the pavement...

70
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,509
a district commander would be there
within minutes.

71
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:32,809
I guess we're living in a brave new world.

72
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,111
I was in Washington with Burrell
when I heard.

73
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:36,913
D.C.? What for?

74
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,183
Burrell took some district commanders
down to DOJ with him...

75
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,157
pimping ourselves for a little grant money.

76
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,920
So what do we got?

77
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:46,990
Nine-year-old in his bedroom...

78
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:50,066
catches a seeing-eye stray
through the window.

79
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,498
-Dead?
-Pronounced at University.

80
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,831
-Witnesses?
-No one offering a name...

81
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,873
but the general theme
is two crews arguing over the real estate.

82
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,636
We got casings from at least
three different calibers on the ground.

83
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:03,269
We're gonna canvass hard,
but your people and Tactical...

84
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,042
should hit the area drug corners
and collect bodies.

85
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,844
Fucking pointless.

86
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,617
We jack up enough shitbirds,
this case can fall.

87
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:14,657
I ain't talking about that. I know the drill.
I'm talking about this whole mess.

88
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,094
Been chasing this shit
from one corner to the next like it's a plan.

89
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:21,894
Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps.

90
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,496
You'll feel better when you do.

91
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,229
You told us about WorldCom
and the name change-up, right?

92
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:32,301
-You said that--
-I said change the name of our product.

93
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,934
I didn't say nothing
about taking people off a corner.

94
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:37,775
We done changed the name
of that weak shit so many times...

95
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,145
that don't nobody come down
to the Towers no more.

96
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,014
And them Carrollton boys had it going on.

97
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:45,418
Who shot the young one?

98
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,524
I don't know. I don't think it was us.

99
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,855
Them other niggers was going wild, though,
I mean--

100
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,761
You know, the cops are gonna have to
bang some heads on this one.

101
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,230
They got to.

102
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,299
That means we gotta shut everything down
until this shit pass.

103
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,303
That means the Towers, the low-rises.

104
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,374
Everything gotta take
a long fucking time-out!

105
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,165
I know, String.

106
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,102
I'm sorry, man.

107
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,551
Let me tell you something, man.

108
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:24,054
This here game,
it's more than the rep you carry...

109
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,355
the corner you hold.

110
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:27,521
You gotta be fierce, I know that.

111
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:32,230
But more than that,
you gotta show some flex.

112
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,429
Give and take on both sides.

113
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:37,467
-You hear me?
-Yeah.

114
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:43,237
All right, anything that fired a bullet
out on that corner...

115
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,075
has gotta disappear, you understand me?

116
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,979
I'm not talking about the storm drains.

117
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,951
Call that nigger Shamrock
and drive all that chrome over to the harbor.

118
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,621
All right.

119
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,032
Coming up.

120
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,728
I got people waiting on a package from me...

121
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:41,565
but Sergei says
that until we're sure about the police....

122
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,868
We're not going to be doing that business
for a few days.

123
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:50,338
Your uncle, he is right to be careful.

124
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:52,838
But, Niko...

125
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:56,851
if you are going to be doing this,
you should not be talking to us about it.

126
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,079
Why not?

127
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,752
We are more, what you call, wholesalers.

128
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,924
I'm kind of small-time, huh?

129
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,990
You are not so big,
but you're among friends.

130
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,499
Call that number.

131
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:21,242
-Talk to him.
-Mike?

132
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,837
This White Mike?

133
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:27,280
-You know him?
-From Curtis Bay.

134
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,385
I went to Southern High School
with the guy.

135
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:35,481
You are with us now,
so he will be fair. No problem.

136
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,620
Now, for the rest of our business....

137
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:45,093
We will disappear these containers.
All of them clean.

138
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,469
Take them to Newkirk Street.

139
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:50,897
If there is a problem,
they will stop the trucks...

140
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,737
or we will see the police.

141
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:57,310
If not, no more worries.

142
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,779
All right.

143
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:06,918
We are off the warehouse phone now?

144
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,821
All day yesterday,
I was giving the new number to our people.

145
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,553
This is bullshit.

146
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,333
If they were onto the truck,
then they would've searched it, no?

147
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,070
Five-O!

148
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:36,480
Where you guys going?
Come on, you know the deal.

149
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,248
Get the fuck up against the wall! Hurry up!

150
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,423
Come on, keep moving.

151
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,729
Get him. Down.

152
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:54,694
This is bullshit, man.
You know I ain't did nothing, man.

153
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,972
Everybody gets the special
downtown at central booking:

154
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,807
one baloney sandwich and one white milk.

155
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:08,351
-Just shut the fuck up.
-Man, I'm clean, you hear me?

156
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:11,386
-What are you doing in the Pit then?
-Saying no to drugs.

157
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:15,390
Don't just say no to drugs, motherfucker.
Say, "No, thank you."

158
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:19,890
Put your fucking head down,
step up and get in.

159
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,631
Sit down right here, stupid.
Watch your head going in.

160
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,961
Slide over, asshole.

161
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:29,095
Shame a kid had to get killed
before we got around to doing this.

162
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:33,265
What exactly is it that we're doing?

163
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,711
Young boy killed over bullshit.

164
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:41,306
Now you got the police
crawling all the way up your ass.

165
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:46,454
It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger,
I gotta say.

166
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:51,160
Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that
if I take you up on your offer.

167
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,619
I'll be out there selling that real.

168
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:56,665
My boys ain't gonna be scuffling.

169
00:13:56,766 --> 00:14:01,328
They ain't gonna be scuffling or standing
on nobody's else's corner, starting no shit.

170
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,529
You're Westside.

171
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:06,708
You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right?

172
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,110
No.

173
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,805
Goes all the way back
to Franklin and Fremont.

174
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:13,747
I mean, all the way back to the '60s and shit.

175
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,910
-Sollers?
-Sold heroin like it was water.

176
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,817
I mean,
the motherfucker made himself some money.

177
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:22,824
I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

178
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:24,985
I know you don't.

179
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:27,291
And the police don't.

180
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:31,124
And the stick-up boys
wouldn't have a fucking clue either.

181
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,828
'Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope.

182
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:39,204
No profile, no street rep.
Just buy for $1, sell for $2.

183
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:43,972
Sometimes, when your back up
against the wall, you go to the gun.

184
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,977
I know. I been there.

185
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,179
But you ain't gotta live by it.

186
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:52,678
Avon's a soldier.

187
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,454
That's who you want with you
when the shit fly.

188
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,720
But as far as business go....

189
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:07,259
-You still got that connect?
-Right off the boat, String.

190
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:09,968
All right.

191
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,668
I'm gonna buy from you
at the price you paying...

192
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,738
and I'll let you walk that shit
straight in the Towers.

193
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:22,511
You can have 734, 770 and 221 .

194
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,085
I keep the other three.

195
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,951
How you gonna tell it to Avon?

196
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,194
It makes sense, don't it?

197
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:36,522
He gonna hear something
when it makes sense.

198
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:39,594
Right?

199
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,107
No shit.

200
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,422
-I thought you was in with Nicky.
-Fuck Nick.

201
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,787
He said you was his other half.

202
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,659
I don't want his fucking money.
I mean, that's drug money.

203
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:10,357
And fucking drugs are bad, right?

204
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:13,435
I mean, you gotta consider
what that shit does to the community.

205
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:16,232
You spent all last year with White Mike.
You remember that?

206
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,670
A man can grow.

207
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:22,909
Besides, I got a caper in mind
that is gonna put that horseshit to shame.

208
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,479
I'm telling you.

209
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,446
You want in?

210
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:32,245
-What do I gotta do?
-What a longshoreman does best, Johnny.

211
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,619
Zig, your duck won't touch
the Pikesville rye?

212
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:39,962
He drinks mid-shelf.
He don't like that rail shit.

213
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,460
Fuck if I wouldn't give my right leg
for a shot and a beer.

214
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:49,705
New Charles in the house.

215
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,707
-Moving pretty good.
-Waiting on a prosthetic.

216
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,936
You got a decent lawyer?

217
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:57,808
Nat Coxson hooked me up
through the union.

218
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:00,277
What's with the duck?

219
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,311
-You know you gotta let go of your name.
-Say what?

220
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,823
Yeah, New Charles don't work no more
for a one-legged fuck.

221
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,689
Yeah, maybe "Stump."

222
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,825
You know what? "Peg."

223
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,130
"New Peggy."

224
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,835
-How about "Tilt"?
-Tilt?

225
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,864
Tilt. Just like a pinball machine.

226
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:27,336
Tilt. I like that.

227
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,947
Yeah, I called a couple of nights ago.

228
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,021
Told you I might be in town tonight,
remember?

229
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:43,456
-So, this is your first time?
-Yep, first time for me.

230
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,488
What do you do, Jimmy?
Are you the police?

231
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:49,292
-Do you work with the police?
-No. Christ, no.

232
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:53,930
No, I'm a traveling salesman.
I travel and, you know....

233
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:57,398
-Where do you live?
-I'm not gonna tell you that.

234
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,603
I live out of town.

235
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,038
I'm sorry.
I don't think we can help you tonight.

236
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,273
Thank you.

237
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,351
You sucked. I mean, really.

238
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,547
Fuck if I thought
I was gonna be interrogated.

239
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:18,252
I mean, Christ,
I'm just a guy looking to get laid, right?

240
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:32,363
Hey, fucknuts.

241
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,100
What the fuck is wrong with you?

242
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,872
Christ, Ziggy.

243
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:53,618
Jesus, Zig. What the fuck?

244
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,144
What's up with my cousin?

245
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,012
Don't even talk to me about that asshole.

246
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:23,121
-Drank himself to death.
-Oh, shit.

247
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,558
What kind of fool
would give a duck whiskey anyhow?

248
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,493
That boy ain't right.

249
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:32,329
And his fucking bird
couldn't hold liquor for shit.

250
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:40,699
La-Z-Boys?

251
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,711
And Davinas. Male and female.

252
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:45,505
Dope and coke.

253
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:48,641
-What the hell is a Davina?
-It's like a love seat, kind of.

254
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,447
-Any line on weight?
-All whole numbers.

255
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:54,817
-No halves, quarters, eight-balls?
-Ounces?

256
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:58,060
What kind of numbers
they putting on the furniture?

257
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,095
Nothing much above five.

258
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:03,494
Proposition Joe has Ashland
all the way up to North.

259
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,365
Ten corners, easy.
Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch.

260
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,306
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

261
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:11,068
It's kilos. We're on the main stem.

262
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:14,334
-What was coming and going last night?
-Not much.

263
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,810
No trucks in, some cars in and out...

264
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:19,677
but none of the drug players
we saw rolling up there before.

265
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:23,980
Whatever was in that last truckload
probably went out in car trunks.

266
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,353
They're doing their distribution
somewhere else for now.

267
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:29,721
Which is why job one
is to get back to a good phone.

268
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,090
The same PC
that got you on that warehouse phone...

269
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,220
will get you anywhere else you want to go.

270
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,592
All we need is the new number.

271
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,689
Verizon running
any new lines in there lately?

272
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,098
We talked to the phone security people.
They say no.

273
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,500
Probably going to a cell phone.

274
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:44,698
Best bet is to get the new number
off the Russian's cell phone.

275
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:46,104
Okay, then.

276
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,477
Freamon and Prez,
stay on one shift in the wiretap room.

277
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,604
Bunk and Russell, man the other.

278
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,046
Herc and Carver,
you guys are on Newkirk Street...

279
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,675
waiting to see
if the warehouse traffic picks back up.

280
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:59,482
McNulty and Greggs
have a line into the prostitution ring.

281
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,523
But so far, the people handling the girls...

282
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,683
have been a little cautious
about fresh johns.

283
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,125
So we're gonna need a new angle there.

284
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,526
Questions?

285
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,194
What was your play with those girls?

286
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,466
Out-of-town salesman.

287
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,633
-How far out of town?
-What do you mean?

288
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,768
The farther out of town,
the more they believe.

289
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,437
Less like a cop you sound.

290
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:25,707
You do any accents?

291
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,976
English, British, Scottish,
something like that?

292
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,244
Crikey!

293
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:33,051
I was looking to get a little hanky-panky...

294
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:37,650
and this one bloke gave me this number
to call when I got across the pond.

295
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:40,223
Work on it, son.

296
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,424
$200,000?

297
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,425
That isn't a quarter of what they owe.

298
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:49,596
They say they will pay another $200,000
once their shipment clears the docks.

299
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,900
-And then?
-That is all.

300
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:59,410
These Colombians
are without honor, Spiros.

301
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,106
They are cheats.

302
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,443
-The chemicals we sent are good, no?
-No complaint.

303
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:06,681
They say they want more, even.

304
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:10,623
And they understand that we can guarantee
their product gonna clear Customs?

305
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:12,194
Right.

306
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:17,031
-And still, they try to chisel.
-Why?

307
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,765
What are they thinking?

308
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:22,697
That it is all profit for us.

309
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,897
That we will settle
for half of what we agreed...

310
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,772
because $400,000 is still a lot of money.

311
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,846
The Greek will be angry.

312
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:35,147
This is business, Eton.

313
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:38,453
The Greek? He will be smart.

314
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:48,491
Jesus.

315
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:51,429
You accidentally shoot one 9-year-old
in his bedroom...

316
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:53,593
and the whole city gets its undies
in a bunch.

317
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:55,466
To err is human, that's what I like to say.

318
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,869
The mayor went to the scene
for the cameras last night.

319
00:22:57,974 --> 00:22:59,271
Said the crime will not stand.

320
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:02,138
Tell the mayor we're still working
without an eyeball witness.

321
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,507
How about the street talk?

322
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,582
I got some mentions of a 17-year-old
with the streetname Bodie.

323
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,809
Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus.

324
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:11,853
And why is young Preston
not being hurled with great abandon...

325
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,854
around one of our interrogation rooms?

326
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:16,720
We got cars on his grandma's as we speak.

327
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,620
What the fuck you think
you're dealing with here? Amateurs?

328
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,633
Fuck Nick. This is my thing.

329
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,771
You want in, you gotta deal with me.

330
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:34,001
All right, I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes.

331
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,668
Roadsters, sedans, cabriolets.

332
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,076
I got them brand new,
with the keys in the ignition.

333
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,204
Nothing stripped.

334
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,613
-Off the docks?
-No shit, off the docks.

335
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:44,515
What the fuck do I look like,
a fucking car dealer?

336
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,814
Twenty on the dollar.

337
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:50,290
But if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna
need you to order a minimum of three.

338
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:51,860
Or else it ain't worth it for me.

339
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,987
Now, base price on an S430
starts at $73,000.

340
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:58,362
You round it,
I get $15,000 for each car that you want.

341
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:02,498
A stolen car is a stolen car.

342
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:05,229
Without title,
who is going to pay even $10,000 for it?

343
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,435
Sure, in Baltimore, maybe.
But where you're from...

344
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:11,206
I'll bet you got family
that don't give two fucks...

345
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:14,044
whether or not an American car
got a title on it.

346
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,744
Man, it would be a sad state of affairs...

347
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:19,150
if an international entrepreneur
such as yourself...

348
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:22,520
didn't know what to do
with a couple of extra Mercedes.

349
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:28,928
Big night for Jimmy McNulty.

350
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,966
Or should I say
James Cromwell of Knightsbridge...

351
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:35,162
Stepney and Mersey.

352
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:36,471
Excuse me?

353
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:39,665
Cromwell was the English fuck
who stole my ancestors' land...

354
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:42,744
and the other ones
are all from rock 'n' roll songs.

355
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,574
Anyways, 10:00 tomorrow night...

356
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,581
the shuttle comes for me
on the parking lot off Russell Street.

357
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:48,980
Good work.

358
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:51,879
We'll get Greggs to wire you up
and set the surveillance.

359
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:54,353
Shame we're not up
on a good phone right now.

360
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:57,153
Be nice to tickle the wire
when we raid the brothel.

361
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,319
A little luck,
maybe we get back up before then.

362
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:03,890
One other thing.

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,662
I'm bothered that a Russian immigrant
this deep in dirt...

364
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,500
doesn't have anything
in a law enforcement computer.

365
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:12,597
You still got that friend over in Woodlawn?

366
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,040
I'd like to know what the FBI has
in its database.

367
00:25:15,144 --> 00:25:17,009
After that meeting on the Barksdale case...

368
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:19,638
I made a point of pissing him off,
remember?

369
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:22,713
So what? You do that to everybody.

370
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:26,713
This is George Glekas.

371
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:31,191
He's the cat who owns the appliance store
where that second can landed.

372
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:35,488
Run his ass, too.

373
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:40,194
Why not just cut another guy in
and run them out the bobtail lane?

374
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,237
These babies start disappearing
and everybody on the terminal...

375
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,398
is gonna suspect an inside job.

376
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:47,476
We're gonna need bolt cutters
for the fence...

377
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:49,567
and then we're gonna need
enough wood beams...

378
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,545
to make a track across the grass
onto the road.

379
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,637
Why bother?

380
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:56,775
We can run them cars
over that little patch of grass, no problem.

381
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:58,615
That ain't the plan.

382
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,721
I just saw a can disappear.

383
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:09,229
-Talco line?
-Pakusa working it?

384
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:13,232
-It's him. Do we try to follow?
-We know where it's going, right?

385
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:15,997
1 2-08, you copy?

386
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:19,197
1 2-08, what's up?

387
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,575
We got a can that might be coming to you
off the port.

388
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:25,909
Can number: Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor...

389
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:30,151
4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two.

390
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:34,117
-What do you want us to do with it?
-See if it arrives.

391
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:36,847
And if it does?

392
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,991
See what happens then.

393
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,195
You wanna know something, Carv?

394
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,935
I'm starting to think
that as criminal investigators...

395
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:49,095
we're not really respected.

396
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,637
That ain't necessary, Jimmy.

397
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,175
I knew we were fucking the dog
on that Barksdale thing.

398
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,744
Who do I tell?

399
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,879
We got this new ASAC,
thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss.

400
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:02,883
And believe me, this ain't like your agency.

401
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,680
You piss them off, you ride the boat.

402
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:05,754
Here...

403
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:09,289
you come into work one morning,
you find yourself assigned...

404
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:12,155
to some fucking dustbowl
lndian res in Arkansas.

405
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:14,320
-Still, I was out of line, Fitz.
-Fuck it.

406
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,523
What you got there, brother?

407
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,801
White boys. A different look for you.

408
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:26,705
Funny thing is, they're all showing clean.
What's the chance of that?

409
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,140
Anyways, NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end.

410
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:32,271
Customs had a little intel
on this guy, Glekas.

411
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,790
You said Customs had intel on him?

412
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:46,191
Should show here.
Let me try something else with it.

413
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:53,201
This'll give us any contact your boy
might have had with us, agency-wide.

414
00:27:53,302 --> 00:27:54,599
Got something out of San Diego.

415
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:56,534
-On Glekas?
-We'll see.

416
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,146
I make a long distance call to Hyattsville...

417
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,272
I need three forms
and a lieutenant's approval.

418
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:09,613
Yes, Agent Ernest Koutris, please.

419
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:12,983
Believe me,
we ain't short on paperwork here either.

420
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:14,822
Agent Koutris?

421
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:16,689
Not much to it.

422
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:20,985
We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case
I worked in '95, '96.

423
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:25,392
He was just crumbs, so no charges.
But I did an interview.

424
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:28,764
The guy struck me
as just a mope playing it slick.

425
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:32,539
Yeah, if you want, I can send you what I got.

426
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:34,803
All right.

427
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,470
If you need it, let me know.

428
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:04,970
We need to talk.

429
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:15,408
Anyone following?

430
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:31,155
Run up and down the street.
Take tag numbers from cars.

431
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,626
-All week I've done it. Nothing.
-Again.

432
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,694
The truck is here.

433
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:42,630
Lester, it's here.

434
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,903
They offload anything?

435
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,333
Not yet.

436
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,101
Okay, wait on it.

437
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:54,111
See, the thing about it, Preston,
is that you're unbelievably stupid.

438
00:29:55,284 --> 00:29:56,478
You are.

439
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,749
I don't say it to upset you.
Just to state a fact.

440
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,788
He doesn't think so.

441
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:05,418
Nobody ever thinks they're stupid.
It's part of the stupidity.

442
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,996
You don't need to tell us
what happened on that corner.

443
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,428
We know what happened.

444
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:13,332
We got you, we got your guns,
we got the whole fucking story.

445
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:21,833
Where that lawyer at, man?

446
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,149
See, you just fucked up.

447
00:30:31,254 --> 00:30:34,189
Way you looked at the bag,
you know what's in there, don't you?

448
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,885
That's you, right there, fucking up.

449
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:49,597
-I don't know what you talking about.
-No, you fucked up.

450
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:53,505
We even got your prints on one of the guns.
We even got that.

451
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:55,908
Which one?

452
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:05,551
That's you right there.

453
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,852
Lawyer.

454
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:14,986
They were asking about me?

455
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,164
San Diego.

456
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:21,896
San Diego was a long time ago.

457
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,503
Our friend in Washington
does not know why.

458
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:26,700
Only that the people asked.

459
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:31,041
You told me the police
looking into the women were local.

460
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:32,478
They were.

461
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:33,976
No FBl.

462
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,748
We've been running only clean containers?

463
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,551
Yes. And no one watches, no one follows.

464
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,655
No one stops anything.

465
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,556
And we changed the warehouse phone?

466
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,689
A day or two more,
and we are back to business.

467
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:56,200
We watch, we are careful.
But we are back to business.

468
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,699
You will have to do a favor
for our friend, no?

469
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,277
Fair is fair.

470
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,541
The Colombians, I think.

471
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:08,041
They take our chemicals
and pay less than promised.

472
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,483
Down there,
I understand everyone is a terrorist now.

473
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:16,184
Judges are killed.
Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad.

474
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:22,120
The Colombians who cheated us,
they're not with the guerrillas.

475
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,698
They're trash.

476
00:32:26,102 --> 00:32:28,502
The world is a smaller place now.

477
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:34,104
And the FBI cares very much
about such things.

478
00:32:35,811 --> 00:32:37,244
Fair is fair.

479
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:44,349
Sergei's making a call.

480
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:51,316
If there is no problem,
then bring in the La-Z-Boys.

481
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,258
I will meet you there.

482
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:54,860
Recognize that voice?

483
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,023
That's the man
from the warehouse phone, right?

484
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:59,966
-That's the same guy?
-Same guy, new number.

485
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:04,435
-Who you calling?
-Pearlman, at home.

486
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,572
Another affidavit,
and we're back on the main stem.

487
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,623
Shit is raw, String.

488
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:29,527
I mean, you can stomp on this motherfucker.

489
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,194
All right.

490
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:35,336
So, when them police stop
busting heads up in them Towers...

491
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,998
you all let Prop Joe's people
take hold of three of them.

492
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:39,267
All right.

493
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:47,012
Okay, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate,
and you're there.

494
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,614
Start connecting the dots...

495
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,949
and you have to start asking yourself
what these guys aren't into.

496
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:54,887
Drugs, women, stolen goods. All of them.

497
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:56,588
FBI didn't have much.

498
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:58,785
A little something out of San Diego
on Glekas...

499
00:33:58,894 --> 00:34:01,988
-in a stolen goods case that was closed out.
-San Diego?

500
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,365
These guys move around.

501
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,667
-What's with the suit?
-Date night.

502
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,231
The undercover at the brothel.

503
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,103
Run like hell, ma'am.

504
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:16,770
We wanna be up on that phone,
so we hear what we hear after tonight's raid.

505
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,506
Who's the affiant?

506
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:31,553
Can you get the SL-series in Pacific blue?
That would be best.

507
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:33,660
Whatever you need, chief.

508
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,890
I don't give a damn
about the color of this one.

509
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:37,295
Whatever you have.

510
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,597
Ain't a problem.
They all just gotta have sunroofs.

511
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:42,864
It's a long story.

512
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:47,840
Next Tuesday would be good for us.
A ship comes Wednesday early, so....

513
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:49,839
Listen...

514
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:52,671
you think I can get an advance on this?

515
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:56,183
I got some expenses right now,
and I'm a little tapped.

516
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,747
-I'm just asking.
-Payment on delivery.

517
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:01,488
Don't worry about it, chief.

518
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,219
I would never even dream of cheating
a smart businessman like yourself.

519
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,930
It ain't enough that I gotta be the one
thinking this whole shit through.

520
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,001
That I gotta be the one
looking out for this shit and that shit.

521
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:15,969
Checking up on this,
making sure this shit is done.

522
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,903
No, that's not enough.

523
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,306
That's why they be paying
them fucking CEOs so much damn money.

524
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,141
Because when the shit fall bad,
it all fall bad on them.

525
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:29,274
Everybody else can be ducking and hiding,
doing what they fucking wanna do.

526
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:31,580
But when push come to shove...

527
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:34,986
I'm the one
who's got to take that responsibility...

528
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,083
and y'all are leaving me
very little to work with right now.

529
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:41,994
-Hold up, String--
-No, that's a very simple thing, my nigger.

530
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:44,429
You drive the guns to the water.

531
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:48,970
You look around, you ain't see anybody,
you throw the guns.

532
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:51,138
In the water.

533
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,605
Splash.

534
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,813
Now, get the fuck out of here, man.

535
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:03,313
Except you, young one.

536
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,488
You ain't say shit back there?

537
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:17,362
No, they fucked up when they told me
my prints was on one of them guns, right?

538
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,559
And I wiped them shits down myself.

539
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,193
And the one they said was mine
wasn't even.

540
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,471
If they would've had anything past my name,
they would've kept me, right?

541
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,417
-All right.
-All right, String.

542
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,043
Lock that door.

543
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,920
You got a bolt cutter?
'Cause I'm gonna need a good one.

544
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:50,466
Got two in the window there.

545
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,125
Got two in the window there.

546
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,902
You hung this on a duck?

547
00:36:56,939 --> 00:36:58,236
Of course.

548
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,036
$1,200.

549
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,145
Fair enough.

550
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:16,056
-Nick.
-It's been a while, Mikey.

551
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,785
Yeah, it has.

552
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:20,691
But your name
has been ringing out in my mind lately.

553
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:21,888
Yeah?

554
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,188
My man called.

555
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,130
Said you was gonna take a re-up from me.

556
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,464
Yeah, that's what they told me, too.

557
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,468
Nicky Sobotka, living the life.

558
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,532
Who fucking knew?

559
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:36,403
-So how much you looking for?
-Two or three G-packs a week.

560
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:39,007
I was getting that shit
from the Greek's people.

561
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,604
-Four each.
-Four?

562
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,974
I wholesale for five, man.

563
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:45,652
I don't know.

564
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:48,814
They told me
you were gonna be straight with it.

565
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,720
Sergei. What up, dawg?

566
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,197
I got a friend of yours here
says we're giving Gs at four.

567
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,267
Yeah?

568
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:02,035
All right, fuck it. Yeah, it's fine.

569
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:04,195
Another thing.

570
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,165
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

571
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:09,574
dropped that body over on Potee Street
the other night, you know?

572
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:12,743
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with some Greek-ass name...

573
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:15,612
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

574
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:19,017
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

575
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:22,085
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

576
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,892
Idiot.

577
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:27,554
You got friends in high places, Nicky.

578
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:30,488
-Four a pack for you.
-All right, cool.

579
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,403
Thank God for the Russian's cell phone.

580
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:42,603
They might be laying off the warehouse line,
but at least he ain't changing that up.

581
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:46,203
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

582
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:49,213
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

583
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:06,027
-What the fuck is that?
-It's a man's purse.

584
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:09,804
European men like yourself
sometimes carry one.

585
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,641
Them people ain't right over there.

586
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:16,104
The mike has to go somewhere.

587
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:20,477
Besides, you might have hands all over you
before we get what we need.

588
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:22,140
Indeed I might, luv.

589
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:25,084
It'll be your call
when we come through the doors.

590
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:28,748
You want us in, you say.... What was it?

591
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:32,355
"Spot on." It means "exactly."

592
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:36,255
And remember, they have to bring up
the money and the sex first...

593
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:39,857
then an overt attempt to engage.

594
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,399
Spot on.

595
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,437
Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide.

596
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:51,076
Listen, what do you guys have
in VICAP for male victims...

597
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,707
headless or faceless,
and missing both hands?

598
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,844
Middle Atlantic region probably.

599
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:32,315
$4.5 million in the capital budget
that's set to pass House and Senate both.

600
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,581
Money'll be allocated
for the fiscal period next year.

601
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,556
Congratulations, Frank.

602
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,625
What kind of stevedore drinks champagne?

603
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:04,878
So, Nat, about the election.

604
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:09,757
I just need one more year
to bring the dredging home.

605
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,553
That's what I need.

606
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,555
Ott's turn, Frank.

607
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,160
This is Agent Koutris
of the FBI down in Washington.

608
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,433
He's with the counterterrorism people
down there.

609
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:27,398
-Terrorism?
-He needs our help tonight.

610
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:48,493
1 1-34, what's your 20?

611
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:51,764
I'm at the overpass on Wicomico.

612
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:53,831
Copy that.

613
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,368
Okay, we're on here.

614
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,202
Good evening.

615
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,022
Paint pigments.

616
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:27,534
They ship them in
for the SCL plant down at Fairfield.

617
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,804
It's in there somewhere.

618
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,499
Run it.

619
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:03,765
Same consistencies on all the barrels.

620
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:06,175
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

621
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:07,142
-Nothing else in there, really.
-Nothing but the pigments.

622
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,242
-What's going on?
-I don't know nothing, Horse.

623
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:16,543
Swear to God.

624
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:19,951
Tonight, I'm just a dumb white boy
from Locust Point.

625
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:37,695
You know,
I'm saying this out of respect, Brie.

626
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:41,367
I love the man like my brother,
but when it comes to something like this...

627
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:44,309
he gonna listen to you
more than he listen to me.

628
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,880
You think so?

629
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:51,013
All I put in his ear about my son
didn't do a damn thing, now, did it?

630
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,421
All them times I told him
that he needed to do more for D'Angelo...

631
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:57,151
and what happened?

632
00:43:58,393 --> 00:43:59,985
He feel for that.

633
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:02,621
He feel for you.

634
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,997
I know he didn't see it coming.

635
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:08,902
-None of us seen it coming.
-I did.

636
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,864
I swear, I saw it.

637
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:16,910
He ain't listen to me then.
Why the hell you think he gonna listen now?

638
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,974
'Cause we got a weak product...

639
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:23,040
and we holding on to prime real estate
with no muscle.

640
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,552
I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird.

641
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:33,624
Now look, I know that your heart is heavy.

642
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:36,957
I know.

643
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:40,899
But them wolves is at that door.

644
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:52,712
As long as them Towers are still standing,
I am, too.

645
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:58,252
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
everything we fought for go to shit.

646
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:00,583
So I'll talk to him.

647
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:27,814
Mr. Cromwell.

648
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:31,915
Decisions, decisions.

649
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:37,148
Would it be wrong to take two?

650
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,221
Attaboy.

651
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,229
We should get upstairs.

652
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:50,435
Nothing but paint pigments.

653
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,905
Trust me, old friend. It's there.

654
00:46:10,092 --> 00:46:11,923
Son of a bitch!

655
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:27,338
Okay, then.

656
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,871
Right.

657
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:34,611
Maybe, we could talk about this first?

658
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:45,186
Any time you guys want.

659
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,292
The money changed hands, right?

660
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:48,988
Sounded that way.

661
00:46:49,297 --> 00:46:52,198
-And they talked about sex?
-Definitely.

662
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,063
Any time you guys want.

663
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:55,363
Hang on.

664
00:46:57,205 --> 00:46:58,229
Oh, God.

665
00:47:00,008 --> 00:47:01,498
Is it soup yet?

666
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,570
Spot something. Spot on it.

667
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:05,713
Let's go.

668
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:15,086
-Whoa.
-Why?

669
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,351
We're supposed to take the door
and get in quick.

670
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,551
Calm the fuck down.

671
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,993
It ain't like they gonna flush
a half dozen whores down the toilet.

672
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,096
-Who is it?
-Baltimore police.

673
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:31,600
-What do you want?
-To lock your ass up.

674
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:39,941
Hands. Let me see them.

675
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:55,490
-Two more in the back.
-Come on, ladies.

676
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:13,412
You're late.

677
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:18,480
He okay?

678
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,086
He'll live.

679
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:28,456
...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms
ofprocessed crack cocaine...

680
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:31,896
is estimated to be in excess of $45 million.

681
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,696
Federal officials have confirmed
to Channel 6 News...

682
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:36,532
that their investigation is ongoing...

683
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:38,663
and that while no arrests
have yet been made...

684
00:48:38,773 --> 00:48:42,265
the seizure itself has severely disrupted
the operations of a group...

685
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,346
believed to have ties
to Colombian narco-terrorist--

686
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:48,780
Now, that, gentlemen, is a case.

687
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:55,620
God forbid you two should put something
like that on my friend, Frank Sobotka...

688
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:57,818
I would die happy.

689
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,261
Our case is progressing.

690
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:05,128
-Great, what can you charge?
-We're not at that point.

691
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,101
We've got wires into a smuggling operation
that we've linked to drugs and women.

692
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,934
Likely, they're the people
who were bringing in the girls...

693
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,133
who turned up dead in that can
two months ago.

694
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:18,201
Now, we're on one location that we believe
is a transshipment point for narcotics.

695
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:20,543
And last night, if you check the 24s...

696
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:23,140
you'll see that we hit a brothel
we also think ties in.

697
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,151
A month or two more
on the taps and DNRs...

698
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,744
and we will be able to identify
the top-end players.

699
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:31,690
-You hit a brothel?
-Waterfront condo, high-end.

700
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:33,420
Jesus.

701
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:38,396
If you find anything that looks
like a list of steady customers, flush it.

702
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,027
I mean, half the names
in the Maryland Manual are probably on it.

703
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:45,405
Any problems on the raid?

704
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:49,166
A complication or two.
Nothing we can't write around.

705
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,040
Immigration is holding the girls.

706
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:54,673
And the madam, who has legal residency,
we cut loose after she posted bail.

707
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,876
You try to interview them?
See if any will roll?

708
00:49:56,985 --> 00:49:58,179
Not while the taps are up.

709
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,790
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

710
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,313
Better to let them think it was a random raid
and see what's said on the wire today.

711
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:06,121
Cut to the chase.
You any closer on my murders?

712
00:50:06,227 --> 00:50:08,752
If these are the people
who were importing those girls...

713
00:50:08,863 --> 00:50:10,353
then, yeah, we're closer.

714
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,957
The more we learn, the more chance
we have to clear those cases.

715
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:16,126
What about Frank Sobotka?

716
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:18,904
I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere.

717
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,975
The union may be involved
in the smuggling...

718
00:50:21,076 --> 00:50:24,011
but we're not getting a sense
that it goes past that.

719
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:27,445
This is about Frank Sobotka.

720
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:29,714
The case is bigger now.

721
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,846
Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it.

722
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:40,357
Now, I'm asking,
do you have charges on Frank Sobotka?

723
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:42,987
Charging Sobotka at this point
would lose us the wire...

724
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:44,622
and a chance at the real targets.

725
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:48,100
-He is the real target.
-Patience, Stan.

726
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,465
-I'm sure if they bring the case--
-You owe me on this, Erv.

727
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:56,069
You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail.

728
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:59,543
You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels.

729
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:02,941
Okay.

730
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,146
Now the votes are in...

731
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:10,247
and you're moving your damn golf trophies
upstairs to the commissioner's office...

732
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,451
now you're freezing me out, huh?

733
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,792
Fucking rat fuckers, all of you.

734
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,224
This is my case.

735
00:51:19,768 --> 00:51:20,826
Mine!

736
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,563
And now you're gonna tell me
who the target is?

737
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:28,067
Not fucking likely.

738
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,208
He's saying no.

739
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:42,248
He's saying we fought for
every one of them Towers...

740
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:44,882
and to give them up now
would mark us as weak.

741
00:51:44,993 --> 00:51:47,985
He's saying if we do this,
Prop Joe would have it over us...

742
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:50,462
and we might never get out from under.

743
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,126
-We don't have the product or the muscle.
-I told him.

744
00:51:55,036 --> 00:51:56,162
I did.

745
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,370
He say he still trying to find us
a better connect.

746
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,170
And for muscle...

747
00:52:03,278 --> 00:52:06,179
he's saying he sending us
the best he can find.

748
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:09,907
Brother Mouzone.

749
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:15,953
He sending in Brother?

750
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:18,381
From New York.

751
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,928
Coming down to work on retainer,
for as long as we need.

752
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:25,764
-Brother Mouzone?
-Yep.

753
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:34,699
"At which point
the officer was unable to resist...

754
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:38,404
"the ministrations
of the aforementioned suspect...

755
00:52:38,513 --> 00:52:42,711
"and found himself
brought to the point of a sexual act."

756
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:47,381
You're famous behind this, you know that?

757
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,652
As a pervert,
this report is gonna make you a BPD legend.

758
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:53,193
I can't perjure myself.
I gotta explain it somehow.

759
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:57,628
Motherfucker, you have violated
a half dozen departmental regs right there.

760
00:52:57,732 --> 00:53:01,668
Not to mention that no state's attorney
is gonna even bring this thing into court.

761
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,204
We're not going to court.
The girls are being deported.

762
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:07,468
We did the raid
just to tickle the wire, remember?

763
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:14,244
There were two of them. I was outnumbered.

764
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:28,620
You fucking with me, right?

765
00:53:28,763 --> 00:53:31,789
Brother Mouzone, from NYC?

766
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:36,064
I went to Avon, told him I didn't have
enough muscle to hold down them Towers.

767
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,332
-Played it like that.
-Yeah, and he reached out.

768
00:53:38,439 --> 00:53:40,339
Joe, I'm still holding on to this deal.

769
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:43,410
Know what I'm saying?
This is just some shit we gotta deal with.

770
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,206
Deal with how?

771
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,941
My nigger, I would take
the motherfucker out if I could...

772
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:50,483
but Avon can't know
it came from his own people, right?

773
00:53:50,585 --> 00:53:54,521
You don't think I'm gonna send
any of my people up against Brother?

774
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:55,850
Shit.

775
00:53:56,057 --> 00:53:59,185
That nigger got more bodies on him
than a Chinese cemetery.

776
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:00,283
True.

777
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:04,889
Look, I'm just saying,
this your problem, not mine.

778
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
You want my product,
you need to deal with it.

779
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,429
All right, so listen, we got some time here.

780
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:14,702
Avon gotta send up word
and wait for word to come back...

781
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:18,210
set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone,
I mean, set up the whole shit.

782
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:20,008
And that's like a week or maybe two.

783
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:22,708
And by that time,
your people's gonna be in the Towers...

784
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:25,877
and if the money's right,
then that is what it is.

785
00:54:25,987 --> 00:54:29,753
Ain't no nigger from New York
gonna change the facts from the ground.

786
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:30,925
All right?

787
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:41,326
1 2-08 to 1 1-37, you there?

788
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,799
1 1-37, what you got?

789
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,169
That last truck is on the move.

790
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:49,035
It sits there for two days
and they don't offload a thing.

791
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,303
-10-4.
-They're testing us.

792
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:53,505
They been moving clean cans.

793
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:09,121
-The trash hasn't drawn any flies.
-No?

794
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:13,326
-Wejust took out the last of it. No problems.
-Okay, then we go.

795
00:55:13,434 --> 00:55:17,234
-What about llona?
-She is home. They kept the children.

796
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,869
There are always more children.

797
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:25,712
Why don't we tap that cell phone,
even if we don't know who we're tapping?

798
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:29,209
That call might just be our PC.

799
00:55:30,652 --> 00:55:33,712
And this here is the little king of everything.

800
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:49,062
So how many we got in the sector?

801
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,129
Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU...

802
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:55,773
and a dozen guys Tactical sent us.

803
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:57,674
We're on every corner.

804
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:00,547
Pretty damn quiet today.

805
00:56:02,216 --> 00:56:03,342
Today.

806
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:08,249
Let's go.

807
00:56:51,899 --> 00:56:53,093
Officer.
