1
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:18,078
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.

2
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:20,275
Elena, you gotta talk to me.

3
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,979
Last call.

4
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:31,593
Why is she such a pain in the ass?

5
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,725
-Excuse me.
-Hey, pal.

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,802
It's all right. One more, please.

7
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,201
-Save some for the other customers, okay?
-Pour it!

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,608
-You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
-There's a cab picking me up.

9
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:58,617
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.

10
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:39,689
Bite me.

11
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,635
Yeah, coffee.

12
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,980
-What's with the hand?
-Just a scratch.

13
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,154
Get me some eggs, will you?

14
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,661
-Can I get a scrapple with that?
-You can get anything you want.

15
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:27,797
Oh, God!

16
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:54,114
Look at him, all high and mighty.

17
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:57,654
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?

18
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:00,018
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.

19
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,189
He's built kind of solid, though.

20
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:07,457
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.

21
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:10,996
-You think?
-His ass is candy, Zig.

22
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:13,728
You, you're the legend of the docks.

23
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,175
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.

24
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,574
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.

25
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,842
So either we bring in a hell of a case...

26
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,475
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.

27
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,884
That sounded a little desperate.

28
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,089
Not entirely.

29
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:38,622
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.

30
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:43,596
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

31
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:46,826
Come take a look at this.

32
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,767
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...

33
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,970
where we tracked the suspect container.

34
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,515
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...

35
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:02,016
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...

36
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,950
among other traffickers on the East Side.

37
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:08,218
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.

38
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,089
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...

39
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:15,130
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...

40
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:17,359
that we've already
made controlled buys from.

41
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,436
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.

42
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:23,370
-What's your PC on the truck driver?
-Sergei Malatov:

43
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:27,534
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.

44
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,774
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.

45
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,975
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.

46
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,746
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...

47
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:40,220
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cell phone.

48
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,053
Checking the DNR log's history...

49
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,525
we matched seven other calls
from that cell phone...

50
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:47,893
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.

51
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,933
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.

52
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:54,731
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?

53
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,603
On a Cl's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...

54
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,942
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...

55
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,242
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

56
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,648
When we ran that phone number
from that address...

57
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,448
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.

58
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:15,787
But when we checked it against
the cell phone of our friend, Sergei...

59
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:19,487
-we got a couple of hits.
-Sobotka's your stated target, right?

60
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:21,860
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...

61
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,900
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

62
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,232
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.

63
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,102
-No offense to Stan Valchek.
-Okay.

64
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,734
I admit, you've got PC.

65
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:38,514
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cell phone, too.

66
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,810
Now what have you got for exhaustion?

67
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,282
Any possible informants?

68
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:45,184
-Nothing on the docks.
-No one we can buy weight with.

69
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:48,086
-Surveillance?
-That got us to the front door...

70
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:51,251
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

71
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,791
Start typing. I'll call the judge.

72
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:06,301
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.

73
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,342
-I hear Charles lost his leg.
-What?

74
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:18,586
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?

75
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,554
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.

76
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:24,024
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.

77
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:38,739
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.

78
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,207
Banana, too.

79
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,256
Fucking shit!

80
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,588
-Take us up.
-Son of a bitch! God damn it!

81
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,193
Fuck you!

82
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,163
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.

83
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:10,102
You're the fucking wimp.

84
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:12,266
No, fuck you, Maui!

85
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,643
-Stay there.
-Fuck you!

86
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,485
God damn it!

87
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:31,253
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.

88
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:36,093
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!

89
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,568
Shit.

90
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:52,614
-What the hell are you wearing?
-No one mentioned all the perks.

91
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,011
Lacrosse?

92
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,809
What, a brother can't run with a stick?

93
00:10:57,921 --> 00:11:00,321
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.

94
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:02,789
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?

95
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:05,453
Lester, I'm just saying....

96
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,427
I thought you were born in pinstripes.

97
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:12,161
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...

98
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,136
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...

99
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:18,207
Iost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...

100
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,002
a veteran police of means and talent...

101
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,169
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

102
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,746
Up to a point.

103
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,544
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

104
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,087
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.

105
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,155
Take that one over there.

106
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:35,019
I'm homesick already.

107
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:39,923
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.

108
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:50,301
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.

109
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,874
Fucking Ziggy.

110
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:57,141
-What are you looking for?
-Can't find the fucking bills.

111
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:00,614
-End of the month, everything's hanging.
-We got anything for the Greeks?

112
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:04,220
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

113
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,244
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

114
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:09,583
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.

115
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,733
Let me ask you something important.

116
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,630
You like fake tits? I can't decide.

117
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,965
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.

118
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:34,007
I thought I knew what paperwork was.

119
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:38,486
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls....

120
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,868
You all cannot spell for shit.

121
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,511
Would we be police if we could?

122
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,308
-Who's the duty judge this week?
-Vanderwal.

123
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,439
You think he'll sign?

124
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:10,747
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.

125
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,715
Fucking Vanderwal.

126
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:15,857
Wash windows?

127
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:30,096
-Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
-Yes, Your Honor.

128
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,401
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...

129
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,570
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?

130
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,238
Yes, Your Honor.

131
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:41,643
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Absolutely.

132
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,982
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

133
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,282
Sash installation.

134
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:51,093
And then if you can give
the windows a wash.... Thank you.

135
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,930
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.

136
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,365
-Fuck, my knee.
-Sorry.

137
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,830
-First name?
-First name: Francis.

138
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,769
Spell the last name on the account.

139
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,740
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

140
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,812
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.

141
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:13,178
-You've been flagged.
-Flagged?

142
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,949
It says right here on the computer.

143
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:16,883
Yeah? You're kidding me.

144
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,011
I don't have any more information
on that now.

145
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,885
Whatever, okay.

146
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,228
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.

147
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,772
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?

148
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,102
No phone.

149
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:44,069
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cell phone,
but they let me go...

150
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,173
even before I mail the check in.

151
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:50,343
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?

152
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,546
-I've been flagged.
-Flagged?

153
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,382
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:

154
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,983
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."

155
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:02,460
"Flagged," what the fuck is that?
What am l, special?

156
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,701
Maybe you been touched by an angel.

157
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,305
Told you, B.

158
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,240
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.

159
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:19,475
-Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
-No, that ain't it, man.

160
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:23,876
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.

161
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,080
Damn.

162
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,831
-Pud, how we doing?
-Slow as a white man in slippers.

163
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,826
All right, later.

164
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:47,505
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.

165
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,544
It's that bullshit, man.

166
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,107
You two got a reason to be here?

167
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:56,447
-We're just going about our business.
-Keep moving.

168
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:02,488
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?

169
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:06,722
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.

170
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,295
Shit is fucked up, man.

171
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,864
Damn, junior, you had a night.

172
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,065
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself--

173
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,368
Drop it.

174
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,670
What is wrong with you, man?

175
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,613
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...

176
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:30,481
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?

177
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,846
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.

178
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,525
Come and get me.

179
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,261
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?

180
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:56,367
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.

181
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:58,837
You jealous, bitch?

182
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:01,746
I'd rather be back in Homicide.

183
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,054
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.

184
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:08,948
Why?

185
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:18,866
-That floater showing up in your dreams?
-No, it's not just her.

186
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:25,604
I mean, who am l, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.

187
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,437
I need to do a case.

188
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,473
I mean, if I'm not gonna....

189
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,416
If I'm no good for....

190
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,732
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.

191
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:55,901
-He'll put you on this straightaway.
-Yeah, why wouldn't he?

192
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,781
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...

193
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:14,584
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.

194
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:17,956
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.

195
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,460
Where is it now?

196
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:22,395
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

197
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,523
How's that for your kid brother?

198
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:27,535
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

199
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:29,968
Just this.

200
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:33,903
Read it.

201
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,174
-What is it?
-A confirmation letter, like.

202
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:41,950
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?

203
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:44,315
I put you up for it. You're on.

204
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:45,847
I'm on?

205
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:50,350
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?

206
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,918
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

207
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,998
You mean, you greased it.

208
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:01,260
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.

209
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:04,898
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.

210
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,976
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

211
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:09,911
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

212
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,914
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.

213
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:16,276
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.

214
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,913
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.

215
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,251
That's not for me.

216
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:26,484
What's for you?

217
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,158
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.

218
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,027
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.

219
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:36,332
Whatever I got comes straight.

220
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,273
That's real noble, big brother.

221
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:44,971
Not noble. Right.

222
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,080
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?

223
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,019
The only difference between me and you...

224
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:57,286
-is you picked the wrong union.
-That ain't the only difference.

225
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,987
-If you were in my position--
-I'm not.

226
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:08,027
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.

227
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,272
Come on, kid.

228
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,972
Sit down.

229
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:36,157
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?

230
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,028
We all did back then.

231
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:42,361
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.

232
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,838
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.

233
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,933
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.

234
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:51,172
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...

235
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,145
when he was in the bag.

236
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,679
How come they don't fly away?

237
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:01,353
His wings are clipped.

238
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,157
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?

239
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:14,498
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.

240
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:16,367
Them things got lice.

241
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,433
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.

242
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,674
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

243
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,946
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.

244
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:38,393
-With reasons.
-But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.

245
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,660
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.

246
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:43,732
-But good police.
-Always.

247
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,061
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...

248
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,830
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...

249
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:54,775
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.

250
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:57,068
And when he is policing...

251
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,508
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.

252
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:03,278
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.

253
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,714
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.

254
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:11,017
Go back to Rawls.

255
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,293
So I get paid?

256
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,494
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.

257
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:23,128
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?

258
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,265
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential lnformant Number 238...

259
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:30,471
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.

260
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:34,446
-So you're gonna send my picture--
-And your social security number.

261
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,451
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.

262
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:40,522
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?

263
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,217
Did you?

264
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:44,993
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.

265
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,153
We brought back
very significant information...

266
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:50,426
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.

267
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,896
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.

268
00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:00,039
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?

269
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:02,135
10%.

270
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,510
10% goes to me and I don't tell.

271
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:08,743
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.

272
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:12,184
-That's why you don't tell.
-We're not even gonna use your real name.

273
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,620
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

274
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,891
10%.

275
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:25,764
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

276
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,161
It's payday, Zig. Once again.

277
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:37,206
All that?

278
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:42,050
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.

279
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:44,879
Nice sled you got.

280
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:48,680
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.

281
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,157
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?

282
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,956
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.

283
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,522
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.

284
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,498
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

285
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:02,730
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

286
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,935
Worry about yourself.

287
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,445
I heard you took on Maui.

288
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:15,945
-Boy needed to get schooled.
-What are you, some kind of badass now?

289
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:23,356
-Yeah, it's me.
-Niko, things okay?

290
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:26,954
-Things are going great.
-Ifyou need more, talk to Sergei.

291
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:30,590
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?

292
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:32,995
Is that the man?

293
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:36,230
-You don't have to concern yourself--
-I wanna meet him.

294
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:39,968
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?

295
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:43,443
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.

296
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:47,081
-Take the money, Zig.
-You don't think I can do it?

297
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,549
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.

298
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,379
-I don't want it. You pick it up.
-You.

299
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,484
Fuck you.

300
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:09,771
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?

301
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:11,567
-How many you ordered?
-That'd be three.

302
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,073
Your order's in.

303
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:17,702
-Yes?
-It's Nick.

304
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,209
How's it going?

305
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:22,648
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
Youjust say where and when.

306
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,447
I'll call you back.

307
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:31,823
-Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
-This ain't West Baltimore.

308
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:36,488
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.

309
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:41,334
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.

310
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:44,304
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.

311
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:48,366
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.

312
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:56,140
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?

313
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:59,483
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.

314
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:04,451
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire-
in-the-belly garbage, either.

315
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:04,894
The answer is no.

316
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,156
The answer is no.

317
00:26:07,563 --> 00:26:09,622
What I need from you, I get.

318
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,857
-No bullshit, no arguments.
-What?

319
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:18,139
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?

320
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:21,670
I need McNulty on this detail.

321
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,741
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...

322
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:31,884
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.

323
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,622
You want me to clear those bodies?

324
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,329
See that you do.

325
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,141
Who they?

326
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,114
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...

327
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,211
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

328
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,789
This far over?

329
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,492
I know one thing, though.

330
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,060
-What?
-They're serving our customers.

331
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,194
-Marine unit, Diggins.
-I'm looking for McNulty.

332
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,097
McNulty, for you.

333
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,516
It's Daniels...

334
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,575
Get back to your office.

335
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,186
Thanks, Lieutenant.

336
00:27:58,507 --> 00:28:00,975
This new generation with the names....

337
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,048
$150? Jesus.

338
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:10,886
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

339
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,992
This is the other half of the case, right here.

340
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:25,555
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, lnc...

341
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,932
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.

342
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:30,505
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?

343
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,972
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.

344
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:35,270
A building this nice is for the johns.

345
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:38,403
-Makes them feel safer.
-How do they bring them in? The lobby?

346
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:41,847
-Garage, probably.
-Either they have a garage card...

347
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,181
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.

348
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:47,449
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...

349
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:49,547
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...

350
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:53,617
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.

351
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,254
Tickle the wire like that.

352
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,460
Exactly.

353
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:03,799
Pleasure boats, topless women.

354
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,767
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.

355
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:10,838
Thanks.

356
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:24,654
-We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
-And the day before that.

357
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,593
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?

358
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:29,755
We up, but we ain't in it.

359
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:33,096
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so....

360
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:36,171
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.

361
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:38,569
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.

362
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:40,437
How you gonna act like that?

363
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,875
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so....

364
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:50,080
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?

365
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:54,121
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.

366
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:02,059
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.

367
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:04,825
Separate your ass.

368
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:10,032
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...

369
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:12,869
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.

370
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:15,773
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...

371
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:18,108
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

372
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:22,013
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.

373
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:26,187
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

374
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:29,791
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

375
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,552
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.

376
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:39,399
-Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
-Same for me.

377
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:42,497
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...

378
00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:44,765
if she even heard tell of it.

379
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:54,507
What?

380
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,114
Takes a whore to catch a whore.

381
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,183
What the fuck did I do?

382
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,459
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.

383
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:09,224
I say, look at this.

384
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,128
Dolores, is that you?

385
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:18,433
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.

386
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,470
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...

387
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,480
but he can. So, if you will...

388
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:30,109
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.

389
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:33,114
-Tell me he's a fake.
-That'd be lying, hon.

390
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:35,156
Is they real diamonds around its neck?

391
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:37,521
You sick, boy. You just sick.

392
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,924
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...

393
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:43,464
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?

394
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,365
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.

395
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:54,274
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.

396
00:31:55,577 --> 00:31:58,603
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.

397
00:31:58,914 --> 00:31:59,972
Easy, there.

398
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,676
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.

399
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:04,218
He needs a chaser.

400
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,310
Put it on my tab, Dolores.

401
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:12,924
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.

402
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:23,804
That look right to you?

403
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:27,137
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.

404
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,410
What about the passenger?

405
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:31,541
Looks the part to me.

406
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:42,420
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.

407
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:44,458
Our man Horseface on it?

408
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:49,924
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.

409
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:55,533
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.

410
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:25,130
There goes the shuttle.

411
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:33,542
What's he waiting on?

412
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,805
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.

413
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,637
Lying to the wife's easy.

414
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:43,184
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.

415
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,362
Police!

416
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:10,642
Let's see your license.

417
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,983
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?

418
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:23,883
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?

419
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:29,023
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.

420
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:31,099
How does he go about it?

421
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:36,396
He'd dial that phone number.

422
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,101
Dial the number. What else?

423
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:44,568
Punch in those four numbers there.

424
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:49,013
-And?
-Ask for Eve.

425
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:51,048
-What?
-Ask for Eve.

426
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,621
Go on, go home.

427
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:08,202
Godspeed, Bob.

428
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:11,464
-Johnson.
-My ticket to the dance.

429
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:25,780
Here we go. We got one.

430
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:29,085
1 2-14, Kima.

431
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:31,659
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

432
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,887
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.

433
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,657
-Raise our boys.
-Right.

434
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:38,494
-What's Kima rolling as?
-Gas and electric.

435
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,721
-Yes?
-Everything's good.

436
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:04,288
-You coming in now?
-Yes.

437
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:57,669
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.

438
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:00,612
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...

439
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:03,946
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.

440
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:08,087
-Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
-Copy.

441
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:10,949
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.

442
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:13,653
The van has too much profile on it
right now.

443
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:15,730
Copy that, too. We're up.

444
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,328
-Broken seal?
-Hey, Frank.

445
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:26,865
What's missing?

446
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,637
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

447
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:31,803
-Diapers?
-Disposables, yeah.

448
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:36,375
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?

449
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,077
I'm not so sure.

450
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:41,417
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.

451
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:51,022
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?

452
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,863
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.

453
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,665
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.

454
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,329
-Yeah?
-She's detailed.

455
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,806
Something to do with city police.

456
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:13,981
All right, we're up.

457
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:17,018
I'm out. You have the eyeball.

458
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,951
12-08, copy that.

459
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,294
First I got this thing on my phone bill.

460
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:30,394
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.

461
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,802
You're paranoid, Frank.

462
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:34,398
-Why would she lie?
-Shit if I know.

463
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:40,413
-The Greek has two today, right?
-Boris comes back in an hour.

464
00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:44,474
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.

465
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:47,979
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?

466
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,954
Enter it on the computer, like any other.

467
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:52,652
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.

468
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,092
You want me to lose a clean can?

469
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:57,688
-And give it to the Russian, yeah.
-You gonna tell them?

470
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:01,766
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.

471
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,668
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.

472
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,139
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.

473
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,677
I know.

474
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,684
We got something here.

475
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:24,090
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

476
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,493
They're running them out in tandem.

477
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:29,530
-That means "one after the other," Jimmy.
-I know what it means.

478
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:30,893
1 2-08.

479
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,895
Carver, what's the status of your truck?

480
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:35,468
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.

481
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,862
-You want us on the truck or the can?
-The can.

482
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:40,132
Copy.

483
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,670
-I got no eyes at the port.
-Kima?

484
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,747
-She pulled up.
-I got it.

485
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,682
But the truck already left. You won't make it.

486
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:53,253
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.

487
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:56,457
Do it. You're still here?

488
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,057
Good call.

489
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:31,615
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.

490
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,586
-You stop for 24 mph?
-License and registration.

491
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:56,107
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

492
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:03,216
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

493
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,082
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.

494
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:08,246
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.

495
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:10,757
Not on the phone, Frank.

496
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,757
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.

497
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,791
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

498
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,729
Go ahead, open it.

499
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,032
Bobbie Dolls.

500
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:46,014
What the fuck is this bullshit?

501
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:51,080
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.

502
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:53,820
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.

503
00:43:54,395 --> 00:43:56,886
Are they thieves or are they stupid?

504
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:04,264
He's dialing the same number.

505
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:08,332
It came, but it's nothing.

506
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,477
It's bullshit.

507
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:16,878
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.

508
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:18,952
Get rid of it where?

509
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,717
Drop it in the fucking street.

510
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,290
-This is sweet.
-The boss man.

511
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:32,090
And we're on him.

512
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:35,068
-7 a.m.?
-Man, what the fuck do you think?

513
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,603
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.

514
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:39,070
Shit is early.

515
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,039
Y'all down for this?

516
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:44,703
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.

517
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,337
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.

518
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:50,975
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.

519
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:52,848
-Hey, Poot.
-Yo, Poot.

520
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:56,483
Come on, man.

521
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:01,422
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.

522
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,827
A nigger can't look at a female?

523
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:06,523
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.

524
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:09,501
-At least I be getting some.
-Well, I be getting some, too.

525
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:12,004
But I don't make it my everything.

526
00:45:15,143 --> 00:45:17,111
Lieutenant, you still up?

527
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:19,340
I'm here.

528
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:22,343
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

529
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,715
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.

530
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,749
Now he's dumping it.

531
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:30,614
10-4. Come home.

532
00:45:31,593 --> 00:45:36,292
-You don't wanna sit on the can?
-Negative. The can is clean.

533
00:45:55,116 --> 00:45:57,107
I don't know, Uncle Frank.

534
00:45:57,218 --> 00:46:00,187
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.

535
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:01,414
Maybe.

536
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,454
You called Spiros still, right?

537
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:08,785
Spiros will know what to do.

538
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:14,528
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.

539
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:15,933
All right.

540
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,942
I can't keep up with him.

541
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:24,807
What's with the duck?

542
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:27,573
Ziggy.

543
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,023
Is Daniels around?

544
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:40,890
-No.
-What's the deal with can number two?

545
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:42,696
No contraband.

546
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:46,828
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.

547
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:51,896
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.

548
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,576
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?

549
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,080
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.

550
00:47:02,116 --> 00:47:06,348
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.

551
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:09,912
-But more than one, I get sleepy.
-Yeah, me, too.

552
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:14,486
-What, you short a car?
-Need new brake pads.

553
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,710
Two. Boys.

554
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,246
How about you?

555
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:35,638
Boy and a girl.

556
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:37,609
And your husband, he....

557
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,018
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?

558
00:47:41,122 --> 00:47:45,320
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?

559
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:47,153
I was just asking.

560
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:49,160
He left me.

561
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:51,292
Left us.

562
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,565
Picked up, moved south.

563
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,536
Said it was either my job or him.

564
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:03,140
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

565
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:06,873
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.

566
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:09,677
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.

567
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:17,788
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?

568
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:21,856
She died.

569
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:30,431
-Not now, Gus. I'm good.
-Whatever you say, Jimmy.

570
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:35,038
So, you about ready to go?

571
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:38,344
-Sure.
-Be right back. I just gotta make a call.

572
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:02,927
Please enter your code now.

573
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:09,365
-Hi, may I help you?
-Yeah, let me talk to Eve.

574
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:14,539
-This is Eve.
-I'm looking to connect.

575
00:49:14,649 --> 00:49:16,173
Would you like a date tonight?

576
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:19,776
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.

577
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:24,090
-Have you been entertained by us before?
-No, first time for me.

578
00:49:24,192 --> 00:49:26,888
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.

579
00:49:26,994 --> 00:49:29,462
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

580
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:33,091
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.

581
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:35,226
When are you thinking of coming?

582
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:11,334
Just give me a minute.

583
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,573
Stop! Move away from the cookiejar.

584
00:51:34,555 --> 00:51:35,783
Long day.

585
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,755
Yeah, me, too.

586
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,102
Thanks for the beer.

587
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,236
Goodbye.

588
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:16,687
Hey, y'all, they coming.

589
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:19,995
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?

590
00:52:20,868 --> 00:52:23,063
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.

591
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,968
-You're standing on my real estate.
-Mine now.

592
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:30,738
-Took it while you was resting.
-Y'all too late.

593
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:39,509
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.

594
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,584
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?

595
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:50,521
-You gonna see me in your sleep.
-Yeah, I know.

596
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:57,402
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.

597
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:00,102
They gonna come back.

598
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:04,377
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.

599
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:15,585
-Where is he?
-You can talk to me, Frank.

600
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:18,556
-This is bigger than you.
-I'll tell him what you say.

601
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:20,593
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.

602
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:32,831
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.

603
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:36,441
Have a seat.

604
00:53:53,494 --> 00:53:55,860
A long time since we talk, Frank.

605
00:53:56,697 --> 00:53:58,961
-Coffee, something?
-We're good.

606
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,598
What's on your mind?

607
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,668
Every goddamn thing.

608
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,905
For one,
I think my cell phone's being tapped.

609
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,639
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.

610
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:17,308
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...

611
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:20,649
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.

612
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,188
-So you switched the can.
-I ran a test.

613
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,884
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

614
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:28,621
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...

615
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,822
right after he picked it up.

616
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:33,562
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.

617
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:34,691
Very smart.

618
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:37,930
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

619
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,670
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.

620
00:54:41,775 --> 00:54:44,801
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

621
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:48,942
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.

622
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:51,609
Our cut stays the same though, right?

623
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:53,417
You kidding?

624
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:55,446
What's your name?

625
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:57,554
-Nick.
-Sobotka.

626
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:03,022
That's a fair question, Niko.

627
00:55:03,397 --> 00:55:06,833
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.

628
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:10,131
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.

629
00:55:10,237 --> 00:55:13,764
-That's work, isn't it?
-We take gas, so do you.

630
00:55:13,874 --> 00:55:16,035
-You don't understand--
-I understand completely.

631
00:55:16,143 --> 00:55:18,202
No one is in this for love.

632
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:21,481
It ain't just the money.

633
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:25,483
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!

634
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,548
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!

635
00:55:36,297 --> 00:55:39,733
Okay. We pay you still.

636
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:43,970
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...

637
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:46,769
and I want you should be happy.

638
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:49,602
Thanks.

639
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:56,949
It's a new world, Frank.

640
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:00,312
You should go out
and spend some of the money...

641
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:04,517
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.

642
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:08,256
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
