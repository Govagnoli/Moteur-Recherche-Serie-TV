1
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,521
O.K. Good,
children good...

2
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,655
Remember to feel the clay
Be one with the clay

3
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,456
nice...

4
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:47,610
Put more clay on the balls.

5
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,047
Boys!
What is that?

6
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:52,158
A reindeer?

7
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,123
You know, I've had it!

8
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,511
You four boys never
take art class seriously!

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,775
What a crime.

10
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:59,760
You think art is not important?

11
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:02,063
Weelll, art is just kinda...
for gaywads.

12
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,304
I love our class!
See?

13
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,276
Do you think this is funny?!
Do you think this is funny, huh?!

14
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,779
Well, you four can just spend
your afternoon after school here

15
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,529
making new pottery!

16
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,214
You can't do that!

17
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:21,923
I certainly can!
I'm your teacher!

18
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,519
You're an art teacher!
Make it two hours!

19
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,434
Mrs. Dreible thinks she's so cool!

20
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:29,948
How dare she talk
to us like that?!

21
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:31,262
(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,781
We can't let her get away with this!
I think tonight we need to do something drastic.

23
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,200
Like what?

24
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:37,982
Like find out where 
Mrs. Dreible lives,

25
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:42,105
and go over there, and...
TP her house.

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,350
(Yeah!)
TP her house?

27
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,538
Toilet paper!
Cover her house in toilet paper.

28
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,954
What's the matter, Kyle?
You chicken? Ugh!

29
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,335
Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime,
you're being punished!

30
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,334
Fine! But we'll have the
last laugh tonight, artwhore!

31
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:01,832
Yeah! Payback time,
you ugly skank!

32
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,530
D'you think that's enough?
Should be fine.

33
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,031
Don't you guys think
this is a little suspicious?

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,032
We should buy something
else so it doesn't look obvious.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,890
Okay. Here we go,
pack of chewing gum.

36
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,553
Hello boys.
Find everything you need?

37
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,547
Yep. All set.

38
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,068
Mokay, let's see here.
Toilet paper Toilet paper...

39
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,758
So, what are you
kids up to tonight?

40
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,391
Oh, we're just gonna watch
some TV, maybe play a board game.

41
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:36,016
Nice relaxing night at home, huh?
Toilet paper Toilet paper

42
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,706
Eh, hey. Now you kids be
careful with this chewing gum.

43
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,644
Don't go sticking it 
under tables.

44
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,725
Okay. Toilet paper 
Toilet paper Tooilet paper..

45
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:48,632
You know, son...

46
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:51,606
I dont remember you comin' in last
week and buying this much toilet paper.

47
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,357
Heh yeah,
that that's right.

48
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:56,743
You TP'ed a house
last week, Cartman?

49
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,557
No. Last Thursday
night was fajitas night.

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Is this the right house?

51
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,841
It's the right address-wait! 
Look there!

52
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,996
There's Mrs. Dreible!
This is the place.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh wait, wait,
there's kids inside.

54
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:15,138
So?

55
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:17,208
So we're not TP'ing
a house with kids inside it!

56
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,502
Kyle, we all
agreed to do this!

57
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,313
We didn't say nothin'
about no kids, man!

58
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:23,648
Kyle, you're bein' an asshole!
Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.

59
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:26,908
Here's what I think of your
art class, you God-damned bitch!

60
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,438
(Yeah! Fuck you!)

61
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,170
Come on, let's go!

62
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,920
What have we done?

63
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,668
Let's go, Kyle!

64
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:08,787
We're, we're in trouble.
We're in sooo much trouble.

65
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,857
Aw man,
that was sooo awesome!

66
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:13,302
How can you say that?
Did you see what we did to their house?!

67
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:14,973
It'll take them days 
to clean that up!

68
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,058
Who cares??

69
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,310
Well, YOU don't, because you're
a non-caring asshole, Cartman!

70
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,289
Me? There's toilet
paper on your hands, too, Kyle.

71
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:26,368
Cartman's right, Kyle.
We're all in this together.

72
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:32,714
Noo! No. Noo!

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,031
Honey, what is it?? Oh,
Jesus no! Our house!

74
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,474
Mommy! Mommy!

75
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,441
Whyyy? Whyyy?

76
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,764
Ah! Oh God!
Oh God!

77
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,015
Hey, uh, you guys here
what happened last night?

78
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,644
Mrs. Dreible's house got
covered with toilet paper.

79
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,344
Yeah. They say it's gonna
take three weeks to get it all down.

80
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,797
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs.
Dreible probably had it comin' to her.

81
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:06,285
I don't know. I don't think
anybody deserves that kind of brutality.

82
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,662
Well, I understand the
people who did it weren't caughts,

83
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,299
so-o...
Looks like nobody will ever know

84
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,736
the geniuses who
masterminded that perfect crime.

85
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,893
Okay children,
let's take our seats.

86
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,676
Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny,
the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.

87
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,759
Damn!
Oh God!

88
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,244
How the hell did they find out
it was us that TP'ed that house?

89
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,276
Will you relax, Kyle?!
They have nothing on us!

90
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,528
As long as we all stick
to our story, we'll be fine.

91
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:31,806
We'd better go over our story
again so we don't screw it up.

92
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:36,026
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at
the bowling alley until about 7:30,

93
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:38,315
at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy,
the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club,

94
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,609
was bowling in the lane next to us,

95
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,262
and we asked her for her autograph,
but she didn't have a pen,

96
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,842
so we followed her out to her car,

97
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,247
but on the way we were 
accosted by five Scientologists

98
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,062
who wanted to give us all personality
tests, which were administered

99
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,842
at the Scientology Center
 in Denver until 10:45,

100
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,734
at which time we accidentally
boarded the wrong bus home

101
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,499
and ended up in Rancho de Burritos
Rojos,south of Castle Rock,

102
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,733
and finally got a ride home
with a man who was missing

103
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,967
his left index finger, named Gary
Bushwell,arriving home at 11:46.

104
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:00,624
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy
take that personality test?

105
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:01,614
Yes, dude!

106
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:02,908
Kyle, it's very simple:

107
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,108
we followed Ally Sheedy
 out to her car,

108
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,656
but on the way we were
accosted by five Scientologists

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,739
who wanted to give us all
personality tests, which were administered

110
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:09,721
at the Scientology Center
in Denver until 10:45,

111
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,345
at which time we accidentally
boarded the wrong bus home

112
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,320
and ended up in Rancho de
Burritos Rojos,south of Castle Rock,

113
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,178
and finally got a ride
home with a man who was missing

114
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,722
his left index finger,
named Gary Bushwell,

115
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,378
arriving home at 11:46,
 you got it??

116
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,159
-Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
-Oh, for Christ's sake!

117
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,695
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman
do all the talking, okay?

118
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,389
He's better at being
in trouble than anybody.

119
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:25,515
Thank you, Stan.

120
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:27,190
Sh sh, here they come,
here they come.

121
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:30,268
And so I said, 'That's a terrific
joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'

122
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:33,056
Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey.
Are you ready to see us now?"

123
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,871
We're gonna talk to you
one at a time, boys, m'kay?

124
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:38,125
Kenny, will you
step into my office, please?

125
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,072
(Me??)

126
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,479
Come on, Kenny,
let's go, 'k?

127
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,509
Touché, Mr. Mackey,
touché.

128
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,154
Why are they doing us
one at a time?

129
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,791
They want to see
if we mix the story up,

130
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:51,354
and see if someone will rat out
the other three for a better deal.

131
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:52,856
I can get a better deal?

132
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,433
Kyle, so help me God,
if you Jew us out on this one,

133
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,154
I will fucking kill you!

134
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:59,704
There we go.
That should be about the last of it.

135
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,561
Ex- excuse me, uh,
wha-what are you doing?

136
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,689
Crime scene investigation!

137
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
There are several
footprints in the snow.

138
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,347
Perhaps more than
one perpetrator?

139
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,626
Ah... look, we really don't wanna
make a big deal out of this.

140
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,892
Is that the toilet paper there?
I'll need to take those bags as evidence.

141
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,455
Lo-ih ih it's just not
that big a deal, I mean,

142
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,940
I toilet-papered houses
myself when I was a kid.

143
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,165
You?! So where were you
last night at around 9?!

144
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,712
I was here.

145
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,567
Aha!!
Got you!

146
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:34,558
Officer, why would
I TP my own house?

147
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:35,803
Insurance?

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,301
It wasn't me, okay?

149
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,599
Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna
get my yard back to normal.

150
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,085
Now you listen to me!

151
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:43,838
Whoever TP'ed your house is
still out there roaming the streets.

152
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:47,858
It's only a matter of time before another
house and another family is victimized!

153
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:50,218
I have to stop that
from happening.

154
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:53,136
You really have nothing
better to do, do you?

155
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,341
No I do not.

156
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:01,138
Noo! No.
Noo!

157
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,532
Oh, Jesus no!
Our house!

158
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:08,669
Mommy! Mommy!

159
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:13,220
Whyyy? Whyyy? 
Whyyy?

160
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,325
Oh God! Oh God!
I have to tell the truth!

161
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:21,630
Mooooomm!

162
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:25,515
Hello, Kyle.
Going somewhere?

163
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:30,066
I was... I was just
going to get a drink of water.

164
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,175
No need.
I have one for you right here.

165
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,518
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

166
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,392
Is there anything
else I can get for you?

167
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,127
Noo, I'll just...
be... going back to bed now.

168
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,020
You do that. 
Goodnight, Kyle.

169
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:49,956
Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred
houses in less than a year. 

170
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:51,492
He's a real monster.

171
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,960
I just need to talk to someone
who knows how toilet paperers think.

172
00:08:56,294 --> 00:09:00,235
Just remember: he'd toilet-paper
you in a second if he had the chance. 

173
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,382
He's the last cell on your left.

174
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:19,216
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady.
I'm with the South Park police.

175
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:24,016
That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer.
You should try something more... casual.

176
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:27,499
I was hoping you could help me
solve a toilet-papering case?

177
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,169
And why would I do that?
Because I'm such a charming fella?

178
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,235
Uh please, I need your help.
What would you want in return?

179
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:39,880
Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they
don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. 

180
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:42,094
You can imagine how
bothersome that becomes.

181
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,866
You... know I can't
give you toilet paper, Josh.

182
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,221
No, but it was worth a try, 
wasn't it?

183
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,970
Tell me something, officer: why is it that you
police such a small town. 

184
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:52,619
You must have had
larger inspirations.

185
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,022
What happened to those...
big-city dreams?

186
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,007
Well,
that's kind of personal.

187
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,911
Quid pro quo, officer.
Tell me what I want to know. 

188
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,660
And I'll help you catch whoever
toilet-papered that house.

189
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:10,822
Look kid, I have very little time to
catch whoever toilet-papered that house. 

190
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,368
Tell me what you know.

191
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,619
Are those the crime scene photos? 
Let me see them.

192
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,477
Yes. Yes.
Not bad work, not bad at all.

193
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,273
These toilet-paperers are professional,
at least one of them is.

194
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,573
So you think there
was more than one. Why?

195
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:29,938
Tell me something first.

196
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,527
When you went to the academy
you had something to prove. 

197
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:33,902
You wanted to protect and serve,
but mostly you wanted to protect yourself.

198
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:36,826
Who were you protecting
yourself from, Officer Barbrady?

199
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:39,981
Oh all right, all right, my uncle
Charles used to hit me with a belt!

200
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:44,255
Thank you. Your toilet-paperers
are most like males 

201
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,284
between the ages of 8 and
 10 and probably virgins.

202
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,892
Parents notice that 
much toilet paper missing, 

203
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,450
so they would have 
to have bought it themselves.

204
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,142
Find out where the toilet 
paper came from, officer, 

205
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,192
and you just might catch your man.

206
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,977
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to 
you guys for a second?

207
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,110
I think we have the counselor
and the principal fooled, 

208
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,976
but we need to talk about Kyle.

209
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:02,798
What about him?

210
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,881
Come on, you know. 
He's losing it. He's gonna crack.

211
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:06,017
(I think so too.)

212
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,038
Kyle can't take the heat; 
he's gonna sing like a canary.

213
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,636
Then we're all gonna take 
the fall for what we did.

214
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,767
Ha-ey fellas.
Butters.

215
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,456
Look you guys, all it takes 
is for one of us to crack, 

216
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,236
and we all know who
 the weakest link is!

217
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:26,226
So what should we do?

218
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,941
We have no choice.
We have to kill Kyle.

219
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,573
-Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
-(Yeah!)

220
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,792
Why not?

221
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,362
Kyle's not gonna
say anything, alright?

222
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:35,865
He almost spilled the beans
in the counselor's office! 

223
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:37,270
He can't even keep
 the story straight!

224
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,287
I'm telling you guys, 
he's weak. 

225
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,725
He's weak, and he'll be 
the end of all of us.

226
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,950
You wanted to see me, 
Officer Barbrady?

227
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,668
Yes, thanks for coming,
Mr. Bell.

228
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:49,027
A house was TP'ed in South 
Park and I need to see 

229
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:52,170
if you can identify the toilet paper
 I recovered from the scene.

230
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,245
I'm... 
sorry I have to do this.

231
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,554
Oh my God.

232
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,932
Is this toilet
paper from your store?

233
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:04,738
It's... difficult to tell, 
it's... so decayed, I... 

234
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,653
wait a minute, yes. Yes, 
I recognize the floral pattern now.

235
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,495
Positive ID on
the toilet paper.

236
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,643
Who would...
do this to toilet paper? Who?

237
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,527
Mr. Bell, do you remember
 anyone suspicious 

238
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,643
buying toilet paper in
 the last few days?

239
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,917
Suspicious like how?

240
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:20,594
Well, like someone who was black
or Mexican or Middle Eastern.

241
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:24,239
Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall
bought toasted tarts and chips

242
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,968
and... we don't allow Middle 
Eastern people in the store.

243
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,692
Oh my God!

244
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,829
What's this all about,
Cartman?

245
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,578
I just wanted to see how 
you're doing, Kyle. 

246
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,298
Why don't we go out
 for a little boat ride?

247
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,381
A boat ride?

248
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:39,455
I just thought we should find 
a private place to... talk.

249
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,675
Well, okay.

250
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,926
Could you help me put this cement
 block and chain in the boat?

251
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,647
Okay, let's go.

252
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,305
So how are things,
Kyle?

253
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,118
Terrible. Every time I close my 
eyes I see the house we TP'ed.

254
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,054
I see the tears of our art teacher and 
hear the screams of her daughters.

255
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,103
And you feel like
you have to confess.

256
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,151
I don't know what to do.

257
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,200
Part of me feels like
 I wanna end it all now. 

258
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,087
Tell people what heppened.

259
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,776
You know, I never knew how 
beautiful this pond was before.

260
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,652
So cold. 
The world can feel like that. 

261
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,122
So calm on the outside, as if 
nothing bad ever happens.

262
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,184
What the hell are you 
doing, Cartman?!

263
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,488
I'm killing you. 
But unfortunately

264
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,685
 I could only afford a Wiffle ball 
bat, so it's gonna take a while.

265
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,185
Cartman!

266
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,706
Don't fight it, Kyle, 
it will only take longer.

267
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,747

Just slip into sweet 
unconsciousness.

268
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:45,406
You wanna kill me?! Fine!
I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!

269
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:56,002
Won't be long, Kyle.

270
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,095
Josh, I need your help.

271
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:03,691
The answer is right in front
of you, but you can't see it.

272
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:05,068
How do you mean?

273
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,817
Tell me, the toilet paper.
Was it quilted?

274
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,588
Yes.
Single-sheet?

275
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,497
No, two-ply. What?
What does that tell you?

276
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:16,655
Why does one 
toilet-paper houses

277
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:20,926
To get revenge.
No, that is incidental.

278
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,774
Your toilet-paperers wanted to
 transform the art teacher's house,

279
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,730
 thus transforming her 
entire occupation.

280
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:26,880
What do you mean?

281
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,231
Your uncle, who hit you with
a belt. Was he a large man?

282
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,978
I don't have time for this, kid.

283
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,837
Did he stink like bayer when 
he came home from work 

284
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,296
all powoor from playin' down
 at the pool hiyouse?

285
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,183
Alright alright my dad dressed me
up like a little girl on poker nights 

286
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,823
and he made me sit on 
all my uncles' laps!

287
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,904
Uh, oh. Thank you.

288
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,564
Your toilet-paperers are most likely
students in the art teacher's class, 

289
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,626
students who aren't
very good at art.

290
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,206
Oh. Of course! 
One of her students!

291
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,612
Fly along now, Officer Barbrady.
You've got some arrests to make. 

292
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,309
Fly fly flyyy. 
Fly fly flyyy.

293
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:04,716
Josh, were you doing the silly 
voice for the policeman again?

294
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:05,881
No, sir.

295
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:14,882
Cartman, what are you doing?

296
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,033
I'm getting rid of our problem.
Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.

297
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,658
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude.
The police made an arrest. 

298
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,223
And the person confessed!

299
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:24,630
-They did?
-They did?

300
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:27,005
They say they got the guy that
did it down at the police station.

301
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,149
Who confessed?
That doesn't make any sense.

302
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,260
But can I still kill Kyyyle?

303
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,786
Hello boys. 
How are you?

304
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,339
We heard that you have the person
who TP'ed the art teacher's house? 

305
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:42,586
Is that true?
It sure is!

306
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,161
Uh, can we see them-him-her?

307
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:46,884
Right over here.

308
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,570
Yeah, we interrogated the 
suspect for over forty hours, 

309
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,240
and he finally cracked.

310
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,811
Hey fellas!
Butters?

311
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,932
Yep. I'm in jail.

312
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,573
You con-fessed?

313
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,157
Uh huh. Unh, they said
I TP'ed the art teacher's house.

314
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,775
I don't seem to remember it,
but they're pretty sure it was me.

315
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,469
I just can't get
my behavior under control!

316
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,480
His parents are on 
their way down now.

317
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,138
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh
let me have it! 

318
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,405
Just wait till 
my father gets here!

319
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,378
You guys,
we can't let him do this!

320
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,402
What are you talking about?
This is a gift from God.

321
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,890
An early Easter present all wrapped up
in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!

322
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,004
Well I'm just a little asshole,
is what I am.

323
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,609
When God made me, he must have 
not been payin' very close attention,

324
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,140
'cause I turned out wrong!
Just plain wrong!

325
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,424
Officer Barbrady,
Butters didn't TP that house.

326
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:30,609
Why do you say that?

327
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,393
-Because it was-
-Wiffle ball, anyone?

328
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,427
Anyone care for
a nice game of Wiffle ball?

329
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:38,018
You know, it's not my parents I'm 
worried about. It's my girlfriend, Karen.

330
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,488
Why, she lives in Michigan.
But when she finds out about this, 

331
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,665
woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore!

332
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,456
She might even break up with me.
And it would serve me right, too.

333
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:49,431
All right, boys, visiting time is over.
Thanks for stopping by.

334
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,245
You see guys,
it all worked itself out.

335
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,084
Tadow, tadow, how you like me now?
Feel a little silly now, Kyle?

336
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,106
Tadow, how you like me now?

337
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,474
I still feel bad, Cartman

338
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,920
What? Hu- How can you feel bad?
Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.

339
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,400
Yeah. That makes it even worse.

340
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:13,151
Kyle, you don't seem to understand.


341
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,434
We're we're not gonna 
get punished for this. Ever.

342
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,214
I know.

343
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:20,966
So... so then, 
how can you feel bad?

344
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,591
He feels guilty for doing it and for
letting someone else pay for it.

345
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,996
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.

346
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,905
It doesn't matter if you get
in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.

347
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:31,028
I think you're right, Kyle.
Maybe we should confess.

348
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,530
(Yeah, maybe we should.)

349
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,865
What?? Eh... hey you guys!

350
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:37,545
There's nothing to feel bad about!
We're, we're off scot-free!

351
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:40,191
We feel bad for other people.

352
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:43,124
For oth-er...

353
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:49,742
ih, is it that ...you think
you might get in trouble later?

354
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,930
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell
the teacher it was us, 

355
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,492
and let her decide 
what to do. And Cartman,

356
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,034
if you had any thread of a 
conscience at all, you'll do the same!

357
00:17:57,316 --> 00:18:01,368
Eh buh... eh... eh...
Freakin' weirdos, man!

358
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,535
Well well well!
I had to see it to believe it!

359
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:05,694
Hi, Dad.

360
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,243
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me!

361
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,911
Look at you! Standing
behind prison bars! Again!

362
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,163
Yeahhh.

363
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,218
What fibs have you been
telling this policeman, Butters?!

364
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,725
You know damn well you
didn't toilet-paper that house!

365
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,193
Butters was with us all night,
Officer Barbrady.

366
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:22,273
Butters, what have we told you
about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! 

367
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:23,615
We have had it, mister!

368
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:25,459
Well, he kept 
accusin' me for hours,


369
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:27,336
and then he shot me up 
with sodium pentathol.

370
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:28,961
And that's your excuse?!

371
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:32,509
Well, looks like I made a mistake.
I... guess I'd better let you out now.

372
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:35,122
Just wait till we get you home,
you little fibber!

373
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,885
Officer,
can I stay in jail, please?

374
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,542
Come on, you guys!
Hurry! Guys, hurry!

375
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:41,720
What is it, Cartmam?

376
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:43,613
It's over this way!
Come on!

377
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,396
So how are things, guys?

378
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,586
Cartman, we're confessing
tomorrow in school, and that's final.

379
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,397
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

380
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,115
You can't kill
all three of us, Cartman!

381
00:18:58,412 --> 00:18:59,849
Can't I?

382
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,134
Excuse me, everyone.

383
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,618
I have someone with me 

384
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,768
who can tell us all who 
toilet-papered the art teacher's house!

385
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,963
Josh insisted he be able to tell you 
the names of the toilet paperers in person.

386
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,237
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady,
but we actually don't need to know-

387
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,307
Hold it! Principal Victoria, 
Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Dreible. 

388
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,280
We have something 
we need to tell you.

389
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:30,111
All right. Will you people
stop barging into my office, please?

390
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,033
What's the matter, Principal Victoria?
Was your mother abusive?

391
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:35,157
Did she spank your thighs with cold
cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?

392
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:36,768
Get him out of here!

393
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:39,359
Uh, Policeman Brown,
will you take Josh outside, please?

394
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,436
Polceman Brown,
 never quite made officer. 

395
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,969
Why is that, Polceman Brown?

396
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:44,848
We have to confess that
we were the ones that-

397
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,585
It's too late, boys, m'kay?
We already know everything.

398
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,459
You, you do? How?

399
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:54,458
Hi guys.
Cartman??

400
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,520
I told them everything,
you guys. It's over.

401
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:59,709
Luckily for us, one of you had 
enough of a conscience to come forward.

402
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,738
My consciences
just caught up with me.

403
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:02,639
That's not fair!

404
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:04,452
You all get two 
weeks of detention,

405
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:07,001

except Eric, who gets 
one week for being brave.

406
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,593
But, but he's lying!
He doesn't have a conscience!

407
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:11,646
Well, I guess my 
work here is done.


408
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:15,329
After all this, 
I'm gonna need a long vacation.

409
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,065
This was supposed to be my story!

410
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,206
My coming to terms with a 
guilty conscience! This isn't fair!

411
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,336
Okay, Josh,
time to go back to the... Oh no!

412
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,691
He... He was too fast for me.
He ran out the door!

413
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:29,927
Couldn't you
have gone after him?

414
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,504
Well, ah I'm covered in toilet 
paper. I'd look silly.

415
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,353
Welcome to detention.

416
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:42,479
You will be here till five o'clock,
so make good study use of your time. M'kay?

417
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,485
Wugh! Two weeks of this!

418
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:46,819
Yeah. But I have to say,
I feel a lot better now.

419
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,041
I know what you mean, Kyle.

420
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,353
I realize now that even though you 
might not get caught doing something bad,

421
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:51,876
you can still get caught later.

422
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,217
Oh Jesus!

423
00:20:53,731 --> 00:20:55,182
I didn't feel bad before,
but now I just feel terrible.

424
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,383
You just feel bad for
yourself that you're in detention!

425
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,885
Right. I guess I learned
today that sometimes you-

426
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:03,075
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't 
learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!

427
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,262
Police station.

428
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,722
Hello Officer Barbrady.

429
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,005
Josh? Josh, where are you?!

430
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:17,513
I'm afraid that giving away my location 
might be harmful to my freedom, officer.

431
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,390
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me get out of that dingy cell.

432
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:24,070
Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile 
Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.

433
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:25,597
Sorry, officer, gotta run.

434
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:27,953
There's something I've been
meaning to do for quite some time.

435
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,734
Ciao.
