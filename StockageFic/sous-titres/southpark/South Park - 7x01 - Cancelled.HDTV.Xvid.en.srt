00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:11,586
I'm going down to south park
Gonna have myself a time

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,212
Friendly faces everywhere
Humble folks without temptation

3
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:18,411
Going down to south park
Gonna leave my woes behind

4
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:21,756
Ample parking day or night
People spouting "howdy neighbor"

5
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:24,943
Headin' on up to south park
Gonna see if i can't unwind

6
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,210
( muffled mumble muffled mumble )

7
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:32,475
So come on down southpark
And meet some friends of mine

8
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:37,509
School days school days
Teacher's golden rule days

9
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,360
Aw, dammit !
What ?

10
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:40,573
My god damn brother is trying
To follow me to school again !

11
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:41,886
Suck my balls.

12
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,795
No, ike, you can't come
To school with me !

13
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,170
Yeah, go home,
You little dildo !

14
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,561
Dude, for the last time,
Don't call my brother a dildo !

15
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,420
Alright, go home you little
Semen-puking, asshole dickhead.

16
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:52,988
Ow !
Dude, sweet !

17
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:54,116
Yeah, check it out.

18
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,289
Ready, ike ?
Kick the baby !

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,449
Don't kick
The god damn baby.

20
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:00,527
Wah-- ah !

21
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:03,551
Woah, cartman, Looks like you
didn't Get much sleep last night.

22
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:04,860
That's because
I was having these

23
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,501
Bogus nightmares
All night long.

24
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,913
Really ?
What about ?

25
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:10,725
Well, i dreamt that i was
Lying in my bed, in the dark...

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,665
When all of a sudden this bright
Blue light filled the room.

27
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:16,567
And slowly, my bedroom door
Began to open.

28
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,101
And then the next thing
I remember

29
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,150
I was being drug
Through a hallway !

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,799
Weeee !

31
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,235
Then these scary aliens
Wanted to operate on me !

32
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,696
They had big heads
And big black eyes--

33
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,407
Dude, visitors !
Totally !

34
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,272
What ?

35
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,049
That wasn't a dream, cartman,
Those were visitors !

36
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:31,775
No, it was just a dream,
My mom said so.

37
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,675
Visitors are real !
They--

38
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,051
Wait a minute, this has
All happened before.

39
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,024
Yeah. This does seem
Really familiar.

40
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,175
What the funk and wagnalls
Are you talking about ?

41
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:42,887
Cartman, don't you remember the
Last time you had this dream ?

42
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:44,992
Shut up you guys, you're just
Trying to scare me.

43
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,428
No, dude,
This happened before !

44
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:47,637
Aliens put some device in you,

45
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,272
And then we tied you to a tree
And you went up on their ship.

46
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,583
- You don't remember that ?
- No, i don't Remember that !

47
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,534
You don't ?

48
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,429
No, because the aliens
Erased my memory !

49
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,222
I remember this whole thing.

50
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,020
Ike tried to follow you
To school, you kicked him,

51
00:01:58,282 --> 00:01:59,901
Then cartman told us
About his alien dream.

52
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,835
Yeah, and then chef
Pulled up in his car.

53
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,536
Hello there, children !

54
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,444
And then you said--

55
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,070
What's gonna be for
Lunch today, chef ?

56
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,398
Well, today it's salisbury steak
With hot buttered noodles

57
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,101
( all ) And a choice
Of Green bean salad

58
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:16,216
-...Or vegetable medley.
- Weird.

59
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:17,651
Say, did any of you
Children--

60
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,668
See the alien spaceship
Last night ?

61
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,289
What the-- ?

62
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:24,072
- Chef, we're In a repeat !
- A repeat ?

63
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:26,057
Cartman was visited by
Aliens again last night.

64
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,324
And now it's like we're living
A repeat of a previous day.

65
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,823
Oh, dude, i hate repeats.

66
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,420
I've been feeling deja vu
All morning, children.

67
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:34,544
I knew something strange
Was going on.

68
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,033
It all started when cartman
Got an anal probe.

69
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:39,731
We have to get eric to a
Proctologist right away.

70
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,952
What is a
Proc-tologist, chef ?

71
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:46,924
He's a doctor that specializes
In your asshole, children.

72
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,412
You mean at some point
In this doctor's life

73
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:50,472
He decided he wanted to
Work on people's buttholes ?

74
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,443
- That's right.
- What a dick.

75
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,753
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, doctor.

76
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,660
Thanks for seeing eric
On such short notice.

77
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,098
What seems to be
The problem ?

78
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,588
We just want you
To take a look

79
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,225
And tell us if you see
Anything abnormal.

80
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,687
Other than its
Monstrous size.

81
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:05,373
Shut up !  Shut your
God damn mouth !!

82
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,686
Alright, let's see here...

83
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,756
- Oh my god !
- What ?

84
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,963
Why there's a huge crack going
Right down the middle !

85
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,650
Ha, ha, very funny.

86
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,415
Like we haven't heard
That one a zillion times.

87
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,151
Alright,
Let's take a look.

88
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,918
Hey ! Just what the hell do
you Think you're doing ?

89
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,503
Eric, the doctor has to feel
Inside your rectum.

90
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,983
And afterwards, He'll probably have
to Burn his hand and bury it.

91
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,219
Kyle, i swear if i didn't Have a
Guy's hand up My ass right now,

92
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,712
I'd leap across the room
And kick you in the nuts.

93
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,168
Egh, eh-- ooh.

94
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,823
The prostate
Seems to be normal...

95
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,532
No swelling of
The hermodal gland...

96
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,826
Wait, what's this ?
Aaagh !

97
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:47,766
- Are you okay ?
- Dude...

98
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,174
You know that feeling
When you take a huge dump ?

99
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,638
Awesome.

100
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:52,609
Well, doctor ?

101
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:55,219
I've never quite
Seen this before.

102
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,141
Perhaps he just needs
Some hemorrhoid cream.

103
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:01,679
Aaagh !
You alright ?

104
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,759
You know that feeling when
The huge dump you just took

105
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,066
Shoots back up Inside your ass ?
No, i'm not alright !!

106
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,421
I've never seen A
Hemorrhoid React this way.

107
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:11,444
That wasn't no hemorrhoid,
It was a alien hoop-a-joo !

108
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,443
Come on, children, we've got to
Get eric to some real help !

109
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:15,703
Where to now, chef ?

110
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,078
That thing inside
Eric's asshole

111
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,923
Looked like some kind of
Alien satellite dish.

112
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,594
We need to see my friend down
At the space center, now !

113
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:32,786
And you're the only person
I could think of

114
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,411
Who might be able
To help us, jeff.

115
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,556
How do we, uh,
Make it come out ?

116
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:39,163
Someone just has to activate it
Like the proctologist did.

117
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:40,709
Oh, no, no, no, no !

118
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,772
Nobody is putting their
Finger in my ass again !

119
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,637
Unless it's kyle.

120
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,055
What ? No way !
You do it, kenny.

121
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,067
Nope, it has to
Be kyle.

122
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,368
Go on.

123
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:49,669
I'm not putting my finger
Up cartman's butt !

124
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,706
Kyle, the fate of the world
May be at stake.

125
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,308
Come, kyle,
Do hurry.

126
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,726
Go ahead,
It won't bite.

127
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,804
( farts )

128
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,214
God damn it, cartman !

129
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:08,430
I couldn't resist,
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,734
( farts )

131
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,233
- Stop it, cartman !
- Okay, okay.

132
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,278
( farts )

133
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:17,686
God dammit !

134
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,749
Man, that was great.

135
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,357
Okay, go ahead,
I'm all out of farts now.

136
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,017
( farts )

137
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,802
- Durrrr !
- Durrrr !

138
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,970
Okay, okay,
It's not funny anymore.

139
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,868
( farts )
- Oh, yes it is !

140
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,752
- Eric, that's enough !
- Okay, okay.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,030
( farts )
Oh, double psyche !

142
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,724
That's it !

143
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,007
I don't care about
The fate of the world.

144
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,940
- Screw it !
- Oh, nice going, Cartman !

145
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,276
Alright, alright,
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,065
- Go ahead, kyle.
- No !

147
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:49,805
- No, go ahead, I'm dry.
- You're lying !

148
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,903
It stopped being funny
40 seconds ago, boys.

149
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,321
Let's just get this
Over with.

150
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:55,389
But it wasone of the
Best times i've ever had.

151
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,031
Can i see this thing,
Please ?

152
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,605
Okay.

153
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:00,243
( farts )

154
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,219
Okay, now it's
Funny again.

155
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,422
This is so awesome !
I don't think i made it

156
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:06,904
Out of that proctologist's's
Office, guys,

157
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,435
I think i died
And went to heaven !

158
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,419
That does it !
Charrrge !

159
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,189
( fart )
- Aagh !

160
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:17,483
What's it doing ?

161
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,772
It's sending a transmission
Of some kind.

162
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,984
Got it.

163
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,405
It's just sending images of
Cities and people and stuff.

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,556
Where is the signal
Being sent to ?

165
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,704
Ugh, agh !

166
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,744
I don't wanna play
Anymore, you guys.

167
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,253
We went through all that just
For some gay video of earth ?

168
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,257
We wanted to see an alien
Planet or something !

169
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,495
Whoever they are, if they're
Receiving messages

170
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,473
They might be
Sending them too.

171
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,771
Wait a minute.
C-candy bars !

172
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,083
Candy bars ?

173
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,896
Y'know, candy bars, they
Usually come in a wrapper,

174
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,083
Just like you wrap
A christmas present.

175
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,873
Christmas happens
When it's cold.

176
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,366
Cold as in alaska.

177
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,650
That's polar bears,
Polar bears...

178
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,560
Polarity !

179
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,726
I can switch the polarity
To see what transmissions

180
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:06,087
Are coming from the location
This one is being sent to !

181
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,949
What the heck ?

182
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,042
They're coming in !

183
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,356
What do we do ?

184
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:28,324
It's that guy you want ! He's trying
to reverse Your polarities !

185
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,856
What ?

186
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,735
Run !

187
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,917
Get in the car, children,
Get in the car !

188
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,611
( honking )

189
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,067
What is that ?

190
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,736
Can you see anything,
Children ?

191
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,674
The aliens
Are chasing us !

192
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,159
God damn aliens !

193
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,131
Chef, end of the road !

194
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,262
Hold on, children !
We have to ditch them !

195
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,959
What are you doing, man ?

196
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,289
( "dukes" narrator ) Looks like them
Boys are Getting a little fresh air.

197
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:11,153
( country music )

198
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,639
I think we ditched 'em.

199
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,728
I don't think we're
Out of the woods yet.

200
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,765
Coop coop !

201
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,015
It's the police !
That ain't no police !

202
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:32,051
When do we get to eat ?
I'm hungry.

203
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,353
Chef !

204
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,541
Ohh !

205
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,700
( "general lee" horn )

206
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,840
Ha !  God damn aliens !

207
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,013
I beat you !

208
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,660
Where'd you learn
To drive, aliens ?

209
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,797
- Chinese auto school ?
- Chef ! Chef, help !

210
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:56,627
You're lucky i didn't
Just turn around

211
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:59,006
And beat your white
Skinny alien asses anyway !

212
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,299
Maybe next time
You'll remember to-- huh ?

213
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,411
Aw, crap !
Children !

214
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,106
( all )
Cheffff !

215
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,018
Well, it looks like the boys
Are in more trouble

216
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,730
Than a june bug
In molasses.

217
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,277
And it's pretty thick
Molasses, too.

218
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:19,967
Uh...

219
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,420
You guys,
Wake up !

220
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,896
What the--
Where are we ?

221
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,936
We're in the
Alien ship.

222
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,437
Ah, ah !

223
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,218
Ugh, i'm trapped inside
Helen hunt's ass !

224
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,658
Oh god, help me,
You guys !

225
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,390
It's not Helen hunt's ass !
It's an alien spaceship.

226
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,257
Oh, thank god !
Oh thank, thank you lord.

227
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,251
You guys, look.

228
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,158
Wow.
Wow.

229
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:47,741
My god,
Do you guys realize ?

230
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:50,556
This is only the second time
We've ever been in outer space.

231
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,580
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

232
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,749
This is like
My fifth time.

233
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,655
Uh-oh.

234
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:02,026
This must be
The head alien guy.

235
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:03,369
Oh, no !

236
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:06,791
Hello, boys.

237
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,184
Dad ?

238
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,811
No, not really.

239
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,589
I just read your mind
And thought this form

240
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,560
Might be more
Pleasing to you.

241
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,485
Oh dude, don't do that,
That's gay.

242
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,048
Yeah, that's like that
Stupid movie "contact".

243
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,748
Oh god, that movie
Pissed me off.

244
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,297
Very well, i shall
Show my true form--

245
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:22,918
Blargh, blargh,
Blargh !

246
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,100
Okay, okay, take the form
Of something else !

247
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:26,652
How's this ?

248
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:29,731
Santa !
No, that's stupid too.

249
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,288
How about this ?

250
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:33,523
( all )
No.

251
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:34,902
No.

252
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:38,890
Ooh, very nice.

253
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:40,448
No.

254
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:42,167
No.

255
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:45,439
- Dy-no-mite !
- ( all ) No !

256
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,199
Jeff !

257
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,209
The aliens took the children
Up on their ship !

258
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,286
Oh, no !

259
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:52,982
Did you find out what
The aliens are up to ?

260
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,788
When i reversed the polarities
I found this--

261
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,994
It's a message that
The aliens are broadcasting

262
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,524
Throughout the
Entire universe.

263
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:01,182
But i have no idea
What it says.

264
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:02,775
They took the children, jeff !

265
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,618
I have to know what
Those aliens are up to !

266
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,635
Wait a minute--
Butt sex.

267
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:08,937
Butt sex ?

268
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,105
Butt sex requires a lot of
Lubrication, right ?

269
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,576
Lubrication...
Lubra, chupa...

270
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:17,178
Chupacabras, the goat
Killer of mexican folklore.

271
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,347
Folklore is stories
From the past

272
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,082
That are often
Fictionalized,

273
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,685
Fictionalized to heighten
Drama, drama student !

274
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,420
Students at colleges
Usually have bicycles.

275
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,022
Bi, bi-binary !
It's binary code !

276
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,191
Who's having butt sex ?

277
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:33,228
Hello my honey
hello my baby

278
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,396
Hello my rag time gal

279
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,698
No !

280
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:41,035
Let me search it
gonna work it...

281
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,337
No !

282
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:44,939
Don't piss on the moon,
babe

283
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,241
No !

284
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:49,711
Alright, earthlings, what form
Do you want me to take ?

285
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,747
How about a taco--
That craps ice cream ?

286
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,820
Guys ?

287
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,687
- I like it.
- Me too.

288
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,591
Alright, then we can
Get back to business.

289
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,760
Follow me this way,
Earthlings.

290
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:10,098
I want to apologize To you boys
For all the spooky, Scary stuff.

291
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,435
We just needed to get to the
Malfunctioning uplink relay.

292
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:15,737
You mean the thing
In cartman's ass ?

293
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,038
That's right.

294
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,207
See, there are dishes in over
50,000 earthlings' rectums,

295
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:20,942
Your friend's
Has been malfunctioning.

296
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,243
Why do you put them
Into people's asses ?

297
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,412
Are you planning some
Kind of alien take over ?

298
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,713
Oh, heaven's no !
We're a production company.

299
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:28,750
We make intergalactic
Television programs

300
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,919
That the whole
Universe watches.

301
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,087
Television ?

302
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,690
We at nerzod productions
Started 20 billion years ago

303
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,991
With one philosophy:

304
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,028
The best universal television
Isn't scripted, it's real !

305
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,840
We started with Great shows like
"who wants to Marry a gelgamek ?"

306
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:45,842
And "antares 6 Millionaire".
And then we had A big hit with

307
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:47,700
"get me outta here,
I'm a klignanian".

308
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,273
But then, of course,
There's our signature show,

309
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:53,608
The greatest universal
Reality show of all time.

310
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,297
Earth ?

311
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,334
A few billion years ago
We realized--

312
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,220
What if we took species From all
Different planets In the universe

313
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,797
And put them together
On the same planet ?

314
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,189
Great tv, right ?

315
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,942
Asians, bears, ducks,
Jews, deer and hispanics

316
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,472
All trying to live
Side by side on one planet !

317
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:14,878
It's great !

318
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,066
Our planet is just
A reality tv show ?

319
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,721
Well, you don't think
The whole universe

320
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,346
Works the way earth
Does, do you ?

321
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,394
No !  One species,
One planet.

322
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,973
There's a planet of deer,
A planet of asians and so on.

323
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,403
We put them all together
On earth

324
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,913
And the whole universe
Tunes in to watch the fun !

325
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,758
You mean that you aliens
Actually enjoy sitting around

326
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,574
And watching us fight
And kill with each other ?

327
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,447
- Dude, that's messed up.
- Why ?

328
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,287
Why !  Because you're playing
With people's lives !

329
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,186
You're turning people's problems
Into entertainment !

330
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,524
Yeah, we'd never
Do that on earth !

331
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:45,889
Ladies and gentlemen.

332
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,320
We have recently come across
An alien transmission

333
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,922
That is being beamed throughout
The entire universe.

334
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:52,681
( audience murmuring )

335
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,856
When decoded,
It looks like this.

336
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,269
What does it mean ?

337
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,894
It's simple
Mathematical language

338
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:12,794
That can be understood
Throughout the solar system.

339
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,457
Translated into our language,
It looks like this.

340
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,375
( announcer )
This janamon at 8:00

341
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,311
It's everyone's
Favorite show-- Earth !

342
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,458
It's been 100 galgamars
Since we first took species

343
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:25,907
From 17 different planets

344
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,485
And put them all together
On the same planet !

345
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:33,681
They've fought And fallen in love.
What will happen This galgamar ?

346
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:39,065
Tune in janamon at eight To
find out ! It's earth, onfognl !

347
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,228
I'm afraid that earth,
All of earth,

348
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:49,239
Is nothing but an intergalactic
Reality tv show.

349
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,914
My god.
We're famous !

350
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,715
( cheering )

351
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,357
Wait, you don't
Understand.

352
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:01,354
I'm on tv !
I'm on tv !

353
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,427
Oh, this is so awesome !

354
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:11,351
That should get the relay
Working again.

355
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,252
Alright, earthlings,
If you'll step over this way

356
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,837
We'll erase your memories
And get you back to earth.

357
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:16,943
( phone rings )
Oh, excuse me.

358
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:18,716
This is najix.

359
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,104
Uh-huh.
Oh, no.

360
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:23,288
Oh, no, really ?

361
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,606
It's for sure ?

362
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,821
Alright, i'll break
The news to everyone.

363
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:30,374
No, no, i understand,
Thanks.

364
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,093
Well, you kids can go
Back to earth if you want

365
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,794
But i'm afraid it won't
Be there for long.

366
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:36,260
The show's been canceled.

367
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:37,732
What ?
Who canceled us ?

368
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,074
The universal
Network heads.

369
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,981
They say the earthlings have
Become aware of the show

370
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,326
So it won't be
Funny anymore.

371
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,753
Oh ( bleep ),
Did we do that ?

372
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,686
Everyone, can i have your
Attention real quick ?

373
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:47,504
Uh, look, i just got a call
From the network

374
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,734
And i'm afraid earth
Has been canceled.

375
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:50,950
( all )
Aww...

376
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,471
Now, now,
It was a great run

377
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,107
And i think we should all
Be really proud.

378
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,605
( slight applause )

379
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:58,207
Let's call in
The demolition crew

380
00:15:58,551 --> 00:15:59,956
To strike the earth
For resources.

381
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,597
Wait, wait !
They can't do this !

382
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,052
Let us talk to
The network heads !

383
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,098
- Wouldn't do any good.
- Dude, we have to try !

384
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:06,803
Please take us to them,
Please !

385
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:09,155
Alright, kids, we'll take you
To the network heads,

386
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,578
But i warn you,
Nobody has ever gotten

387
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,545
The executives
To un-cancel a show

388
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:16,475
Once the call
Has been made...Nobody.

389
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,307
( beeping )

390
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:41,810
What the hell is that ?

391
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,631
There's a huge ship of some kind
In earth's orbit.

392
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,043
But why ?
Wait a minute-- Chaos theory !

393
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:49,302
Chaos theory ?

394
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:52,743
Chaos theory, it was first
Thought of in the '60s, 60.

395
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:54,836
That's the number of episodes
They made of "punky brewster"

396
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,212
Before it was canceled.
Canceled ?

397
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:57,844
Huh ?

398
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,167
Don't you see ?
The show is over.

399
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:01,981
The aliens are
Canceling earth !

400
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,324
Oh my god.
We have to stop them !

401
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:09,573
( announcer ) Welcome to planet
Fognl, Home of the joozians,

404
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,202
Oh, uh, we have a 3:00 meeting

408
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:26,765
( laughing )

409
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:30,361
Oh sure, come on in, Earthlings !
We're just checking Our new show.

410
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,726
We took 100 beings from
The planet marklar

411
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,944
And put them on an asteroid
With sentient beings

412
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,315
From the horsehead nebula.
It's a riot !

413
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,955
They hate each other !

414
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,985
Mighty, powerful
Network executives.

415
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,891
We have come a great
Distance in order to--

416
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,372
I'm starving, you earthlings
Have haglar yet ?

417
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,202

To you about the show.

00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,632
Please don't cancel us,
Please.

423
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,198
I'm sorry, earthlings,

424
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,413
But you have to realize
The universe is a business.

425
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:10,194
You made it to 100 episodes,
You should be proud.

426
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,528
Yeah, a show should never
Go past 100 episodes

427
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:14,509
Or else it starts to get stale

428
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,405
With ridiculously stupid
Plot lines and settings.

429
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:21,446
Here's you order of glagaplatzl
For gnakleberg !

430
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,977
But, sirs, we think our show
Is just getting good.

431
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,088
I mean, we're just now
Starting to see people

432
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,689
Getting really pissed off
At each other.

433
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,416
Oh my god,
This is great !

434
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,512
You must have some
Joozian ancestry.

435
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,703
Tell us about it.

436
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,699
Look, there's five billion
People on our show,

437
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:36,887
You can't just up and
Cancel on us.

438
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,809
Oh my god, will you look at the
Hekmas on that joozimak ?

439
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,315
Dude, we're trying to
Save our planet here !

440
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,516
Let's take the earthlings
To a hekma bar !

441
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:45,046
Oh, yeah !

442
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,436
Oh yeah, let's see
Those hekmas !

443
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:54,018
- Sirs, if you'll--
- Oh, man, I am so wasted.

444
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,880
Hey, you earthlings wanna
Try a little blancgh ?

445
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,017
( snorting )

446
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,777
Oh, yeah !
Oh, gluck yeah !

447
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,808
Kenny !
Man, screw this place !

448
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,967
Let's go get a hotel room
And a hooker !

449
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,281
Oh, yeah !

450
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,497
We have to find a way
To stop those aliens !

451
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,925
Their ship is massive,
There's no way to stop it !

452
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,674
Wait a minute--
Jackets !

453
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:20,575
Oh, no.

454
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:22,373
If people don't wear jackets
They could get cold !

455
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,020
A cold is caused by a virus,
A virus, a computer virus !

456
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:27,553
We could make
A computer virus

457
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,093
And send it to their ship
To disable their computers !

458
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,686
That doesn't make
Any goddamn sense !

459
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:39,939
Oh yeah, hooker, Oh yeah !
Yeah, woo, yeah !

460
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:43,393
Boy, earthlings, is this
A party or what ?

461
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,433
That's it, baby, you're
Getting my jaggon hard !

462
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:49,664

Oh yeah, suck it,

468
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,888
Dude, i have no idea what
We're seeing right now,

469
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,779
But i have a feeling
It's really, really wrong.

470
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:07,733
Oh yeah !
Oh yeah, yeah !

471
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:14,056
Oh, god... My head.
What did we do ?

472
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,846
Oh, man, i can't believe
I sucked your jaggon.

473
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,167
Oh god, we did suck
Each other's jaggons !

474
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,346
You kids won't tell anybody
About this, right ?

475
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:23,252
No.

476
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,199
No, wait--
We won't tell anybody

477
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,980
If you don't
Cancel our show.

478
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:28,701
Ooh, i knew
That was coming.

479
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,451
They've really got us
By the nezmins.

480
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:32,096
The earth show
Can still be good.

481
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,565
Just erase everyone's memory
So we don't know we're a show !

482
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,795
I'm sure you'll see that if
You give our world time

483
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,599
It will become even more
Outrageous and violent.

484
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:40,662
There's even world war iii
To look forward to !

485
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:42,451
And then we won't have to
Show anybody the picture

486
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,235
Kenny has of you guys sucking
Each other's jaggons.

487
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,765
Alright, alright, Earthlings !
You win.

488
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:48,705
The show can stay on.

489
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:49,798
Alright ! Alright !

490
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,079

Whoa, cartman looks like You

494
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,582

Bogus nightmares All night long.

00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,427
