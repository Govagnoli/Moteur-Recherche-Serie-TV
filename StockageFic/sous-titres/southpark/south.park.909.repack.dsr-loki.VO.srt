1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,830
What are you guys all doing here?

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,590
I don't know, I, I got this
emergency letter from Cartman,

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,783
who said to meet in his basement?

4
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:35,860
Yeah, us too.

5
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,723
Ah, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

6
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:42,494
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll cut to the chase:

7
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,453
The girls at our school have been
hiding something from us!

8
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,471
Hiding something huge...

9
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,362
What ?

10
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:54,103
What if I were to tell you...
that the girls have a device...

11
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,249
which allows them to see...
into the future?

12
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:58,771
What ??

13
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,273
How do you know?

14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,964
The girls do not have a device that shows
them the future, Cartman! That's retarded!

15
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,993
You, sir, mocked Cartman before,
yet you two sit here demanding answers!

16
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,637
Now damn you let him speak!

17
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,626
Thank you, Clyde.

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,714
Aaaagh, I'm afraid it's true.

19
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:21,110
I secretly videotaped the girls on the playground
yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera.

20
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:23,351
I caught the following images on tape.

21
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:27,110
I warn you, these images may be
too shocking for young children.

22
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,081
Oh okay, I'm not looking.

23
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,497
Video Playback Initialized!

24
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,702
Cool!Okay, my turn, my turn!
Do me now!

25
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:39,608
Okay Bebe, what do you want to know?

26
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:42,256
I want to know if I want to live
in a big mansion in the future.

27
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,069
Okay, let's find out. Ready?

28
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,589
Pick a number.

29
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,677
Four.

30
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,268
One two three four.
Okay, pick a color.

31
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:49,942
Blue.

32
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,230
B L U E.
All right, pick another color.

33
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,730
Red.

34
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:57,014
'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live
in a big mansion in the future?

35
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,216
Definitely yes!

36
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,155
All right!

37
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,875
Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!

38
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,559
Whoa! Wow!

39
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,732
Do me next. I wanna know if
I'm gonna marry somebody cute.

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,384
I'll do it! I'll do it!
Pick a number.

41
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,072
Three.

42
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,302
One two three. Nooow, pick a color.

43
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,945
G R E E N

44
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:14,734
Now blue!

45
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:16,087
The answer is no.

46
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,283
Aw dangit!

47
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:21,781
Oh my God, how does it know the answer?

48
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,781
I... don't believe it.

49
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:27,274
Believe it! The girls can ask it any question
they want and it gives them an answer.

50
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,132
Freeze image!

51
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:34,021
Gentlemen, we have to get our
hands on that device.

52
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:47,382
How is the incubation shield coming, Clyde?

53
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,284
It's all set.

54
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,243
Once we have the device, it can be housed in here
safely until we know what we're dealing with.

55
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,458
Good man.

56
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,559
Any luck here?

57
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:58,342
The outside of the device seems
to be covered in numerals.

58
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,225
Inside are colors... which must open
up some sort of temporal timewall

59
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,639
Good. Keep working. We want to know
all we can before we try to operate it.

60
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,495
All right, gentlemen, our containment center
for the timewall is nearly complete.

61
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,687
All that's left for us to do is get the
device from the girls and bring it here.

62
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:13,846
Let's go take it.

63
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,161
Don't be a fool, Craig.

64
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,255
Do you really think the girls are just
gonna hand that technology over?

65
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,663
So what do you suggest?

66
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:23,519
Heidi Turner is going to have a
slumber party on Thursday night.

67
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:26,707
There's no doubt in my mind the girls will
be using the future-telling device there.

68
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:29,319
If we... can get somebody
invited to that slumber party,

69
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:33,430
not only can we get a hold of the device,
but, find out how to use it.

70
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't
go to a chicks' slumber party.

71
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:41,275
No, not a boy, but a girl.

72
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,102
One of us is gonna have to go undercover,

73
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:49,734
show up in school tomorrow disguised
as the new girl who just moved to town.

74
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,194
You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?

75
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,737
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay?!
It's way cooler than that!

76
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:01,911
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in
class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.

77
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:04,281
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death.

78
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,008
It's simple spy stuff, my friends.

79
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:10,309
Take your top man, fake his death,
then send him in disguised as the enemy.

80
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:13,263
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?

81
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:17,811
Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?

82
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,638
Yes? What is it, officer?

83
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:20,538
You'd better come quick.

84
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,914
Your son is at the Bowery Building
threatening to kill himself.

85
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,395
What ??

86
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,825
Don't do it, son!
You have too much to live for!

87
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,095
Oh my God, Butters!

88
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,738
Oh uh, hi Mom.

89
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,271
Just keep stalling, Butters.
We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet.

90
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:53,882
Butters? Butters, whatever is
troubling you, this isn't the answer!

91
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,457
Look at all these people
who've come out for you!

92
00:04:56,492 --> 00:05:01,068
Just come down now, son, and ...we promise we
won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.

93
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:04,408
N'aw geez!
Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.

94
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:06,347
Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters!

95
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,518
He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!

96
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,240
No, wait, whatwhat's he doing??

97
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,198
Okay. One! Two!

98
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,770
JEEESUS CHRIST!

99
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,080
OHHHH MY GOD!!

100
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,610
He... didn't make it.

101
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:38,073
NOOOOOO!! NOOOOOO!!
My son is DEEAAD!! NOOOOOO!!

102
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,465
Nice.

103
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:45,652
And he shall be remembered as the peaceful
little boy who warmed his parent's hearts.

104
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:52,647
Lord, as we commit this
child's body to the earth,

105
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,238
may we ask it be the last child
you strike down so mercilessly.

106
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,894
We know this request to be futile, Lord,
but just thought we would ask.

107
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,574
NOOOOOO!! NOOOOOO!! BUTTERS!!

108
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:11,369
NOOOOOO!! Don't put him down there!!
Don't put him down there!!

109
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,598
Okay children, let's take our seats.

110
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:21,965
Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning
over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters

111
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,964
Who's Butters?

112
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,530
But we all must try to move on

113
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:31,881
And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new
student who has just moved here from Dallas.

114
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,316
Children, please say hello to...
Marjorine.

115
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,875
Oh, uh, hello.

116
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,147
Welcome to our school, Marjorine.

117
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:43,597
Oh... Thank you.

118
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:47,277
Dude, I think it's totally working.
The girls are totally buying it.

119
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:50,580
Why don't you tell the children
a little about yourself, Marjorine?

120
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,353
Well, I'm just a typical little girl.

121
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:59,720
I like dancin', an' and ponies, a-a-and
getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.

122
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,425
Nice.

123
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,885
Now Marjorine, that's not very lady-like.

124
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:07,662
Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch
just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.

125
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,099
That girls sure has a strange sense of fashion.

126
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:14,317
Dude, they totally think he's a girl.

127
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:15,890
All right, have a seat, Marjorine,

128
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,112
I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to
show you around the school.  Won't you, girls?

129
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,199
Where do you buy your clothes?

130
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,025
Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.

131
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:31,432
Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.
This is going swimmingly.

132
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,958
Heidi, sweetie,
I'm just gonna set the snacks over here.

133
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,012
'Kay Mom.

134
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,827
Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one
extra girl coming to your slumber party.

135
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,437
Who??

136
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,196
The new girl in your class, Marjorine.

137
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,685
Mom, I didn't invite her!

138
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,058
I know, sweetie,
but I got a call from Marjorine's mother.

139
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,190
Her mother ?

140
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,656
She said Marjorine is having a really
hard time being in a new school.

141
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,737
Her mom asked me personally if
we could have Marjorine over,

142
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:09,004
and besides, her mother told me
that she works as a state official

143
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,535
and that I should ... respect her authority.

144
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,782
Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.

145
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:30,269
Why couldn't we help him?
Why is our little boy dead?

146
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:36,755
Oh Butters! Oh Butters,
I miss you so much!

147
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:43,364
Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.

148
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,109
Who are you?

149
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,133
I came to talk you out of it.

150
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:53,098
You need tuh... just accept that your
son is dead, not try to bring him back.

151
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,943
Bring him back?
Why... What are you talking about?

152
00:08:56,978 --> 00:09:01,495
I know you're thinkin' of puttin; him up there,
the Indian Burial Ground up that road.

153
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,923
You're thinking if you bury his body there,
he will come back alive.

154
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,727
Sometimes, dead is better.

155
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:09,012
Indian... Burial Ground?

156
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,380
It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of.
The Nelson boy, back in '85.

157
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:20,277
You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury
him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-

158
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:25,345
Don't do it, Stotch! What comes out of the ground
ain't the thing you put in.

159
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,759
The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped
using it when the ground went sour.

160
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:32,092
I'm just here to talk you out of it.

161
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:38,015
Don't bury your son's body at
the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch!

162
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,576
The one that's right up over there, behind the
Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better.

163
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,416
All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.

164
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:56,473
Huh I can't do it, felas.
I can't go into a girls' slumber party!

165
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,162
What if they find out I ain't a girl?

166
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,669
You're gonna be fine.

167
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:03,168
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what it is
that girls do at their slumber parties.

168
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,807
But if they all start, you know,
lezzing out, just roll with it.

169
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,744
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?

170
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,548
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the
future-telling device, pay attention to how it works

171
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,504
Once you know how to operate it, just grab it
and get the hell out of there.

172
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,286
Wuh then I can go home and tell my mommy
and daddy I'm not really dead?

173
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,032
Youh dude, of course.
Now go, the party's already started.

174
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,186
Good luck, man

175
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:26,879
Remember Butters, you must get that future-
telling device from the girls at all costs!

176
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:29,514
And just roll with it
if they start lezzing out.

177
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,256
All right, now we all want
you to have a good time.

178
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,955
But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is
our responsibility to look out for all of you.

179
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:44,387
There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot,

180
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:48,584
and most importantly, if I catch any
boys anywhere near this party,

181
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:50,866
they're gonna be in a world of hurt.

182
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,012
All right, have a nice time, girls

183
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,448
So, what do you guys wanna do first?

184
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:00,669
We could play "girl talk."

185
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,997
I brought the new Justin Timberlake CD.
We should dance to it.

186
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,364
How about we read each other's futures?

187
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,758
I know. Let's do
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."

188
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,841
Who wants to go first?

189
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:21,545
I will.

190
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,508
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out?

191
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:36,013
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

192
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:43,427
Jesus, what are they doing in there?

193
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:48,113
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber
parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.

194
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:52,465
AAAAAAAAAAH NOO! Witches!
You're all witches!

195
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,765
Marjorine, what is your problem?!

196
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:58,437
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys
wanna tell each other's futures now?

197
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:05,470
Yeah. I can tell you your future, Marjorine! You're going
to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy dorky geek!

198
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,770
Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid!

199
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,141
Yeah, and you're flat

200
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:15,250
Marjorine, why don't you just leave?!
Nobody wants you here!

201
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:32,837
Hello son. Don't you worry.
Daddy's gonna make everything all right again

202
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,887
There he is. There's my boy!
Come on, Butters!

203
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh... Butters... smell like... bacon.

204
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:59,481
Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son.
We're gonna bring you back!

205
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,015
I think we went too far with Marjorine.

206
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,668
She's in the bathroom crying.

207
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:10,902
Marjorine?

208
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,377
Nobody likes meee...

209
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,568
Aw gee, she's really upset.

210
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:21,588
I feel terrible, you guys. It can't
be easy being the new girl in school.

211
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:25,237
Marjorine? Marjorine?
Hey, we didn't mean it.

212
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:27,726
You don't know how hard it is to be me.

213
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,646
Marjorine, we were just teasing.
We think you're great.

214
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:34,556
You think I'm uglee-eeheheee.

215
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,103
You're not ugly, Marjorine.

216
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,375
You said I'm ugly and I'm flat.

217
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:45,499
Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all.
We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty.

218
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:48,550
Yeah. How about we all give you
a little makeover, Marjorine?

219
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,813
Yeah, Let's go!

220
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,250
You mean it?

221
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,737
Dude, it's been too long.
Something's wrong.

222
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,024
Maybe they found him out.

223
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,611
Then, he's already dead.

224
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,366
Come on, we gotta go check on him

225
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:09,782
Can you see anything?

226
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,091
He's just dancing around.

227
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,171
That sonofabitch!

228
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:26,593
Marjorine, sweetie,
your mom's on the phone.

229
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,095
My mom?

230
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:30,774
Hello ?

231
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:33,281
Butters! Just what the fuck
do you think you're doing?!

232
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,779
Well, I'm just havin' some
fun with my girlfriends.

233
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:40,098
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole!
You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.

234
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,422
Well, I'm workin' on it!

235
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,210
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!

236
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,566
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this!

237
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:50,627
Well I put myself through a lot,
and you can't talk to me like that! Uh, mom.

238
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:53,974
Just do what you were sent
in there to do, dickface!

239
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,783
Hey Marjorine,
you wanna know your future?

240
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,374
Ah. Uhh. Could I hold that?

241
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,935
Sure.
Here, you do my future.

242
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:18,784
How?

243
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:23,140
Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your
thumbs and index fingers in here...

244
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:31,584
Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!

245
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:34,215
There's a boy here?

246
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:40,546
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight,
but I gotta do what I was sent here to do!

247
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,782
He's got it! He's got the device!

248
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,401
Tango tango tango! We've got it!

249
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,584
Let's get it to the cointainment center! Go!

250
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:55,570
Come on, Butters.

251
00:15:55,588 --> 00:16:01,866
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done,
and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead!

252
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,420
What the hell?

253
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,767
Haaahahahaha, we have the device now!
The power belongs to us!

254
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:15,728
Anybody have a piece of notebook
paper so I can make another one?

255
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,671
Go! Go! Get in the containment field!

256
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,157
Stephen, you did what??

257
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:42,185
I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest
chance it would bring him back!

258
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:45,115
I don't know!
I don't know what I'm doing anymore!

259
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:49,825
You dug up our son's body??
Performed some kind of pagan ritual??

260
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:54,219
Linda, I did it for you!
You wanted him back so much. So did I!

261
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:55,675
Not Like this.

262
00:16:56,586 --> 00:17:03,883
Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen.
He would be a walking abomination.

263
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,097
An unholy demon spawn!

264
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,266
Hello?

265
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:17,895
It's him.

266
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:19,435
Keep the door locked.

267
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:26,711
Mom? Dad?
Ih it's me, Butters. I'm back.

268
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,996
Oh God...

269
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:52,260
It's gone, dear. It's gone.
Forgive me.

270
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,004
Huhey Mom and Dad, I'm not-

271
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:01,542
Oh God, it's terrible!
What have I done?!

272
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,472
Uh, I guess you're probably
a little surprised to see me.

273
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:07,390
IT ISN'T RIGHT! MAKE IT GO AWAY!

274
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,701
Gentlemen, this is a historic day
for all of boy- and mankind!

275
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,377
In a few moments, we will know the future

276
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:21,895
Ho- hold on guys.
We're not sure what this device is capable of.

277
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,007
Maybe we should wait until
we've had more time to study it.

278
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:27,631
No, no! We don't have tome for that, Stan!
It's time to ask it a question.

279
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,011
How come you get to use it first?

280
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,019
Because I do, Clyde.

281
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,136
I wanna use it.

282
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:35,772
I'm askin' the first question!
Let's just start with something simple.

283
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,033
Will Kyle die before he's twenty?

284
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:39,855
Wait! I don't wanna know that

285
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:42,137
Ask it if the Broncos
are gonna win on Sunday.

286
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:43,949
Naw, dude, then it won't be fun to watch!

287
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,601
Will you all just shut up
so I can do this?!

288
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:46,785
You shut up, asshole!

289
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:48,568
I don't wanna know when
I'm going to die, fatass!

290
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,693
Guys, guys, guys, stop!

291
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:55,350
Look at what this thing is doing to us.

292
00:18:56,634 --> 00:19:00,886
Butters was trying to tell me something outside
the house. That this device is nothing but trouble.

293
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,437
I think I know what he meant now.

294
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,015
How can it be nothing but trouble?

295
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:08,615
We risked everything to get it from the girls.
How long before the girls attack us to get it back?

296
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:14,347
Yeah. Forget about the girls, what about if
the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this?

297
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:15,813
They'll come after it for sure.

298
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,916
Maybe we should take it to someplace safer.

299
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:20,268
And then what?
Hide forever from the government?

300
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,499
From the... terrorists who
want to use it for evil?

301
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,609
Maybe... maybe nobody is
meant to have this kind of power.

302
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,129
You mean, destroy it.

303
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,995
Are you guys nuts?!
After everything we've gone through?!

304
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,226
We got it away from the girls.
That's what matters.

305
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:39,781
But now the right thing to do isn't using it
ourselves, then we're no better than they are.

306
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,227
Think of the power!

307
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:46,613
It's too much power. For anybody.
Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.

308
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:57,563
Are we sure about this?
We'll never know the future.

309
00:19:57,591 --> 00:20:01,637
Nobody will. That's the way it's
supposed to be. Hit it, Kenny

310
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,408
Damn, Ken!

311
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:22,243
Here. Here, you see? It's going
to be all right. Hello... son.

312
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:24,829
Hi Dad.

313
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,425
He was supposed to stay dead!

314
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:30,857
Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?

315
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:36,333
Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now.
You're an abomination.

316
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,578
Can I please just have somethin' to eat?
Well I'm pretty hungry.

317
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,294
It's... hungry.

318
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,932
Yes... It must feed.

319
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,412
Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains.

320
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,669
Oh yes. Thank you for coming.

321
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,603
Which room are we looking at?

322
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,313
Just follow me to the basement.

323
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,774
Yes. The basement.

324
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:05,728
Oh my, it's pretty dark down here.
You sure you need curtains?

325
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,108
Oh my God!

326
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,569
Uh hello, I'm Butters

327
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:12,404
Little boy, what are you doing down here?

328
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,503
