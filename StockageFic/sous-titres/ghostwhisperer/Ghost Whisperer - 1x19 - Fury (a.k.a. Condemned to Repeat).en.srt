00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:09,309
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,030
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,559
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:16,294
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:21,568
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

7
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:23,469
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,091
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

9
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:28,513
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

10
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:32,110
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,612
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,143
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

13
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,017
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

14
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:43,684
So today,

15
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:47,637
25 years after judge Walter Merrick took his oath of office,

16
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:51,002
we are here to dedicate this courthouse in his name.

17
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:56,122
These qualities have earned him the deep respect which he so richly deserves.

18
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,559
So how come I've never heard of this guy?

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,660
Maybe you need to be on trial more often.

20
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:03,870
- You're hilarious.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,400
Fair, impartial, and open-minded,

22
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,185
a man of learning and knowledge--

23
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:18,364
I've seen his name in the paper a few times. He gives lots of money to local charities.

24
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,765
And now I'd like all of you to stand with me...

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
On this momentous occasion...

26
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,431
as we honor this great man.

27
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,218
Maybe he should give some money for some new color guard uniforms.

28
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:01,739
Melinda!

29
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:05,785
Stop!

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000

31
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,285
- He's lucky you got there in time.
- He's lucky he's alive.

32
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,726
I figured this for a heart attack or a stroke, but

33
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:22,656
nothing showed up on the test?

34
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:23,974
Nothing will.

35
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:27,758
What did you see?

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,989
A man,

37
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,448
maybe 40 and angry.

38
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,716
Very angry. It's like he was trying to suck the life right out of the judge.

39
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,266
Well, he almost succeeded.

40
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,433
Yeah, things are definitely changing out there.

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,830
I heard that.

42
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,269
What did you feel?

43
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,312
It was almost like I was being smothered, or

44
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,298
choking.

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,981
I don't know. It's like there's more and more spirits out there that are dangerous,

46
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,282
and they have even more power to hurt people.

47
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,059
Maybe even kill them.

48
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:05,591
Maybe this has been happening all the time. Maybe you're just seeing more now.

49
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:06,542
I don't think so.

50
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:22,896
Hey, Mr. Slade.

51
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,616
Hey!

52
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:31,586
I was taken advantage of! For 18 years I worked here. What did I get for it?! Nothin'!

53
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:34,578
No respect! Look at me when I'm talking to you, fool!

54
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,445
Hey! I grew up in this town.

55
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,746
I had a future. I got a family.

56
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:42,072
I got a son.

57
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:47,609
You don't think I wanna be with my family? And he took it all away from me!

58
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,256
You don't deserve this, judge Merrick!

59
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,930
You will never see this dedication to your good name!

60
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,311
Never! Never! Never!

61
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,639
So why was he at the hardware store?

62
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:02,132
Mike's remodeling. Sometimes it can stir things up.

63
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,083
Oh.

64
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:06,142
Remember how I was thinking we should put some new shelves in the back?

65
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,093
Let's not.

66
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,457
Listen to me!

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,870
I lost everything! Where's my justice?

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,950
Where's my justice, huh?! Where's my justice for me?!

69
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:14,953
I'll be right back.

70
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:28,196
You two!

71
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,174
You two! You think you're friends?!

72
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:34,335
That was a nice trip.

73
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,114
You'd get justice, wouldn't ya?

74
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,703
You know why? 'Cause you're white!

75
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,330
And you, you wouldn't get nothing!

76
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,581
No justice for you, boy! No justice for you!

77
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:43,916
- Justice for what?
- Excuse me?

78
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:47,872
I can help you.

79
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,008
Wait. Wait, don't go.

80
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,011
Too late to help!

81
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,749
For my hardware store to compete with the big chains out on the highway,

82
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,431
I've got to update the store, you know?

83
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,484
- Give it a little polish.
- Your table's ready.

84
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:08,985
Sell some hard-to-find items.

85
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,968
Uh, you know, personal service...

86
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,140
the whole deal.

87
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,987
So how's the construction going? Any problems?

88
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,309
Sure. Everything costs twice as much as my contractor said it would be.

89
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,954
That's not really what I meant. I meant, uh,

90
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:25,274
noises, things being moved, cold drafts.

91
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:28,598
- Things that go bump in the night?
- Did anyone die there?

92
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,871
You know about that?

93
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:30,999
No, not really.

94
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,498
I'm just trying to learn everything I can about the town, good and bad.

95
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,976
Yeah, it was back when my dad had the store. 1974 or '75.

96
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,765
Yeah, one of the employees got killed.

97
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:41,716
In the store?

98
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,825
No, I don't think so. Why?

99
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,531
You think I might have ghosts or something?

100
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,945
No. Um, I just have a very morbid curiosity.

101
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:08,903
You ever notice how people will shop like crazy in a pouring rain,

102
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,403
but one clap of thunder and they scurry home like roaches?

103
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,995
Hmm. Roaches. Nice visual.

104
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:14,462
I liked it.

105
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,372
And where is the rain, by the way?

106
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:19,316
It's been thundering for, like 2 hours and not a cloud in the sky.

107
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:20,270
Here, this is him.

108
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:25,135
Ely Fisher attacked a white co-worker, Link Hofstadter, when he insulted him.

109
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,764
Ooh. Must have been one serious insult.

110
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:31,503
Then Link killed him, but no charges were ever filed.

111
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:33,672
Why does that sound backwards to me?

112
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,085
They were saying there was rumblings of racism.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,950
You think?

114
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,035
What? It was almost 30 years ago.

115
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:43,686
It's hard to imagine that people still think like that, especially here.

116
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Did I ever tell you my vodka story?

117
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:46,724
No.

118
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,752
I was in this liquor store looking for a good bottle of wine,

119
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,017
but they didn't have a really good selection. So I'm leaving,

120
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,568
behind this pretty blonde, and the alarm goes off.

121
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:57,416
And then the security guard practically tackles me.

122
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,294
They thought you were shoplifting?

123
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,250
The blonde had put a bottle of vodka under her coat.

124
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,831
And she didn't know there was a sensor on it, but--

125
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,740
well, I was the one that they saw.

126
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:12,233
I didn't think stuff like that still happened, at least not in the city.

127
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,384
It wasn't in the city.

128
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,605
Melinda, it was right here in Grand View.

129
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,416
You see things I don't

130
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,034
and vice-versa.

131
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:21,687
Yeah, but most people in this town are not like that.

132
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,288
Well, I don't know all of them.

133
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,965
I didn't know any of them in 1975.

134
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,906
What else does it say?

135
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:30,451
Ely, he had a wife and a young son.

136
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:32,087
Oh! Wait.

137
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,946
Wow. Judge Merrick.

138
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,661
Yeah, he was the prosecuting attorney. He was also the one who

139
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,362
didn't file charges against Link.

140
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,179
So why is Ely suddenly back?

141
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,270
I don't think he's too happy that judge Merrick is being honored.

142
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,811
All right. I'm ready to do the whole "scurry and roach" thing myself right now.

143
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:00,104
- See you tomorrow.
- Have fun.
- Ok, thanks. Bye.

144
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,662
- Really, go ahead and eat.
- No, I'll wait.

145
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,653
Lasagna.

146
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:40,317
Tastes better when it's reheated anyway.

147
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:41,608
I'll be home in an hour.

148
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,717
You sound a little funny. What's going on?

149
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:44,724
I'll explain later.

150
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:47,829
Look, the weather stinks. Do you have to go see this judge tonight?

151
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
Yeah, I think I do.

152
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,582
Listen, do you know anybody at the courthouse

153
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,251
that might know where the Fisher's moved after Ely died?

154
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,072
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

155
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,016
On whether or not you really come home in an hour.

156
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,588
9:02. Set your watch.

157
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:04,172
Check.

158
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:05,758
Drive safe, babe.

159
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,049
Bye.

160
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:51,854
Stop it!

161
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,100
- Thank you.
- I'll check on you later.

162
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:21,838
The nurse said someone's coming to repair the monitor. I can stay until they get here.

163
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:23,938
2 close calls in one week.

164
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,506
This is getting to be a habit.

165
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:27,907
Is there anything I can do?

166
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:31,267
I think saving my life was enough for one night.

167
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,549
You were at the ceremony, weren't you?

168
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:40,271
Um, is there anyone I can get in touch with for you?

169
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,321
No. My wife passed a few years ago.

170
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,339
Haven't seen my brother in years.

171
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,586
Now, if i die...

172
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,084
I'm sure there would be a few people happy to get that call.

173
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:54,707
People you sent to jail?

174
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,308
Most of them are still in jail.

175
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,179
My sentences stuck.

176
00:11:58,909 --> 00:11:59,959
I was proud of that.

177
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,104
Ely Fisher?

178
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:03,217
Beg your pardon?

179
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:06,367
He died in 1975. You were a prosecutor then.

180
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:08,489
1975?

181
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:14,302
Sweetie, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning much less 30 years ago.

182
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,458
This is gonna sound strange, but I think you might be in danger.

183
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,520
Please.

184
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,393
The only danger I face is my cholesterol.

185
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,009
And I'm...

186
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,675
getting a little tired now.

187
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:28,983
Of course.

188
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,263
Maybe I'll come back another time.

189
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,749
Mr. Merrick, are you all right?

190
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:36,644
I'm all right.

191
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:00,448
Your father was Ely Fisher.

192
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:04,474
He worked at the hardware store in Grand View.

193
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:06,925
- Who wants to know?
- My name is Melinda Gordon.

194
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,997
How'd you get this number, lady?

195
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,811
Dad, you said you'd--

196
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:12,586
- just hold on!
- One second, buddy.

197
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,337
My husband works for the county, and he looked up some courthouse records.

198
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:17,998
Courthouse?

199
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,510
Yeah. I'm doing some research,

200
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:22,291
and I was wondering if we could discuss it. I could come to Martinsville.

201
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,492
What do you want, lady?

202
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,248
- Daddy, come on.
- Hush, Jameel.

203
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,835
Walter Merrick. Do you know him?

204
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,239
Yeah, I know Merrick.

205
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,612
He's the man who killed my mother when I was 7.

206
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:34,685
Your mother...

207
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,890
I'm sorry. I knew that your father had died.

208
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,241
My father didn't just die.

209
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,526
My father was murdered.

210
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:47,782
I can't believe it.

211
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:52,339
I lose my father, my mother, and judge Merrick gets a building named after him.

212
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,359
What am I sayin'?

213
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,146
Of course I can believe it.

214
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,199
You said he killed your mother. How?

215
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,232
Do I know you...

216
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,908
or what you want?

217
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,856
Why should I tell you anything?

218
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,119
You came here, didn't you?

219
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,620
I came to visit my aunt Rose.

220
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,383
Well, I think there's more to the story than what's in the newspaper.

221
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,934
A white man killed my father and got away with it.

222
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:14,901
That's the story.

223
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:16,379
Come on, dad. Let's go.

224
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,629
Look, I'm sorry,

225
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,238
ok? I didn't mean to...

226
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:21,448
to upset you or your dad.

227
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:24,098
I just want to help, both of you.

228
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:25,062
Help?

229
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,535
How are you gonna help him?

230
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:30,943
Come here.

231
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,358
Look, you see that store right there?

232
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:35,953
That's where your granddaddy worked.

233
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,594
See that alley down there?

234
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,187
That's where he died.

235
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,754
Your grandfather worked in that hardware store for 18 years.

236
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:45,677
And then Mr. Slade hired that punk Link Hofstadter.

237
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,253
I don't need to be treated this way, not by any man.

238
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,254
Ely. Ely, wait. It's the only fair way.

239
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,652
With all due respect, Mr. Slade. I've come to work on time for 18 years.

240
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:54,903
Never took one sick day.

241
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,130
And you're gonna start him at a dollar more an hour than you pay me?

242
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,081
How is that fair?

243
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,710
You think I'd work for less than some colored man?

244
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,988
His father, I owe him a favor.

245
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,086
Oh, yeah, I know.

246
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,006
Everybody around here owes the Hofstadters a favor.

247
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,032
And this one can't tell the difference between a lamp shade an a light socket.

248
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,633
Hey! You watch your mouth, boy!

249
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,102
And that night...

250
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,446
that night,

251
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Link waited on him,

252
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,183
jumped him and killed him in cold blood.

253
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:27,692
Dad, my hand.

254
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,711
Link said that it was self-defense.

255
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:39,283
- And the newspapers, they say--
- The Hofstadters own the newspapers.

256
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,966
And they own half the mortgages on the properties in Grand View.

257
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,283
But there were no witnesses.

258
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,734
I heard there was a witness,

259
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,823
and the Hofstadters paid them off, whoever they were.

260
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:49,887
Is there any proof?

261
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,632
That's just what Merrick said,

262
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,015
the man whose name is on that plaque back there.

263
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:56,663
Go away! Get lost!

264
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,591
I was about the same age as Jameel.

265
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:06,263
And my mother couldn't believe that Merrick was not gonna press charges.

266
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,888
My mother wasn't gonna just let it go.

267
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,279
She wanted justice.

268
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,841
But judge Merrick told her there were no witnesses

269
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,942
and that it was Link's word against hers.

270
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:16,894
But she knew.

271
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,608
Your husband threatened to kill Link.

272
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,955
There was a witness!

273
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,951
She knew my father would never hurt anyone.

274
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,743
It was self-defense.

275
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,942
At least put it in front of a grand jury. Let them decide.

276
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:33,123
My mother died that day.

277
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:37,043
They said it was a heart attack. And I guess they were right.

278
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,694
'Cause her heart broke that day.

279
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,391
That's a

280
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,811
horrible thing for a 7-year-old to see.

281
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,256
Do you think I want your sympathy?

282
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,580
Do you know what became of Link?

283
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:50,381
Yeah, I kept track of that bastard.

284
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,707
He got sick a couple of years ago and died...

285
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,582
in the comfort of his home...

286
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,087
surrounded by his wife and kids.

287
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:03,465
Get outta here!

288
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:05,143
Come on!

289
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,151
You know what's weird? Ely never showed himself today.

290
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,107
Maybe he's all gone now.

291
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,371
That's what I love about you: Forever an optimist.

292
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,190
It was more like standing on that square, you could see Ely's anger on his son's face.

293
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,710
They make the same expressions when they're mad...

294
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,960
which is all the time.

295
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,060
Well, the man's father was killed,

296
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,573
probably in a hate crime.

297
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:30,984
Nothing was done.

298
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,455
That would

299
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,632
pretty much make me mad all the time.

300
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,083
I get it. I do. It's just...

301
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:40,208
so sad to see such an angry little boy,

302
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,477
that hatred passed down from father to son.

303
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,224
That's the way of the world, my love.

304
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:47,373
Always has been.

305
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:51,481
You know, maybe if I get them together,

306
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:55,477
the judge could tell Randall what happened and break they cycle.

307
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,980
Right.

308
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:00,393
And then they could get started on that pesky little gaza strip thing.

309
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,344
I'm serious.

310
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,110
There's a reason I am pulled into these people's lives.

311
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,263
I know, I know.

312
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,446
Some things are beyond your help,

313
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:10,754
anybody's help.

314
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:12,176
Some people,

315
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,000
all they wanna do is hold on to their hatred.

316
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,293
Well, I won't know unless I try.

317
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,490
Wait.

318
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,574
You mean now?

319
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:24,465
Yeah. I can't sleep anyway.

320
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,275
I'm coming with you.

321
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,748
No. You might scare him off.

322
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,295
He does not sound like a guy who scares easy.

323
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:33,096
Please? There's nothing you can do.

324
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,265
Wait. What are you saying?

325
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:38,004
I'm supposed to wait here while you go out in this weather looking for this...

326
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:38,833
whatever he is?

327
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:39,848
No. Don't wait.

328
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,328
Get some rest. I'll be home soon.

329
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,979
Who are you?

330
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,095
What do you want?!

331
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,720
What have I done to you?!

332
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:21,448
I know what happened to you,

333
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,240
to your wife and your son.

334
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,358
What about my son?

335
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,545
He's in pain.

336
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,344
He's filled with hatred.

337
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,587
He should be.

338
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,538
No,

339
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:32,643
you're wrong. It's gonna ruin his life.

340
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,858
Look, I can help you talk to the judge--

341
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,797
I'll talk to him when he's dead like me,

342
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:38,935
and that's what I'll make him

343
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:42,219
before he ever gets a chance to see that dedication to his good name.

344
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,979
Don't do this. There's a better way.

345
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,930
I'm taking him!

346
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,417
You better stand back,

347
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,394
or I may have to take you, too.

348
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:51,822
There are people over here who are very interested in you.

349
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:55,815
Hey, it's ok. It's ok.

350
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:58,052
Don't be mad.

351
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,043
I spent a lot of time on that case.

352
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:09,426
Interviewed dozens of people.

353
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:12,477
I was a brand-new prosecutor, and I wanted to make my bones.

354
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,501
The Hofstadters are very powerful. Is that why you decided not to prosecute?

355
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:18,452
No.

356
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,300
If ambition were my only concern,

357
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,119
a murder trial would have been the best way to get my name in the papers.

358
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,481
Everything isn't in black and white.

359
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,425
Interesting choice of words.

360
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,505
No, I knew Link Hofstadter.

361
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,339
I knew his family. He was a fine young man.

362
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,019
You want to know what really happened that night?

363
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:41,143
I come to work on time for 18 years, damn you,

364
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,233
took crap from customers who let me carry their refrigerator to the damn door

365
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,344
and then got nervous when I took it inside.

366
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,045
Customers who made me put their change on the counter

367
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:50,799
so we wouldn't accidentally touch hands.

368
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,150
But I took it. Oh, I smiled. I said thank you,

369
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:55,602
and you're paying him a dollar more an hour than you pay me?

370
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:58,055
His father, I owe him a favor.

371
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,106
A dollar more!

372
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,798
And this meathead can't tell the difference between a lampshade and a light socket.

373
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,149
I'd watch your mouth, boy.

374
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,048
Don't you ever call me boy. You dumbass cracker.

375
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,674
- Just stop it.
- Call me boy again, you're dead!

376
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:11,025
That's enough. We're okay.

377
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:13,758
I won't have this. Not in my store.

378
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,841
One more fight, I fire you both.

379
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:23,160
That night, Ely waited for him.

380
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,387
Ely could take care of himself. He was good with his fists.

381
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,396
Hey, boy,

382
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:32,784
I got somethin' for you.

383
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:33,874
Come on.

384
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,916
Come on, cracker.

385
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:36,909
Show me what you got.

386
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,357
Come on. Come on.

387
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:40,624
Come on, cracker!

388
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,641
Come on, show me what you got.

389
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:43,242
I'm not losing my job over you.

390
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:44,546
Come on.

391
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:53,582
Come on, boy.

392
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:55,587
Come on, boy.

393
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:00,614
Come on.

394
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,570
It was a case of self-defense.

395
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:22,228
How do you know that? You weren't even there.

396
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,320
I took statements from the people who saw the two of them arguing in the street.

397
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,136
The medical reports backed up everything Link said.

398
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,987
I came to this very hospital to question him that night.

399
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,759
He had two broken ribs,

400
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,687
and he needed 19 stitches to close up his cheek.

401
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,421
And Ely?

402
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:42,197
The blow to his head killed him instantly.

403
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:43,908
Link was all torn up about it.

404
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,138
I doubt he ever forgave himself.

405
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,082
There were rumors about a witness.

406
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,658
Oh, I knew about the rumors. They were never substantiated. Not one.

407
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:54,986
Why are you digging all this up? Why now?

408
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,878
Ely's family feels like there was an injustice done.

409
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,155
I'm sure they do.

410
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:04,005
It was a tragedy from every side. But you can't bring criminal charges

411
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,627
against a man, ruin his good name,

412
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,180
maybe taint him for life, for defending himself.

413
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,618
Daddy, why are you crying?

414
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:23,337
Look, I'm not crying.

415
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,760
It's just the wind. It blew something in my eye.

416
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,751
It's real windy in the square.

417
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,786
Then why are we sitting here so long?

418
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:34,244
Maybe...

419
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,510
I don't know.

420
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,656
Makes me feel closer to my dad.

421
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,752
I feel a little mixed up.

422
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:44,689
Come on, let's go.

423
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:47,172
But daddy, you told me never to cry.

424
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,443
Yeah, that's right. Don't you ever let anybody make you cry.

425
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,820
You only trust your own kind.

426
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,919
That's how you stay strong.

427
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,336
That's how you stay ready.

428
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:00,784
Ready for what?

429
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:04,235
Ready for places like this.

430
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:09,106
- He looks just like in the pictures.
- Who?

431
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,083
What are you talking about, Jameel?

432
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,147
Grandpa.

433
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:22,574
Come on, let's go.

434
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:24,471
But, dad,

435
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:26,281
he's standing right there. I swear.

436
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:35,651
I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.

437
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:38,051
No way, our insurance doesn't cov...

438
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:40,544
the boy, he can see me.

439
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,209
Lots of kids can see spirits.

440
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,536
Are you talking to me?

441
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:53,285
Okay, should I get ready to run screaming from the store?

442
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:55,422
I'll get back to you on that one.

443
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,629
- How come he can see me?
- I don't really know.

444
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,301
They usually grow out of it by the time they're eight or nine.

445
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,493
When they realize they're not supposed to be seeing them.

446
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,094
Your grandson's seven, I think.

447
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,139
So why didn't you talk to him?

448
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,076
I don't know what to say.

449
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,048
Yes, you do.

450
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:17,839
Wait, hey, oh, no. Are you gonna leave me here alone with the...

451
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,980
All right.

452
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:27,018
I'll be in the back if, uh...

453
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:28,797
if you need me.

454
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:37,993
Hi.

455
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:41,816
There's something I need to show you in my store.

456
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:51,185
Where are we going, daddy?

457
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:52,362
Don't worry about it.

458
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,977
- What's your name?
- Jameel. Jameel Fisher.

459
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,633
Mm-hmm, second grade.

460
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:01,872
Who's he talking to?

461
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:03,324
What's going on here?

462
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:05,952
The other night when I called,

463
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,045
it's because I had seen your father.

464
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,278
What're you talking about? My father's dead.

465
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,262
Your dad, he can't see me, can he?

466
00:26:12,911 --> 00:26:14,211
No, just me and the lady.

467
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,392
What're you, some kind of grifter?

468
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,816
What, you're gonna tell me my future next?

469
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:20,535
Look, I have this gift.

470
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Do you still live here?

471
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,069
No, but I did.

472
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:27,665
All my life.

473
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:30,574
I was born in the same house your aunt Rose lives in now.

474
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:32,506
Wait a minute, you were born in a house?

475
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,457
What?

476
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,387
Back then, lots of people were. Couldn't afford the hospitals.

477
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,788
Granddaddy was born in a house, not a hospital. They were too poor.

478
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:44,106
- How are you doing this?
- I'm not.

479
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,122
Me and your aunt Rose,

480
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:50,017
we slept in a dresser drawer when we were babies.

481
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,568
Then Celia came along, they finally bought a crib.

482
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:53,959
Who's Celia?

483
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,763
Celia.

484
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,483
She passed when she was just a little thing.

485
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,000
She drowned down

486
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,028
in a pond.

487
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,389
I was supposed to be watching her.

488
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,721
Daddy, is that why you won't let me go swimming unless you watch?

489
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:09,772
'Cause granddaddy wasn't watching Celia?

490
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:11,122
All right, what is this?

491
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:14,144
Only me and my family knows that story.

492
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:15,933
Your father knows.

493
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:17,177
My father.

494
00:27:17,488 --> 00:27:18,438
He's here.

495
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,504
He is, daddy.

496
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:22,326
All right,

497
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,990
if granddad's here,

498
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,875
ask him what happened that night.

499
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:35,012
It's not like what Link Hofstadter said.

500
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:37,329
Came out of the barn,

501
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,254
and I could smell the alcohol on him.

502
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:40,847
Hey, sambo.

503
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,077
Come here.

504
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,328
I got something for you.

505
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:45,333
Mr. Hofstadter,

506
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:48,159
I didn't mean nothing about what I said at the store today.

507
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,328
Come on, boy, show me some of your sass now!

508
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:51,929
I'm not losing my job over you.

509
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:11,941
I heard his ribs crack.

510
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:16,307
But he wasn't gonna let me win. What would he tell his redneck friends?

511
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,048
It wasn't like Link said.

512
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,698
I was just going to get some milk for your daddy's breakfast.

513
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:34,949
My daddy gives me milk for my breakfast too.

514
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:38,859
He wasn't looking for a fight.

515
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:40,196
That's what my mom said.

516
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,391
Nobody would listen.

517
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,952
She cried, she cried,

518
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:47,392
she couldn't work.

519
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:49,213
She lost her job.

520
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,453
I just wanted a way to make them pay, Link and that prosecutor.

521
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:54,354
He wanted to punish Link and Merrick.

522
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,313
Well, wait,

523
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:58,000
if he's still here,

524
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:00,384
after all this time,

525
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,158
how come he didn't talk to me?

526
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:06,319
I was the same age as Jameel is right now.

527
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,291
I didn't know I could.

528
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,196
I was just trying to make them pay.

529
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:15,126
You know what it would've meant, pop? If I could just see you?

530
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,142
To just know that you were there.

531
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:21,307
Teach me the things that a father is supposed to teach his son.

532
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:22,758
It's not like that, Randall.

533
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:24,952
He just didn't know that he could.

534
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:26,752
What about mom?

535
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,268
Where were you when she died?

536
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,497
And where is she?

537
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:32,814
Tell him

538
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:33,958
I was there that day.

539
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:36,719
Rachel saw this light,

540
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:40,187
she wanted me to come with her, but I couldn't, I just couldn't.

541
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,488
Your mother crossed over.

542
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:44,582
And your father couldn't because he was too angry.

543
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,283
Well, I know all about the anger.

544
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,480
All right, 'cause that's all he left me.

545
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,230
What good has he done, huh?

546
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:08,363
Wait!

547
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,389
Back there you asked me where he was

548
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,890
when you needed him to teach you the things fathers teach their sons.

549
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:19,184
There are some things you need to teach your son.

550
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,601
Maybe even some things you need to teach your father.

551
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,102
Yeah, well, my father's gone.

552
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,500
Either you're working some scam, or

553
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,576
you're just plain crazy.

554
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:29,371
I'm not, and you know it.

555
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:30,809
She's not, daddy.

556
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,364
Please,

557
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,229
come with me to see judge Merrick.

558
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,118
And do what?

559
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,069
Lay this to rest.

560
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,025
Come in.

561
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,432
She your boss?

562
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:44,096
Um, she's my partner.

563
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,820
You're partners with a white lady?

564
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,000
Well,

565
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,927
she's also my friend, Jameel.

566
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:52,912
She's my best friend.

567
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:58,211
My dad says that people wouldn't fight if they stuck with their own kind.

568
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:01,705
Well, your dad's a pretty smart guy.

569
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,024
You know what my kind is?

570
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:08,336
Here.

571
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:12,590
People who

572
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,613
are respectful of others,

573
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:17,051
people who are intelligent,

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,472
kind, funny, nice to kids,

575
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,896
people like Melinda.

576
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,460
- She's funny?
- Oh, she's so funny.

577
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:29,151
See that's the thing about people, Jameel.

578
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,553
You don't know who they are just by looking at them.

579
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,270
You have to get to know them.

580
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,012
But your dad is absolutely right.

581
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:40,976
Once you find out that someone's your kind,

582
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:43,177
you stick with them.

583
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,748
You owe me.

584
00:31:58,285 --> 00:31:59,635
Can I do anything for you?

585
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:01,331
Rain check.

586
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:05,124
Yeah, I remember, but not now, ok?

587
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:06,886
It's your turn to help me.

588
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:08,650
And it's gotta be now.

589
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:12,273
Why?

590
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:16,347
Because I was working here the night they brought Link Hofstadter in.

591
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,576
I waited two hours for the son of a bitch.

592
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,716
I was just gonna throw him a beating.

593
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:30,667
You know, show him how he has to treat

594
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,920
a white man.

595
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
You're the witness.

596
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,881
He told me everything.

597
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,979
Well...

598
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:49,327
this is a nice send-off.

599
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:50,650
They're letting me out on parole.

600
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:53,551
I suggested they sentence me to community service, but...

601
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:56,460
I'm sorry, do I know you?

602
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,211
This is Randall Fisher. Ely's son.

603
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,557
The two of you will have to excuse me. I've gotta get dressed.

604
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:04,308
There was a witness, wasn't there?

605
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:06,919
A nurse, who came to you.

606
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:10,671
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going home now.

607
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,529
Hey, I wasn't gonna end him.

608
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,365
Maybe he shouldn't have raised his hands to me.

609
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,485
You know, he should've just

610
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,005
taken what he had coming.

611
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,821
Maybe then I would've left him alive.

612
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:26,572
Hey, come here.

613
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:31,420
We have to keep this place safe. For our kind.

614
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,890
But that's not it, is it?

615
00:33:36,092 --> 00:33:39,353
The E.R. nurse came to you and told you what Link had said to her.

616
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:42,112
Mr. Merrick, I'm the nurse who called you.

617
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:44,646
Link told me everything.

618
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:46,143
I talked to Link too.

619
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,243
He was drunk.

620
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:50,182
There's more people to think he got jumped by a black man in an alley

621
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,657
and he didn't defend himself.

622
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:52,997
That's not the story.

623
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,877
Well, it's a case I can't win.

624
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:56,192
So the case is closed.

625
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,944
The next day there was $5,000 in my checking account.

626
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,185
The Hofstadters put $5,000 into her checking account.

627
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,185
What?

628
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,444
I didn't know, I swear. She never told me.

629
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,242
She tried to tell you once, but you told her that the case was closed.

630
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:15,162
- But if I'd known they paid her...
- you should've looked again.

631
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:16,613
But you wanted to look away.

632
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,641
How do you know all of this anyway?

633
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:22,720
How do I know you didn't just invent it?

634
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:23,547
It's the truth.

635
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:25,987
Check the bank records if you don't believe me, but the easier way,

636
00:34:25,988 --> 00:34:27,097
is just to do nothing.

637
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,448
This was a stupid argument

638
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:30,045
that got out of hand.

639
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,430
It was an argument over a dollar an hour.

640
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:34,681
This had nothing to do with a dollar an hour

641
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,166
or a seat on a bus or a water fountain.

642
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,290
This is about something bigger and you know it.

643
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,710
I didn't know about the money.

644
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,838
Well, you do now.

645
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:50,901
I just didn't believe he could've done something like this.

646
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:53,252
We know what you believe, judge, then and now,

647
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:56,641
and we both know why you looked away, don't we?

648
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:25,716
Walter Merrick was not only a judge in this courthouse for 25 years,

649
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:28,476
he was instrumental in restoring Grand View

650
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,877
to the town many of us grew up in.

651
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,979
The storm has passed. He's healthy and strong as ever.

652
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,532
Judge Walter Merrick.

653
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:39,973
Thank you very much.

654
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,210
I've been recognized

655
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,896
as many things in this town.

656
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,607
A tough,

657
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,558
but fair-minded

658
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,242
judge,

659
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,272
a deacon of my church,

660
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,230
a good husband.

661
00:35:57,863 --> 00:35:58,863
The one thing I was

662
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:00,277
not known as...

663
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,634
is a racist.

664
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:06,654
30 years ago,

665
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,437
a black man, Ely Fisher was killed

666
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:11,535
right in the square.

667
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,996
The plain truth is, I assumed

668
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:16,614
Ely Fisher was the guilty one.

669
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:18,342
I made a judgment call

670
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:19,892
that was callous

671
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,140
and bigoted.

672
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:28,022
It would be easy to say, it was 30 years ago,

673
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,720
but the truth

674
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:34,738
is that I was that same man until yesterday.

675
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,061
Despite

676
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:39,834
great progress in this country, racism

677
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,194
is still very much alive.

678
00:36:43,263 --> 00:36:44,213
It can be subtle,

679
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:47,898
handed down from generation to generation.

680
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:52,850
This tragedy is my shame.

681
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,383
My debt.

682
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,654
But,

683
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,188
if it becomes a reason to change,

684
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,160
for even one of you, or one of your children,

685
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:08,607
Ely Fisher's death

686
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,606
will have gained new meaning.

687
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:15,185
So later today, I will officially recommend

688
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,450
that this plaque be removed

689
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:19,768
and that a new one replace it.

690
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:21,178
One that dedicates

691
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:22,831
this courthouse

692
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:25,184
to Ely Fisher.

693
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:32,244
Hey, there's grandpa.

694
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,773
Where'd grandpa go?

695
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,659
Thank you all for coming, and enjoy the festivities.

696
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:01,827
Is he gone for good?

697
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:03,928
I don't know.

698
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,062
Ely, I...

699
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:10,625
Grandpa,

700
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,372
daddy needs to talk to you.

701
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:13,897
I'm right here.

702
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:15,993
He's here.

703
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:17,565
Ask him how he feels.

704
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:19,191
I hardly know.

705
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,114
I'm glad the right thing was done,

706
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,851
but it don't change much.

707
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:25,824
Thought I'd feel happy,

708
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,268
like I won.

709
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:32,043
I don't think anyone won.

710
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,168
He's glad

711
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:37,122
that the truth came out, but it didn't change much.

712
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,072
It does, pop.

713
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,758
I thought staying mad all that time really gave me something.

714
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:44,167
Something to stay here for.

715
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:45,568
Something to keep me going.

716
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,456
But it took a lot away too.

717
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:50,771
From me, from you,

718
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,484
even Jameel. And that's gotta stop.

719
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,252
I'm not mad, grandpa.

720
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:00,435
That's good, little man.

721
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:03,454
And you make sure your pops doesn't stay mad either.

722
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:05,004
You tell him

723
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:07,621
he can let go of this now.

724
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:10,126
He's got a clean slate.

725
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:12,096
So do I.

726
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,154
I see it.

727
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:24,242
A light.

728
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,219
I guess it's time.

729
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:30,755
- You're ready.
- Time for what, grandpa?

730
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,374
To see your grandma Rachel and your aunt Celia.

731
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,738
Can I meet them?

732
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:40,292
No.

733
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:42,044
Not quite yet.

734
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:45,987
He looks like his mother.

735
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:48,231
That's a good thing too.

736
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,364
He's glad that you look like your mother.

737
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:57,985
I thought...

738
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:00,759
that it would hurt too much

739
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,333
if I knew you.

740
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,552
Or if I remembered you too well.

741
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,223
But you left such a big hole.

742
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:12,377
Tell him he grew up strong.

743
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:14,073
And I'm proud of him for that.

744
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,483
But he's gotta grow up soft now.

745
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,170
He's gotta teach his son

746
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:20,308
to be both.

747
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,511
- Tell him I said goodbye.
- I will.

748
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,183
Ely, wait.

749
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:56,008
Before you said that there are people who are interested in me.

750
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,500
Who and why me?

751
00:40:58,294 --> 00:40:59,244
I was mad,

752
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:01,135
I didn't mean to scare you.

753
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:02,147
What did you mean?

754
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:04,853
I don't know. I'm not sure.

755
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,603
There's a lot I don't understand.

756
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:12,549
They know about you.

757
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:14,843
And not

758
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:17,209
everybody is happy about what you do.
