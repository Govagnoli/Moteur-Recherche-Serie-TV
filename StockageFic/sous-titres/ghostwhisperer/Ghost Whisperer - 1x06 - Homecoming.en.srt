1
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,733
Pay new bills
or price old furniture?

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,234
Uh... furniture.

3
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,668
You know,
i cannot believe

4
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,501
you're canceling
drinks with
my brother.

5
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:29,934
Whoa, not canceling.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,167
I changed the location
to linda's on the square,
ok?

7
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,301
I want mitch
to see your house.

8
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,067
I don't know what
you're so worried
about.

9
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,367
Melinda:
We can't have visitors.

10
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,201
We haven't had a chance
to clean up.

11
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,700
Ah, the man
sells real estate
for a living.

12
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:46,201
He sees all the secrets
of people's homes.

13
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,201
Rich people.
People who have
maids.

14
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,034
Didn't you just say
he was once named

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,067
one of
the 30 millionaires
under 30 to watch?

16
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:54,700
Actually, it was 25
out of 25,

17
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,201
but who's counting?

18
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,534
Ah, melinda, you should
see their penthouse
in the city.

19
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,534
And their summer house
at the beach.

20
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,267
His wife, maya,
the ex-model...

21
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,334
i know.

22
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,534
She decorated them
both,

23
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,534
and she has, of course,
impeccable taste.

24
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,467
Ok. Your brother's
definitely never stepping
foot in my house.

25
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,034
What are you talking
about?

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,534
You guys are almost
done renovating.
Your house is beautiful!

27
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:15,867
Would you mind
telling that to jim?

28
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,867
Because he now wants
to repaint every room.

29
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:21,234
I swear he likes to live
in a perpetual state
of construction.

30
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,034
Actually, you know what?
I better run.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,733
'Cause i told mitch
i was gonna pick him up
at the hotel.

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,334
So he's not staying
at your apartment?

33
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,167
He's way too rich
to sleep on my couch.

34
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:35,167
Yeah. And to have drinks
on mine.

35
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,167
Well, too bad, 'cause
mean old moneybags

36
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:39,100
is gonna be
on your porch at 9:00.

37
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,301
Bye.
Bye.

38
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,967
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy

39
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:26,841
I started calling andrea
a squeaky wheel
when we were kids.

40
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:29,641
I would follow him
around everywhere
and talk constantly

41
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:32,707
like a squeaky wheel,
and he couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

42
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:35,841
How's my little sister
doing at your store?

43
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,541
Andrea: Our store.
Our store.

44
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:38,973
She owns half.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,507
We're partners.
I... told you that.

46
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:43,774
You did, but i wasn't sure
whether this was a vocation

47
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,007
or another one of your
avocations.

48
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,307
Yes. I am the perpetual
student.

49
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,240
I did actually
manage to learn

50
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,541
quite a bit of latin,
though.

51
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,707
What was that?

52
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,107
You guys all right?

53
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,841
Uh... i was meaning
to replace these frames.

54
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,541
I can understand
why you'd want to keep
the original wood.

55
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,774
I mean, you can't beat
that quality of craftsmanship.

56
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,140
Yeah, tim did

57
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:11,774
andrea and melinda:
All the renovations
himself.

58
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,274
So what are your plans
for this house?

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,007
Besides living in it?

60
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:21,607
I been thinking about
repainting all the rooms.

61
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:22,808
Why do you ask?

62
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:24,607
If i had a house like this,
i'd flip it.

63
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,707
With the remodeling
that jim's already done,

64
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:29,741
put this back on the market
for 6 or $700,000.

65
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,107
That much.

66
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,040
If you guys are interested,
i could show you how.

67
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,841
You could end up with
a much bigger and better place.

68
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,441
It couldn't hurt
to find out, right?

69
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:14,741
What are you doing
here?

70
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,574
This is my home.

71
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,407
Who are you?

72
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,841
Is that you?

73
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,240
Are you dead, too?

74
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,841
Uh, no.
[Small laugh]

75
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,407
What is that?

76
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,441
It's your energy.
You have a lot of
pent-up anger,

77
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:47,140
and i would calm down
before you short out
the whole block.

78
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:50,474
Yeah, that's me.

79
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,808
With my mother.
I have to talk to her.

80
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,040
Where is she?

81
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,407
I'm not even sure
where i am.

82
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,240
Jim:
Melinda.

83
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,240
Oh...

84
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:00,240
friend or foe?

85
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,374
Friend. I think.

86
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,507
Be up in a minute.

87
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:21,040
Hi.

88
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,040
Hi!

89
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,507
You're outside
the store.

90
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:25,007
Yes, i am.
Why?

91
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:27,407
Because inside the store,
it's gotten a little
creepy.

92
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:30,541
No offense if it's like
a friend of yours
or something.

93
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,808
I just thought i'd enjoy
the day out here
until you came.

94
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:34,808
My friend.

95
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,007
Yeah.
Right.

96
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:48,174
What's all my furniture
doing here?

97
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,174
I bought it
at an estate sale.

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,174
What's your name?

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,741
Jason. Jason shields.

100
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,674
How come you can
see me and hear me?

101
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,874
It's this thing.
It's complicated.

102
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,808
The best part is
that i can help you
cross over.

103
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,707
I mean, you really
don't want to stay here.

104
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,908
You need to get
to the next place.

105
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:09,007
No. I don't wanna
go anywhere until
i find my mother.

106
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,307
Picture.

107
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,240
See the tattoo
on her arm?

108
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,707
And if you look
real close,

109
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:19,340
you can see that she
bites her fingernails.

110
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:20,707
What's her name?

111
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,940
I don't know.

112
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,073
I don't know what
she looks like,

113
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,641
where she lives,
or anything about her.

114
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:27,808
The last time
i was with her was when
we took that picture.

115
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:29,541
I was only a day old.

116
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,607
So she put you up
for adoption.

117
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:34,641
I was gonna start
looking for her as soon
as i turned 18,

118
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,741
'cause then my mom and dad
couldn't stop me.

119
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:38,207
Your adoptive parents.

120
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,940
So... what happened?

121
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:44,174
I would have been
18 this week.

122
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,107
How did you find out
you were adopted?

123
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,307
My mom and dad were moving
grandma into a nursing home.

124
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,541
Her mind was starting to go.

125
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:01,507
I found the picture.

126
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:04,741
I asked my grandmother
who the baby was,

127
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,808
and she said it was me
with my mother,

128
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,274
except my mother
doesn't have a tattoo.

129
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,808
That's when i knew.

130
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,174
If you won't
tell me who she is,
i'm gonna find her!

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,707
Mother: I don't know
who she is.
She abandoned you!

132
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:25,140
How do you know what happened?
I'm gonna find my mother!

133
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:27,474
I am your mother!

134
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,874
They denied it.
And then they weren't even
gonna talk about it.

135
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:37,973
They weren't even gonna
tell me that i was adopted.

136
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,674
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,707
I can't go anywhere
until i find my mother.

138
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,741
I have to know why
she gave me up.

139
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,607
Maybe if i talk to
your adopted mother...

140
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,741
no! She won't help.

141
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,407
Even if she could.

142
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:45,707
She'll have nothing
to do with this.

143
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,574
Will you help me?

144
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:56,741
You know these adoption
searches take years,

145
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,374
and that's with
some information,

146
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,707
and you don't know
anything about
this woman.

147
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,407
Not true. I know
that she bites her nails,

148
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,908
and i know that
she has a tattoo.

149
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,407
Can you imagine
finding out

150
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,674
that your parents
are not your parents?

151
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,641
Sounds like
every angst-ridden
teenager's dream.

152
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,441
I know it was mine.

153
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:18,441
Yeah, mine, too.
But the reality
must be devastating.

154
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:23,073
This is jason's only connection
to the woman who gave him life.

155
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,040
No wonder
he's attached to it.

156
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:27,140
Wait.
That's haliston county.

157
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:30,874
See?
She's got a hospital
i.d. Bracelet on.

158
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,474
I can't see the name,

159
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,541
but that's the symbol
for haliston county
hospital.

160
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,140
Are you sure?

161
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,007
Yeah. We had
a resident from mercy
just take a job there.

162
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,474
So that's where
jason was born.

163
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm off work
tomorrow.

164
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,274
Me, too.

165
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,507
Well...

166
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,140
now that
that's solved...

167
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:57,574
someday we'll have
one of our own.

168
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,741
I'm thinking
more like 4 or 5.

169
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:01,340
Ouch!

170
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,240
We definitely need
a bigger house.

171
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,973
Jimbo!

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,973
Hey!

173
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,774
Hey, good to see you
again.

174
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,808
Dennis nakamura.
Hey, meet my wife,
melinda gordon.

175
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,140
Hi. I really appreciate

176
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,274
your help
in finding my friend's
birth records.

177
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,908
No problem.

178
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:18,973
Maybe i can
ask you for a favor
in return.

179
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,940
This is where we keep
babies that have been
abandoned

180
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,973
or are being put up
for adoption.

181
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,741
This is where jason
must have been
after he was born.

182
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,240
You ever heard of
f.t.t.?

183
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,874
Yeah. It's a failure
to thrive.

184
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,874
It's a condition
babies develop

185
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,874
due to emotional
neglect.

186
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,474
Yeah. Basically,
if an infant isn't
being held enough,

187
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,474
looked at, touched,
or given enough
emotional attention,

188
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,574
it stops growing.

189
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:45,607
That's why we get
volunteers like yourself

190
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,407
to come in
and hold them.

191
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,541
Oh... hi, little one.

192
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,407
While you're doing
that,

193
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,574
we'll look for
your adopted friend's
birth records.

194
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,240
Adoption, huh?

195
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,641
Tricky business.

196
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,541
Although,
from what i've learned
over the years,

197
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:06,641
you can always count
on the courts

198
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,307
to have adoption
records on file.

199
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,541
Getting to see them
is another matter.

200
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,641
What are you doing here?

201
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:14,940
Waiting.

202
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,841
Won't be long now.

203
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:20,507
Oh, is this one yours?

204
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,641
She will be soon.

205
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:27,040
I don't understand.

206
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,774
I have a calling,
just like you.

207
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,774
I'm a guardian
for little children
who don't have anyone

208
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,240
to meet them
on the other side.

209
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,474
I take care of them.

210
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,107
So, she isn't
gonna make it?

211
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:44,940
It's ok. She's not
meant to make it.

212
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,908
We have a better place
for her.
[Monitor beeping]

213
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,441
Time for us to go.

214
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:05,441
Waiting in line
is worse than
being dead.

215
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,073
Why are you
ignoring me?!

216
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,507
I'm not. I just can't
talk with all these
people around.

217
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:17,240
Ok, miss gordon.
I found jason shields'
adoption records.

218
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,140
Uh, do you have
a judge's signed order
for a release?

219
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,741
Not yet. I just need
to know if the record
is complete.

220
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:24,307
Oh, i can't let you look
at it without a release.

221
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,240
What do you
want me to do?

222
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,774
Are you ok, miss?

223
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,507
Stand behind the counter.

224
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,574
I <i>am</i> behind
the counter.

225
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,407
That's what i meant,
like that.

226
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,174
You know, you wouldn't
be breaking any rules

227
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,107
if you just told me
that the documents
were all there.

228
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,441
Well, what kind of documents
are we looking for today?

229
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:48,874
Well, can you list
what's there?

230
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,641
Petition to adopt,
finalization papers,

231
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,574
adoption consent...
get her to slow down.
I can't see anything.

232
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:59,574
Could you slow down,
just for a minute?

233
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:03,441
All right, here's something
that says my mother was 17,
italian-catholic,

234
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,040
unmarried.
That's it. That's it?

235
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:07,340
Is there anything else?

236
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:11,174
Only the orders
to terminate
parental rights.

237
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,340
No, this can't be right.

238
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,774
Melinda: What is it?

239
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,307
Dissolves
the birth parents

240
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,707
from any legal right
to the child.

241
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,073
Right.

242
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:23,140
Are you ok?

243
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,441
She gave me up
willingly.

244
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,207
I thought she had to
give me away. L...

245
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:30,541
i thought someone
was forcing her.

246
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,674
My mother didn't want me.

247
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,607
she gave me away
when i was a day old.
What's wrong with me?

248
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:51,408
Nothing. We don't know
what her situation was.

249
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:56,307
I can't tell you how many
hours i studied that picture
looking for clues.

250
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:59,441
I was psyched she had a tattoo.
I mean, how cool is that?

251
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:02,774
And the fingernails.

252
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,341
I figured they were bitten down
'cause she was all upset
about having to give me away,

253
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:11,141
like, maybe she was too young
and her parents were forcing
her to give me up.

254
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:12,940
Pretty stupid, huh?

255
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:16,874
"Willingly relinquished"
is just a legal term.

256
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,107
We don't know what
other kind of battles
she was fighting.

257
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:22,974
I don't know who i am...
or who i was.

258
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,673
Hey, i know
how hard this is,

259
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,374
but you're forgetting
about the 2 people
who did want you.

260
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:31,508
They chose you,
they loved you,
they raised you.

261
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,974
You don't keep secrets
from people you love!

262
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,874
How could they not tell me?
How could they let me
find out like that?

263
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,874
Let's ask.
I can't.

264
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,041
I don't wanna talk to her.

265
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:44,807
If we're gonna find
your birth mother,

266
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:47,508
i have to see
if they know anything
that can help us.

267
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,940
Can't you just, like,
read minds and stuff?

268
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,441
Can't you just
look into the past
and see what happened?

269
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:55,441
No. I'm not
a fortune teller,
and i'm not a psychic.

270
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,974
I have my hands full
as it is, believe me.

271
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,874
Where can i find
your mother?

272
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,707
Hi. I'm looking
for diane shields.

273
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:11,874
Look no further.

274
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,074
You found her.

275
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,707
My name's
melinda gordon.

276
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,374
I'm a friend
of jason's.

277
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,907
Forgive me for being
so blunt,

278
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:26,907
but there's really
no easy way to say this.

279
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,874
Jason's passed away.

280
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,508
Last year. I know.
I'm very sorry.

281
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,807
Has it been a year
already?

282
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:36,141
Shoot. I've got
something in my eye.

283
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,874
Um... excuse me
for a minute, would ya?

284
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,441
I plant trees for him.

285
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:54,441
I planted one
at the high school,
one at the skateboard park,

286
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,441
and 2 in the girls'
soccer field.

287
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:58,441
It's a beautiful
thing to do.

288
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,807
What can i do for you,
melinda?

289
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:06,474
Well, this isn't
such an easy thing
to say either. Um...

290
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,207
i've seen jason.

291
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:11,774
I spoke with him
this morning.

292
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,573
I have an antique
store in grandview,

293
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,940
and somehow i ended up
with jason's furniture.

294
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,874
You've seen jason?

295
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,907
Spirits are sometimes
very attached to their
personal things,

296
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,474
furniture, jewelry.

297
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,774
You're talking about
ghosts.

298
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,740
I can see them.
And help them.

299
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:29,540
Oh, my dear girl.

300
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,540
People say i have
a twisted sense of humor,

301
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:37,074
but <i>this</i> is in incredible
bad taste, even for me.

302
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,441
Who put you up
to this?

303
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,974
I found a picture
of him when he was
a baby

304
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,441
with his real mother,
and...

305
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,640
i'm his real mother.
Who in the hell are you?

306
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,174
Sorry. I didn't
mean it that way.

307
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,441
I really took him home
from the hospital,

308
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,408
and i was really there
when he was crying

309
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:50,907
and when he was laughing,

310
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,007
and i really lived through
his loud music.

311
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,673
And then i really
had to bury him,

312
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,640
and now i have to endure
a very real silence

313
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,640
because the crying
and laughter and music
has stopped.

314
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,640
So don't tell me
i'm not his real mother!

315
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,907
I didn't mean
to offend you.

316
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:09,573
I'm just trying
to find his
biological mother.

317
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,940
Jason wants to know
where she is.

318
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,740
You're telling me...

319
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,707
that from beyond the grave,

320
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:19,807
my son wants to find out
who gave him up?

321
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:22,807
Pretty much, yeah.

322
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:24,874
He needs closure.

323
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,940
My son is dead...

324
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:32,408
and that's hard enough
to live with.

325
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,241
Leave me alone.

326
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,707
You know i missed you,
squeaky.

327
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:41,341
And the girls are always
asking about their
aunt andrea.

328
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,441
Next time,
you have to bring them.

329
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:46,907
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
everybody's schedules
are so crazy, but...

330
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:50,074
so, what are you gonna
do with this place?
You gonna flip it?

331
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:53,408
Well, i could.
I got a waiting list of clients

332
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:55,573
looking for homes
just like this.

333
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,940
Do you like it?

334
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,041
Are you kidding?
I'd love to live
in a place like this.

335
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,807
Good. 'cause i just
made an offer on it
this morning.

336
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,141
You're moving
to grandview.

337
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,974
I wanna open up
a second office.

338
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,573
Part-time, of course.

339
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,207
So i'll live in one
of the bedrooms,

340
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,107
and that leaves the rest
of the house for you.

341
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,207
Oh, but i have
a place.

342
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,740
With all due respect,
squeaky, what you have
is a shoe box.

343
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,141
I like my place.

344
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,840
You just said
you'd love to live here.

345
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,774
It'll be fun,
just like when
we were kids,

346
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,074
spending summers
at the beach house.

347
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,774
Jason?

348
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,341
Are you...

349
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:45,207
are you here?

350
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:05,707
I know it must have
taken a lot for you
to come and see me.

351
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:09,107
He was there with me
in the house.
I can't deny it.

352
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,007
And it was not
just the music, either.

353
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,607
I felt him.

354
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,274
He feels a lot of
anger and confusion.

355
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,774
The last thing
i ever wanted to do
was hurt him.

356
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,174
Why didn't
you just tell jason
he was adopted?

357
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,607
Well...

358
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,274
we meant to...

359
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,408
every mother
and father's day,

360
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:30,107
every birthday, but...

361
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,408
the moment just...
didn't seem right.

362
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:36,174
We were afraid
of how he would react.

363
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:38,441
He was bound
to find out.

364
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:41,107
When i brought him
home from the hospital,

365
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,341
i held on to him
for 2 days.

366
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:47,907
I was terrified
the woman who gave birth
to him would... want him back.

367
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,874
You know who she is,
don't you?

368
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,607
When jason
first found out,

369
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:58,673
i wanted to know
who she was.

370
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,041
I tracked her down.

371
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:03,041
Her name is fran vaughn.

372
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:06,607
[Paper rustles]
This is her address.

373
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:10,640
If it means that much
to jason,

374
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,607
i'm not going to
stand in his way.

375
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:15,041
I'm not going to try
to protect him anymore.

376
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,774
Protect him from what?

377
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,441
From his birth mother.

378
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,774
She's not the little angel
he thinks she is.

379
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,557
I like what you've
done with the yard.

380
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,524
Thought i'd touch up
a few little things

381
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:43,457
so, you know, mitch
could start showing
the place.

382
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:46,057
I'm glad that andrea
invited mitch over.

383
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,524
If he sells this house
for as much as he says,

384
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,691
we'll have quite
the little nest egg
for our future.

385
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:52,457
Yeah, it's a smart move.
It's just...

386
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,924
a lotta work's
gone into this house.

387
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,958
That's the problem.
You've been too busy
working

388
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,924
when you could have
been playing with me.

389
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,757
Oh, uh, you know,
i think i got a little
time right now.

390
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,457
Later, tiger.
I have to catch a train.

391
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:06,657
I'm going to go talk
to jason's birth mother.

392
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:09,257
Wait a minute. Whoa.
She's gonna be shocked.

393
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,257
Shouldn't you call her
first?

394
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:14,257
I have to tell a woman
the baby she gave away
18 years ago

395
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,824
wants to meet her.
Then i have to tell her
that he's dead.

396
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:19,290
Not the kind of
conversation i want to
have over the phone.

397
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,990
Or in person?

398
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:23,757
Yeah, well...
welcome to my world.

399
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,924
That woman looks like
she could be my mother.

400
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,824
Her, too.

401
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,591
Hey! I'm walking here!

402
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:36,791
Oh, do you believe
these people?

403
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,757
What are you doing?
Someone might think
you're talking to yourself.

404
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:42,691
Yeah, and wouldn't care.
Half the people in the city
talk to themselves.

405
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,324
What do you think
she's like?

406
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,958
You're gonna know
in about 10 seconds.
That's her address.

407
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,990
What's the matter?

408
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,958
What if she doesn't
remember me?

409
00:23:55,023 --> 00:23:57,290
Well, i've never given
birth, but from
what i hear,

410
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,123
it's not something
you forget.

411
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,457
What if she doesn't
want to remember me?

412
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,958
Hey, it doesn't matter
what she wants.

413
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,224
You need to meet her.
Come on.

414
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,057
No, i can't.

415
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:12,390
Look, you go on
without me.
I'm not ready.

416
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,290
Yeah?

417
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,858
Is fran vaughn in?

418
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:25,958
I'm here on behalf
of your son.

419
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:28,390
I don't have a son,
just a daughter.

420
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,924
Well, someone took
this photo of you
and your new baby

421
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,157
18 years ago.

422
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,224
How do you know
that's me?

423
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,557
Tattoo, amongst
other reasons.

424
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,424
Look, i can't be
doing this.

425
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,757
Your son's name
is jason shields,

426
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,390
and he'd like to make
contact with you.

427
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:50,491
I was a different person
back then.

428
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,557
I got sent to juvie upstate
because i was young
and stupid.

429
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,390
I had no idea
what i was doing
half the time.

430
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:57,791
Well, you knew
good enough

431
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:00,290
to try to make a better
life for your son.

432
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:04,524
My husband's inside,
and my daughter's
going to be home any minute.

433
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:08,057
They had no idea
i had a kid,
and i don't want them to.

434
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:11,390
They don't have to know.
But jason wants to make
contact with you.

435
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:14,057
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

436
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,591
Your son is dead.

437
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:19,224
What?

438
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,724
He died a year ago.

439
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,390
Jason was allergic
to bees.

440
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,057
He got stung,
and he died.

441
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,724
But... you said
he's trying to make
contact with me?

442
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,424
He is.

443
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,457
What the hell is this?
Who are you?

444
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:34,457
My name's melinda gordon.
I'm from grandview,

445
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:38,524
and have this... gift
to speak with and see...

446
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:39,924
dead people?

447
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,524
Yes. People who have
died and not yet
crossed over.

448
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:46,123
Ha ha ha! Wow.

449
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,224
Hoo! Wow. You really
had me going there
for a minute.

450
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,090
Um... we're not buying
at this house.

451
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:54,457
Please at least
take my card. You can
reach me at my store.

452
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:56,190
Sure, sure, look, uh,

453
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:57,524
you're a nut job, lady.

454
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:00,691
Get off my stoop,
and don't bother me again.

455
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,290
Right.

456
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,891
I thought you liked
living in your apartment.

457
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,390
I do. I love
my apartment.

458
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,891
So much
that you're moving?

459
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,891
Into a house. Hello!
I'm the only person
i know

460
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,891
who has a smaller
place here than they
did in the city.

461
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,324
Ooh, there you are.

462
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,257
There who is?
Be right back.

463
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:35,990
Okey-dokey.

464
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:37,090
What's she like?

465
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:38,591
I'm sure
she's a nice person.

466
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,357
She blow you off?
Pretty much, yeah.

467
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,457
So, melinda.

468
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:46,190
Either i'm running a fever
or i'm starting to see
ghosts myself.

469
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,591
Hey, i'm sybil.
Fran vaughn's daughter.

470
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:54,090
We need to talk.

471
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:56,090
[Laughing] my mother
would have a kitten

472
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,591
if she knew
i was here right now.

473
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,090
You weren't supposed to
hear our conversation.

474
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,691
I'm glad i did.
I have a half-brother,

475
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:03,357
and he's dead.

476
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:07,791
I think it's so cool
that you can talk to ghosts.

477
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,023
How rad is that?

478
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,491
I love this kid.

479
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:12,824
What does my brother
look like?

480
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:16,390
He's handsome.
You guys have
the same eyes.

481
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:18,390
Wait a minute.
He's... he's here?

482
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:22,057
Oh ho ho! My god!

483
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,891
what's it like
to be dead?

484
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,224
It's kinda like
freshman year
all over again.

485
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,457
You're there, but...
nobody pays any
attention to you.

486
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:36,090
He says it's kinda like
freshman year.

487
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,958
Oh, the banality
of being invisible.

488
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,123
Oh, that sucks.

489
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,457
What do you miss most
about being alive?

490
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:50,757
Lots of things.

491
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:53,424
He misses you
and your mother.

492
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,757
He wants to know
what she's like.

493
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:59,624
Oh, um... she's a pain
in my butt.

494
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:03,757
Everything...

495
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,557
has to be done her way
or no way.

496
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:09,190
She always wants to know
what i'm doing,
who i'm with.

497
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,691
But when you need
to talk to her,

498
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,791
she doesn't have time.

499
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,424
I can't stand her.
I just...

500
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:22,023
sometimes i won't even
go inside when i get
home from school.

501
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,524
I'll just hide out
under the stoop
and put on my headphones

502
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,757
and listen to some morrissey
so i don't have to deal.

503
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:30,390
Tell her i'd give her
anything to be in her
shoes.

504
00:28:30,457 --> 00:28:33,724
He wishes he could
trade places
with you.

505
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,224
Oh, um, yeah,
i wish he could, too,
right now.

506
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,990
I'd rather be dead.

507
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,624
Hey, sybil,

508
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:41,757
it's not good to say
stuff like that.

509
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:43,824
It's true.

510
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,924
You don't know
what it's like.

511
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,591
I don't have...
anyone to talk to.

512
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:51,591
You have me.
Tell her she can
talk to me.

513
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,224
He wants you
to talk to him.

514
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,057
Really <i>talk</i> talk?

515
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,757
Go ahead.

516
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,424
I'm in trouble,
and i don't...

517
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,524
really know what to do.

518
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,058
Jim, you asleep?

519
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,357
That depends if
you're coming to bed.

520
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,190
I can't stay.
We have company
downstairs.

521
00:29:30,257 --> 00:29:31,424
Living or dead?

522
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,223
One of each.

523
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,190
Oh, hey,
mitch called.

524
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:37,190
He might have a buyer
for the house,

525
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:39,891
and he wants to know
if he can show it
next weekend.

526
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:41,223
You ok with that?

527
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,490
So soon?

528
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:44,390
Well, yeah. I told him
you wanted to move out.

529
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:47,557
Me? You're the one
that said we should
try and flip it.

530
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:49,557
Only because you said
you were interested,
you know?

531
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,557
Now that i know
you're not happy...

532
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,058
not happy?

533
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,058
Yeah, you're always
tired of me trying
to fix things up.

534
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:57,991
Well, yeah, i am,
but that doesn't mean
i wanna move.

535
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,857
I love that the doors
are crooked and the
bannister's broken

536
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,124
and the windows
won't stay up.

537
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,590
I know that we can
make a lot of money
if we flip it...

538
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:08,924
just because we could
doesn't mean we should.

539
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,657
Ok. I don't care
about the money.

540
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:12,190
This is our home.

541
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:15,891
I agree. But then
why are we trying
to sell it?

542
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:17,891
Because we're so
stupid in love

543
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,024
that we'd do anything
to make each other happy.

544
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:23,824
This is like
an o. Henry story
told by donald trump.

545
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:26,857
Does that mean that you...

546
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,557
will tell mitch
that we don't want
to sell?

547
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:32,223
No. It means i'll get
andrea to tell him for you.

548
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,091
Oh... l...

549
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:35,824
sleep.

550
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:38,957
I don't know
if you can hear me.

551
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:42,058
But i just... i don't
know what i'm doing.

552
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:46,457
I don't want to mess
this up any more than
i already have.

553
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:47,824
She's so young.

554
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,791
One year older
than your mother
when she had you.

555
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:52,223
Jason, i'm so scared.

556
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,824
where's my daughter?

557
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,223
Living room.

558
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:06,524
Come on, syb.
Get your things.
We're going.

559
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,424
Melinda: You know,
it's late.

560
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,158
Why don't you sit
for a minute?

561
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:12,158
I'll make you
some coffee
for the drive back.

562
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:14,824
Thanks for letting me know
that she's here,
but we need to go.

563
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:22,290
If you've got
something to say,
say it now.

564
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:24,091
Mom.

565
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,158
I'm pregnant.

566
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,824
Say something.

567
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:32,691
Mom, talk to me.

568
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,457
Get in the car.

569
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:37,024
No. Not until
you talk to me.

570
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:40,390
I have been trying
to talk to you about this
for the last 2 months.

571
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:43,857
You've been pregnant
for 2 months and you
didn't tell me?

572
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:45,824
You didn't tell me about
your pregnancy either.

573
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,557
It was a mistake,
sybil. A terrible
mistake.

574
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:54,257
Mom, jason can hear you,
ok? You're hurting
his feelings.

575
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:56,390
Stop it!
There's no jason.

576
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,490
Listen to me, sybil.

577
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:01,557
Giving up that baby
was the best thing
i could have done.

578
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:06,124
When i got pregnant,
i knew i had to walk
away from that baby.

579
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:10,058
But it forced me
to grow up.

580
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:13,257
I finished high school.
I met your father.

581
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:15,158
I had you.

582
00:32:15,223 --> 00:32:17,158
And that's what
you'll do, too.

583
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:20,058
You'll put this baby
up for adoption,

584
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:22,158
and everything will be
fine again, ok?

585
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:23,390
Now, come on.
Let's go home.

586
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:24,557
No!

587
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:33,857
Um, it's getting late.
Maybe she should
just stay here.

588
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:36,124
You, too, if you want.

589
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,424
What's the point?
She'll still be
pregnant in the morning.

590
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,357
I have to deal with
this now.

591
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:45,590
And frankly,
none of this is any
of your business.

592
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:48,957
But i know someone.

593
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:52,657
Someone she should meet,
someone who knows a lot
about adoption.

594
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,190
Fine.

595
00:32:58,257 --> 00:33:00,290
One night.

596
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:07,058
Diane:
Come on in.

597
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:10,657
I'll be right out.

598
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,824
I don't understand
why we're here.

599
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,124
If you still want to
leave in 10 minutes,

600
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,124
i'll take you back
to your car.

601
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,724
Come on, sybil.

602
00:33:57,024 --> 00:33:58,724
Diane: Hello.

603
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:02,290
My name is diane.

604
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,323
I raised your son.

605
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,357
I owe you an apology.

606
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:09,957
I never told him
he was adopted.

607
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,323
But he found out,
and he wanted
to meet you.

608
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,624
I wouldn't let him.

609
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:18,657
That's what
we argued about
the day he died.

610
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,924
His name was jason.

611
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,991
He was a wonderful
kid, fran.

612
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:31,724
He was smart
and funny,

613
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,824
and he cared
about people.

614
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:37,223
It's the one thing
you can't teach,
isn't it?

615
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:44,524
And he was kind...

616
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,524
and he was gentle,
and you would have
been proud of him.

617
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,091
Please stop now.

618
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:55,757
Mom, please talk to me.

619
00:34:55,824 --> 00:35:00,290
Fran, jason's here.
He wants to talk to you.

620
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:06,357
I didn't believe it
either, fran...

621
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:08,657
but it's true.

622
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:11,457
Jason's here.

623
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:14,957
And melinda can talk
to him for us.

624
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,791
Ok. That's it.

625
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,957
Come on, syb.

626
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,657
Sybil, right now!

627
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,224
he looks just like
his father.

628
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,291
Why is it that families
keep so many secrets
from each other?

629
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:18,458
Well, because family's
so important.

630
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,458
It's the hardest love
to lose, you know?

631
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,124
And that's why
it's so difficult

632
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:23,957
to tell your family
how you really feel.

633
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:27,291
And your friends.
Jim and i decided we don't
want to flip our house,

634
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:29,224
and we need you
to tell him.

635
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,623
Absolutely.

636
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,458
Right after i work up
the courage

637
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,458
to tell him i'm staying
in my shoe box
of an apartment.

638
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,590
Whoa! Why the change
of heart?

639
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:39,924
I've changed.
I'm not squeaky
anymore.

640
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,757
You know, i wasn't
lovin' squeaky.

641
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,690
I have a really hard
time being myself
around my brother.

642
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:46,690
You'll always be
his little sister.

643
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:48,790
You're just not
a little girl anymore.

644
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:51,191
Speaking of not being
a little girl
anymore...

645
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:00,391
so how do i do this?

646
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,557
Do i look at you?

647
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:05,824
You can. Or you can
just look at the picture.

648
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,690
Just say what's
in your heart.

649
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:10,291
She looks so sad.

650
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,623
Yeah. This is hard
for her.

651
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,091
He's here?

652
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:21,857
Jason...

653
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:24,857
when i was
at your house

654
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:26,957
and i saw those
pictures

655
00:37:27,024 --> 00:37:29,957
and i heard the way
diane talked
about you,

656
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,291
i was...

657
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,557
i am so proud.

658
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:39,157
I know i don't have
a right to feel that way,

659
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,057
but... i am.

660
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:45,890
And i'm so sorry for me

661
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,991
that i didn't get
to know you.

662
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,490
You may not believe
this,

663
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,557
but there's always been
this empty place in me,

664
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:54,724
and now that i've seen
how you grew up

665
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,424
and where...

666
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,523
and how much
you're loved,

667
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,690
it feels
a little less empty.

668
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:05,091
What's gonna happen
to sybil's baby?

669
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,790
He wants to know
what's gonna happen
with the baby.

670
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:12,590
I don't know.
We have a lot...

671
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,091
to work out.

672
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:19,458
But whatever sybil...
whatever your sister
decides,

673
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:21,623
we will be a part
of this baby's life.

674
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:26,957
And the baby's
gonna know about
uncle jason.

675
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:29,523
And diane.

676
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,024
Can he hear us?

677
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:35,124
Yeah, he can.

678
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:37,257
He's smiling.

679
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:42,523
He has a lot of questions
for you.

680
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,124
I thought i did,

681
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:47,991
but there's only
one thing i really
need to know.

682
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:54,224
Did you ever think
about me?

683
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,191
Did you ever say a prayer
for me at thanksgiving

684
00:38:57,257 --> 00:39:00,391
or wonder what kind
of presents i was
getting at christmas?

685
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,991
Did you even remember
my birthday?

686
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:06,991
Do you love me, mom?

687
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:10,757
Uh, he wants to know...

688
00:39:10,824 --> 00:39:12,257
no, wait. Um...

689
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:14,157
don't ask.

690
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:19,391
I don't want to know
if the answer's no.

691
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,857
What is it?

692
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:25,523
Uh, this is hard
for me. Um...

693
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,590
he wants to ask you
something, but he
doesn't know how.

694
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,790
Tell him... he can
ask me anything.

695
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,523
He's my son.
I love him.

696
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:48,358
He would love to hear you
say that again.

697
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,857
He's my son.

698
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:53,057
I love him.

699
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:02,157
Give them the picture?

700
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:03,890
Oh, right.

701
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,623
That's your brother.

702
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:20,991
It's ok, baby.

703
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:34,890
I still have one more
person to see.

704
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:40,991
He wants you to know

705
00:40:41,057 --> 00:40:44,024
that he was
so hurt and angry
over being adopted

706
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:48,590
that he took it out
on the one person
who was always there for him.

707
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:52,523
All you ever tried to do
was protect me
and love me.

708
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,790
No matter how hard
i tried to push you
away,

709
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:57,458
you never
gave up on me.

710
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:00,057
He feels lucky
to have been your son.

711
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,757
I was the lucky one.

712
00:41:02,824 --> 00:41:06,057
For 17 years,

713
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,224
you made my life shine.

714
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,257
You were
the greatest gift.

715
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:13,257
He's sorry
that he got mad

716
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:15,358
and that it ended
that way.

717
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:18,224
But it's not ended.

718
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,890
And it never will be.

719
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:22,024
I will always
be with you.

720
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:25,890
And you will always
be with me.

721
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:31,623
What's that light?

722
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,490
That light's for you.
If you're ready.

723
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,224
I'm ready.

724
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:41,458
Bye, mom.

725
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,458
He's crossed over.

726
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:56,657
Good boy.

727
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:03,257
Shoot.

728
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,458
I've got something
in my eye again.

729
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,358
I'll walk with you.
