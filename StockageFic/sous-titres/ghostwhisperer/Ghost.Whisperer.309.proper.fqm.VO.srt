1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,700
You know. Don't even call
this a short walk.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,500
We've been going for two miles,
and that's in a forced march.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
All right, when we get to the base camp,
I'll give you a nice massage.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Hey, how nice is nice?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,400
How long have we been married?
And you got to ask.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,300
What's someone doing in our tent?

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
Who's that?

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
I don't know.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
Wait a minute. Is she a...

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
No, she's not a ghost. She's real.
She's a young girl.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,200
- But doesn't she look kind of-
- Yeah. Something's not right.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,900
There's not another campsite
for miles.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,300
Oh, we scared her.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
No, wait!

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,900
Wait a minute!

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Wait!

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,000
Look, we don't want to hurt you!
We just want to help!

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,100
Wait! Don't get-

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,000
It's all right.
No, take it easy, ok?

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,800
Let me see your leg.
I'm a paramedic.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,100
I can help you.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,500
Let me just look at your leg,
all right?

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,300
It's nothing.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,600
It just needs to be cleaned
and dressed.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,700
Hey, uh, tell us your name.

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,000
You must be pretty scared, huh?
Out here in these woods all alone.

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,300
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,300
You come back with us
to our camp, ok?

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Get warm, have a good meal.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
I'll split this with you.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
Ok, you can have
the whole thing.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
It's ok.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,400
It wasn't very deep at all.
It should heal quickly.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,300
You know,
we really want to help you, 

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,600
but you have to tell us
a few things first, like...

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,600
what's your name?

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,800
Where are your parents?

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Are you lost?

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,900
Maybe if we talk to child services back in town,
they could give us some information-

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,200
Becca.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,200
- Your name's Becca?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,900
Ok.

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,900
Becca, so...

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,900
what are you doing here?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Are you hiding from something?

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
I ran away.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,100
What did you run away from?

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,500
Your parents?

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,500
I don't have any parents.

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
They're dead.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Do you live in a foster home?

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,800
How long have you been out here?

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,400
I dont know. Two or three weeks.

54
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,200
We need to find out
where that foster home was

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
so that we can let them
know you're all right.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,500
Please. I don't want to go back there.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,900
Well, we're going to do the
best we can to keep you safe, 

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but we need to let the
police know that we found you.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,500
Don't make me go back there.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm begging you.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, we don't get
any cell service out here, 

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
and if we try to hike to the car,
it would be dark before we get there, so...

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,600
Ok.

65
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,800
You're going to stay here with us.

66
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,800
We'll keep you safe.

67
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
I won't let you leave me.

68
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
What's going on?

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,100
What's happening to me?

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,500
Hey, look at me.
There's nothing here.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
You're all right.

72
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,400
She's mine.

73
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,600
Becca, I know that you
don't really feel safe, 

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
but trust me, you are.

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,100
I think the best thing for you is
just to get a good night's sleep.

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,900
I can't.

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Well, then, let's talk.

78
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,200
Do I have to?

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
I know that this is
going to sound strange...

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
but have you lost any
friends or family lately?

81
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,600
Why?

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm just trying to understand
why you're out here.

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,000
They hurt me. I left.

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,400
I'm not going back.

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
Ok.

86
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
Why these woods?

87
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
How have you been living out
here all this time by yourself?

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm tired.

89
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
I'm going to go back to sleep.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,100
Wait. Um, can you hang with me for a
minute, just till I fall back asleep?

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Of course I will.

92
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,400
Hey, I didn't know you were so
good with teenage hard cases.

93
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,300
Well, it helps that I used to be one.

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
You? Come on.

95
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Yeah. You remember that age.

96
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,300
You're always mad at your parents
'cause they didn't understand who you were.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,600
Well, take all that, add ghosts, and stir.

98
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,200
Do you think that's
what happened to Becca?

99
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Or maybe she was abused?

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,300
I don't know.

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
What did the ghost say about her?

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,600
He just said "she's mine. "

103
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,100
Well, maybe he could be a friend
or a brother who was also abused.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,400
Could be.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,500
Well, I guess we'll find out
when we know where she belongs.

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,200
What if we're just taking her right
back to the thing she's running from?

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Don't really have a choice.

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
Honey.

109
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
No. Wake up.

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Becca's gone.

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
What?

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
I left this in my backpack.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,700
She must have found it in the tent.

114
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,000
Ok. So where could she have gone?

115
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
I don't know.
Wherever she went, she's staying, 

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
'cause she took most of the food.

117
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,700
Oh, no.

118
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,600
What?

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
My car keys.

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,600
What?

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Becca

122
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Just watch out.
She might get some traction.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Becca!

124
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Becca, stop it!

125
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,300
I'll try get this side

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
You can't go. I need you!

127
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,500
I won't let you go!

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Go away!

129
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,700
Leave her alone!

130
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,800
Get out of the
car- right now.

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,100
Get out of the car.

132
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,000
You could have killed yourself.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
What were you thinking?

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
You saw him, too.

135
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
You can see ghosts.

136
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,600
So, we'll go downtown later and see if
we can get some things that fit better.

137
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,900
So you're not going to
call the police or whoever?

138
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,300
Eventually, but if you need
some more time, for now...

139
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
do you need some help with that?

140
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,700
I know how to use a brush.

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,000
You know, when my grandma first
told me that she could see ghosts, 

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
I should have said, "thank god.

143
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
You know, there's finally
someone else like me. "

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
All I could say was,
"what is wrong with my grandma?"

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,600
It might be something
you have to get used to.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
So, you said that you
were hurt by people.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Mostly with words?

148
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Yeah, mostly.

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,300
Who?

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
My foster parents.

151
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,800
What happened to your real parents?

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,600
They died in a car crash.

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
How old were you when they died?

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,900
I guess I was, like, 5 or 6.

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,300
How old were you when
you started seeing ghosts?

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,700
I don't remember ever not seeing them.

157
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
What did you say to your
parents after they died?

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,000
After they died?

159
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,500
I never saw them.

160
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Your parents didn't die, did they?

161
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,500
And you don't have foster parents.

162
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,200
You made it all up.

163
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,500
Look, you can tell me the truth.

164
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
If you do, I can help you.

165
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,900
And if you don't, then you're going to
go back home, and nothing's going to be-

166
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,100
they think I'm sick.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,600
They take me to the doctors and
they try to make me take pills.

168
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Ok. So then, we'll make them understand.

169
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
It won't work.

170
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,200
Well, you can't live in the woods
forever, and you don't have to.

171
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,800
Know how to make the ghosts go away?

172
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
I know something better.

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,700
Yeah, mom. I'm fine. I promise.

174
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,900
I don't know. Just, like, some
cuts and stuff, 

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,800
but he's, like, an ambulance guy,
and he says I'm fine. So...

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Yeah, I know.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,300
They'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,100
They live in a small town
outside St. Louis.

180
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, what happens now?

181
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Well, they just talked
to the Grandview police, 

182
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
who said nice things
about us, thank goodness, 

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
so I guess she'll stay
here until they get here.

184
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,500
How did she get that far from home?

185
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,800
'Cause she's a smart girl.

186
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,100
She took a bus 5 or 6 days and
then got off here in Grandview.

187
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
Ok. And how
about this-

188
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
another person who sees
ghosts chooses Grandview.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Why does that keep happening?

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I don't know, but I don't
have time to think about it.

191
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,300
Right, 'cause you got
a ghost to cross over.

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,100
No. She does.

193
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,300
I have 24 hours to teach
that girl everything I know.

194
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Has he been in touch with you
since you left home?

195
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,500
No, I met him in the woods.

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,400
But the thing to remember is that
they're more scared and confused than you.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
They're stuck here, for some reason, and
most of the time, they don't even know why.

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,100
and after you've figured out
why they've stayed earthbound, 

199
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,100
you can help them,
take care of them.

200
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,000
And they can cross over.

201
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,800
Cross over?

202
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Yeah. Into the light.

203
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
So, how do you know
it's a better place?

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
You ever been there?

205
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,500
No, but I've felt it.

206
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,300
There's peace there, and knowing that I
gave them that, there's nothing better.

207
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,200
Hey. You must be Becca.

208
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm delia.

209
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,600
It's ok, honey.
I won't bite.

210
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,200
I hear that you are
a very special girl.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
Uh, you know what? There's some really
cool vintage dresses over there.

212
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,500
Why don't you take a look?

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Melinda, you know that I believe
that you do amazing things.

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I have seen you change
people's lives again and again.

215
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
- But this-
- what?

216
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Do you really think the
best way to help this girl-

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Is to give her a crash
course in being you?

218
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
Delia, she's not just running
away from her parents.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,800
She's running away from ghosts.

220
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,900
Can't you teach her
how not to be afraid?

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
I can't stop her from seeing them, 

222
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,400
which means that I can't stop them
from going to her with their problems.

223
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Have you ever tried walking around with
a crowd of dead people following you?

224
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,200
It's not fun.

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
Didn't you say your mom had
this gift, and she lived with it?

226
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Trust me,
that is not a good argument.

227
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Melinda?

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Yeah. I'll be right there.

229
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,500
Look, I had my grandmother, ok?

230
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,400
Becca has no one but
parents who don't understand.

231
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
I have to teach her
how to cross them over.

232
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm not going to let her
turn out like Gabriel, 

233
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
overmedicated and institutionalized.

234
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,400
Becca!

235
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,300
Look, I'm sorry, ok?

236
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
I know that this is hard.

237
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
You don't have to apologize.

238
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,400
I should be used to seeing them.

239
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
You have to stop running
away from them, 

240
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,900
or else they're going
to keep finding you.

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
You think I don't know that?

242
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,900
Look, that's why you
have to face them, ok?

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
You just have to find
out what they need.

244
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
It will make them stop.

245
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,600
Ok. I'll try.

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,300
Let's start with his name.

247
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,900
Did he give you that?

248
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,800
I think it's Daniel.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,500
Has he said anything about how he died?

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Um, I think he was in
some kind of accident.

251
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
He said there were bodies around.

252
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
Was there a fire? 'Cause he
looked like he'd been burned.

253
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,300
Honestly, I try not to look.

254
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
He talked about that, too.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,700
Ok. I see it a little bit, but
for her to be your mini-me, 

256
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
her hair would have
to be a lot different.

257
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,600
This is my friend Rick Payne.

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
He's a professor.
He's also-

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
oh, my gosh! Those eyes!

260
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Look at those eyes with that
"don't even try lying to me, 

261
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
'cause I can literally see
right through you" look!

262
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,100
- A little strange?
- Yes.

263
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,200
The resemblance is uncanny.

264
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Ok. The ghost.

265
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
He's a boy, about Becca's age.
His name is Daniel.

266
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
There was an accident in the woods.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,700
There were lots of bodies
around, so I'm thinking...

268
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,000
last year plane crash.

269
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,600
Yeah, he probably wandered off, got
separated from the rest of the passengers.

270
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,300
Yeah. The woods are not
far from the crash site.

271
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,500
Well, that would explain the bodies.

272
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
And the burns on his face.

273
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,000
Ok. Well, I'll check the manifest.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
I'll see if his name turns up.

275
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
What about the voices?

276
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,700
What voices?

277
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
In your basement.

278
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,900
Didn't you hear them?

279
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,000
No, not really.

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,100
Wait a minute. You can hear
voices that Melinda can't?

281
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,900
That would make her
more powerful than you.

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,300
No. That's just how it works.

283
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,600
In the beginning, you get everything, 

284
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,500
you get voices, ghost energy, all of it.

285
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
And then, eventually, you learn to tune
certain things out so you can function.

286
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Whatever she's hearing, it's
probably coming from the tunnels.

287
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
Do you still have that giant
hole in the wall in your basement?

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
What tunnels?

289
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh, you don't want to
know about the tunnels.

290
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,500
Well, why not? What's under there?

291
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
What's under there? More
like who's under there.

292
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,200
More accurately, who isn't under there.

293
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
The amount of
trapped souls-

294
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,300
ok. You know what?

295
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,800
Maybe she should focus on the ghost that's
haunting her right now, don't you think?

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,100
Yeah, ok-yes.
I do.

297
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,100
What's my job again?

298
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Check the plane manifest.

299
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,900
Ok.

300
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,300
You and I have a field trip to go on.

301
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
come on, Let's go find Daniel.

302
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,300
Why?

303
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Because this is probably
near where he died.

304
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
It will help him remember what happened.

305
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
But why look for him at all?

306
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,100
I mean, he hasn't bugged me
in hours. Maybe he's finished.

307
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,400
No, he's not finished
until he crosses over-

308
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,000
until we help him cross over.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,900
How many times did I tell you?

310
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,700
I don't like being left behind!

311
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,300
Becca, talk to him.

312
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,300
Find out what he needs.

313
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,700
Please, don't go.

314
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,900
Ask him what's keeping him here.

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,200
Why won't you just leave me alone?

316
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,500
They left me here.

317
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
They never said a word!

318
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Were they punishing me?

319
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,100
What was I supposed to think?

320
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,600
Who? Daniel, who left you here?

321
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Who is she, anyway?

322
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,300
I don't like her.

323
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Becca, find out what's keeping him here.

324
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,700
I don't care.

325
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,700
I hate him! I want him to go away!

326
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,700
I'm burning

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
Hey, what do you see?

328
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
Daniel, talk to me, all right?

329
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,600
I want to help you.
She wants to help you!

330
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,500
She doesn't want to help me!

331
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Why should I help her?

332
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,600
Well, then, stop hurting her, all right?

333
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,100
Let her go.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Hey.

335
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,800
What happened?

336
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
I was on fire!

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,300
It was horrible.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Look, I know how painful this is, ok?

339
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,000
But look at me.

340
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm right here. We're ok.

341
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,400
There's a reason that he
told you all of that. Ok?

342
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
He was trying to tell
you what happened to him, 

343
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,300
and with that, you can cross him over.

344
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
I don't care.

345
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,100
Yes, you do.

346
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,000
You want to help him and yourself.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,400
I don't care about
Daniel or any of them!

348
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,000
You can't give up.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Yes, I can!

350
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm done.

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,100
I'm never going to do that again.

352
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Still not hungry?

353
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
You know, your parents are
going to be here tomorrow, 

354
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
so we don't really have much time.

355
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,200
Has a ghost ever done
anything like this to you?

356
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,000
I've seen weird things before.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,900
No one's ever tried to hurt me.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,300
I know how awful this is.

359
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
But the vision, it's...

360
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,400
sometimes the only way they can
tell you that they need your help.

361
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,100
But why should I help Daniel when
all he tries to do is scare me?

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Look... I know that this is not fair.

363
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,700
Most kids don't have to think about
death until they're much older.

364
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
But you and me?

365
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,700
Our lives are different.

366
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
You want a reason why
you should help Daniel?

367
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,900
One is because if you don't,
he'll never leave you alone.

368
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,700
But the real reason is because you can.

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,700
Ok.

370
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
But how?

371
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,500
The vision.

372
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,900
Tell me everything you saw.

373
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,700
There were bodies on the ground.

374
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
I'm right here.

375
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,700
I was on fire.

376
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
You mean Daniel was.

377
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,000
At first, his skin hurt really bad.

378
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,800
Then, he couldn't feel anything.

379
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,800
There was metal burning.

380
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
And tires.

381
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
And there were cars.

382
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,800
They looked like tinfoil
somebody punched really hard.

383
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
One of them was on fire.

384
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,200
I think that one was Daniel's.

385
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,800
Can you see a license plate number?

386
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,700
There were
letters. M-I-Y...

387
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,600
the number 8.

388
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Hey...

389
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,900
Becca.

390
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,800
No. You did great.

391
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,500
You know what? Let's get out of here.

392
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
What do you think?

393
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,800
Let's go...

394
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,900
walk amongst the living
for a little while.

395
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,800
Can I just be alone?

396
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,000
Sure.

397
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
Hey, Melinda?

398
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,800
Were you ever scared?

399
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
It's never been easy.

400
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,800
But I had someone
who... made me feel brave.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
I hope I can do that same thing for you.

402
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,200
Hey.

403
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,000
How'd the open house
for the new listing go?

404
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Oh, people loved the cookies, but
not bites on the house.

405
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,100
I brought leftovers.

406
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,700
Thanks for covering.

407
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,000
Where's Becca?

408
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
She's at home resting.

409
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,300
Jim's there.

410
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
How's she doing?

411
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
We made some progress.

412
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,800
I think I know who the
little boy in the woods is.

413
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,600
He's looking for his parents.

414
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,900
2 cars hit head-on,
causing a pile-up.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,100
There were 5 fatalities,
including a family, 

416
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,500
Becca had seen their
license plate in a vision, 

417
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,700
a mother, father, and a 13-year-old boy
named Daniel Asher.

418
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,400
That's terrible.

419
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,500
Daniel died at the scene.

420
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
And his parents died
later at the hospital.

421
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,500
You know, maybe they just saw
the light and went right into it.

422
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
And he's just been
waiting there ever since?

423
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
He thinks they're still alive?

424
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm not sure.

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,000
But he needs to know that they've
gone, and he should join them.

426
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,300
With any luck, Becca will be
able to convince him of that.

427
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
It would really help them both.

428
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,600
You know what? I really have to go.

429
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
Hey.

430
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
You're back!

431
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
That's so great.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
Um, you could come meet my parents.

433
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,600
So, I was telling them all
about how you helped me.

434
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,000
Now, I admit that I was just
pretending to see ghosts, 

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,300
just like you did when you
were my age for attention.

436
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,600
Melinda. I'm Joan Cahill,
Becca's mom.

437
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't even know what to say.

438
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,900
Honestly, I don't, either.

439
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,800
Honey, the Cahills were able
to get an earlier flight.

440
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,300
Um, this is Tony.

441
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,600
Tony, this is my wife Melinda.

442
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,500
Thank you for saving our daughter-
our whole family, actually.

443
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Well, I don't know if I really helped.

444
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,800
You did.

445
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Look, I don't know how
you got through to her, 

446
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,700
but these things that she was
imagining, we didn't know what to do.

447
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,500
Frankly, I felt like we'd lost
her long before she ran away.

448
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,000
But... you're back now.
Right, sweetheart?

449
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,900
Things are going to be a-ok.

450
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah. A-ok, again.

451
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
Thanks for not busting me.

452
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,900
So, what are you going to do now?

453
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Every time you see a
ghost, just ignore it?

454
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,900
Kind of already tried that.

455
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,000
- Yeah, but it will be easier now.
- How?

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,900
'Cause I know it's not my fault.

457
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,600
Before, I thought I had
something bad in me.

458
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I was making them come
to me and nobody else.

459
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,500
They come to you
because you can see them.

460
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
And because they need your help.

461
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Look, this is who you really are.

462
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
It's who we both are.

463
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
No.

464
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm not brave enough.

465
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,900
You comfortable, sweetie?

466
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,300
You can't hear a word
I'm saying, can you?

467
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
I could sleep for about
100 years, you know?

468
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Should we try to get a
later flight tomorrow?

469
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,800
No. Let's get home.

470
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,900
Thank god, we can throw these away now.

471
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,900
What were we doing, making
her take these?

472
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,700
Joan, wait...

473
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,800
she wasn't hallucinating.

474
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,900
She never actually saw anything.

475
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,800
I know. I hope it's
over, but just in case...

476
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,700
it's not just about Becca.

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,100
It's about that little boy in the woods
waiting on parents that will never come back.

478
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,800
Yeah, but Becca knows
about the light now.

479
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,200
So maybe she's able to help him.

480
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
And he knows about you.

481
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,600
He can come to you.

482
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,500
And what about the ghost
that haunts her after that?

483
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,200
And then, the one after that?

484
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,300
Honey, no one could have
helped her more than you did.

485
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,500
Yeah.

486
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,300
That's what kills me.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,900
No. Get away from them.

488
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,100
I'd give anything just to
be with my parents again.

489
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,800
Oh! No, no. Why can't
you just leave me alone?

490
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
Because then I'd be alone, too.

491
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
How'd you like it if I left
you in the dark in those woods?

492
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,800
I begged you to.

493
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,400
But you didn't mean it.

494
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,500
Why can't you just be my friend?

495
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,900
Because you're dead!

496
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,200
You'd be dead, too, if I didn't
help you find food and water.

497
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
I looked out for you.

498
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Every night, I was there,
and you knew it.

499
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,800
Ok. Fine.
You watched over me. Thanks.

500
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Now, go, please.

501
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm still protecting you.

502
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,800
What's that supposed to mean?

503
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,500
Someone knows about you
and your friend. That lady.

504
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
- He found me, and he'll find you, too.
- Who?

505
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm not sure.

506
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,000
He wanted me to come
with him, but I wouldn't.

507
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,500
He said he knows where
they're keeping my parents.

508
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,100
I don't understand.

509
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,700
Melinda knows things.
You should go to her.

510
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,800
No. She just wants to send me away
so I'll never see my parents again.

511
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,400
Becca...

512
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
please.

513
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,100
You have to help me. only you hear voices

514
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,500
Why don't you let me finish that up, huh?

515
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Go on up.

516
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,100
that's weird

517
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
- Hey.
- We are so sorry to bother you.

518
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Is Becca here?

519
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
Please tell us she's here.

520
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
No, she's not.

521
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,200
Oh, god.

522
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,800
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

523
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,200
Um, we were tired. We fell asleep.

524
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,900
Probably 3 hours ago.

525
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
We already called the police.

526
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I woke up freezing.

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It always seemed so cold
right before I hear her scream.

528
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,400
Becca gets night terrors.

529
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,600
And this time, she didn't call out.
She was just gone.

530
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,800
Becca say anything?
Was she talking to anyone?

531
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,900
I heard her whisper something.

532
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,800
She went into the bathroom.

533
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
She does that sometimes when
she's trying to hide from us.

534
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,300
Yeah, but does she say anything?

535
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,600
I buried my head in the pillow.
I couldn't listen.

536
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,700
Ok. She was probably talking to Daniel.

537
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,100
And if she went with him, then
she's trying to cross him.

538
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,100
I'm sorry. Cross him?

539
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Just take them to the police, all right?

540
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
- I'm going to go to the woods.
- You got it.

541
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,000
Excuse me. What the hell is going on?

542
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You know what? I'm really sorry
to have to throw this at you, 

543
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,800
but your daughter's been
trying to tell you for years.

544
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,400
You've tried pills.
You've tried doctors.

545
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
The only thing you 2 never
tried was believing her.

546
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,700
Your daughter sees ghosts, ok?

547
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,300
And I know that because I see them, too.

548
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Look, you both have to understand
that my wife has lived her entire life

549
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,500
having people tell her she's crazy.

550
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,000
And maybe right now,
you think she is, too.

551
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,000
But I'll tell you, she's the only chance
you have of getting your daughter back.

552
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
You can hear it too, right?

553
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,700
This is where Melinda
said the trapped souls are.

554
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
It sounds like they're hurting.

555
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,100
That's why we have to hurry.

556
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Hello?

557
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,800
This is guardian-safe.

558
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,400
There's been an alarm activation
at your place of business.

559
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
The tunnels.

561
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,100
Sorry, ma'am, I didn't hear you.

562
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

563
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
No, no, no. It's my husband.

564
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,300
Sometimes he forgets
how the alarm works.

565
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

566
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
What? What?

567
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
- What?
- Hey.

568
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,600
In the square this afternoon, when
you told Becca about the tunnels, 

569
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,100
didn't you tell her that she could
get to them through the basement?

570
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
Oh, gee whiz. You know, I really
thought there was going to be a

571
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,000
"sorry I woke you up, professor"
mixed in there.

572
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
She's in trouble, ok?

573
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,100
She ran away from her parents after
they heard her talking to someone.

574
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Was it the ghost Daniel?

575
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
No, room service.

576
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,700
Well, we know she heard us talking about
the hole in the wall in your basement.

577
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,200
But why would they go into the tunnels?

578
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
Because you told her that there
were spirits trapped there.

579
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,200
Maybe she and Daniel think it's
the best way to get to his parents.

580
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,000
And by the way, the store
alarm just went off.

581
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,600
- Oh, boy. Sounds like Daniel's up to his old tricks again.
- What?

582
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,400
Remember, you asked me to
read up on the accident?

583
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,700
Well, the post mortem report says
that that kid's blood alcohol level

584
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,900
was a few notches above schnockered.

585
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
So, he was drunk?

586
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Very.

587
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I think your parents are down there.

588
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,800
Look, if you're scared, you
don't have to do this.

589
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
You can just go.

590
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,700
I'll go alone.

591
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,000
You could get hurt.

592
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
I won't leave you.

593
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,400
We can do this.

594
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,600
Becca, you here?

595
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,900
Becca?

596
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
Becca?

597
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,300
Daniel?

598
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
Becca?

599
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Becca!

600
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Becca?

601
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,900
Daniel?

602
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Becca?

603
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,100
mom, dad? are you here?

604
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,600
She's here, another one.

605
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,600
mom? dad?

606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Are those your parents?

607
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,400
You. Is it over?

608
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
Can I go now?

609
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,800
Who are you?

610
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,100
He has a gun.

611
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,200
Why did you all come here?

612
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,800
How did you find this place?

613
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,500
It still hurts.

614
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,200
We were promised.

615
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
You said...

616
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,200
he promised.

617
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,100
Becca, I'm scared.

618
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,400
Who are all these people?

619
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,400
Melinda, see?

620
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,000
Just a few stitches
and you're all better.

621
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,200
And we can stop somewhere
special on the way home.

622
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,200
oh, Melinda

623
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
It's ok, honey.

624
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,600
They're just upset.

625
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,500
Erwe we supposed to help.

626
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,900
I can't understand them.

627
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,400
There's too many voices.

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
I know.

629
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,400
But if you try, you can
hear what's important, 

630
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,900
the one soul that we need
to hear most at that moment.

631
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,400
All we have to do is
listen with our hearts.

632
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
Where is he?

633
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,000
I can't find him!

634
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Sweet girl, can you help me?

635
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
I need to find my husband.

636
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,200
Daniel? I'm here.

637
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
I'm here. It's ok.

638
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
No, it's not.

639
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,600
We can't find my parents.

640
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,900
I know.

641
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
I did.

642
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I listened for them.

643
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Then, I heard them calling for you.

644
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,100
- Daniel? Honey
- Daniel? Where is he?

645
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Daniel!

646
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
I've been waiting for you for so long.

647
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,900
It's ok.

648
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
You can go to them.

649
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,900
Daniel, what's wrong?

650
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,000
Daniel. Come.

651
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,100
You said they'd never leave you.

652
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,300
But you didn't believe that, did you?

653
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,600
Not after what happened that
night before the accident.

654
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,300
It's my fault.

655
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,800
We never would have been in
that car if I didn't screw up.

656
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,300
My friend levI's
parents were out of town.

657
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,800
We all said we were sleeping
at someone else's house.

658
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,800
And we snuck into their liquor cabinet.

659
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,100
We went outside and started
taking out some mailboxes.

660
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,100
Someone called the police.

661
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,400
And then they called us.

662
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,700
At 2 a.m., We're picking our
13-year-old up from the police station.

663
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,500
Blaming ourselves, each other.

664
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,100
Arguing over who was supposed
to follow up with levI's parents, 

665
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,200
still thinking every
mistake could be avoided.

666
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,800
If I hadn't done that, if you
weren't so tired and worried-

667
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,900
Daniel! That car swerved into our lane.

668
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Dad!

669
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,500
It wasn't your fault.

670
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,300
And even if it was, we
would never leave you.

671
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,300
Then where were you?

672
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Your parents died at the hospital.

673
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,400
We didn't understand what happened.

674
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,200
How could we still be here and you not?

675
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,000
And then, we met a man who...

676
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
told us he could bring us to you.

677
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,100
A man. Who are you talking about?

678
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,400
He didn't say his name- only that
we shouldn't go into the light.

679
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,200
If we did, our son would be lost forever.

680
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
We're together now.

681
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,700
Do you see it?

682
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,100
It's so beautiful.

683
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Daniel.

684
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,800
Come.

685
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,500
I can't.

686
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,400
I don't see it.

687
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,400
He needs your help.

688
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
But how? What's keeping him here?

689
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,500
Just listen with your heart. Ok?

690
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
You'll find the answer.

691
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,700
He's staying behind because of me.

692
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,500
I've already hurt my family so bad.

693
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
I don't want to leave and hurt you.

694
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,400
- Daniel, it's ok-
- It's not.

695
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
We know that now.

696
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
Look around this place.

697
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,700
Who's going to watch
over you in the dark?

698
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,800
Daniel, if you do this...

699
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,600
you'll be helping Becca.
You-

700
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,400
you'll prove to her that
there's nothing to be afraid of.

701
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,600
Come on, Daniel. Just try.

702
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,800
See the light.

703
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,500
For me.

704
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Look at that.

705
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
Mom.

706
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Dad.

707
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,300
I see it.

708
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,300
Take care of her, will you?

709
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Yes. Yes, I will.

710
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
We want to believe you.

711
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
You have no idea how much.

712
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,100
But it almost seems impossible.

713
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,300
If you need help explaining anything...

714
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
dad...

715
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,600
there's someone... a man.

716
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,300
He's been wanting me to
tell you both something.

717
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,400
He's been asking for a long time.

718
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,300
I was scared of him at
first because he looked...

719
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,300
he said he died of an aneurysm.

720
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,900
He said you're married because of him.

721
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,000
She's talking about Larry.

722
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,500
He introduced us, but Becca, he
died before you were even born, 

723
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,100
he wanted you guys to meet for so long.

724
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,800
But you guys just kept on saying no.

725
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,800
And he just kept saying, 

726
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Have a little faith.

727
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,600
what if I don't know how they died, 

728
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,500
or what if I don't know what
it is they're really missing?

729
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,200
- What if it just-
- Hey, relax. Ok?

730
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
I just saw you do it.

731
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,600
I didn't tell you what
it was that Daniel needed.

732
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,800
You just listened with your heart.

733
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,900
Yeah.

734
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,500
Can I ask you something?

735
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,400
When you were running away, why
did you stop here, in Grandview?

736
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,600
I don't know, just a feeling.

737
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
The bus stopped, and
something told me to get off.

738
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,400
- It was just-
- something you had to do.

739
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,900
Yeah.

740
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Well, you know where to find me.

741
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,500
I wasn't sure if
you were still in town.

742
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,000
Something told me you were.

743
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Is it really worth it, Gabriel?

744
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,100
To break up families just
for a few extra souls?

745
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,500
I mean, what could you
possibly need them for?

746
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,200
It's not just about gaining
or losing a few extra souls.

747
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,700
Of course not, unless you
happen to be one of them.

748
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,400
As usual,
you're missing the big picture.

749
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,800
What is the big picture?

750
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,600
'Cause you're just a collector.

751
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,300
And please, don't stand there and pretend
like you're doing something noble.

752
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,700
Wait a minute.

753
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,100
You didn't want them, did you?

754
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,500
You wanted her.

755
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,000
That's what drew her here, the
same thing that drew you.

756
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,900
Please, don't do this.

757
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,800
You have a real choice.

758
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,500
You could work with me, and we can
free all of those souls down there-

759
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,500
sorry. I picked another horse.

760
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,900
He's much faster than you.

761
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,100
Then what are you doing here?

762
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,900
You're my sister.

763
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,800
And you have a choice too.

764
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,700
What does that mean?

765
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,700
It means don't be so sure
you have all the answers.
