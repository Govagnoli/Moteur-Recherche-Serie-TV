1
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,883
My name is
Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,194
I'm married,

3
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,501
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,412
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,421
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,231
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,940
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,053
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,258
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,874
They're stuck here, because they have
unfinished business with the living,

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,687
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:41,720
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,669
So how long were they married?

14
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,971
Just a few months.
He was so crazy about her.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,885
How come he never brought her
into the store?

16
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:57,394
I don't know. Maybe he was just tryin'
to buy her things to surprise her.

17
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,718
He is a great customer and so sweet.

18
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:05,234
Anyway, we don't have to
stay that long.

19
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:09,462
Jake.

20
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,277
How are you?

21
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:14,887
You remember my friend Melinda.

22
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,202
I'm so sorry for your loss.

23
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:18,507
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

24
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:22,318
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

25
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:34,180
That's his wife?

26
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,300
Tell me about it.

27
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,410
What's wrong with this picture?

28
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:45,522
I land the richest guy in Driscoll
County, and my heart gives out.

29
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,252
This is like poetic injustice.

30
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,962
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:56,394
Are you interested in crossing over?

32
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,001
- You mean that light?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:01,211
I really think you should go into
that light, you'll find peace there.

34
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:02,626
Peace.

35
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,932
I'm thirty...

36
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,738
28 years old.

37
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,747
What do I want with peace?

38
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,364
Besides, I...

39
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,474
I really did love him.

40
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:16,387
Everything ok?

41
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:20,701
You didn't tell me that
his wife was so youthful.

42
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,120
I thought you knew.

43
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,927
Nice jacket.

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,338
- She likes your jacket.
- Oh, thank...

45
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,263
- No.
- Yes.

46
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:33,978
- Is that supposed to happen?
- What?

47
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,983
The light, it's... it's like...

48
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:41,600
it's not so bright anymore, like
there's something getting in the way.

49
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,722
- Oh, that's freaky.
- What is?

50
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:47,933
I'm gonna go hang somewhere else.
This is too creepy.

51
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,854
What's going on?

52
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,461
I'll tell you later.

53
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:55,471
Gonna go find the ladies' room.

54
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:58,590
Stop crying. I'm not dead!

55
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,605
I'm right here! Look at me!

56
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:05,519
What is wrong with you people?

57
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,899
You're very confused right now.

58
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,419
It's a difficult time.

59
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,426
How come you can see me and they can't?

60
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,636
That's a long story.

61
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:30,244
The important thing is...

62
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:34,258
there's a better place for you.

63
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:42,995
EPISODE 2x20

64
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:46,920
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

65
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:50,831
Are you sure the guy you saw
was talking to a ghost,

66
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:51,947
not just talking to himself,
and the ghost...

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,653
I know what I saw.
They were interacting, ok?

68
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,669
Ghost to human, human to ghost.

69
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,291
Well, that means there's
someone else out there...

70
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:03,905
Like me? I know.

71
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,413
Ok, there's always been
my grandmother and my mom

72
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,725
with whatever abilities she has,
but I have always wondered

73
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,137
what it would be like to have
a friend who saw what I saw,

74
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:14,953
who felt what I felt.

75
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,165
Well, I mean, this is weird, Mel.

76
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,870
What are the chances
that there are 2 people like...

77
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:19,786
in Grandview?

78
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:22,290
I know, which is why
I'm all questions right now,

79
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,001
and I have to talk to this guy.

80
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,610
I'm gonna go back to that
funeral home tomorrow

81
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:28,517
and see if they at least have
a guest book that I can look at.

82
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:32,431
I'm never gonna sleep tonight.

83
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,635
What?

84
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,856
Who are you?

85
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,580
Wait. I remember you.

86
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,591
You were on the plane.

87
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,803
- I made a mistake.
- I know.

88
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,617
You didn't cross over.

89
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:12,125
Don't let them find me.

90
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:19,060
We call it the Harold and Maude
syndrome, from the movie.

91
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:21,578
People who hang around
wakes and funerals.

92
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,390
- So have you ever seen him before?
- I've seen him a bunch of times,

93
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,602
at the cemetery, too.

94
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,415
Has he ever spoken to you?

95
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:32,921
Once or twice. Nice guy.
Seems harmless.

96
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,352
Damn.

97
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,361
Would you mind?

98
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,781
So,

99
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,191
what did he say to you?

100
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,198
Oh, you know, the usual questions.
Did I know I was dead? How did I die?

101
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,619
Do I know other dead people?
Blah, blah, blah.

102
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,431
I said, "Look, I like it here.
I have no intention of leaving.

103
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,745
"You wanna be a do-gooder, go help
that confused old lady over there

104
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,653
who doesn't even know she's dead,
poor thing. "

105
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,763
Could I check your guest book?

106
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,472
Sure.

107
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,983
So does he ever know the people
who are being waked?

108
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,093
I don't think so.
And it's usually young ones.

109
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,705
He never pays much attention
to the old people.

110
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,219
I just don't get all this
fascination with the dead.

111
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:14,729
For me, it's almost like being alive,
except a lot less expensive,

112
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,145
and I never get asked for directions.

113
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:19,354
That alone was almost worth
keeling over for.

114
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,570
Can I help you with something?

115
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:27,380
Oh. I realized that I forgot
to sign the book yesterday, so...

116
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,011
Look at that.

117
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,419
Done.

118
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,042
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Buster.

119
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,350
When I ran this place,
there was never one crooked tie.

120
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,361
I am sick of doing your job,

121
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:42,071
sick of it.

122
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,780
Close your mouth.

123
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,086
I don't know that I can.

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,895
I recommend it for your next class.

125
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,801
How are you not jumping out
of your skin over this?

126
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:50,510
I don't know anything
about this guy, ok?

127
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,519
He could be a friend or a foe.
It could be a hoax.

128
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,229
Hoax? Hoax?
Melinda, listen to yourself.

129
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:57,041
You sound just like all those
frightened little people

130
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:58,751
that have doubted you your whole life.

131
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,459
You were one of those
not too long ago.

132
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:03,068
I'm a scientist. It's my job to doubt
you and be frightened all the time.

133
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:06,080
That's my job. And quite frankly, when
I doubted you, my life was a lot simpler.

134
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,295
- Doubt was my friend.
- Doubt was your crutch.

135
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,008
Are we gonna find this ghost guy,
or are we gonna write bumper stickers?

136
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,614
I'm trying to find him,
but I don't know anything else except

137
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,927
his name is Gabriel, and he likes to

138
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:17,039
hang out at funeral homes
and cemeteries.

139
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:19,248
Ok, great. So he doesn't have
a lot of colorful clothing.

140
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,559
That narrows it down. What else?

141
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,267
Why would a guy like this
pop up in Grandview?

142
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,573
I don't know, but I wanna find out.

143
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,679
Maybe you guys were meant to find
each other for some reason.

144
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:26,291
For what reason?

145
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:29,100
Maybe you have to find him
cheerier hobbies.

146
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,515
Ok, look, in case this guy
turns out to be the real deal,

147
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,419
will you just look this
stuff up for me, ok?

148
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,230
Same ability, same place, same time.

149
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,536
Yes, I will, but listen.
The second you find this guy,

150
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,750
you bring him right here immediately.
Do you understand?

151
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:42,160
That's exactly what I'll do.

152
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,172
Were you being sarcastic?

153
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,280
Was that sarca...

154
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:53,005
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

155
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,224
- Hey, good morning.
- Sorry I'm late.

156
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,232
Is everything ok?

157
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah, I was just a little distracted.
How are you?

158
00:08:58,856 --> 00:08:59,251
Good.

159
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:04,054
You know, we never really got a chance
to talk about what happened yesterday.

160
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,778
Weird, huh?

161
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:10,791
So you're saying that the ghost
of Jake's wife was at the wake,

162
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,610
like literally in the room.

163
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:14,817
Yeah. Ghosts usually go to
their wakes and funerals.

164
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:17,030
They like to see who came,
check out what they look like.

165
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:19,341
Hair, clothing, the whole deal.

166
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,850
Really?

167
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:28,972
And you actually have conversations
like we're having right now?

168
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:32,997
Delia, why are you asking me this?
You know that it makes you crazy.

169
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:36,117
It's just that when I think about
ghosts and, you know, stuff like that,

170
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,531
I imagine them to be kind of cloudy,

171
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:42,943
transparent people
dragging chains, you know.

172
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:47,264
I get some of those, too, believe me.

173
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,798
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

174
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:25,559
I need help.
I have to get out of here.

175
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,974
Who are you? You're not
the one who can help me.

176
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,083
I can help you,
but you have to let me.

177
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,097
There's a better place for you.
I can help you get there,

178
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:35,910
but you have to want it.

179
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:37,922
She's the one.

180
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:41,530
She's the one who can help me.

181
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,348
Oh, hi.

182
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:46,681
Didn't see you standing there.
You must think I'm crazy.

183
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,320
Sometimes I talk to myself.

184
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:52,851
Good way to get locked up, right?

185
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:54,795
Do you see the light?

186
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,714
Do you see it?

187
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,754
I'm not sure.

188
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:03,775
There's something in the way.
I can't get close.

189
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:07,621
Are you sure that there are not people
waiting for you, like family or...

190
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,464
No. They're not.

191
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,085
Tell me what you can see.

192
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,838
Hey, you can't just walk off like that.

193
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,163
- What do you want? Who are you?
- My name is Melinda Gordon.

194
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,093
- Who are you?
- Gabriel Lawrence.

195
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,013
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Look, you know what?

196
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:36,436
You and me have something that we need
to talk about, don't you think?

197
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:39,998
I promise I won't bite.

198
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,344
So where did you live
before you came here?

199
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:45,866
Denver. Yeah, a small neighborhood
called Rosemont.

200
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,608
When my parents died,
my uncle John took me in.

201
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:51,242
We traveled all over,
every corner of the world.

202
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,571
Did your uncle know?

203
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,786
No, no.

204
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:57,199
I realized pretty fast that this
was something I had to keep to myself,

205
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:59,939
and so stopped trying,
learned to live with it.

206
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,872
Besides, I didn't care
if people understood me.

207
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:05,007
You know, I never really
trusted the living anyway.

208
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:08,932
The dead made much better friends.

209
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:12,077
So did you have,
regular dead friends?

210
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,914
Absolutely.

211
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:21,149
When I was a kid, I'd invite
my ghost friends for sleepovers.

212
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:24,818
Yeah, I took 'em with me to school,
camping, trips.

213
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,761
I'd cry when they would
finally cross over.

214
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,885
I wished they would
stay with me forever.

215
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:30,909
I was afraid to acknowledge them.

216
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:34,730
I mean, not the ghosts, but I was
afraid what other people would think.

217
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,077
Me, too.

218
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,393
You tell people anything, you're
a thief, you have a contagious disease,

219
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:43,043
you know the meaning of life,
but nothing...

220
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:46,373
quite matches the look you get
when you say you can see ghosts.

221
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,011
Exactly.

222
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:52,629
It's like people always think
that you're after something.

223
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,885
Are you after something, Gabriel?

224
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,420
I mean, come on.

225
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:00,040
The two of us living in the same town.

226
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:02,771
It's a little weird.
You have to admit it.

227
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:07,901
Maybe, but I have a different
weird threshold than most.

228
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,362
Well, don't you?

229
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:13,978
Have you noticed a shift
in the spirit world?

230
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:17,732
- Is this a test?
- Maybe.

231
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,782
Uh, actually, I have,

232
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:24,709
like they're getting stronger.

233
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,261
You felt it, too?

234
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,087
Yeah. They can do more.

235
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:33,906
It's like they can affect us
in ways they couldn't before.

236
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:36,664
Like the flight attendant.

237
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,593
Look, when that plane
came down, there was...

238
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,829
a very dark spirit here

239
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,254
who was trying to get as many souls
as possible to stay earthbound.

240
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,305
He was able to convince a lot of souls,
including her, that...

241
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,055
they belonged here,

242
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,274
that there was something
they were meant to do.

243
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,298
Now she's terrified of crossing over.

244
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:59,921
I just think she doesn't know
who to trust.

245
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,365
There's something keeping her
from crossing.

246
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,206
Maybe she could talk to me again.

247
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:10,626
- Now, that I know...
- Us. Maybe she could talk to us.

248
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,592
I'm not trying to take over
your corner.

249
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,910
I don't have a corner.

250
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,626
I just have history with this spirit.

251
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:21,372
Well, strength in numbers.

252
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,598
Are you gonna get that?

253
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,026
Rick.

254
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,668
Yes.

255
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:47,199
Yes. Hello.

256
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,414
I met him.

257
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,440
Yep. He was at our house.

258
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:52,864
Seems great...

259
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,378
funny, smart.

260
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:56,998
Yeah. And he's a double capricorn.
He likes long walks on the beach.

261
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,928
Skip the personal ad.
Is he the real deal or not?

262
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,763
I think so.

263
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:06,701
So what do you guys talk about?
Just compare notes, talk shop?

264
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,641
In a way.

265
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,962
I don't know if I can
totally trust him yet.

266
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,490
You know, I have a weird thing
about coincidences.

267
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,420
You're so suspicious.
I love that about you.

268
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:20,341
Then again, that's what
I love about me, so...

269
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:24,710
We're gonna go back to
where it all started.

270
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:28,248
Plane crash site, tomorrow night.

271
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,890
See if we can find
the flight attendant.

272
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,519
Tomorrow night.

273
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:36,752
You're not thinking of going out
with her tomorrow night, are you?

274
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:38,788
I can't go tomorrow night.
I have a lecture.

275
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,613
Oh, good, 'cause you're not invited.

276
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:44,035
Well, good, 'cause
you're not invited, either.

277
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,475
I'll let you know how it goes.

278
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:49,492
Good night.

279
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:23,483
It's weird being up here again.

280
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,252
Think she'll be here?

281
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:31,375
I like to go back to the beginning,
where they died.

282
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,923
Sort of like me in that way...

283
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,051
go after them, try to help 'em.

284
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:39,177
I don't exactly go after them.
They usually come to me.

285
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,612
I like finding them.

286
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,230
I like chasing them, too.

287
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:44,348
Sometimes I compete with myself,

288
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:48,674
how many can I send off in one night.

289
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,642
Your husband's a good man.
He understands you.

290
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,968
Yeah. I'm very lucky.

291
00:16:56,112 --> 00:17:00,609
Never known anyone I could trust that way.

292
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,172
- I'm not going back.
- Where?

293
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,116
To that place with those people.

294
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:10,148
I think it was hell or something.

295
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,973
Are there spirits still
blocking the light?

296
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:17,016
Maybe you have some unfinished business
or someone who

297
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:18,553
you need to say good-bye to.

298
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:19,971
There's no one.

299
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,688
You must have some family.

300
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,509
I never wanted any of that.

301
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,529
How about your parents?

302
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:29,564
They wanted me to be just like them,

303
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:30,899
to never leave,

304
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,312
and I wouldn't, so now they hate me.

305
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,843
No, they don't.

306
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:39,158
They do, because I left, and I died.

307
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,523
Amy,

308
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,453
I know what it's like to be alone,

309
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,983
to have no attachments,

310
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,013
no one pulling on your heart.

311
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,948
You and I are more alike than you know.

312
00:17:55,099 --> 00:18:01,192
There's a difference between being
lonely and being alone, am I right?

313
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,668
You just have to decide

314
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,293
that you don't wanna be
alone like that anymore,

315
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,538
and whatever blocks the light now

316
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,264
will move.

317
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,008
Amy,

318
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,226
I can show you a place

319
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,963
where you'll be very happy.

320
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,314
Who's that?

321
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:31,673
Please don't let them find me.

322
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,672
Gabriel!

323
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,976
Stop! He is my friend!

324
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,415
Look, I'm sorry. I...

325
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,829
I didn't mean to scare you off.
I just... I couldn't resist.

326
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,060
- What the hell is this?
- It's a kirlian camera.

327
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,784
It measures auras. It's nothing.

328
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,404
- That's property of the university.
- Is this some kind of a joke, huh?!

329
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:09,745
Some kind of cheap trick?!

330
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,562
Look, I didn't know
he was gonna be here, I swear.

331
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:15,782
Now you know why I prefer the dead.

332
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:24,381
You're not gonna believe what I saw.

333
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:29,356
I can't believe you followed me.
What are you, 12?

334
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,788
It was in the name of science.

335
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,607
Listen, my lecture let out at 5, so...

336
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,427
Do you have any idea
what this makes me look like?

337
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:37,046
Yeah, tell me about it. I was running
like a girl, holding this camera.

338
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,379
I fell down. That guy grabbed me,
and he almost...

339
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,704
Thank goodness he didn't
break this camera,

340
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,121
'cause this thing is not cheap,
and I am.

341
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:43,837
Did you notice he's got
quite a temper on him?

342
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,959
Yeah. You always seem to
bring out the best in people.

343
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,083
Yeah, I consider myself sort of
like a truth serum,

344
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,308
except without the needles
or the C.I.A.

345
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:55,746
All right, luckily,
I always keep a backup.

346
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,594
You remember our friend?

347
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,318
- Kirlian camera?
- Yeah. It reads auras.

348
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:05,247
Energy fields, like the kinds
your friends the spirits give off.

349
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,107
Here you go.

350
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,628
- Would you like to guess
what those are? - Spirits.

351
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,357
Spirits. Spirits!
This place is lousy with 'em!

352
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:13,889
Yeah. It's a haunted field.

353
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,308
There are lots of spirits that
didn't cross over in the plane crash.

354
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,848
Oh, well, how come kirlian can
see them all and you can't?

355
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,976
You know why?
Because that sees energy,

356
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:25,601
and spirits can choose to manifest.
I can't make them show themselves.

357
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:29,444
All right. Really? Well,
why don't you take a closer look.

358
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,288
Here you go.

359
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,827
Look at these orbs around him.
They follow him wherever he goes.

360
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:40,760
They're attached to him.
When he chased me, they came with him.

361
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:45,019
Look at that.
Those are his ghosts.

362
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,985
I came to apologize for last night.

363
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,096
I sort of lost it,

364
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:09,208
and I want us to start over again.

365
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:21,865
There's something
I want you to see first.

366
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,092
They're spirits.

367
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:25,798
Attached to you.

368
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,407
How do you know
they're not attached to you?

369
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,812
Stop playing with me.

370
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,721
- Why don't you trust me?
- I don't know why.

371
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:31,730
But you don't.

372
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,034
Why did you come to Grandview?

373
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,543
Did you know that I was here?

374
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,956
I came here because
I felt I had to be here.

375
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:42,074
I was drawn here.

376
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:45,181
Maybe it was you.

377
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,904
Or maybe it was them.

378
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,815
Maybe it's just because
I feel I can help here.

379
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,238
Look,

380
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,744
we have to work together.

381
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:59,352
All right, we were both
put here for a reason.

382
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:02,263
- We have to find out what it is.
- How?

383
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,178
Find your flight attendant,

384
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,984
and we need to know
what she sees on her side.

385
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:14,404
If you wanna work with me, meet me
tonight at the funeral home at 9:00.

386
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,597
Maybe I was too hard on Gabriel.

387
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:34,710
I mean, he does try to help spirits.

388
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,830
He even goes and looks for them,

389
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:40,236
unlike me, who tries to avoid them
whenever I can.

390
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,754
That's because...

391
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,466
he doesn't have anything else.

392
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,577
Who am I to judge him...

393
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,088
or not to trust him?

394
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,794
Do you have any idea
who this guy really is?

395
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,408
- Have you checked on him?
- There's no phone listing.

396
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:57,419
Not here, before that,
before Grandview. Didn't he...

397
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,333
- Didn't he say something about Denver?
- Yeah. He said he lived with his uncle.

398
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,246
He told me his name, but...

399
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:04,657
John.

400
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,969
Right. Right.

401
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,377
John.

402
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,644
Ok. There's only one John Lawrence,
and he's a

403
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:29,462
doctor and the director
at Rosemont hospital.

404
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,587
Rosemont.

405
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:34,895
That's where Gabriel said he lived.

406
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,007
I realize it's just about
quitting time where you are,

407
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,122
but I really need to
speak to dr. Lawrence.

408
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:45,032
It's urgent that I speak with him.
I promise that I'll be very brief.

409
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,457
I thought so.

410
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,561
Thank you, yes. I will hold.

411
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:53,177
- Isn't it a little late?
- I'm sorry. It'll just be a minute.

412
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,494
- Isn't this what you have an office...
- Thank you.

413
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,307
- Hello.
- Dr. Lawrence?

414
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,212
Yes. Who is this?

415
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:02,116
Hi. My name is professor Richard Payne,
Rockland university.

416
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,837
Your nephew Gabriel Lawrence applied
for a job here in my building,

417
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,955
so I wanted to call and
ask you some questions,

418
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,463
just so I could fill in some
of the blanks on his application.

419
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,873
I don't have a nephew.

420
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:16,186
Well, that's not what
my papers here tell me.

421
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:19,803
It says Gabriel Lawrence is your
nephew. He's mid-twenties, he's dark,

422
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:21,720
and you raised him from
the time he was 9 years old.

423
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,626
I think you might be talking
about Gabriel Hastings.

424
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:27,441
He's not my nephew.
He was my patient.

425
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,156
Sorry, did you say, "patient"?

426
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,862
This is a psychiatric hospital.
He came to us as a child.

427
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:36,380
He basically grew up here,
but I really shouldn't say too much.

428
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:39,096
With all due respect, doctor,
I think I have every right in the world

429
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:43,307
to know whether or not the person
I'm about to hire is dangerous.

430
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,928
He was severely delusional as a child,

431
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:52,040
came a long way, and he was released to
his own custody when he became an adult.

432
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:54,069
That's really all I can say.
Please tell him to call me.

433
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:57,078
Will do. Thank you. Bye-bye.

434
00:24:57,198 --> 00:25:00,593
So much for uncle John.

435
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:03,010
Hey, what's the matter?

436
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:05,421
That could have been me.

437
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:09,732
Severely delusional,
kid that sees ghosts.

438
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:13,053
I wonder how many people there
are like that,

439
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:15,869
you know, who just get put away
because of what they can do.

440
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:17,779
Melinda, this is nothing like you, ok?

441
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:20,190
This guy went psycho
because he saw ghosts.

442
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,300
I know. I just don't know
what to believe.

443
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:25,612
And I have to talk to him,
'cause maybe I can help him.

444
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:28,826
No. No, I forbid it.
No, you cannot.

445
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:33,740
This isn't a stray dog, Melinda.
This guy's trouble, ok?

446
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,863
Let's take a break. I'm thirsty.
I'm really thirsty. Who wants a drink?

447
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:41,081
- Not me.
- I will.

448
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,918
He's very concerned about you.

449
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:51,228
I remember when he used to be
that concerned about me.

450
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,145
Must've lasted at least the first
few weeks of our marriage.

451
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:58,962
I'm sorry, but it's really
not what it seems.

452
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:00,483
It's all right.

453
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:04,588
Doesn't really matter now anyway.

454
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,212
So what's our next step?

455
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:11,223
You know, this is really
none of my business, but...

456
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:15,240
why didn't you tell me
your wife was dead?

457
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:17,357
Because I don't deal with it very well.

458
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:20,069
Maybe it's time to.

459
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:24,580
- What happened to her?
- It's nothing. She died in her sleep.

460
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:27,299
That is so him.

461
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,312
I was killed driving past
a construction site.

462
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:34,628
A crane collapsed onto my car.
I was trapped for over 2 hours,

463
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:39,348
and I died just before
they cut me free, but...

464
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,771
it's too tough for him to think about.

465
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,294
She's here.

466
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:50,012
Why?

467
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:51,919
I kept a journal.

468
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,728
Third shelf behind the textbooks.
He should read it.

469
00:26:54,845 --> 00:27:00,241
She has a journal, third shelf.
She wants you to read it.

470
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:03,167
I knew it.

471
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:08,582
I just knew it. Things have been moving
around for months, and I hear her.

472
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,508
I smell her perfume
when I come home sometimes.

473
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:17,328
Just make sure he reads it.

474
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:21,851
There are things he should know.

475
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:29,390
She's gone.

476
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:34,509
She really wants you
to read that journal, ok?

477
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:38,228
You call me if you need to.

478
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,896
Help me.

479
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,809
Hey,

480
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,214
glad you made it.

481
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:06,023
So much that's about to happen.

482
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:09,534
It's a great party, huh?

483
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:10,851
Miss, please.

484
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:13,257
Where you been?

485
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,070
You're the only reason
I wish I wasn't dead.

486
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,883
I'm not crossing over!

487
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,391
Party!

488
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:36,962
So how long you been dead?

489
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:47,318
You stood me up.

490
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:48,827
What is this?

491
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,735
What are you doing
with all these spirits?

492
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,045
Having fun.

493
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:53,651
They're my family.

494
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,955
You can't do this. You can't just
keep them all trapped here.

495
00:30:57,078 --> 00:31:01,173
Trapped? They're anything but trapped.
They're more free than they've ever been.

496
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:02,991
You lied to me.

497
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:03,700
Did I?

498
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:06,903
Yeah. I spoke to your uncle John,
who was never your uncle.

499
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:08,320
So what?

500
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,725
- You would lie, too, in my place.
- No, I wouldn't.

501
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:12,338
Come on, Melinda.

502
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:15,543
This thing we do makes us liars.

503
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,860
You lie every single day,

504
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:21,568
every time you make an excuse for
why you're talking to yourself

505
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:25,388
or when you backpedal to explain
how you know something you shouldn't

506
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,406
or when you're looking
right at somebody

507
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,122
that no one else can see.

508
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:34,435
Lying is second nature to us.

509
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,449
Lying...

510
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,257
is survival.

511
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:44,572
Is that what got you out
of the institution? Lying?

512
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,300
You bet your ass it is.

513
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:58,449
Look, I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

514
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:01,061
I didn't grow up with
a family like yours.

515
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,570
I don't have a partner like you have.

516
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,384
My support system was a tray of me
to make it all go away.

517
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:08,096
Look, you owe it to them
to cross them over.

518
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:12,803
- And you owe it to the families...
- Don't tell me what I owe the living.

519
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,127
There has never been one living person
who made me feel I was worth anything,

520
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,647
who made me feel I wasn't
just some nut to be locked away.

521
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,466
I'm here for the dead, not the living.

522
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,779
They know they can trust me,
and they know I trust them.

523
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:31,395
This isn't just some
lonely hearts club, Melinda.

524
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,413
We're getting ready.

525
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:35,319
- For what?
- For what's coming.

526
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:37,530
We're blocking the light,

527
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:40,540
and soon no one's gonna get through.

528
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:45,154
These aren't your grandmother's
ghosts anymore.

529
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,777
We're kindred souls, you and I,

530
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,988
2 sides of the same coin.

531
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:54,600
Just imagine how powerful we'd be
if we linked up.

532
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:59,221
Or you could just risk
losing everything.

533
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:01,443
What are you saying?

534
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,954
I want you to leave your life.

535
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:08,070
Why do you think we met?

536
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,485
You said it yourself.

537
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:14,195
This can't be an accident.

538
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:38,034
Please take me out of here.

539
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,563
- Do you see a light?
- No.

540
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:45,982
Well, look for it.
You have to want it.

541
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,014
I see it.

542
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,422
There are still people in front of it.
I can't get close.

543
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:54,041
I think that's because you're
scared and confused.

544
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:55,456
They're using it against you.

545
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:57,268
So what do I do?

546
00:33:57,384 --> 00:34:00,778
Can you think of anybody,
like a grandparent or friend who

547
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,898
might still be in the light?

548
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:06,413
I've never really lost anyone.

549
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,133
Even my dog is still alive.

550
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,758
Ok. Well, you know what?

551
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,181
Why don't you think of yourself
as a little girl,

552
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:20,893
8 or 9, you know.
Maybe it's your birthday party.

553
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,022
We always had a birthday party.

554
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,338
With your parents?

555
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,445
Yeah, my aunts and uncles.

556
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,358
Do they make you feel safe and loved?

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,674
Yeah. I looked forward to it all day.

558
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,697
They're all watching me now.

559
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:38,109
They're smiling at me.

560
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:42,132
Do you feel like nothing bad
could ever happen to you?

561
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,354
Yeah, like they're always
gonna keep me safe.

562
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:48,175
They loved me so much.

563
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:52,092
They can't block you
when you feel those things.

564
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,818
You're right.
They're starting to move.

565
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:55,625
The light's getting bigger.

566
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:58,237
So there's nothing stopping you now.

567
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,656
Go into it.

568
00:35:00,774 --> 00:35:03,168
It is so beautiful.

569
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:07,786
Now I can see everything
there is to see.

570
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,069
Ok.

571
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,977
Crossed her over going 60,
and never took my foot off the gas.

572
00:35:22,107 --> 00:35:27,002
How's that for your
grandmother's ghost, Gabriel?

573
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:34,261
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me tonight.

574
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:37,479
It ain't over yet.

575
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:55,477
It was right where she said it
would be. Feel free to read aloud.

576
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,607
"Almost told him tonight,

577
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,623
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

578
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:04,834
Should I just leave without
saying anything or just leave a note?

579
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:08,167
Will he even notice?

580
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:12,288
I keep waiting for him to tell me
that he knows about the affair.

581
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:16,413
Could it be he actually doesn't?
Is he that unconscious? "

582
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:19,737
- It gets better.
- I am so sorry.

583
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:23,860
I don't understand the appeal
of this unfinished business.

584
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,384
I think I would have been all right
without that piece of closure.

585
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:29,601
It's like everything has
just turned upside down.

586
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,420
Think Gabriel had something
to do with this?

587
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:34,732
I went to Gabriel's house tonight,
and he had like this...

588
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:38,150
I don't know. Army of souls
at some never-ending party.

589
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,474
I knew the ghosts that were there,
'cause they hadn't crossed over.

590
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,294
Was Kate there?

591
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,104
I didn't see her.

592
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:49,417
But there were others, you know,
from the plane crash, even before that.

593
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:52,642
- Ghosts from the past?
- Yes.

594
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,762
"When the forgotten return."

595
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:58,573
"Death will be twice closer."

596
00:36:58,704 --> 00:36:59,899
Hello. Translation?

597
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:01,405
It's the 5 signs.

598
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,814
The dead dove on the doorstep.

599
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:07,238
The bee.

600
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:10,650
Writing on jim's back.

601
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,373
What is it, Mel?

602
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:15,191
The dead will rise.

603
00:37:15,306 --> 00:37:18,203
And now the forgotten have returned.

604
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,921
So all 5 of those things have happened.

605
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:23,532
No, not all of them. Not the writing
on your back, "mors dilecti".

606
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:28,851
It was latin. It translates to
"death of a loved one".

607
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:32,192
Ok, you know what?
We have to go and talk to Gabriel.

608
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,907
You think Kate will be there?

609
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,115
I don't know, but he better
tell us what's going on.

610
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,560
Upstairs.

611
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:42,122
In here.

612
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:13,606
He's been watching you this whole time.

613
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,133
Couple of pictures of you up here, Jim.
Few of me.

614
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:19,156
I've always hated that picture of me.

615
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,866
He's been planning this
for quite some time.

616
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:28,096
No. This is bigger than just him.

617
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,828
I hear someone.

618
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:48,436
Kate?

619
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,950
What are you doing here?

620
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:51,458
She's here?

621
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:53,069
He used me.

622
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,277
- Who did?
- Gabriel,

623
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,491
all of them.

624
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:57,999
Where did they go?

625
00:39:58,114 --> 00:40:00,507
I don't know, but they left me here.

626
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,824
Why?

627
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:08,849
Because I feel so bad about what I did.

628
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,573
I should never have hurt you
like that, Rick.

629
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:16,797
I shouldn't have told you about
the diary, but they wanted me to.

630
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:20,523
She's saying that Gabriel
wanted her to hurt you.

631
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:23,847
He wants to hurt everybody
who helps you.

632
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,067
Why?

633
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,576
He wants to make you weak.

634
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,683
Why is he collecting souls? Why
does he want them to stay earthbound?

635
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,705
It's not just him.

636
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:35,624
It's happening all over.
They're planning something.

637
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:38,642
- Who is?
- Everyone on this side.

638
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:41,557
What do they want?

639
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:45,278
They want to make the dead
stronger than the living.

640
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:46,900
They want to take over.

641
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:48,810
What's happening, Melinda?
What is she saying?

642
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:49,920
Wait.

643
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,228
She'll tell you.

644
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:54,935
I never meant for it
to be this way, Rick.

645
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:57,359
I'm sorry.
Would you tell him I'm sorry?

646
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,973
She's saying that she's sorry.

647
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:02,391
Gabriel wanted her to hurt you

648
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,806
because you're close to me.

649
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:07,619
So it was all a lie, then,
the journal and the affair.

650
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:09,940
No.

651
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:12,953
No, that's true, and I'm sorry.

652
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,570
Is that the only reason she haunted me?

653
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:17,982
No. No, not at first.

654
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:23,912
Just moving things around,
making noises,

655
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:27,041
I just felt like I was getting
more of your attention dead

656
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:29,558
than I did when I was alive.

657
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:32,175
I just...

658
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:36,091
I just wanted you to know
how lonely I felt.

659
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:38,815
How much I loved you

660
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:43,130
and needed you and hated losing you.

661
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:48,171
And then...

662
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,289
Gabriel found me,

663
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,901
told me that I was gonna be punished

664
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,719
for what I'd done
if I tried to cross over.

665
00:41:54,833 --> 00:42:00,628
He said I should stay here and help him.
He said then the pain would go away.

666
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:02,366
What is she saying now?

667
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:06,375
She was haunting you because
she wanted you to pay attention,

668
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:09,701
and she knows that she made a mistake,

669
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:15,220
and she feels terrible about it,
and that's why Gabriel left her behind.

670
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,557
How did we let it get to this, Rick?

671
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:22,584
I did love you.

672
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,800
I know you love me.
I know you did.

673
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,638
How did we lose that?

674
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,281
Will you...

675
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:42,101
Will you forgive me?

676
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:46,429
She wants to know
if you can forgive her.

677
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:51,448
It's what she needs to find peace
and cross over.

678
00:42:58,629 --> 00:43:00,823
No.

679
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,842
What?

680
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:07,062
No.

681
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,980
I could say it, but I'd be lying.

682
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:11,189
I could say the words
if that's what you want.

683
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:14,302
You'll never get
another chance like this.

684
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,823
You have to know that.

685
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:19,630
No.

686
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,552
She should have come to me.
We should've spoken about it.

687
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,267
She was with another man, Melinda.
I just...

688
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,298
There's too much pain.

689
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:32,922
No.

690
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:36,848
