1
00:00:01,104 --> 00:00:03,579
No, why did you want me to the basketball game?

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:06,188
I don't know the difference
between a field goal
and a slam dunk.

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,898
They don't have
field goals
in basketball.

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,765
That's football.
No, basketball, too

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,378
Oh, jim,
why don't you come?

6
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,094
Ned would love
to have you there.

7
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,832
Ah, i'd love to,
but i got the night shift.

8
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:16,032
You know?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,301
Look, i wouldn't ask,

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,934
Except this is
a new school for him,

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,068
He just transferred in,

12
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:22,435
And i know
he would appreciate

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,615
Seeing a few
familiar faces there.

14
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,759
I'd be happy to come.

15
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:26,712
Huh! That's great!

16
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:28,201
Oh, he will
so thrilled!

17
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,767
Oh, i hope he gets
a touchdown!

18
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,025
Hey, honey, we're here.

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,292
Yeah, i saw that, mom.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,262
Did you say hi
to melinda?

21
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,087
Hi, melinda.
Hi, ned.

22
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,992
And i have snacks
if you're hungry.

23
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:57,384
Oh, no.
Really, i'm ok, mom.

24
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,074
I know it means a lot
to him that we're here.

25
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,981
I can see that.

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,217
Is that brad? No.34

27
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:05,183
I mean,
what's the big deal?

28
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:07,620
What can he do
that you can't do?

29
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,044
That.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,101
Way to go, brad!

31
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,234
Is that his girlfriend?

32
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,801
Yeah, her name's
krista.

33
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:34,292
I don't know.

34
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,975
What happened?
Ned, what's wrong?

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,317
Brad's points aren't up.

36
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,273
Something wrong
with the scoreboard.

37
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,012
Maybe she needs help.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,094
"34 + gf = death."

39
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:53,995
What's going on?

40
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,869
34, that's brad's
number.

41
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,807
So "gf" is gotta be
girlfriend, right?

42
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:01,266
Yeah, brad and krista
are like this
uber couple.

43
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,834
What?

44
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,201
"Slammers be slammed?"

45
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:13,978
Wait, this doesn't have
anything to do with
that awful slam book?

46
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,656
What's a slam book?

47
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,273
It's just this
terrible website

48
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:21,653
Where students
can anonymously slam
each other. It's--Ugh.

49
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,082
What's going on?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,368
Delia, get up, go!

51
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:33,250
Ok, ned, come on, let's
get out of here.Ned...

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,135
Ned, what the hell
is going on?

53
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,130
Tell me more
about the slam book.

54
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,026
It's just a way
to hurt people.

55
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,556
Well, it's working.

56

00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,692
??? T before
the bleachers closed,

59
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,807
The scoreboard said
"slammers be slammed."

60
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:48,573
Well, it's obviously
a ghost

61
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,697
Who's a big fan
of a jump shot.

62
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,342
You know, as opposed
to slam dunks.

63
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,000
Nothing? These are
basketball references.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,225
Why am i wasting
my time?

65
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,048
Ok, have you ever heard
of a slam book?

66
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,091
Of course i have.

67
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,639
The internet's
wonderful contribution

68
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,122
To ruining reputations
everywhere.

69
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,950
Yeah, these kids
just create a webpage
and tear into each other.

70
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,022
Everyone can see it.

71
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,662
You don't even have
to sneak into
the boy's locker room

72
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,881
To find out what
they wrote on the wall.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,233
Not that i ever did that.

74
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,218
I never did that,
either. Ever.

75
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,682
I never had
anything written
about me, either,

76
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,866
Which is awful.
Zip, zero, nothing.
Is there anything worse?

77
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,599
Yeah, try this--
"Want milk?

78
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,766
Try jay baker's man boobs.

79
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,332
So you think this ghost
is lashing out

80
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,233
Because of what
somebody wrote about it
in the slam book?

81
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:27,755
Maybe. Especially
if what was written
by brad and krista.

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,633
Hey, morning.
Hey, professor payne.

83
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,267
Hey, you two.
Hey

84
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,800
Hey, ned, how are things
going at school?
Weird.

85
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,090
Why? What happened now?

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,824
Well, the school tnks
they have a suspect

87
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:38,820
In that gym incident
last night.

88
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,781
The girl who ran
the scoreboard,
what was her name?

89
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:41,610
Lucy.

90
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,299
Well, that means
it's not a ghost, then.

91
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,133
Well, it depends on
who you talk to.

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,037
The school feels
they caught the culprit.
Ned, on the other hand...

93
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:50,081
Lucy's brother died
a few weeks ago.

94
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,733
Yeah, he hit his head
skateboarding.

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,100
He seemed fine,
and then he just
fell asleep.

96
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,233
Concussions
are like that--
Totally stealth.

97
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,566
Oh, that is awful.

98
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,566
And that's exactly
why some people think that

99
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,299
It makes sense
that lucy did it.

100
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,167
You know, she was upset,
understandably.

101
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,739
Maybe she blames
brad and krista

102
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,332
Even though
her brother's death
was an accident.

103
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,469
What is her brother's name?

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,171
Thomas. Thomas benjamin.

105
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:17,599
Well, that's strange.
There's practically
nothing here.

106
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,836
Just one kid
calling him guano boy.
Whatever that means.

107
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:21,906
Where can i find a picture?

108
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,016
Check the school
face page. Here.

109
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,482
Guano boy's
better than nothin'.

110
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,451
At least he's not invisible.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,106
Hello?

112
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:32,982
Do you guys even hear
what i'm saying?

113
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,787
I don't know if he caused
all that stuff

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
With the scoreboard
and bleachers,

115
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,399
But i know he was there last
night. This is the ghost i saw.

116
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,200
Really?
Mom.

117
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,499
What?

118
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,866
So if it was the ghost,
that's good news, right?

119
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,332
At least for lucy.

120
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,100
You can tell
that ned's a little
biased on the subject.

121
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,621
So lucy's a friend?

122
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,033
Don't say anything.

123
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,697
Uh, ned, i take it
you don't agree

124
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,499
With, uh, britfan20-12
who describes lucy
as, quote,

125
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,332
"Satan's deadly
girl pawn?"

126
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,033
Whoever wrote that
doesn't know her.

127
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,583
She's really cool.
You should meet her.

128
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,174
So then why don't you
introduce me?

129
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,833
Uh, geometry class?
I sit right behind you.

130
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,161
Uh, right next
to tony neil.

131
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,167
Spanish 2.

132
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,633
I sit in the back,
over to the left,

133
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,399
Uh, by the pencil
sharpener.

134
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm sorry, i have no clue.

135
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:25,866
Don't take it personally,
i'm new at school, ted.

136
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,066
Ned.

137
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:27,793
I'm new, too.

138
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,866
That's why i thought
you might, uh--

139
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,362
Uh, lucy, i'm melinda.

140
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:36,699
Ned told me
about your brother,
and i'm really sorry.

141
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,903
Thanks. Um...

142
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,100
What's this about?

143
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,966
Well, i was at the gym
last night.

144
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,284
Yeah, look,

145
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:45,933
I already talked
to a lot of people
about it, so...

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,866
I don't think
that you did it.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,499
I was there
at the scoreboard.

148
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,666
I'm all emotionally messed up
about my brother.

149
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,833
It had to be me, right?

150
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,198
Well, it's hard
to explain,

151
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,507
But i'm pretty sure
someone else did it.

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,053
Why?

153
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,167
Do you blame brad and krista
for your brother's death?

154
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,533
It was an accident.
Why would i blame them?

155
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,444
Whoever wrote
"slammers be slammed"

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,948
Obviously blames them
for something.

157
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Can i ask you more
about your brother?

158
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,973
I heard that he died
in a skateboarding
accident.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,090
He came home that night
and put a bag of ice
on the back of his head.

160
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,499
He had his skateboard
with him,

161
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,417
So i figured he just
wiped out again.

162
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:28,566
And then he went to sleep
and never woke up.

163
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:29,933
Do you remember
anything else?

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,299
Anything he said?

165
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,466
Nothing he said.

166
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,599
But i noticed
there was like...

167
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,466
Chalk on his jacket.

168
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,900
Like, the kind
that they use

169
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,100
To write the name
of the football team
on the field.

170
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,366
This is gonna sound
like a weird question,

171
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,793
But were there any
bad feelings

172
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:48,666
Between thomas
and krista--

173
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,666
What does the gym thing
last night

174
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,489
Have to do with thomas?
He's dead.

175
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,919
Oh, i get it, ok.

176
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:59,800
You say that you don't
think that i had anything
to with it, but...

177
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,066
No, it's not
like that.

178
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,843
Why can't everybody
just give me a break?

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Lucy!
Hey. Let her go.

180
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,612
I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

181
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh...

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Aaah!

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,193
Aaah!

184
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,938
Please, please stop!
He's harmless!

185
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:55,267
Just let him fly away!

186
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,100
I don't get
why we can't tell lucy.

187
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,366
She'd be so relieved
to know that her brother's here.

188
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:11,533
For starters, she'd have
some answers for everything
she's being accused of.

189
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,432
Yeah, i don't know
if she's gonna be
relieved, ned.

190
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,167
It's a lot
for one person
to handle.

191
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,066
I handled it when you told me
my dad's ghost was here.

192
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,291
I don't want
to tell her
about her brother

193
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,432
Until i know
what he wants.

194
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,233
Officer: lucy benjamin?
Yeah?

195
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,733
Grandview police.
We need to ask you
some questions.

196
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,491
Who would put
a bat in there?

197
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,966
I mean, who would
think of that?

198
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:31,766
It was you.

199
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,767
You're the only one.

200
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,699
I don't know what
you're talking about.

201
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,814
Brad: krista, take it easy.

202
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,414
Why would you do that to me?

203
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm like the only person
in this whole school

204
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:41,527
Who's been nice
to your brother.

205
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,626
Why would you do that to me?

206
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,777
I died becau of you.
That's why.

207
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:49,412
And now you're gonna pay--
Both of you.

208
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,200
I just don't get
why the cops were there.

209
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,583
Lucy's not some psycho.

210
00:09:58,618 --> 00:09:59,767
It's the world we live in now.

211
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,500
Schools feel like
they can't be too cautious.

212
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,864
Well, does thomas
have any idea

213
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,933
What kind of trouble
he's getting
his sister in?

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,434
Well, maybe he does,
maybe he doesn't.

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,901
We just have to find out
what he has against
those two,

216
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:11,567
And what it has to do
with the slam book.

217
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,667
So what do we do?

218
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,066
Well, usually i would
talk to lucy,

219
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,567
But she seems to think
i'm just another adult

220
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:18,500
Who wants to blame her
for what happened
in the gym.

221
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,100
Who else can we get
to talk to her?

222
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,200
I don't know.

223
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:27,176
I mean,
this whole thing just--

224
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,100
Ok, you know what,
if you're afraid

225
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,600
To have ned get involved
with ghosts,

226
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,867
Then i understand.

227
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,652
It's not the ghost
i'm afraid of.

228
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,671
What is it, then?

229
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:39,000
Nothing. I'm not
afraid of anything.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,126
Me, neither.

231
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,003
What are you doing here?

232
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,988
Are you here
with your friend?
No.

233
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:02,685
I just--I didn't
mean to bother you.

234
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,719
I just wanted
to talk.

235
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:05,732
Oh, god, i'm sorry.

236
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,537
Um...

237
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:11,116
I haven't been
in the best mood lately.

238
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,320
I should get going,
anyway.

239
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,834
I'm really sorry
about what happened
to thoma

240
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,184
I shouldn't have...
said anything.

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,999
No, it's ok.
It's...messed up

242
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,849
How you don't really
want people to bring it up,

243
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,381
And then, if they don't,

244
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:34,290
It's like everybody's
already forgotten him.

245
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,178
Were you two
really close?

246
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,330
He's my big brother.

247
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,600
We were the only 2 kids
in our family.

248
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:42,567
He always looked out for me.

249
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,432
Sometimes more
than i wanted him to.

250
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,911
Yeah. I got a mom
who's like that.

251
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,774
Just, i...

252
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,013
Miss him so much
sometimes, you know?

253
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,403
And all this strange stuff's
happening,

254
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,300
And making it
so much worse.

255
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,485
Maybe i can help.

256
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,700
What do you mean?

257
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,133
Ok, this is gonna
sound weird.

258
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,801
Really wei, but i
can't think of a not
weird way to say it,

259
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,033
So i'm just gonna
say it.

260
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,773
I believe in ghosts.

261
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,369
And if you go with me,
just for a minute,

262
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,958
Maybe you can see
how you won't have
to miss thomas so much.

263
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,416
Plus, it can
help explain

264
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:24,703
All the strange things
that's been happening.

265
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,167
The scoreboard,
the bleachers,

266
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,467
The bat in krista's car.

267
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,667
The bat was just somebody's
bad idea of a joke.

268
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,200
Everybody knew
thomas was into bats.

269
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,667
I know
it sounds crazy.

270
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,667
Ok, wait, what--
What is this?

271
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,561
Is there a camera somewhere?
Are you gonna post

272
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,734
This whole little talk
on your slam book?

273
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,325
I wouldn't do that.

274
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,681
Just don't talk to me
about my brother again.

275
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:45,440
Stay the hell away from me!

276
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,593
These kids must spend
half their waking hours

277
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:53,998
Slamming each other online,
and nobody's immune.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
That's one of the
popular girls, right?

279
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,434
Turns out that's not
such a blessing anymore.

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,667
I guess it pays
to be anonymous
on the internet.

281
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,834
Yeah. Being anonymous
is part of the problem.

282
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,500
These kids say things
under the cover
of a screen name

283
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,901
That they would never
have the courage to say
to someone's face.

284
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,367
Here we go.

285
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:10,367
A slam on krista
keeps it concise
and to the point.

286
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:13,033
"Liar. Two-Faced.
Phony. Bitch."

287
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,558
Anyone who sleeps
with krista better
get tested."

288
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:17,656
"You're not kidding.

289
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,742
Don't forget
the rabies vaccine."

290
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,088
Wow. Rabies.

291
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:23,244
Gettin' slammed already
for having a bat
in her car.

292
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,434
News travels fast
on the internet.

293
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah, except this was
posted last month,

294
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,368
Before thomas died.

295
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:33,100
And there's a few more
mentions of rabies

296
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,243
Going back en further.
You know what, i wonder...

297
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,322
What's that?

298
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,150
Krista's school face page.

299
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,000
Look at the caption.

300
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:50,133
"Here's me with
a bat house i built
with my dad."

301
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,028
You know,
maybe i'm wrong,

302
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,237
But i'm guessing
bat lovers united

303
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,534
Is a very small club.

304
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,691
Makes you wonder what else
they had in common.

305
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,467
Krista: i can't
handle this anymore.

306
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:25,090
"It's ok, brad's
totally clueless.

307
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,667
"I mean, what would
i tell him anyway?

308
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:30,013
I'm crazy about someone
who won't even give me
their name."

309
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,634
Signed krista?

310
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,767
Krista: i can explain.
Brad.

311
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:48,469
And that was sent
to every kid at school
at the same time?

312
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,285
Ned: yeah, how is that
even possible?

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,485
Well, if i had to guess,
i'd guess ghost.

314
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,467
So what now?

315
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:54,598
Well, it seems to imply

316
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,100
That krista was cheating
on her boyfriend brad.

317
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,635
Maybe he knew
about it.

318
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,867
I can introduce you to brad.

319
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,600
I'll be right there.

320
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,567
[Indistinct chatter]

321
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,115
Ned.

322
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,901
Hey.
Hey.

323
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,600
Where is he?

324
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,300
Yeah, practice just ended.

325
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,700
I told him to meet you
in the team meeting room.

326
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:18,767
I'll see you later.

327
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,834
Thomas benjamin
had chalk on him
when he died.

328
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:13,574
He was hit in the head
with something.

329
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm guessing
it was this board.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,094
You're the one
that pushed him into it.

331
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,045
Brad, i don't work for the school
or the police

332
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm just trying

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,534
To help thomas
and his family
get some peace.

334
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,300
And you, too.

335
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,567
But you have
to tell me
what happened.

336
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,901
Krista had been
acting strange for weeks.

337
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,019
I mean, we spe
all our time together,

338
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,901
But she was sorta...
checked out.

339
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,634
She was always online
iming her friends.

340
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:52,374
Hey.

341
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,320
Here's a tip--

342
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,200
When your girlfriend starts
closing your cell phone
around you, it's over.

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,627
I really like krista,

344
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:05,034
And i just--
I didn't want
to lose her.

345
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,534
I had to know
who she was seeing.

346
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,499
I know it was wrong,
but i read her email.

347
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:15,000
Some of the stuff
she was telling this guy
was so intense.

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the weirdest thing was,

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,801
E didn't even know
who he was.

350
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,446
Then i did something
really stupid

351
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
That i'll regret
the rest of my life.

352
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I sent him an email
pretending to be krista.

353
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,801
I said, "let's meet."

354
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:38,634
So you arranged
to meet him here?

355
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
I just wanted to know
who the guy was.

356
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,896
I had a right
to face my competition,

357
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,534
Tell him what krista
meant to me.

358
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,300
Then there was thomas.

359
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,967
Guano boy.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,728
Brad: i couldn't
believe it.

361
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:05,725
Where's krista?

362
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,178
She doesn't know
anything about this.

363
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:08,253
I sent the invite.

364
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,740
Yeah, well, whatever.

365
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,056
Look, man,
i just want to talk.

366
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,805
Yeah, well,
i don't want
to talk to you, man.

367
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:13,856
You gotta hear me out, man!

368
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,322
And that's when
he blindsided me.

369
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,233
[Both yelling]

370
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,400
Ow!

371
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,101
Are you ok, man?

372
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:31,734
What the hell
do you care, man?!
Get off me!

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,834
Brad: and that was it,
i swear.

374
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:43,963
He seemed fine
that night when he left.

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,702
What about krista?

376
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:48,130
How does she feel
about all of this?

377
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,456
Like i told thomas--

378
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,634
She didn't even know
i sent the email
arranging the meeting.

379
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,001
It's me who's to blame.

380
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,157
Quite an entrance.

381
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,692
Just some friends
from a previous life.

382
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,119
I don't know why
they can see me.

383
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:48,500
Then again, i don'know why
you can see me, either.

384
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,396
Brad told me
what happened
the night you died.

385
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,526
Did he mentioned the part
where he killed me?

386
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,339
He said that you
threw the first punch,

387
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,057
And that he thought
you were ok and it was
all an accident.

388
00:19:59,067 --> 00:19:59,768
What if it was?

389
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:01,982
When i left him, he was
with the principal,

390
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:04,081
Confessing everything
to the authorities.

391
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,609
He feels terrible.

392
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,872
Ok, it was all
an accident

393
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,760
And you have
to forgive them
and go into the light.

394
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,356
Forgive them? Why?

395
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,465
Because everything
that you're doing,

396
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:14,367
All these things
you're trying to
punish them with,

397
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,106
These hauntings,
it's just hurting
your sister.

398
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,307
She's getting blamed
for everything you do.

399
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,734
Who's blaming lucy?

400
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:21,851
Is it the slam book?

401
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,168
You know how
they treat anyone
who's different.

402
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,297
No, the police.
Ok, the school.

403
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:27,931
You were there
when they were
questioning her.

404
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:29,923
Well, they shouldn't be
questioning lucy.

405
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,346
That's the whole point.

406
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,571
They should just
leave her alone.

407
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:33,786
Is that why you've been
doing all this,

408
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,750
Because you think
you're protecting her?

409
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,781
I always have.

410
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,062
I'm her brother.
I've got her six.

411
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:42,489
Thomas, please tell me
what it is that you're
protecting her from.

412
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,471
I can help you.

413
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:45,707
No, you can't.
No one can.

414
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:46,820
But if you don't
tell me,

415
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,951
I'm gonna have
to find out myself,

416
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,232
And what if
i'm too late?

417
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:51,139
You stay away from her.
I'm warning you.

418
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,726
Why won't you let me
help her?

419
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:54,451
We all got our secrets.

420
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:56,112
Including you.

421
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,901
Melinda: lucy?

422
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,356
Can i talk to you
for a minute?

423
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:17,725
Talk if you want.

424
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:21,161
I know ned told you
he believes in ghosts.

425
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,373
I really wish
he hadn't done that,

426
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,693
Because it doesn't
do you any good
unless i can prove it.

427
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,942
Oh, you're gonna
prove it to me?

428
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,451
I will if i have to.

429
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:31,197
But i think you
already know.

430
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:32,261
Really? How's that?

431
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,750
I think you've felt
his presence.

432
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,611
And i'm not just talking
about the weird things
that keep happening.

433
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:43,298
I want to know
why thomas needs
to have your six.

434
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,050
What?

435
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:45,410
I didn't know
what it meant,

436
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,435
So i looked it up,

437
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:49,291
And it's what
a fighter pilot
says to another

438
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,463
When he's covering his tail,
"i've got your six."

439
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,766
How did you know
thomas said that?

440
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,576
Because he said it
to me.

441
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:58,417
What do you want from me?

442
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,732
I want to know what
it is that thomas is
protecting you from.

443
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,755
Why he is so mad
at brad and krista,

444
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,429
So that i can get him
into the light
where he belongs.

445
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,635
Lucy, please.
Just tell me what happened

446
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:12,642
Between him and krista.
Were they seeing each other?

447
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:15,084
Did he send those emails?

448
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,068
Hi. Justin yates.

449
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,179
Justin who?

450
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,858
You don't remember me.

451
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,236
Yeah, why would you.

452
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:43,947
Um, ok, uh, blogger?
In shame of the devil?

453
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,394
We met after you won
that plaque from the town
for, uh, saving those kids.

454
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,837
Ok, smile.

455
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,934
Oh.

456
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:58,939
What do you want?

457
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:02,769
Well, i got this
really strange email
a few hours ago.

458
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:03,652
Ok.

459
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,619
So why don't you just
post it on your blog

460
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,914
And i'll read it
when i get a chance.

461
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,924
I know my blog
isn't exactly cnn.Com.

462
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,938
But a lot of your friends
and a lot of your customers
probably check it out.

463
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,692
And you know how
the internet is.

464
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:18,399
Once something
starts to spread...

465
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,514
What are you
talking about?

466
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:22,367
Here. I'll show you.

467
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:34,900
This is a video of me
rehearsing a fight
i had with my husband.

468
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,491
Yeah, you know,
i thought you would
say that.

469
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:37,581
Uh, the one problem is,

470
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,911
The video made my hamster
jump on the wheel, you know?

471
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,340
And, uh, remembered
these files

472
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,612
I kind of borrowed
from professor payne
a while back.

473
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:50,383
They were encrypted,

474
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:52,430
And i'd given up
on trying to decode them

475
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,431
Until tonight.

476
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:56,342
What's in the files,
justin?

477
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:57,995
In a nutshell?

478
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,032
You see ghosts.

479
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:02,062
And you believe that?

480
00:24:02,062 --> 00:24:03,866
Not so much, really,
until i noticed

481
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:06,751
Something about the email
that the video
was attached to.

482
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:10,506
Whoever sent me this clip,
their computer doesn't have
an ip address.

483
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,984
And in case you don't know,
that's not possible.

484
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,595
Not in this world,
at least.

485
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,965
The world of the living.

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,834
Wait a minute, um...

487
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:21,443
What is it
that you want, exactly?

488
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,030
Well, in my business,

489
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,753
Usually when someone
sends this kind of message,

490
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:27,393
Someone wants you
to stop looking

491
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:28,929
Wherever it is you're looking.

492
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,409
So you just wanted
to give me a warning?

493
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,675
Yeah, and, uh, maybe a little
professional courtesy,

494
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,604
In case you find anything
interesting you want to share.

495
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,247
Well, thanks...

496
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:39,770
For the warning.

497
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,806
Good night.

498
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,793
You're welcome

499
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,368
Guilty, guilty,
i'm guilty!

500
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,067
What do you want from me?
I told you i'm guilty!

501
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:56,368
What were you thinking?

502
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,167
Keeping records
of things that
i said to you,

503
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,867
Things that i told you
because i thought
that you could be trusted.

504
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,467
And don't even tell me
that they were encrypted,

505
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,050
Because we both know
how little that's worth.

506
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,567
All right, think back.

507
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,666
You come to me,
i don't know you
from adam.

508
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,958
And all the things
that i've been studying
and wondering about,

509
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:11,515
And between you and i,
starting to doubt,

510
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:12,167
All of a sudden
they're real?!

511
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,433
But why write it down?

512
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,967
[Sighs] look, because
it was so amazing,

513
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,656
I had to make sure
i wasn't dreaming it!

514
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:18,892
This was huge stuff!

515
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:19,634
For you,
it's an old hat,

516
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,628
But let's not forget
that i'm an academic,

517
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,301
And you're sweet,
kind, caring,

518
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,970
Forgiving melinda,
right?

519
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,714
Don't i have an
obligation as my job

520
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,931
To write down
what i observe?

521
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,613
Remember, you're--

522
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:32,734
You're sweet, kind,
forgiving melinda.

523
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,101
Do you have any idea
what this could do
to my life?

524
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,939
Oh, come on, melinda!
What are you afraid of?

525
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,800
Everyone you help,
they already know
that you see ghosts!

526
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,802
I am afraid
of people like you.

527
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:42,934
Of becoming a case study

528
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,201
So that people can
understand things

529
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,700
That can't be
understood.

530
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,134
And while i'm under
that microscope,

531
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,491
I can't even help
the spirits that
actually need me.

532
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:51,332
You've really
thought this through,
haven't you?

533
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,713
My whole life.

534
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:57,625
Hey, ned,
what's going on?

535
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,810
Is that ned?
Tell him i'm here.

536
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,315
It's professor payne, ned.
Put me on--

537
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,101
Ned, could you please
say that again,

538
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,734
Because i had
someone very annoying
distracting me.

539
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,467
Ned: lucy just told the school
she did all those hauntings.

540
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,934
The scoreboard,
the bleachers,

541
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,301
The bat in krista's car,
everything.

542
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,176
What? Why would
she do that?

543
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:15,000
It's like she's trying
to protect thomas.

544
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,415
Thomas is a ghost.
What is she protecting him
from, purgatory?

545
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,268
Wait, will you just
call me back if you get
anything else? Bye.

546
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:21,937
I don't get it.

547
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:23,467
Thomas says that
he's protecting her,

548
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:25,085
She's acting like
she's protecting him.

549
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,364
What are they protecting
each other from?

550
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:28,253
Have you asked krista?

551
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,324
No. She won't return
my phone calls.

552
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,667
All right, well,
ever since brad confessed,

553
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:34,191
Maybe she has
a lot less to hide.

554
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,657
Hi, krista,
i'm melinda.

555
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:40,811
I know who you are.

556
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:43,606
Um, i've been trying
to talk to you.

557
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,739
Wow. Do you have, like,
zero comprehension
of the word "no?"

558
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,774
I do, but did thomas?

559
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:49,642
Thomas?

560
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:51,101
Yeah, i'm not trying to
blame you for anything.

561
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,236
I mean, i'm sure
if you hurt
thomas' feelings,

562
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:54,045
You didn't mean to.

563
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,903
No, i didn't do
anything to thomas.

564
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:59,195
Ok, we had a couple
conversations about bats.

565
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,813
That's it.

566
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:01,254
Well, you were
writing to each other.

567
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,307
It's no secret
that the two of you
were involved.

568
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:05,497
I mean,
the entire school
got that email.

569
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,018
No, those emails
weren't from thomas, ok?

570
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,846
So just drop it.

571
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,062
Well, how can you
be so sure?

572
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,044
They weren't even
signed.

573
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,129
Because, i've written back
since he died,

574
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:17,205
And...

575
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,584
I haven't got a response yet,

576
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,896
But whoever was writing me
opened them.

577
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,365
So if thomas wasn't
writing them, then who?

578
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:24,916
I don't know!

579
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,664
I gotta go.

580
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,352
Wait a minute.
So krista's protecting
thomas, too?

581
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:34,143
Protecting or stonewalling.

582
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:36,932
She's insisting those emails
were not from him.

583
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,605
Or maybe she's just
embarrassed

584
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,457
That she was cheating
on her boyfriend
with guano boy.

585
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:43,242
I'm not calling names.

586
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:46,209
I'm just trying
to put it in perspective.
High school perspective.

587
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:48,300
So assuming that krista
was telling the truth,

588
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,961
And if he wasn't
writing those emails,
who was?

589
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:55,694
Maybe there's some clue
to who sent them
in the emails.

590
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:58,091
You're right!

591
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,539
You're right,
that's all
we have to do.

592
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:00,877
Do you still have
that email
on your phone?

593
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,600
The one the ghost
was texting everyone?

594
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,301
Yeah, but it didn't say much.
That's ok.

595
00:28:04,368 --> 00:28:05,734
Little blogger
friend of mine

596
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,834
Taught me that one
is all it takes.

597
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,544
Professor rick payne
in apologetic servitude.

598
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:16,170
Melinda: good.

599
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,514
I'm gonna forward you
an email,

600
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:18,867
And i need you
to use the ip address

601
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,433
To track down the location
of the computer that
originally sent then.

602
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,172
Can you do that?
Sure.

603
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:25,268
Yeah, i mean i know a geek
who knows a geek.

604
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:26,800
I knew you would.

605
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:30,061
Remember to tell
your mom

606
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,533
That we did not spend
the whole evening
talking about ghosts.

607
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,641
I helped you with
your homework, too.

608
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:36,532
Yeah, that was intense.

609
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:39,638
How much you know about
measuring volumes and planes.

610
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:40,400
[Cell phone rings]
hello?

611
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,879
Rick: all right,
i can get you

612
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,132
The internet service provider
and the physical address

613
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,136
Of the computer's location.
No user name, though.

614
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,430
I would need
a court order for that.

615
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,787
Yeah, but you've already
got the address?

616
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:50,974
Yeah, do you have a pen?

617
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,888
Uh, yeah. Ok,
write this down.

618
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,768
So whoever answers the door
sent those emails to krista?

619
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:19,551
I feel for him,
whoever he is.

620
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,867
Hi.

621
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,167
Lucy?

622
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,110
Yeah, this is
my house.

623
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,067
Are you looking
for someone else?

624
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:35,691
Not any more

625
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,746
Now's not really
a good time.

626
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,066
Lucy? Who is it?

627
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,528
Dad, this is
ned and melinda.

628
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,667
They're...from school.

629
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:50,922
Why don't you
come inside?

630
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,743
Um, we're sorry
to bother you.

631
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:58,762
We were just hoping
that we could talk to
lucy for a few minutes.

632
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,931
What about?

633
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,594
This is
my wife jill.

634
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,605
This is melinda
and--

635
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,488
Ned. Hi.
Hi.

636
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,756
Is this about the trouble
lucy's in?

637
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,549
In a way.

638
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:12,763
It's ok. I can talk to them.
We'll just go outside.

639
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,076
No, i don't
think so, honey.

640
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,513
Our daughter's
all but been branded
a serial killer

641
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,411
Because some kids
reprogrammed
the scoreboard.

642
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:19,321
Dad...

643
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,057
I don't believe
for a second
you did that.

644
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,731
I don't care what
you told the police
or your teachers.

645
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,360
Well, i actually believe
that lucy's innocent, also.

646
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:30,132
In fact, i know it.

647
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,795
Why don't we all
sit down?

648
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:39,931
How do you know that?

649
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:42,558
It's about
the letters you wrote.

650
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,714
Emails, actually.

651
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:48,576
The ones you wrote
to that kid you like.

652
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:49,489
That kid?

653
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:52,188
There's this girl
i was into.

654
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:57,217
If you're here
as someone concerned

655
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,054
About some inappropriate
relationships--

656
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,000
No, actually,
we're just here as friends.

657
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,678
They're here
because of thomas.

658
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:05,008
Because he wasn't
ok with it.

659
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,819
Not really...anyway.

660
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,599
Lucy, what are you
talking about?

661
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,525
The night thomas died.

662
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:12,136
"Meet me at 8:00.

663
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,414
"If you can't
make it, forget it.

664
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,626
I've waited
too long."
Signed krista.

665
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,165
Are you out
of your mind?

666
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,129
Where did you get that?

667
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:20,075
You saved it on the hard drive.
The hard drive that we share.

668
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,712
It's private.

669
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:21,988
Krista eisenberg.

670
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:25,018
She is beautiful,
she's a senior,

671
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:27,525
And, oh, what's one
little key ingredient

672
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,527
Missing in your wacky
lesbian fantasy?

673
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:30,400
She's not gay.

674
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,688
We were posting
on the same blog!

675
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,959
She responded to me.
She wanted my email,

676
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,040
And she's the one
who kept it going.

677
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,331
But you never told her
who you are.

678
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:38,588
You never gave her
your name.

679
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:39,534
She likes me.

680
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:41,795
She doesn't even know
she's writing to a girl!

681
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,727
I think she does.
Oh, why?

682
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,463
Because of little things
that she said.

683
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:48,864
Different stuff
that you wouldn't understand.

684
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:49,773
You can't do this.

685
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,980
Ok? You're comitting
social suicide.

686
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:55,556
Once she sees you,
she's gonna realize
that you tricked her,

687
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:57,041
And she's gonna
be pissed.

688
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:59,184
If she doesn't want
to be with me,
she can tell me,

689
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,407
And i'll handle it.
Can you handle

690
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:02,449
What she's going
to write about you
in the slam book?

691
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:03,881
What her friends
are going to write
about you?

692
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:04,909
Once you're a target,

693
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,549
Everyone's gonna
take a shot.

694
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:07,942
People that don't
even know you.

695
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,547
They're gonna
terrorize you
every day.

696
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:12,811
For the rest
of high school.

697
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:16,886
Lucy, we have got
to undo this

698
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:19,148
Before it gets out.

699
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,307
We're supposed to meet.

700
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,493
I'll go.

701
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,338
Ok? I'll figure
something out.

702
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,880
Ok?

703
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,066
The whole thing
was a set up.

704
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:45,083
Forget her.

705
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,704
Why would krista
do that?

706
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:47,725
She's the one
who kept emailing.

707
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,626
She's the one
who wanted to meet.

708
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:49,745
Why would she
send brad?

709
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,733
I don't--I don't know.
Maybe she got off of

710
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:54,300
Makin' him, like...
jealous or something.

711
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,157
Or she thought
that, uh, maybe...

712
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,953
What?

713
00:32:57,988 --> 00:32:58,774
I don't know,

714
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,314
That the whole thing
was just kind of a joke.

715
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,282
But your brother
was lying to you.

716
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,743
Krista never even knew
about the meeting.

717
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,548
What?
Brad never told her.

718
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,408
He sent that email
himself,

719
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:15,393
But he never
told krista that.

720
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,509
Why was thomas
so mad at krista?

721
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:19,365
Because...

722
00:33:19,386 --> 00:33:22,907
He thought she never
meant anything
she put in the emails.

723
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:26,692
He was sure you were
getting set up.

724
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,092
He thought he was
protecting me.

725
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:33,196
He had my six.

726
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:36,964
Mom and dad,
i am so sorry.

727
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,410
I should have never
let him go.

728
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:40,199
Oh, baby.

729
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:42,042
No one meant
for it to happen.

730
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,214
No, the county is not
charging brad,

731
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:45,481
And they shouldn't.

732
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,088
It was all an accident.

733
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,395
What about all those
things that happened
at the schl?

734
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,157
Are you saying
you did it because
you're angry?

735
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,042
No, your son was.

736
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:54,644
Lucy took the blame
for those things

737
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,951
Because she was tired
of everybody asking
what really happened.

738
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:00,641
Ok, now i'm really confused.

739
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:04,220
But lucy never was
confused.

740
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,766
She knew who she was,
and who she loved,

741
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,939
And she wasn't
ashamed of it.

742
00:34:08,974 --> 00:34:11,110
And mom and dad
were ok with that.

743
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:13,984
Just like they were ok
with me being the freak kid

744
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,812
Who hung out
with the bats all day.

745
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,528
Thomas is here.

746
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,547
His spirit.

747
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:23,817
What are you talking about?

748
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:28,304
He says that you loved
both of your children

749
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:31,402
Just for who they were.

750
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,800
They were cool
about everything,

751
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,043
But they have no idea
what it's like now,

752
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,602
For anyone who's different.

753
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:42,217
They take a few words
and, like,oison
your whole world.

754
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,383
He's worried
about lucy.

755
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:47,612
All the damage that
the internet can do,

756
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:50,056
Spreading
cruel words around.

757
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,206
I mean, look at my sister.

758
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,978
She's pretty, and smart,
and funny.

759
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,483
Everyone likes her.

760
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:00,056
No one had to know
that lucy was different.

761
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,661
He's saying
that you could have
blended in--

762
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:03,866
If you wanted to.

763
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,993
You mean if i chose to.

764
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:10,393
In my heart,
i wanted her to change.

765
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:14,507
But i was the one
that needed to change.

766
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,778
I was just trying
to look out for you,

767
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:21,799
But i realize now
that that's not
what you needed.

768
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:26,643
What you needed was me
to see you and to love you
for who you are.

769
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,914
He loves you.

770
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:36,977
He always did.

771
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:41,140
And he doesn't
want you to be anything
but who you are.

772
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,246
I love him, too.

773
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:49,283
I love you, thomas.

774
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:55,975
Come on.

775
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:03,623
Do you see the light?

776
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,014
Not yet.

777
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:08,634
I got one or two things
to take care of first.

778
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:42,248
So now they think somehow

779
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,752
That the computer
on the scoreboard

780
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,604
Looped into
the school server,

781
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,989
Like it was just
some wires that crossed,

782
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:48,756
Messed everything up.

783
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,519
So thomas set things right.
That's great.

784
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:52,602
Yeah.

785
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,361
And lucy's off the hook.

786
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,433
Excuse me.

787
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,069
Oh, man. She's pissed
about the ghost thing.

788
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:06,504
Do you want me
to go talk to her?

789
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,098
No, it's ok.
I can handle it.

790
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,158
Hey, mom?

791
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:24,868
Be mad at me, ok?

792
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,649
Not melinda.

793
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,453
I'm the one
that pushed her to help.

794
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:33,805
I'm not mad
at anybody.

795
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:36,688
I'm just proud of you

796
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:39,515
For wanting
to help your friend.

797
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,812
Lucy?

798
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,788
She's not really my friend.
She called me "ted."

799
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:45,548
You see,
that's what i mean.

800
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,626
You didn't care what
anybody might call you.

801
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:50,700
You still stuck
your neck out anyway.

802
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,019
Your sweet,

803
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:53,054
Beautiful neck.

804
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,974
I used to kiss it
when i put you to bed.

805
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:00,694
That was just
a second ago, ned.

806
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:03,665
And now you're all
grown up.

807
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,000
I am...

808
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,233
So proud of the man
that you are becoming.

809
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,556
Lucy: hey.

810
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,793
Me?

811
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,463
Ned, yeah, hi.

812
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,953
How have you been?

813
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:28,974
Good. Good, you know,

814
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:30,518
School, life.

815
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:35,227
Um, that was
a cool thing you did,

816
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,732
Telling me about
what you believe.

817
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,089
I know i didn't
make it easy.

818
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,720
Do you want to sit?

819
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,483
Yeah. Yeah, ok.

820
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:52,209
So has your friend
seen my brother around?

821
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,631
No, but he might
still be here.

822
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,913
Usually she sees them
cross over.

823
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,706
Hey.

824
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,414
Hi.

825
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:09,234
I got your email.

826
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:10,867
My email?

827
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:12,630
Yeah?

828
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:19,209
Wait, don't tell me
that it wasn't for me.

829
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:20,647
This is weird enough
already.

830
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:24,643
No, i just--I didn't...

831
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:28,596
Don't be shy.
Just admit it.

832
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:33,898
The web works
in mysterious ways.

833
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,842
Wow.

834
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:41,527
Busted.

835
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:44,478
Thanks for all
your emails.

836
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,426
So you knew?

837
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,157
Not for sure.

838
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:50,434
But, um...
i hoped.

839
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,176
You did
a good thing.

840
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,943
I worry about her.

841
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,860
I don't.

842
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:06,628
She looks like
she has good friends.

843
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:18,649
The light...

844
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,555
What's it like in there?

845
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,186
I've heard good things.

846
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:30,613
But don't go by me.

847
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,917
Maybe you should
go check it out
for yourself.

848
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,902
Justin.

849
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,879
Oh, uh...

850
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:08,154
Hey. Um,

851
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,830
I'm not stalking you,
i swear.

852
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,289
You said it, i didn't.

853
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:16,775
Ahh, did you ever find out
who emailed me that video
from the security camera?

854
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,447
Nope.

855
00:41:17,482 --> 00:41:20,211
It's like you said,
no ip address.

856
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:23,837
You got your secrets,
that's cool.

857
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:26,731
It's just, you know,
it's hard not ask about
the ones i know about.

858
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:29,549
Like your travels
underneath the town.

859
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:30,424
In the tunnels

860
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:34,001
Under our beloved,
perhaps haunted, town.

861
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,957
Is that professor payne's
theory?

862
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:38,074
Look, i don't want
to out you.

863
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,353
Ok, i know what
that could do
