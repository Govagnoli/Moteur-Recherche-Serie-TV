1
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,268
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,968
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:14,555
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,332
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,153
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,505
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

8
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,213
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

9
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,551
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

10
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:29,943
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

11
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:34,195
<i>because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.</i>

12
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:36,166
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

13
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,026
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

14
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,821
Andrea. Melinda.

15
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,320
Sit over there.

16
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,162
Oh.

17
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:56,482
Hello.

18
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,221
Welcome to room 3's talent night.

19
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,532
One of our students, Dillon Cho,

20
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,140
has written a very imaginative play.

21
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:06,962
We hope you enjoy room 3's production of

22
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,412
"Ghost at the crossing."

23
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,182
You know what they say: "Write what you know."

24
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm so bored. My dad has gone away, and my mom's too busy to even talk to me.

25
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:26,600
Hi.

26
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:27,633
Wanna play?

27
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:28,662
Who are you?

28
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:29,733
I'm a ghost.

29
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:30,760
No way.

30
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,523
Wanna come to the railroad tracks?

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,920
I'm really not supposed to.

32
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:35,970
Oh, come on.

33
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,351
We can put pennies on the tracks and watch 'em get squished.

34
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,020
Melinda, help me.

35
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,393
Scene 2: The railroad tracks.

36
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,981
- Boo.
- Hey.

37
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,010
- How was work?
- Busy.

38
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,240
How was the play?

39
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:05,191
Spookier than I expected actually.

40
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,192
Good for Dillon.

41
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:09,660
I haven't had a chance to look through this new training manual, so

42
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,061
I'm just gonna go do it downstairs.

43
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:11,960
No. Stay.

44
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:13,943
I can sleep with the lights on.

45
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:15,040
All right.

46
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:17,520
Hey, I forgot. Your mom called this morning.

47
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,333
What did she want?

48
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:22,712
I don't know. She didn't say.

49
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,812
I'm thinking maybe it's birthday related.

50
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:28,002
Well, you're not gonna plan anything, right? Promise me.

51
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,440
We're not planning anything.

52
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:30,343
We?

53
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:31,470
Me.

54
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:32,872
No one. No one is. Promise.

55
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:33,950
Right.

56
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,513
- 'Cause you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do.

57
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,652
Although I was kind of hoping this year you might be over it.

58
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:41,550
I'm not.

59
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:46,840
You ok?

60
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:48,311
Yeah. I'm just tired.

61
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,913
Mel, I know you have some issues with your mom.

62
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:55,982
And this birthday thing...

63
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,231
- You wanna talk about it?
- What's there to talk about?

64
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,661
Single mother didn't do a very good job. Pretty common story.

65
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,903
But she raised a pretty uncommon daughter.

66
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,953
Yeah, that's part of the problem.

67
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,522
Melinda.

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,112
Melinda.

69
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,312
Do I know you?

70
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,471
Why didn't you help me?

71
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:07,930
Who are you?

72
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,462
Don't you know?

73
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,093
- Trouble sleeping?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,682
Big trouble.

75
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:22,590
<i>Can you see us?</i>

76
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:50,002

77
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,641
We're just open. Come on in.

78
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,132
Hi.

79
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,630
Do you see someone in the store?

80
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:40,583
Um...

81
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:41,543
customer.

82
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:42,451
Besides her.

83
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:43,882
No.

84
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,522
Wow.

85
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:48,781
It  must've been Dillon's play.

86
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,303
I just got the weirdest feeling, like...

87
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,350
like someone was watching me.

88
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:56,283
Can a civilian catch a ghost vibe like that?

89
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,562
A civilian?

90
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,102
Well, maybe, but it'd have to be a pretty powerful ghost.

91
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:02,691
Excuse me. How much is this?

92
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,910
I just thought I'd wind them up.

93
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:23,792
I bet you thought they were antiques.

94
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:28,612
Oh, god.

95
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,893
I can't do this. Just get in the house.

96
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:51,551
Children,

97
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:52,480
I have something

98
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,360
very, very sad to tell you.

99
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:01,702
Some of you may know that Sarah Applewhite has been ill this year.

100
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,120
This morning,

101
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:15,460
her parents called to tell me that Sarah passed away last night.

102
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,311
I know this is

103
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:19,711
kind of a shock.

104
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:23,172
So if any of you want to talk about it further,

105
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm here for you.

106
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:30,522
Yes, Melinda.

107
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,822
Mrs. Riley, Sarah's not dead.

108
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,070
She's standing right over there.

109
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,291
Shh.

110
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:42,093
I wanna talk to my mom and dad.

111
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,500
Then why don't you go talk to them?

112
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,481
I can't find them.

113
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,433
That's because you're at school.

114
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,033
Go look in your house.

115
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:51,890
Melinda, this isn't funny.

116
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:53,491
You heard her.

117
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,553
She can't find her parents.

118
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,471
Why aren't you helping her?

119
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,131
That's enough, Melinda.

120
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,850
Are you saying you don't see her?

121
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,051
I don't believe you.

122
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:13,230
If you don't stop this, I'll have to send you to Mr. Corbett.

123
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:14,380
Why are you all lying?

124
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,293
She's right in front of you.

125
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:29,362
Oh,  I am so sorry. I was in the middle of my shift, and the traffic was horrendous.

126
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,582
Then I had to take the bridge, which made it even worse.

127
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,431
- It's fine.
- Sweetie, what's wrong?

128
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:34,802
Are you sick?

129
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,170
No. At least we don't think so.

130
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,122
I don't know if you've heard this, but

131
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,293
one of Melinda's classmates has passed away.

132
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:42,503
Oh, no.

133
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,753
- Sarah Applewhite?
- That's right.

134
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:50,470
- Oh, sweetie. I am so sorry.
- No, mom. They're wrong.

135
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,801
Sarah's alive. I saw her.

136
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,620
And nobody believes me.

137
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,420
She's been saying this all morning. It's upsetting her classmates.

138
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,430
Some of the other parents have had to come down.

139
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm so sorry.

140
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,411
Well, she's just...

141
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,852
- she's just emotional.
- But it's true.

142
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:09,852
We thought it might be a good idea for Melinda to go home for the day, maybe rest.

143
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,750
- Of course. You're right.
- But, mommy, you have to believe me.

144
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,925
I am so sorry. Come on, Melinda.

145
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:24,746
Mom.

146
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:28,306
Mom, why won't you talk to me about Sarah?

147
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,453
It isn't fair.

148
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:31,823
Melinda,

149
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,291
please stop doing this.

150
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:37,500
I suffered through years of it with my mother. I'm not gonna go through it again.

151
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:38,401
Go through what?

152
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:39,911
What are you talking about?

153
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,353
I can't do this.

154
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,101
Just  go to your room, Melinda. Go on.

155
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,681
Sarah.

156
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,413
It was just

157
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:08,170
amazing how it all flooded back to me, how confused I was, how scared.

158
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:11,031
I had no idea why I could see this girl and no one else could.

159
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,653
I thought your grandmother had told you about all this.

160
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,551
Not until later.

161
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,841
My mom was so angry and embarrassed about the whole thing,

162
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:18,890
she kept it a secret like we were trying to make her miserable.

163
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:19,990
You know I hate that.

164
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,092
I hate that that it happened to you. I wanna go back in time,

165
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,840
and I wanna find that little girl,

166
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:26,940
make her feel better.

167
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,281
You know what? You do.

168
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,191
Every day.

169
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,512
I'm stealing these.

170
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,641
All right, so, uh, what are you gonna do about Sarah?

171
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:35,710
Well, she was shy.

172
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:39,120
I remember that. So that can get a bit tricky. And ghosts have no idea

173
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,661
how much time is going by, so I'm gonna have to go looking for her.

174
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,113
Cool. Your first ghost hunt.

175
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,762
Yeah. And if she's like most ghosts, she'll be haunting places that are familiar to her.

176
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:48,593
Which means?

177
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:50,143
Which means I have to go home.

178
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:02,622
It isn't fair.

179
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,482
Just get in the house right now.

180
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:31,831
Mrs. Riley?

181
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:36,421
I hope that you remember me. Melinda Gordon.

182
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:38,630
Oh!

183
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,042
Of course.

184
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:41,521
Melinda!

185
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,962
Look at you. You're all grown up.

186
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,042
You look just radiant.

187
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:47,482
Life must be agreeing with you.

188
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:48,380
So far.

189
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:50,661
- You look great, too.
- Oh, aren't you kind.

190
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,632
What brings you back?

191
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:56,732
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about a little girl in my class.

192
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,290
I know it's been a long time.

193
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,311
But do you remember Sarah Applewhite?

194
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:01,793
Yeah, I do.

195
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:03,711
It was terribly sad.

196
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,212
Do you remember my reaction that day?

197
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:10,792
I do.

198
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,820
Little children have big imaginations.

199
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:15,740
So don't you be embarrassed.

200
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:19,210
It undoubtedly was your way of processing your grief.

201
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:20,970
Right.

202
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,142
I was wondering do you know what happened to Sarah's parents.

203
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:27,302
Because I tried to look them up in the Hamilton phone book, but they were unlisted.

204
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,653
They broke up shortly after Sarah passed away.

205
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,971
You know, I understand that it often happens when a couple loses a child.

206
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,071
Do you know where either one of them went?

207
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,503
No, sweetheart, I don't.

208
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:40,801
And if I did once, it's gone now.

209
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,582
Time is a funny thing, isn't it?

210
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,020
Yeah.

211
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:49,051
It sure is.

212
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,450
I'm running out of time.

213
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:04,711
Sarah?

214
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,942
Come  on, Chloe. You're gonna miss the bus.

215
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,051
Ok, I'm coming.

216
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:15,120
I looked everywhere. All the places we used to hang out as kids. She was nowhere.

217
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,983
Just that one glimpse, and that was it.

218
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,590
- Can these be engraved?
- What?

219
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:20,740
These soaps-- can I have them monogrammed?

220
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,442
Why would you wanna do that?

221
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,140
Yes. Actually,

222
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:28,011
I know a place on-line that'll do that. I will write down the web site for you.

223
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:30,283
I think something triggered her reappearance--

224
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:34,381
something that she's not aware of. And all I have to do-- hey, we've got lotions.

225
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:35,381
Back there.

226
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:36,671
I'm not interested.

227
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:41,253
Ok. This is their web site. And they will monogram anything. Just e-mail them.

228
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,323
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

229
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:45,971
Melinda,

230
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,592
that was a customer.

231
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:49,222
Oh, what did I say? You know what I can't figure out?

232
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,720
Is why she's being so elusive, 'cause she was shy

233
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,251
when she was a kid. But it's like a constant game of hide-and-seek with her.

234
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,953
Well, maybe she's self-conscious.

235
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,352
Andrea, ghosts are not self-conscious.

236
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,503
Melinda.

237
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:05,910
Melinda, you can see me, can't you?

238
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:08,092
I know you can.

239
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:12,353
- Why aren't you talking to me?
- Go away. You'll get me in trouble.

240
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:15,322
Well, talk to me first.

241
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,020
Melinda.

242
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,571
Why are you wearing your nightgown in school?

243
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:31,760
Oh, my god. You're right.

244
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,452
You're right. She is self-conscious.

245
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:37,612
That's why she disappeared when I pointed out that she was in her nightgown.

246
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:38,510
You're  a genius.

247
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:39,812
Thank you.

248
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:43,303
Now can we move these dolls 'cause they are freaking me out.

249
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:49,652
Oh, bedtime already. The things I have to do.

250
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:53,412
You stay and study. I have to meet someone in the bedroom.

251
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:54,592
Say again?

252
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,642
My little friend.

253
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:56,701
Oh.

254
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,480
What makes you think she's gonna come?

255
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:01,750
I'm playing a hunch. See ya.

256
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,400
Sarah.

257
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:09,712
It's me.

258
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,100
Melinda.

259
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:12,862
Nobody's here but me.

260
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,952
Can we talk for a second?

261
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,493
So...

262
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:19,301
here I am

263
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:22,683
getting ready for bed in my nightgown. Just like you.

264
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:25,612
Shoot.

265
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,282
Hey, you know,

266
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:31,910
why don't you come visit me and it'll be like a... like a sleepover.

267
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:34,912
Or not.

268
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,231
You know ghosts don't sleep.

269
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,862
So you know you're a ghost.

270
00:16:58,926 --> 00:16:59,822
Well,

271
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,082
I don't feel sick anymore,

272
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:05,290
and I'm wandering around for like 2 days.

273
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,250
Ok. So

274
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,200
when you look at me, do I look older to you?

275
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,312
Why? Is it your birthday?

276
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:18,902
It will be on friday.

277
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,042
You'll be 9. Like me.

278
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,293
9. Right.

279
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,462
Why were you so mean to me yesterday, Melinda?

280
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,341
You didn't talk to me at all.

281
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,400
I am... I am so sorry.

282
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:35,873
It was just...

283
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:37,213
you know.

284
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:41,342
It was math. I didn't wanna make Mrs. Riley mad.

285
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:42,541
Yeah.

286
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:43,782
She's pretty strict.

287
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,900
So what did you wanna talk to me about? Are you trying to find the light?

288
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:49,902
Oh, no.

289
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,601
I see the light. It's over there.

290
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,562
Well, then why don't you go into it?

291
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:57,472
You'd probably feel more at home over there.

292
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,583
I can't. I'm worried.

293
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:01,283
About what?

294
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:04,452
My mom and dad.

295
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:10,301
I could hear them getting into a big fight the other night outside my door in the hospital.

296
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:11,761
And it was really scary.

297
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,703
They sounded like they hated each other.

298
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,801
I bet they were just worried about you.

299
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,703
I went back home.

300
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,920
Some other family lives there now.

301
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,903
They got scared when I tried to make them talk to me.

302
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,260
I bet.

303
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,791
So

304
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,763
I don't wanna do that light thing

305
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,673
till I know where my mom and dad are.

306
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,082
And I'm running out of time.

307
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:38,683
What are their names?

308
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,433
Jack and Grace.

309
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:42,573
Daddy build the buildings,

310
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,683
and mommy--

311
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:45,742
Damn it. Sarah.

312
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,063
He lived in Hamilton.

313
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,391
Is it the same Jack Applewhite?

314
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,003
It is.

315
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,171
Hey. I don't think we're gonna be able to do Melinda's party.

316
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:09,870
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

317
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,020
I don't get it. She's not vain in any way.

318
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:13,760
Why does she dislike her birthday so much?

319
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,412
Something to do with her mother.

320
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,630
They had a falling-out before we ever got together.

321
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,131
I've only met the woman myself a couple of times.

322
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,162
If the past is any indication, until this birthday thing is over,

323
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:26,111
we're going to have a very gloomy Melinda. Brace yourself.

324
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,953
Jack Applewhite is an architect.

325
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,722
I thought he was a contractor. Then I looked up "architects." There he was.

326
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,770
Sarah is gonna be so excited that I found him.

327
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,093
I have an appointment to meet with him at 2:00.

328
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,893
Can we have lunch tomorrow instead?

329
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:38,273
Yeah. Uh,

330
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,673
sure.

331
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:40,971
- Ok. Bye.
- Bye.

332
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,751
Or she's gonna be really happy.

333
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,762
Excuse me.

334
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,480
My appointment with Mr. Applewhite was at 2:00, and it's now 2:45.

335
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,132
I'm sorry. He's running a little bit late.

336
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,472
Ok. I just have to get back to work.

337
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:09,170
Marie, change of plans. I have a 3:00 with the board.

338
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,990
- Mr. Applewhite, Hi.
- Yes.

339
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,911
I'm Melinda Gordon. I had a 2:00 appointment.

340
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,381
I'm very sorry. You'll have to reschedule. I have a meeting across town.

341
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,323
Actually, I've come on a personal matter.

342
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,962
Tell Marie I said to give you whatever time you want.

343
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,113
I went to school with your daughter Sarah.

344
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:26,963
You knew Sarah?

345
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:30,492
Yeah.

346
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,241
We were in the 4th grade together.

347
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:37,982
Sarah would be just your age.

348
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:43,532
What's this about?

349
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:45,972
Well, I, uh...

350
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,773
had a dream

351
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:50,192
the other night about Sarah, and

352
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,611
then I kept thinking I was seeing her everywhere.

353
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,850
It happens to me, too. Has for years.

354
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:57,602
And then last night,

355
00:20:58,866 --> 00:20:59,780
I saw Sarah.

356
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,622
What?

357
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:06,573
She's coming to me.

358
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:08,482
Not just in

359
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,692
dreams. I can see her spirit.

360
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:13,140
I see.

361
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,760
That's very interesting. Good luck with that.

362
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,213
Mr. Applewhite, I'm serious.

363
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:20,832
Well, I'm very late. And, um,

364
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,571
like I said before, why don't you just call my assistant--

365
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:26,922
Oh No. Don't tell me...

366
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:30,342
- what the hell.
- Melinda, don't let him leave.

367
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:31,842
You have to make him believe.

368
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:34,303
What have you done to this elevator?

369
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,163
Nothing. Nothing. I swear.

370
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:37,450
Sarah's here.

371
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:39,332
Don't say "Sarah." Say "Cookie."

372
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,342
Cookie.

373
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,341
Because I liked oreo cookies.

374
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:46,742
She loves oreos, and you called her "cookie monster," and you shortened it.

375
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:50,461
He remembers.

376
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:53,841
Who are you? How are you doing this?

377
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,070
How are you doing this?

378
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,671
I swear, Mr. Applewhite, I just

379
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:58,510
wanna help Sarah.

380
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,781
It's easy to say someone was the love of your life.

381
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:07,193
Didn't even come close to Grace and me.

382
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:08,542
She knew everything about me.

383
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:09,740
Good, bad, indifferent.

384
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:14,312
We were poor together, successful together.

385
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:16,831
We let each other down, propped each other up.

386
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,283
I  could never figure out how I got so lucky.

387
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,650
Then we had Sarah. It was like a fairy tale.

388
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,502
Then Sarah got sick.

389
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,752
It became unbearable watching her...

390
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,450
waste away watching her suffer.

391
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:42,840
We saw it every time we looked at her. We saw it every time we looked at each other.

392
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,640
And pretty soon, we just stopped...

393
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:46,613
looking at each other.

394
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,962
Sarah said that you were, um...

395
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:55,391
arguing outside her hospital room the night before she died.

396
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:56,750
She heard us?

397
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:00,420
I didn't even know she was conscious.

398
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,883
What were you arguing about?

399
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:03,482
This new treatment.

400
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,820
It was experimental. I wanted Sarah to try it.

401
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:09,310
Grace was against it.

402
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:11,261
She felt

403
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:13,692
Sarah's little body had been through enough.

404
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:15,532
Of course she was right.

405
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:19,781
The treatment had side effects we didn't even know about then.

406
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,261
If I had known she could hear us...

407
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,282
She's been trying to find you.

408
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:31,772
I know you're divorce, but I didn't know what to say to her.

409
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,380
I never got over what happened.

410
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,543
I never got over Grace.

411
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:38,953
Then...

412
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:42,071
last year, I ran into her again.

413
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:49,541
Grace?

414
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,080
It was like no time had passed.

415
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:54,863
Went for a walk,

416
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:57,522
had coffee then dinner,

417
00:23:58,577 --> 00:23:59,720
went for another walk.

418
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:02,752
It was like a miracle.

419
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,863
We found each other again, and it felt...

420
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:09,502
new.

421
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:15,560
We made plans to have dinner that friday at a restaurant we both love.

422
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:19,503
But Grace never showed.

423
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:21,751
I called her,

424
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:23,690
but all I got was her machine.

425
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:27,330
She called the next day,

426
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:30,293
and I knew, uh,

427
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:32,421
she'd been crying.

428
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,081
She said 3 words to me.

429
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,411
Too much pain.

430
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:46,742
I'm sorry.

431
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,413
She took a job in another city.

432
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:50,991
Wouldn't tell me where.

433
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,603
That was the last I heard of her.

434
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,343
Sarah was hoping to talk to the two of you together.

435
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,562
Is she here now?

436
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:03,690
No.

437
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:05,733
She's afraid that...

438
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,023
she was responsible for your anger at Grace.

439
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:10,920
I-I should tell her.

440
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,662
I'd like to find Grace first, if you don't mind.

441
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:18,801
It's important to Sarah that she talk to both of you together.

442
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,342
What if you don't find her?

443
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:21,430
Well...

444
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:24,201
then I'll come back.

445
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,252
Melinda, what did he say?

446
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,193
You don't have to hide, Sarah. No one can see you.

447
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:33,063
You can.

448
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:36,642
Yeah, well, there aren't a whole lot of people like me.

449
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,211
Maybe none, for all I know.

450
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:40,822
Look,

451
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:43,981
Sarah, your father loved your mother very much.

452
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,573
But you were right. They don't live together anymore.

453
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:50,162
- Because I got sick.
- No, it's not your fault.

454
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,251
- They love you.
- Then where's my mom?

455
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:56,632
- Moved away. We don't know where.
- Maybe your mom knows.

456
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,532
What?

457
00:25:57,535 --> 00:25:58,932
Our moms were friends once.

458
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,893
They knew each other in high school.

459
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:03,263
Why don't you ask her?

460
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:09,782
I can't go see my mom.

461
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:13,091
She's never made me feel anything but ashamed and embarrassed of

462
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,651
what I can do. It's like she's

463
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:17,731
jealous that the gift skipped a generation or something.

464
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:19,750
She called again.

465
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,731
You have to tell me that?

466
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,311
I think she just wanted suggestions for a birthday present.

467
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,652
Oh, well, that's touching, considering that she ruined birthdays for me forever.

468
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:28,550
Mel...

469
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:32,370
don't give her that kind of power.

470
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:35,180
It's your birthday. Take it back.

471
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,291
I would if I could.

472
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:38,570
Believe me.

473
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:47,580
Yay! Well done.

474
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:51,703
- I love you. My big girl.
- I love you, too, mommy.

475
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,503
Why don't you girls go inside and get her presents while I'm cutting the cake.

476
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:56,901
Did you make a wish, honey?

477
00:26:57,786 --> 00:26:59,231
Was it what we talked about?

478
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,572
What did you talk about?

479
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:04,860
Oh, we had a little chat about the importance of birthdays and how it gives us

480
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:09,422
the perfect chance to be grateful for the most important gift that we have together.

481
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,020
Mother, what are you doing?

482
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,622
It's her birthday.

483
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,111
It's not a day for celebrating death.

484
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,372
We're celebrating life.

485
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:19,501
By taking her on macabre field trips to funeral parlors?

486
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:22,553
- Don't think I didn't hear about that.
- Melinda needs to be educated.

487
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,400
- I am trying to protect her from that.
- Mommy, grandma.

488
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:28,273
Melinda, why don't you go inside and join the girls for a moment.

489
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,351
No, Beth. She should stay right here.

490
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,003
Melinda's gift is nothing to be ashamed of.

491
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,962
And you can't avoid the reality of it forever.

492
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,872
Ok, mother, fine.

493
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:39,283
I give up.

494
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:40,391
From now on,

495
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:44,372
you just celebrate her birthday any damn way you want and leave me out of it.

496
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:47,491
Melinda, I'm gonna go lie down. I'm getting another migraine,

497
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:48,891
thanks to your grandmother.

498
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:08,730
Hi, mom.

499
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:09,763
Melinda.

500
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,222
Is everything ok?

501
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:12,651
Are you all right?

502
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,171
Yeah. Everything's fine.

503
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,000
I just wasn't expecting you.

504
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:20,032
It was kind of last minute.

505
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,113
You look beautiful.

506
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,311
Well, come in.

507
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,682
Sorry about the mess.

508
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:34,792
I've been so busy lately, the house has gotten kind of out of control.

509
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:38,021
Not that it was ever in control.

510
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,872
Anyway, you know what I mean.

511
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:45,993
- How's Jim?
- He's fine.

512
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,820
I've been meaning to come out and see what you've done with the house.

513
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:52,930
It all sounds so wonderful.

514
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:55,851
Somehow I just haven't had the time.

515
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,283
Hey, well, come sit down.

516
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:02,511
You want something to drink?

517
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,610
No. Thanks. I can only stay for a minute.

518
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:08,210
Oh. I was hop--

519
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:11,662
well...

520
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:13,901
that's just fine.

521
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:18,212
It's so good to see you. You cut your hair.

522
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,711
It's very becoming.

523
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,550
It really is.

524
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:24,310
Why is she so nervous?

525
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:27,112
I came here because I needed to get some information,

526
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,761
- and I thought you'd be able to help me.
- Me?

527
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:33,200
Do you remember Sarah Applewhite? She was in my 4th-grade class.

528
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:35,842
Of course, darling. I went to high school with her mother.

529
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:38,393
We used to get together when you kids were babies.

530
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:39,973
Of course then

531
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:41,833
poor Sarah got sick, and

532
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,373
Grace and Jack kind of closed ranks on the outside world.

533
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:48,010
But then you know the rest.

534
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,823
Actually, I'm just now remembering the rest.

535
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,240
First time I ever saw a spirit, remember?

536
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:58,601
- Melinda, do we have to?
- Do we have to what?

537
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:01,580
Why does everything always come back to spirits?

538
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:03,732
Why do you hate talking about it so much?

539
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:07,522
Because it upsets me. All I ever wanted for you was a normal life.

540
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:08,660
Why, mom?

541
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:10,373
Why is normal so good?

542
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,820
My life is fascinating.

543
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,122
It's extraordinary. I found a way to really help people.

544
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:18,490
Why can't you just be happy about that?

545
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:19,493
She can't, Melinda.

546
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:21,843
Ghosts scare her.

547
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,833
I really don't wanna get into this conversation.

548
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:27,101
You came for information.

549
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,162
Just tell me what you want.

550
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:30,960
I was right.

551
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:33,310
Your mom knows where my mom is. Let's go.

552
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:36,320
Maybe I should go and talk to your mom alone first.

553
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,223
Why?

554
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:38,853
Well, 'cause there might be

555
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:40,500
grown-up talk.

556
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:44,793
Melinda, you're a kid. She's not gonna talk to you about grown-up stuff.

557
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,031
Right. Um,

558
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:50,113
well, you wanna talk to your mom and dad together, right?

559
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,402
Uh, your dad might be hurt

560
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:55,313
if he knows that you talked to your mom first.

561
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,050
Well, ok.

562
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:00,840
But how will I know it's time?

563
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:02,743
Wait for me at my house.

564
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:06,430
You're all grown up. I can't believe it.

565
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,013
It was so good to talk to your mother. How is she?

566
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,160
Good. Fine.

567
00:31:12,978 --> 00:31:14,723
We had a lot of laughs, she and I.

568
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:20,023
I used to bring Sarah over, and you would have a ball. You'd play for hours.

569
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:22,333
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

570
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:24,783
Why would you? You were only 2 or 3.

571
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:26,731
But for us grown-ups,

572
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:29,451
those memories,

573
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:31,542
they never fade.

574
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,190
Your mother...

575
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:37,060
I've never seen a woman more in love with her child.

576
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:38,673
Unless, of course, it was me.

577
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:42,761
We would sit there staring at the two of you in amazement.

578
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,043
So perfect, so beautiful.

579
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,503
The picture of health.

580
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,201
Grace, are...

581
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,613
are you all right?

582
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:58,363
Forgive me, but you don't...

583
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,412
you don't look well.

584
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:03,923
Don't I?

585
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:05,940
Uh, well, I...

586
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,871
I suppose there's a reason for that. Um...

587
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,112
the fact is is that I'm dying.

588
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:21,120
You're sick?

589
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:23,140
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

590
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,011
It's a genetic illness.

591
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:29,950
Which means, of course, I'm the reason that Sarah got it in the first place.

592
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:31,660
But I don't understand.

593
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,443
There's treatment. People are cured now.

594
00:32:34,448 --> 00:32:37,782
I wouldn't let Sarah have the treatment then, and she died.

595
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:41,441
How could I survive the thing that killed my little girl?

596
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,890
Yeah, but you have your whole life ahead of you.

597
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,280
You know, for some people,

598
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:48,052
Melinda, that's not particularly good news.

599
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,731
Did my mother ever tell you about my grandmother?

600
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:55,840
She had this gift

601
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,012
to be able to

602
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:02,130
see people and talk to people after they died.

603
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:05,291
Beth never told me.

604
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:07,651
Do you believe it?

605
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,580
My grandma helped a lot of people.

606
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:13,460
My mom never understood.

607
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,621
It seems that it skips a generation.

608
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:22,911
Which means

609
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:24,210
you can do it, too?

610
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:25,940
Sarah came to me 2 days ago.

611
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:29,121
Melinda.

612
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,860
- Don't say it if it isn't true.
- It is true.

613
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,420
And now I think I know why.

614
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:42,971
Your sickness--the fact that it's gotten more serious--

615
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,483
it's triggered Sarah to come and find you.

616
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,060
She needs to talk to you and her father together.

617
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:50,741
Are you willing to do that?

618
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:52,393
Melinda,

619
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,083
I'll meet with Jack.

620
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,412
But you have to promise me that you won't tell him I'm sick, or I can't do this.

621
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:03,823
Promise.

622
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:17,841
Hi.

623
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:18,753
Come on in.

624
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,800
Hi. I got your message, but I don't--

625
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:28,653
Grace?

626
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:32,301
I-I don't--

627
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:37,862
- are you back?
- I never left, Jack. I'm sorry.

628
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,240
I-I-I don't understand.

629
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:45,581
- You lied to me?
- Please,

630
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,071
don't be angry.

631
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:48,780
Mommy, daddy.

632
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:50,693
Sarah's here.

633
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:56,510
Are they still mad?

634
00:34:56,955 --> 00:34:59,603
She wants to know if you're still mad at each other.

635
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:00,630
No, honey.

636
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,182
I...

637
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,601
at least I'm not.

638
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,242
Of course we're not.

639
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:07,990
Would you tell her

640
00:35:10,136 --> 00:35:12,980
we're so sorry that she overheard us arguing that night.

641
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,871
We never meant to hurt her.

642
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:16,231
She can hear you.

643
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,452
Ask them if they still love each other.

644
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,583
She wants to know if you're still in love with each other.

645
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,413
I'll always love your...

646
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,190
mommy, Sarah.

647
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:35,452
I always have.

648
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,783
Mommy?

649
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:40,512
Grace, she's asking you.

650
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:43,221
Oh, yes.

651
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:45,550
I love your dad, honey.

652
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:47,253
Don't ever worry about that.

653
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:53,593
Does daddy know that she's sick?

654
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:54,662
How did you know?

655
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:56,791
Know what?

656
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,032
I can feel it. She's sick like I was.

657
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:05,621
- You have to tell daddy.
- I can't.

658
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:07,190
What did she say?

659
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,142
- I can't tell you.
- What?

660
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:12,070
This is ridiculous.

661
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:15,522
You call us together to talk to our daughter, then you can't tell us what she's saying?

662
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:16,490
Grace, she knows.

663
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:19,540
And she wants Jack to know.

664
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:20,670
About what?

665
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:22,950
I knew this was a mistake.

666
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:25,372
I'm sorry. I can't.

667
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:35,721
No, Jack.

668
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:37,203
Crix.

669
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:43,201
Grace.

670
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:48,902
How long have you known?

671
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:50,621
Since last year?

672
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,230
Why...

673
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:55,732
why didn't you tell me?

674
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:57,040
I didn't want you to...

675
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:00,491
watch someone you love...

676
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,321
I wanted you to be happy.

677
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:05,581
Happy?

678
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:10,281
Don't you know the only time I've ever been happy was with you?

679
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:12,150
I don't wanna fight it.

680
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,140
I don't wanna survive if she couldn't. It's not right.

681
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:22,121
I want you to come with me, mommy.

682
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,181
I miss you so much.

683
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:29,943
She misses you

684
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:31,682
so much.

685
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,281
I don't want you to die yet.

686
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,210
I want you to stay here

687
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,363
with daddy.

688
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:42,913
She wants you to...

689
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:45,002
get well, Grace.

690
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,253
She wants you to be with Jack.

691
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:49,332
Tell them

692
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,121
it's ok to be happy.

693
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,222
Tell them that I'm happy.

694
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:00,222
Everything is the way that it's supposed to be.

695
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,832
She wants you to know that she's happy.

696
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:12,570
And that everything is the way it's supposed to be.

697
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,890
- They're not mad anymore.
- No.

698
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:24,482
Thanks to you, they're not.

699
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,102
I feel like I wanna go there now.

700
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:35,192
To that light.

701
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:37,523
Well, I think

702
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:38,761
you're ready.

703
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:45,940
She's going into the light.

704
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:48,113
Sarah?

705
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:56,571
You'll always be with us.

706
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,890
We'll never forget you, Cookie.

707
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:03,303
Bye-bye, baby.

708
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,570
I love you.

709
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,080
It's not scary at all, Melinda.

710
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,642
You can tell your mother that.

711
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,270
Why can't you see value in what I do?

712
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,362
What?

713
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:54,622
Two people who love each other very much are together again,

714
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:58,803
and that should be worth something. But for some reason, you just judge me. Why?

715
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:01,740
Let me make this very clear. I have never judged you.

716
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:06,730
But you have to understand. I went through the early years of this thing with you.

717
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,531
I remember your nightmares. I remember how scared you were,

718
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:12,183
how lonely you were, coming home from school crying.

719
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:14,422
How do you think that makes a mother feel?

720
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,771
- How do you think it made me feel?
- Horrible.

721
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:18,312
That's my point.

722
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,391
You know, I haven't always...

723
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,810
wanted this gift for myself. In fact, sometimes

724
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,743
I absolutely hate it.

725
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:32,561
But I do good with it, mom.

726
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:34,750
I help.

727
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,141
Grandma helped.

728
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:41,093
I understand that, Melinda.

729
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:43,781
You don't know how...

730
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:49,740
I am happy for you.

731
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:51,563
I am.

732
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:54,281
No.

733
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:56,993
What is it that you're not telling me?

734
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,420
Why is it that I always feel like there's something you wanna say and you never do?

735
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,133
Well, I'm not scared of ghosts, if that's what you mean.

736
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:05,282
I don't even know why you said that to me.

737
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,361
I didn't say it.

738
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:07,723
Yes, you did.

739
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:08,671
Yesterday.

740
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:10,131
No, mom, I didn't say that.

741
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:14,670
Sarah said it.

742
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,890
You saw her. You saw Sarah.

743
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:22,982
No.

744
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,743
Yes, you did.

745
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,660
Stop it, Melinda. I didn't see her.

746
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,451
I heard her.

747
00:41:30,707 --> 00:41:32,360
- Can you see them?
- No.

748
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:34,251
I don't know.

749
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:35,782
Sometimes maybe.

750
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:38,412
I hate it.

751
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,702
- It makes me feel like I'm crazy.
- Makes you feel crazy?

752
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:45,762
Think about how I've been feeling this whole time. I was lied to

753
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,922
by the one person that I'm supposed to trust the most.

754
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,972
No wonder you've had headaches all these years, 'cause you've been trying to just

755
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:53,871
push it away.

756
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,061
- I can help you.
- I don't want you to help me.

757
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,052
Ok?

758
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:04,313
I'm glad that you have made your peace with this. I really am.

759
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:07,083
But please, don't ask me to feel the same.

760
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,403
Now, it's getting late.

761
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,113
I've got things to do.

762
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:31,933
Happy birthday.

763
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:43,083
Ok?

764
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:52,590
Ok, mom.

765
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:02,261
That is unbelievable about your mother.

766
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:04,441
In all these years you never knew.

767
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:05,913
Strange, huh?

768
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:08,903
Do you think your grandmother knew?

769
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,503
I was just thinking about that. I wonder.

770
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:16,333
Do it.

771
00:43:18,526 --> 00:43:19,422
All right, look,

772
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:21,271
can I just say it?

773
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:24,373
Oh!

774
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:27,543
- Yes.
- All right.

775
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:32,913
Happy birthday.

776
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:36,180
Thank you.

777
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:39,930
You know, I was thinking that it would be fun

778
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:41,750
to go out tonight and...

779
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:44,063
celebrate.

780
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:46,012
You were?

781
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:48,361
Yeah. Life is good.

782
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:50,050
You know? And

783
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:52,653
racking up another year, well, that is...

784
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:53,571
that's big stuff.

785
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:56,221
Damn straight.

786
00:43:58,507 --> 00:43:59,402
Big stuff.

787
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:01,670
I'm gonna go

788
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:03,262
round up the usual suspects.

789
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:04,840
Sounds good.
