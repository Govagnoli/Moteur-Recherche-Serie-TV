00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:09,447
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:13,143
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:14,667
<i>just moved to a small town.</i>

4
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,454
<i>Just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:18,293
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,748
<i>Except for the time that I was a little girl,</i>

7
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,649
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,193
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

9
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,594
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.</i>

10
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>The ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living.</i>

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,782
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,263
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

13
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,177
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

14
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,168
Did I win?

15
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,256
Actually, I think you broke the record.

16
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:53,082
- Ah!
- Pick anyone you want.

17
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:56,815
How 'bout this one?

18
00:00:59,146 --> 00:00:59,884
Okay.

19
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,646
Giant stuffed octopus, or sparkly bracelets.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,040
Since you're not six-years-old, I would say sparkly bracelet.

21
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:08,018
- There you go.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,615
Wow, where'd you learn to shoot like that, Tess?

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,528
I don't know.

24
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,322
Maybe it's genetic or something.

25
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,147
Note to self, never have gunfight with Andrea.

26
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,904
I love carnivals. Feel like a kid.

27
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,053
Get we have cotton candy?

28
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:32,595
Yeah, but don't come crying to me when you get sick on the tilt-a-whirl.

29
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,757
When I was a kid,

30
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,669
my brother would always drag me into the haunted house, try to scare me,

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,048
but then he would get terrified, and start crying, we'd have to leave.

32
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,580
- It was so satisfying.
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

33
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,731
- Here's your chance to dunk a paramedic!
- Enough brew, Jim!

34
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,363
Yup, it's for a good cause.

35
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,185
For a good cause. C'mon, ladies.

36
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,946
I hope for Jim's sake, that water's not cold.

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,748
Oh, he'll live.

38
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,410
Dulischner's show starts in five minutes. We have to get in there.

39
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,332
I had to thumb-wrestle an eight-year-old to get these tickets.

40
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,576
I'll get the seats, you get the cotton candy.

41
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,863
- Okay, blue?
- Pink!

42
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,540
- Okay.
- Pink, pink, pink.

43
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:05,735
Ticket.

44
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:10,927
Can you, in fact,

45
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,142
trust your senses?

46
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,768
Is what you see

47
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:17,362
an illusion?

48
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,610
Because not everything

49
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,689
is what it seems.

50
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,323
Thank you.

51
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,243
And you,

52
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:29,844
even though you are late,

53
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,378
you're so beautiful,

54
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,549
I have a little gift for you.

55
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:41,952
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,835
my lovely assistant Vera.

57
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,706
Will climb into this box.

58
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:47,718
And I

59
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,369
will slice her in half,

60
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,638
with this saw.

61
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,289
This is the part that always freaked my brother out, completely.

62
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,674
Is something the matter?

63
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:47,324
What have you done?

64
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,115
Oh, no!

65
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,630
- Ambrose!
- What did you do to me?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,900
Stop!

67
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:03,217
Stop!

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500

69
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,198
How are you feeling?

70
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,071
I'm feeling fine.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,980
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,633
If you need anything, let us know.

73
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:55,613
Thank you both so much.

74
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,706
She's gonna be okay.

75
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,657
It's a superficial wound, no stitches.

76
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,681
We're just gonna go back to the booth.

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,140
Bobby.

78
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,078
Bye guys, see you later.

79
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,035
I can't believe I hurt you.

80
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,501
I'm okay. You've done that trick dozens of times before, Ambrose.

81
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,775
What happened?

82
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:19,988
I don't know.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,420
I, uh...

84
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:25,532
the saw, it was so

85
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,380
heavy, and I...

86
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:28,826
I don't know.

87
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:31,387
Like I couldn't control it.

88
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:34,485
You all right?

89
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:41,639
I don't know.

90
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,072
Melinda, what did you see?

91
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,403
Something not good, but that saw did not just slip.

92
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,096
Let's go this way.

93
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,046
Hey, Tess, over here.

94
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:22,829
Go away.

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,225
- There are a lot of unhappy spirits here.
- Why?

96
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:34,522
A lot of people met their maker working at this carnival,

97
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:38,077
but nobody ever wants to leave.

98
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,259
Why not?

99
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:44,563
The carnival was the only place that would take us in life.

100
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:49,295
Who else would have us in death?

101
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,674
Hey.

102
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,475
W hat...

103
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,249
what is it?

104
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:03,863
Well, I guess whoever joins the carnival, stays with the carnival forever.

105
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:11,987
Come on.

106
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:15,445
Come on, it's for a good cause. Come on, people. Come on, Mitchell, you weakling.

107
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,660
Come on, right there, right there, you're gonna miss it.

108
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:20,061
- Do you think she's gonna be ok?
- I hope so.

109
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,390
He's not gonna get anything.

110
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,168
Jim?

111
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,554
Whoo! Man! Would warm water have been too much to ask?

112
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,499
I know, baby, it's for a good cause, but you scared me.

113
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,200
It would've been just as good a cause if they'd dunked me into a jacuzzi.

114
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,316
How you two doing?

115
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,970
- Good, we're great.
- I'm fine.

116
00:07:59,023 --> 00:07:59,988
I'm fine, I just

117
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,657
need to eat. Whoo! Funnel cake, want some?

118
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,529
- Yeah. Sound good.
- Bring two.

119
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,758
Why are these so good?

120
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,311
It's just like fried dough and sugar.

121
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:14,165
Yes, that's why it's so good.

122
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,943
Mmm, nutritious too. Full of vitamins and minerals.

123
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,107
Probably one of each.

124
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,968
Let's go get our fortunes told.

125
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,068
Okay.

126
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,690
- Hello?
- You're welcome fortune seekers.

127
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,044
- You wanna go first?
- Sure.

128
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,395
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

129
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,366
Hello, I'm Lillia.

130
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:34,991
Sorry about the wait.

131
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,559
So,

132
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,669
- you're here to have your fortune told.
- You are psychic.

133
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,370
What? You know what,

134
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,667
it's just the last time I had my fortune read, she said that I would be married

135
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,644
by the end of the year, and that was 1999, and, hmm?

136
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:53,151
People are so often mislead by phony or inaccurate readings.

137
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,913
When something doesn't come true, they're always disappointed.

138
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,829
Or relieved.

139
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,729
Would you like me to read your palm? Or do you prefer hypnosis?

140
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:05,976
Not hypnosis, I have visions. Walk like a Jim, so,

141
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,036
- palm?
- Right.

142
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:10,865
Okay,

143
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,383
- first tell me your name.
- Andrea Moreno.

144
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,012
Oh, you are a woman with many interests, Andrea.

145
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,363
A bit unfocused, but

146
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,737
dedicated.

147
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:25,351
Extremely loyal in your friendships. And you have a very strong money-line.

148
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,170
You have good financial instincts.

149
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,921
Can you fax that to my accountant?

150
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,776
You've been in love, before.

151
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,145
Someone tall.

152
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:34,808
Green eyes.

153
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,539
Um...

154
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:38,312
yeah.

155
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:42,891
He blindsided you.

156
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,438
But that's all right.

157
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,399
You weren't supposed to be with him.

158
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:49,821
You knew that in you heart.

159
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,917
He, uh, he may have left you, but he did you a big favor.

160
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,769
You've since gone through many transitions in your life.

161
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:00,664
I'll say.

162
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,688
No, there's still more to come. Many lessons to learn.

163
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,010
- Do you have a brother?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,395
- Um...
- what?

165
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,130
I see

166
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:18,183
tears.

167
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:20,405
Pain.

168
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,598
- You getting all that from her palm?
- No, no, this is from her...

169
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,391
there are certain things I just feel.

170
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:30,323
When I'm around certain people,

171
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,924
I sense things, it's really hard to explain.

172
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:34,405
I understand.

173
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,974
Something going to happen to my brother?

174
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:39,725
It's probably not serious. I'm sorry if I alarmed you.

175
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,450
Wait, wait a minute.

176
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:42,656
Can you check again?

177
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:45,274
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,972
I think I need...

179
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:51,851
Little short of breath.

180
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,481
You should come back another time.

181
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,145
I'll make it up to you.

182
00:11:58,557 --> 00:11:59,940
Wait, are you okay?

183
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,505
Actually, I'm a little short of breath myself.

184
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:05,186
Melinda?

185
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:08,253
You should go,

186
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:09,154
go now.

187
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:10,522
What's happening?

188
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,968
I think we should get out of here right now.

189
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,043
I can't breathe.

190
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,680
- Melinda.
- The door's stuck. It won't open.

191
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,045
- We had to get out of here.
- This way.

192
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,346
No there's nothing there.

193
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:26,512
- That's the only door.
- The window.

194
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,920
No, I can't... I can't go on the window.

195
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,479
I'll go first, okay, then you can jump.

196
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,252
Come on, this place is falling apart.

197
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:52,624
You see me?

198
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,023
Why are you doing this? What do you have against the carnival?

199
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,279
It's her.

200
00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,414
It's the witch!

201
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:04,664
Are you okay?

202
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,939
Yeah, you were lucky.

203
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,563
You know, we've had more emergencies

204
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,289
at this carnival than we've had in grandview in the last two weeks?

205
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,389
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

206
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:27,820
Tell me again what happened?

207
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,221
It was the strangest thing,

208
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,504
all of a suden, it was like an earthquake.

209
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:34,668
Lie down for a while, I'm sure you'll be fine.

210
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:35,849
Is everything all right?

211
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,052
I heard there was another accident.

212
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,603
- Yeah, everything is fine.
- Over here, Ambrose.

213
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:42,545
Lillia.

214
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,326
She's gonna be fine.

215
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,355
- Who are those people?
- I don't know, I just met them.

216
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,171
The whole time I felt this...

217
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,321
this pressure. Like there was a cinderblock on my heart.

218
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,038
I could tell that Lillia felt the same way. This ghost is intense.

219
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,939
Sounds like it.

220
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,587
I have to find him again before he hurts Lillia.

221
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,400
It's strange 'cause she seems so fragile.

222
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,473
Seems fragile.

223
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,838
Remember, you don't know anything about this girl.

224
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,379
I feel a connection with her, you know, both of us

225
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,580
having gifts and not everybody understands.

226
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,991
That's a traveling carnival. You don't have to get involved.

227
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,487
Right, like you would ever do that.

228
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,044
Like you would either.

229
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,549
<i>I know you actually feels better, just take it easy anyway.</i>

230
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:39,176
<i>I promise.</i>

231
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:41,913
All right,

232
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,049
remember.

233
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,950
Any trouble.

234
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,475
Send up the bat signal.

235
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,881
- Be safe.
- You too.

236
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:09,847
Come in.

237
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:10,996
Lillia?

238
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,511
Hi. It's Melinda Gordon from yesterday.

239
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,437
It's nice of you to come back, but there's no need.

240
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,538
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

241
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,275
Can I do a reading for you?

242
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:24,571
It's the least I could do to repay you for your help yesterday.

243
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:25,605
Okay.

244
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,214
Now, these are oracle cards.

245
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,460
Please pick eight cards.

246
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:37,696
But don't turn them over.

247
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:15,736
Well... you, um...

248
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,838
You've been lucky in love.

249
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:28,226
But...

250
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:31,041
you shoulder some

251
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,574
heavy burdens.

252
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,717
Do you have a big family?

253
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:37,584
A lot of people you care for?

254
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:40,267
In a manner of speaking.

255
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:44,601
Yeah, the saints used to characterize their burdens as gifts from God.

256
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,787
Now this card here, you...

257
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,859
you have a level of consciousness that...

258
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,037
that goes beyond the earthly plane.

259
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,473
Have you ever had psychic visions?

260
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,215
No, not like you do, anyway.

261
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:06,578
Psychic visions aren't all they're cracked up to be.

262
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:09,656
My family thought I was a freak.

263
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,489
They were very strict. They didn't understand what I could do.

264
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,841
Yeah, I know the feeling.

265
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,940
You do.

266
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:22,994
I can tell.

267
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,560
You're a very empathetic person.

268
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:30,725
I can communicate with the dead.

269
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,491
See them and speak to them.

270
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,289
And my gift is to help them, because I'm the only one that can.

271
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:45,473
Are you saying that you saw someone here at the carnival?

272
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:46,655
Here with you

273
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,258
last night.

274
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,740
He was also at the magician Ambrose's show earlier.

275
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,586
He's in his 30s. He's dressed all in black.

276
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:58,094
When I see him I can hear the rattling of chains,

277
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,651
and its hard for me to catch my breath, you know?

278
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:02,252
Almost like he can't catch his.

279
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:09,512
You know who he is, don't you? Do you know why he might still be here?

280
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,782
Do you know why he's here with us right now?

281
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,233
No.

282
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,176
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I--

283
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:28,599
I have to leave.

284
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:37,752
Why doesn't she wanna speak to you?

285
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,122
She and my brother

286
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,604
killed me.

287
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,162
- Five? Ten? Cool.
- Five.

288
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:05,082
Ambrose the magician is your brother?

289
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:06,288
Yes.

290
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,211
And a fine brother too.

291
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:10,537
Until he betrayed me.

292
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:12,807
Do you know when you died?

293
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:15,158
Just after the carnival went back on the road.

294
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,666
We always go back on the road in april.

295
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,333
That was three months ago.

296
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,643
If you say so.

297
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:22,136
Feels like

298
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:23,781
yesterday.

299
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:26,399
I might be able to help you.

300
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,012
All of you, if you just tell me what happened.

301
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,790
I was this carnival's main attraction.

302
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:37,916
<i>Like every magicians, I took my inspiration from the great Houdini.</i>

303
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:41,848
<i>And my younger brother wanted nothing else but to follow in my footsteps.</i>

304
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,600
He had the technique, but not the soul.

305
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:47,056
And Lillia?

306
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:52,365
Lillia was the most beautiful girl in the carnival.

307
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,119
<i>She joined up with us outside Chicago.</i>

308
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:57,831
<i>Running from a family she would never talk about.</i>

309
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,720
<i>The moment I laid eyes on her, I know I had to have her.</i>

310
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,110
<i>I did everything in my power to make her mine.</i>

311
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,151
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about her.</i>

312
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,675
<i>I became so obsessed with her that my work suffered.</i>

313
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:12,266
<i>As painful as it was for both of us, I know I had to keep her at arms length.</i>

314
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,721
<i>She never understood, when we were together we fought about not being together.</i>

315
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:16,917
Perfecting my act.

316
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,376
Redesigning my act.

317
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,967
Making it more challenging, more extraordinary. That was my priority.

318
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,577
It didn't leave much time for her.

319
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:31,004
<i>But then one day I saw them together and I watched the way they looked at each other.</i>

320
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,647
<i>The way he caressed her face.</i>

321
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,142
<i>The way she walked into his arms and they held each other like lovers and</i>

322
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,193
<i>I felt like my heart was tearing in two.</i>

323
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:43,582
The thought of losing her. Nothing else was important.

324
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,140
I knew that from now on she had to come first,

325
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:51,325
<i>At that moment I wanted to thank Ambrose for opening my eyes</i>

326
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:54,636
<i>They took scenes together make me realized how much I loved her.</i>

327
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:58,861
<i>How stupid I was not to have seen the deceipt.</i>

328
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:01,842
<i>Then as if to mark me, on the day I died</i>

329
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:04,668
<i>she read my cards for me and warned me of great danger.</i>

330
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,491
<i>Of course she knew, I wouldn't listen.</i>

331
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,892
<i>Why else would she go through with the charade?</i>

332
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,468
<i>The perfect plan.</i>

333
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,329
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Edward the great, master of illusions</i>

334
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,381
<i>will now attempt to escape from the chains of death,</i>

335
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:20,167
<i>shackled with 50 additional pounds of lead weight.</i>

336
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,164
<i>Submerged in a tomb of water.</i>

337
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:27,743
Start the clock!

338
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:34,168
<i>I knew the instant I ran my tongue accross the key into my mouth</i>

339
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,971
<i>- that something was wrong.
- Five minutes!</i>

340
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:38,172
<i>I've done this illusion thousands of times.</i>

341
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,669
<i>Then I was their faces through the glass.</i>

342
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,578
<i>They didn't looked at me, their eyes glued to the floor.</i>

343
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:50,685
<i>They knew the key wouldn't fit the lock, and they were waiting for me to realize it.</i>

344
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,770
<i>I was trapped in an illusion I couldn't escape.</i>

345
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:57,046
<i>I could hear the bubbles in my heart pounding in my ears.</i>

346
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,677
<i>I couldn't think, I panicked.</i>

347
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:03,282
<i>I wanted to reach out and grab her, scream at her, why?</i>

348
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:07,454
<i>I wanted her to save me, I couldn't hold my breath any longer.</i>

349
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,693
<i>My lungs filled with water, and I felt this release.</i>

350
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:13,695
<i>- Edward.
- Then</i>

351
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,833
<i>it was over.</i>

352
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,636
Are you sure about this?

353
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,902
Couldn't there be some other explanation?

354
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,309
There's no margin for error in what I do.

355
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,676
It just seems so extreme. If they were in love, why wouldn't they just tell you?

356
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:30,877
There's more than that.

357
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,800
My brother Ambrose hated being in my shadow.

358
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,271
With me gone, he could have Lillia and he could take my place.

359
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:38,304
Your own brother.

360
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,790
I never thought it possible.

361
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,469
I tried to teach him, to protect him.

362
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,160
But the last thing I saw was Ambrose's face. The look in his eyes.

363
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,330
He just stood there not even trying to help.

364
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,433
It's not good for you to stay here.

365
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:58,210
Your feeding your own anger and pain, you need to cross over into the light.

366
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,961
- And what would I find there?
- I'm not sure. Peace?

367
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,649
Understanding, maybe forgiveness.

368
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,268
Not interested.

369
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,780
Please let me help you.

370
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,294
I'll never cross over while their allowed to live and be in love.

371
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:11,445
They're gonna pay for what they did to me.

372
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,181
That's the only peace I want.

373
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,377
I didn't ask for your help.

374
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,641
Oh, hello, excuse me. Could you co--ooh!

375
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:49,537
Wow.

376
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:56,853
Sorry miss, the patrons aren't really supposed to be back here.

377
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,625
Yeah, sorry, I'm just looking for someone. Trying to help a friend with a problem.

378
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:04,181
We take care of ourselves, understand?

379
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,861
Do you know where I could find Lillia and Ambrose?

380
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:11,595
Magician's tent.

381
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:16,531
Last person who stuck his nose in carnival business, ended up face down in a ditch.

382
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,111
Car troubles. Went right through the windshield.

383
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:32,961
You can do this, Ambrose.

384
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,239
I know you can.

385
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,979
Just stay focused and relaxed.

386
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Okay, you're right.

387
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:43,077
You just have to believe in it. That's the only difference between you and Edward.

388
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:44,802
He believed he could do anything.

389
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:45,838
You're right,

390
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:47,086
I can do it.

391
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:55,298
You'll never do it.

392
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,133
You'll never be as good as I was.

393
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,510
So stop trying.

394
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,646
Take him out! Take him out!

395
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,815
Don't save him, let him drown like I did.

396
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,370
I can't do it.

397
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,470
- I couldn't do it.
- You will.

398
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:50,508
- I'll never be as good as he was.
- That is your punishment.

399
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:58,686
He didn't need to be attached to a safety cable.

400
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,058
Because he was arrogant, Ambrose.

401
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:02,491
That's why he's dead.

402
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:05,584
You have it in you to be great.

403
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,282
Even greater than Edward.

404
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,190
I just wish

405
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,744
you could see yourself, the way that we see you,

406
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,283
not the way your brother saw you.

407
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:19,623
Just stop talking about it. It's bad luck to speak of the dead.

408
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,717
What are you doing here?

409
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:30,044
- I just wanna find out the truth.
- Well, there it is.

410
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:33,104
They're in love, that's the only truth that matters to them.

411
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,409
You oughta know how they broke my heart.

412
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:45,922
I think we could use a little something to take the edge off.

413
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:47,037
Thanks, Vera, but

414
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,086
I really shouldn't.

415
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:51,702
Why? You knocked up or something?

416
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:57,597
Wait,

417
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,125
you mean...

418
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,571
you're pregnant?

419
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:10,579
That's what you were telling my husband's partner, you're pregnant.

420
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,530
You were afraid for the baby's safety.

421
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:14,269
I can't believe this.

422
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:16,944
Is it true?

423
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:19,817
Who are you?

424
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:22,048
What are you doing here?

425
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:23,953
My name is Melinda Gordon.

426
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,050
I was Lillia in the wagon.

427
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:29,303
When she had to go out the window, I know what happened.

428
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:30,292
Why it happened.

429
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:32,505
Lillia?

430
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,765
What's she talking about?

431
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,767
Can we not do this right now, please?

432
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,450
- Ambrose, let's go.
- What's going on?

433
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:42,135
I've seen your brother.

434
00:27:42,854 --> 00:27:46,354
I've spoken to him. His spirit is still here. He's with us right now.

435
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:48,469
Come. Come, please.

436
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,650
Ambrose, let's go. Let's go.

437
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:58,032
She never loved me.

438
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:00,763
I'm sure that's not true.

439
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:44,753
<i>We take care of ourselves.</i>

440
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,588
Damm. My brakes!

441
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,116
Everything's fine.

442
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:08,534
You're absolutely sure? Run every diagnostic test you can possibly...

443
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,523
okay, no, I hear you, okay. Great.

444
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:16,877
Thanks a million, Christian. I'll pick it up in the morning, okay?

445
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,302
Car is fine.

446
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:21,849
I swear

447
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:23,508
the brakes didn't work.

448
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,600
I believe you.

449
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,515
I also believe the car is fine, which means...

450
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:29,197
someone's trying to scare me.

451
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,161
Well, they did a pretty good job of scaring me.

452
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:32,062
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:33,341
Don't be, just...

454
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:35,835
I'll start riding my bike.

455
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,667
This is not a joke, all right?

456
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:42,812
Look, thrills and chills are one thing, okay?

457
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:43,913
Yeah, I know, I know.

458
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,461
I guess I just assumed Lillia was innocent.

459
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,428
'Cause we bonded over having a gift.

460
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:53,132
I guess maybe Edward was right about them.

461
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:55,791
Not everything is what it seems.

462
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,664
I have to try and get Ambrose to tell me the truth. That's the only way

463
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,915
that Edward will get closure and cross over.

464
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,616
- Be careful.
- I always am.

465
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,205
All right.

466
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,801
Your husband loves you very much.

467
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,622
I never loved anyone that well.

468
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:28,723
And now I never will.

469
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:06,675
- Here.
- Hmm?

470
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:08,758
- The key.
- Key.

471
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:24,838
You.

472
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,874
You say you saw my brother.

473
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:33,989
Yes.

474
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,095
- He's here?
- No, not right now.

475
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:40,023
But he haunts the carnival.

476
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:42,138
Because now he knows.

477
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,568
Knows what?

478
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:48,628
Is there something that you wanna tell me, Ambrose?

479
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,111
Lillia.

480
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:04,916
No, please stop.

481
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,743
I just need you to tell me the truth.

482
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:12,834
About what?

483
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:14,995
Edward's stuck here.

484
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,059
You can help him if you'll just tell him what happened that night.

485
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,310
There's no use in hiding it any longer. He knows about the baby.

486
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,042
But he needs to know the truth about you and Ambrose.

487
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,358
Okay.

488
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:39,637
I can tell you the truth.

489
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:44,799
This baby...

490
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,458
it's Edward's.

491
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,537
Edward was my whole life.

492
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:07,031
I knew that I came in a distant second to his magic, but

493
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:10,502
I couldn't help it.

494
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:12,868
<i>Nobody knew the real Edward,</i>

495
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:14,863
<i>not the way I did.</i>

496
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,540
<i>How driven he was to succeed.</i>

497
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:20,459
<i>His fear of failure.</i>

498
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:24,137
<i>The pressure he used to put on himself.</i>

499
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:27,186
<i>Always trying to top his last illusion.</i>

500
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,720
<i>So when I found out I was pregnant, I thought that maybe a baby could change things.</i>

501
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,838
We fought the night that he died.

502
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,510
I wanted him to know about the baby, I did but I was just

503
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,544
scared. I was scared that

504
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,399
maybe he wouldn't want me to have it or...

505
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:46,794
so I had to tell somebody.

506
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:49,188
So I... I told Ambrose.

507
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,829
<i>And he loved his brother.</i>

508
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:53,919
<i>He was just</i>

509
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:55,974
<i>afraid of him.</i>

510
00:33:57,715 --> 00:34:00,515
<i>Ambrose told me that I needed to tell Edward the truth.</i>

511
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:04,088
<i>And I was going to that night after his performance, but...</i>

512
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:07,544
<i>it's was too late.</i>

513
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:11,112
- Is everything okay?
- Just part of his show.

514
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,053
No, it's not working!

515
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:15,147
Edward!

516
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:25,611
I was just so afraid that

517
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,172
something would happen to the baby.

518
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:31,929
That my grief would suffocate it.

519
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,785
But I held on.

520
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:37,493
Then to let go.

521
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,367
The baby has his father's tenacity.

522
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,684
How far along are you?

523
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,179
Five months.

524
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:45,906
And Ambrose?

525
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,497
Are you in love with him?

526
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:52,034
Look when,

527
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,606
two people share this kind of grief,

528
00:34:57,505 --> 00:34:58,755
it creates a connection.

529
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,450
I'm sure you see it a lot.

530
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:06,022
Ambrose is a good man, but

531
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,182
I could never love him

532
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,471
the way I loved Edward.

533
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,297
But why were you so scared?

534
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:18,495
To know that Edward was with you?

535
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,889
That Edward spirit was following you.

536
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,515
I just thought that he'd blame me

537
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,233
for predicting his death.

538
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:26,893
But the key.

539
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:28,951
How did the key get switched?

540
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,520
He's asking about how the key got switched.

541
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,534
I don't know.

542
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,939
But I swear to you it wasn't me.

543
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,114
I know it wasn't you.

544
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:50,289
Then who?

545
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:02,959
What's this?

546
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:04,405
Lillia?

547
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:06,309
You all right?

548
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:08,659
I don't know, Ambrose.

549
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:11,222
Your brother's here with us.

550
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:14,707
He wants to know what happened. How the key got switched.

551
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,202
- Why, he must've taken the wrong one.
- Impossible.

552
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:18,503
You know, don't you Vera?

553
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:20,773
How the key got switched.

554
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:22,865
Are you insane?

555
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,543
What are you looking at me like that?

556
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,594
Why it got switched.

557
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,560
- Tell them why you switched the key.
- You can't know that.

558
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,958
Is Edward telling you this? How do you know?

559
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:41,029
I didn't.

560
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,121
Vera.

561
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,143
You killed my brother.

562
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:51,289
Ambrose, please.

563
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,099
You were never gonna come into your own when he was around,

564
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,650
- he was smothering you.
- Vera, what did you do?

565
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,674
He was terrible to you. He was terrible to all of us.

566
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,691
Do you think anyone shed a tear over his death?

567
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,610
I did, Vera.

568
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,030
He taught me.

569
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:09,842
He protected me.

570
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,017
I loved him. Lillia loved him.

571
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:14,402
She's carrying his child.

572
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,843
I love you, Ambrose.

573
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,307
Don't you see?

574
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:24,311
I just...

575
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,440
I wanted to make all your dreams come true.

576
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,591
I gave that to you.

577
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:37,813
Is he really here?

578
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,110
Edward?

579
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:43,765
When he needed you he would make you feel like

580
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:47,501
the most important person in the world. And he would just throw you away.

581
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:51,372
Everyone's better off without him!

582
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,532
- Wait, Ambrose, please.
- Ambrose, stop.

583
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,034
Edward doesn't want you to go.

584
00:37:58,362 --> 00:37:59,262
There's no point.

585
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,278
I'm so sorry that you had to hear all that, Edward,

586
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:06,019
but doesn't it bring you some peace?

587
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,729
What? He thought that we killed him?

588
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:13,238
I saw it.

589
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:16,228
I saw it in your eyes when I was drowning.

590
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:18,583
I thought you wanted it to happen.

591
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:20,384
He thought you wanted it to happen.

592
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:21,498
Wanted him to die?

593
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:23,997
No.

594
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,482
All I ever wanted

595
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,006
was to hear you say,

596
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:31,173
that I was good.

597
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:35,543
Instead of all the relentless criticism,

598
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,675
I just wanted to be half as good as you.

599
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:43,907
I am so sorry, Ambrose.

600
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:47,531
How did I not see that?

601
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:49,839
He's so sorry.

602
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:53,164
He doesn't understand why he didn't see that.

603
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,980
You were always looking behind you. Or around you.

604
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,667
You never saw what was right in front of you.

605
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,259
She's right.

606
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,619
He sees things, he knows things

607
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,385
that he didn't know when he was alive.

608
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,156
And now there's nothing I can do.

609
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,611
- It's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

610
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,926
He knows that he mistreated you both.

611
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:26,072
He didn't know how much you loved him.

612
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:29,073
I still love you. Edward,

613
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:31,896
I always will.

614
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,430
He feels like he doesn't deserve your love.

615
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,562
It's not something that you deserve or

616
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:40,912
don't deserve. It's

617
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,572
what it is.

618
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,796
I love you.

619
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:48,381
Ambrose loves you and this child,

620
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:50,907
your child will love you.

621
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,494
If I could have just one more day.

622
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:56,970
Just a few hours.

623
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,334
I would show both of you.

624
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,210
He wishes that he could have one more day with both of you.

625
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,612
You have a lifetime. This baby.

626
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,463
You'll never be far.

627
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,260
Tell my brother to love Lillia.

628
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,787
Love her the way I never could.

629
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:28,929
I will.

630
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:31,268
I will.

631
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,406
Well, I guess the show must go on.

632
00:40:57,102 --> 00:40:59,202
I'm glad Vera decided to turn herself in.

633
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:01,502
It would've been a spectacle.

634
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,739
Police cars and handcuffs.

635
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:05,450
Yeah, the perp walk.

636
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,033
Well, that's what it's called.

637
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:15,692
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the great Ambrose master of illusions</i>

638
