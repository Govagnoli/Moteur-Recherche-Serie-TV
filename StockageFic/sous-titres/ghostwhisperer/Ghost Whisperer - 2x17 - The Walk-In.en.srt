1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,100
I'm married,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,300
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,200
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,400
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,200
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,500
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,900
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,700
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:33,500
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:40,407
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:47,406
Ok, this is ridiculous.
Tim stiffed you again?

14
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,101
Yeah. And it had to be the night
I find a possible homicide.

15
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:55,200
And guess who gets to drive
all the way down to central?

16
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:59,602
Oh, that really is a long drive.
Listen, don't try to be a hero, ok?

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,303
Get yourself a bed down there.
Bet you're sleepy.

18
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:07,703
Well, why don't you give me a little
something to stay up for? Like...

19
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:11,103
what are you wearing?

20
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:12,402
Nothing.

21
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,403
No! No, no, no. Tonight it's
pink flannel pyjama, isn't it?

22
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:17,703
Ok, yes, it is.

23
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:20,102
But you know what? You either get
sexy wife or sensible wife,

24
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,502
and you're not home, so it's sensible.

25
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,503
Fair enough.

26
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,601
Climb into bed.
I'll be home soon.

27
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,300
Ok. Love you.

28
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,201
Love you, too.

29
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,600
Evening, sir.

30
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,001
Clancy. Long time no see.

31
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,603
- What's happening, Harold?
- The usual party.

32
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,700
Just don't ask what we use for piÑatas.

33
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:50,400
- Need a hand?
- Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

34
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:55,403
All right, on 3.
And... 3.

35
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,603
You couldn't take time
to aspirate the guy for me?

36
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,302
Sorry. I'm flying solo.

37
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,601
Flaherty was supposed to come with
but he bagged out on me.

38
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,803
- How about you? Busy night?
- Not really.

39
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,700
Although mr. Krushenzo should
lighten things up for us.

40
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,500
- Autoerotic asphyxiation, huh?
- God bless the weird ones.

41
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:24,202
- What's this guy's deal?
- John Doe. No I.D.

42
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:30,602
Nothing in the files. He's gonna
have to stay on ice until
somebody comes forward.

43
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,302
He's missing his middle toe.

44
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,803
That looks new.
Did you check records on him?

45
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, I did. He hadn't had
any foot surgery recently, so...

46
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,901
I'm back at square zero.

47
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:48,202
- Say hi to Melinda for me, will you?
- All right. Will do.

48
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,801
Thanks, Harold.

49
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,903
All right, you take it easy here.

50
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,200
Great.

51
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,802
Episode 2x16
"The Walk-In"

52
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,501
Who are you?

53
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,002
Can you show me?

54
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:39,201
Ok, maybe you're confused.

55
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:43,803
And you don't understand yet
that you're dead.

56
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:45,301
No.

57
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:50,902
Do you remember anything about
what happened when you died?

58
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:54,302
I don't think I did.

59
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,902
Hi Mel.

60
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:59,401
It's not a look I was hopen to see.

61
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,303
Yeah, we had a...

62
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,003
a visitor, but he's gone now.

63
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,202
Well, I hope I didn't
bring him home with me.

64
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:08,103
Didn't you tell me once
that ghosts hate morgues?

65
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:11,601
Yeah, they do.
There's no energy for them.

66
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:15,100
It seemed like a new spirit, though.
Maybe he was confused?

67
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,301
Well, let's hope so.

68
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,600
???

69
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:24,102
Oh, no, thanks.

70
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,502
Ok.

71
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,702
Ok.

72
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:48,100
- You have a good night's sleep.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

73
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,002
Are you...

74
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:56,702
not wearing what I think
you're not wearing?

75
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,901
Hey, buddy.

76
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,700
No.

77
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,800
No no.
You don't get to "hey, buddy" me.

78
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,503
What the hell happened to you?

79
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:13,700
Do you know how much grief I've gotten
from my wife because of you?

80
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,101
You stood up Delia, Melinda's
friend and my friend, and...

81
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,000
Look, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:21,503
I... I didn't know
how to face you or her.

83
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,400
What happened?

84
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,003
Look, it was the pressure. All right?

85
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,701
We... we were just running
into each other round town.

86
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:33,000
???

87
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,403
Ok.

88
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,703
So then you just don't show up.

89
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,201
What are you trying to do,
get her to hate you?

90
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:45,502
Sometimes it's more fun to think
about things than actually have them.

91
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:51,201
All right, Flaherty.
You're my friend. I won't judge.

92
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,703
Much.

93
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:56,301
Wait. I got totally turned around.
That's why I'm back.

94
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:56,802
What?

95
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,501
I'm gonna make it right with you,
I'm gonna make it right with Delia.

96
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,703
At least you realize you're a moron.
That's a good first step.

97
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:05,400
But Delia?

98
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,901
Good luck with that one.

99
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,600
You watch.

100
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,800
Flaher...
Did you see my ring?

101
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,102
No.

102
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:40,401
All of this because you lost
your paramedic ring?

103
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:44,002
- No, really, it was stolen.
- How do you know?

104
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:46,800
I saw these.

105
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,403
And that's not all.

106
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:53,001
You see how the middle toe's
missing on the right foot?

107
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,001
I've seen that before.

108
00:07:56,106 --> 00:08:00,500
Tell me this is just a prank or a dream.
I'll accept either one.

109
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,803
Harold, how do you lose a body?

110
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,902
My boss wants to know the same thing.

111
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,902
It's gonna be my ass if I can't
come up with an explanation.

112
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:11,200
All I can tell you is,
last night the power went out.

113
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:14,801
I went to check the circuit breaker.
I hear this bang.

114
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:18,802
Come back in here...
he's gone.

115
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,802
All I got are the digitals
that I took of the body.

116
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,800
Can I see them?

117
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,800
- Look, Harold, could somebody
have stolen the body? - No! No.

118
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:32,401
We're locked up solid. You know that.
We haven't had a break-in since
the early nineties.

119
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:37,201
- What about the guy I brought in?
- He's fine. Still here. He hasn't moved.

120
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,302
- How did this guy die?
- It was an anonymous hit-and-run.

121
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,903
You're sure he's dead, right?

122
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,101
She's got a point.

123
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,902
- He could have got up and walked out.
The guy I brought... - Excuse me.

124
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:50,500
I've been doing this a while.
I know dead.

125
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:53,702
Look. Take a look at this.

126
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,602
This is a morbidity thermometer.
We use it to measure body temperature.

127
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,901
Helps us determine when somebody died.

128
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,502
I haven't cleared it since
I took John Doe's temp last night.

129
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:03,901
90 degrees.

130
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,402
See, a body cools one degree per hour.

131
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:11,002
This is not a prank.
This is rigor mortis.

132
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:17,502
I gotta go let somebody in downstairs.
Don't touch anything.

133
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,501
Thanks, Harold.

134
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,803
All right, are you sure that
the ghost from last night

135
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,600
- is the guy in the photograph?
- Yeah, positive.

136
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,703
- I got a really good look im last
night. - How can this be happening?

137
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,102
Somebody came back from the dead.

138
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,500
- No, and if he has, why would he
also appear as... - I'm sorry.

139
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,101
I'm sorry. It's not me.

140
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,501
What?

141
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,602
He's here.

142
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,602
The--the--in the photo?

143
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,100
They can't hear me.
Why can't they hear me?

144
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:47,200
- Who?
- Them!

145
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,807
- Ok, tell me what's happening.
- Tell me what's happening.

146
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,706
My body is moving.

147
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:56,103
- You mean your body's being moved.
- No! I'm running. My feet are bleeding.

148
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,403
I cut them trying to escape.
I... but I didn't want to escape.

149
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,801
What's wrong with me?

150
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:17,703
People are starring at me.

151
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:23,102
I've stolen something.
There's--there's people.

152
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,901
Soldiers.

153
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,601
Soldiers?

154
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,701
Statues.

155
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:32,003
He's moving.
He's in village square.

156
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:36,001
How can they see me if I'm dead?

157
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:51,001
This footage is from the security
cameras at the dry cleaners. Jim got it.

158
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,802
Big brother comes to Grandview.

159
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,601
Can we just watch
and try not to speak?

160
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:57,403
You're not gonna ask me
to solve a crime, are you?

161
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,903
I mean, I appreciate the fact that you
think I'm all things to all people.

162
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,901
- The shoplifter is dead. - Dead,
that seems like a harsh punishment.

163
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,201
They don't fool around
at this dry cleaners.

164
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,901
He is dead while he's shoplifting.
We are watching him dead.

165
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:11,000
- Dead man walking.
- Dead man shopping.

166
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:14,403
We think that he took Jim's ring.

167
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,400
- What do you know about voodoo?
- I don't know.

168
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,502
- What I've seen in horror movies?
- That's unfortunate, but it's typical.

169
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:20,901
It's all right.

170
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,503
The voodoo culture is very,
very rich in history.

171
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:25,902
They believe in something
called tri-bon-age.

172
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,801
Which roughly translates to
"earth soul".

173
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:31,802
The haitians believe that when you die,
your earth soul is released to the cosmos,

174
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:35,102
but sometimes your earth soul gets
stuck. Maybe it even comes back

175
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,303
and gets put into a corpse.

176
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,100
- Ever heard of zombies?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,701
Yeah, probably what you've
seen in the movies.

178
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,300
Well, the myth starts, somebody,
usually a voodoo priest

179
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,902
can take that earth soul, put it
into a corpse, and control it,

180
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:49,002
make it do whatever it wants.
Walk, talk, whatever.

181
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,102
But sometimes the earth soul...
not very happy about it.

182
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,203
And that's why it's coming to me.

183
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,702
Did you see how clumsy
it was in that video?

184
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,301
Yeah, like he couldn't
stand on its feet.

185
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,603
Yeah, it's like the soul is trying
restore control over the body.

186
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,403
They're literally at war
with each other, Melinda

187
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,403
Ok, so if the ghost in the body
is coming to me,

188
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,200
then who's actually in the body?

189
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,100
We've been talking for, like 3 minutes.
You might want to give me 8-9 minutes

190
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,000
before I unravel the entire mystery, ok?

191
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,401
- Ok, sorry.
- It's ok.

192
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,402
- You know what I say about
instant gratification? - What?

193
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,403
Takes too long.

194
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,503
So here's what we got.

195
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:20,803
We have an occupying force in the body
that we must have leave the body.

196
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,203
Which means you are going to need this.

197
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,102
Didn't I get this at the 99 cent store?

198
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,403
Maybe. I got mine at bed,
bath, and voodoo.

199
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:33,100
But this one was blessed
by a haitian voodoo shaman.

200
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,400
Oh, what that is is actually a spirit jar.

201
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:41,400
You light a fire inside and it guides
the earth soul to it, helps it cross over.

202
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,802
Or it's for keeping mosquitoes away.
It might be a candle or something.

203
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:48,302
It's useful either way.

204
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,302
I like this.

205
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,700
It makes me feel calm.

206
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,900
My name is Melinda.

207
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:09,400
Can you tell me something about
yourself, like your name?

208
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,902
Bryan.

209
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,103
- Bryan Curtis.
- Bryan, great.

210
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,803
That's a great start.

211
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:24,003
This candle's supposed to help you
cross over into the light.

212
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,602
Do you see a light?

213
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,202
Not yet.

214
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,403
Not while these things
are happening to my body.

215
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,003
Who's controlling you?
Can you see him?

216
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,900
No.

217
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:42,302
But it's... it's hard.

218
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,503
I loose track of who I am,
when he is doing this.

219
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,203
Where I am.

220
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:51,803
You were able to give me a detail
last time to help me figure out

221
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:54,803
where you were.
Can you do that again?

222
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,902
There's a light.

223
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,302
A blue or white light.

224
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:05,001
Wait, I... I can see it.
It's... it's neon.

225
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,100
- There's a neon sign.
- What does it say?

226
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,502
Uh... there's... it's an "x"!

227
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:15,202
Or letter... a "p", "r"...

228
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know if this is the right place,
but it's the closest I can figure out.

229
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:32,500
I think, someone got here
before we did.

230
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:35,500
Mel, I'm sure the cops are coming.
You think this is a good idea?

231
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,102
Well, it's the only way we can
free Bryan from whoever

232
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:44,003
or whatever's controlling him.
I can't do that if he's in jail.

233
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,503
It's the body from the morgue.

234
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,003
That's him.

235
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,001
Why is he making that noise?

236
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:01,400
I think he's trying to set his own ribs.
Remember, he got hit by that car?

237
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,101
Uhh... Bryan?

238
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,102
It's me. Melinda.

239
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:10,103
Do you remember?
You came to me.

240
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:15,403
Do all your ghosts look like this?

241
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,901
No.
He's a zombie.

242
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:24,502
- Are you ready to cross over yet?
- I can't. Not till he's out of my body.

243
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,103
No... I need to find her.

244
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:33,300
Um... who are you?

245
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,303
What's going on?

246
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,600
There's another ghost inside
Bryan's body. He's just a kid.

247
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,803
I have to find her.

248
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:45,001
I need to finish the list.

249
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,701
That's not normal.

250
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:10,101
Yeah.

251
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,601
Now I have to cross over 2 ghosts.

252
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:16,503
The idea of a ghost in a dead body
is not as out there as it sounds.

253
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:18,701
See, the thing that bothers me
is that usually when a ghost

254
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,500
takes over a living body,
it's in short spurts.

255
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,502
But this ghost is just running
full-bore over this person.

256
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:26,300
Which takes everything you and I know
about the supernatural and pretty much

257
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,701
just blows it out of the water.

258
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:32,303
Hey, let's say Kurt Cobain
takes over Elvis' body.

259
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,803
Does Elvis know new licks
on the guitar now?

260
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:37,203
Is he grundge?
I mean... what happens?

261
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,501
How much of your old body
do you bring into your new body?

262
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,402
And... and do the hips still work?

263
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,500
When I saw Bryan and the ghost
inside him, he looked like teenager.

264
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,002
Except there was something wrong
with one of his eyes. It drooped.

265
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:50,201
Drooped how? Like a muscular
spasm or a purposeful effect?

266
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:51,702
Spasm.

267
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,803
Spasm...

268
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,701
Do you remember how clumsy that
ghost was that we saw on the video?

269
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:00,801
- How he was having such a hard
time with his body? - Right.

270
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:02,903
Yeah. And then I gave you
some weirdo line. I said,

271
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:06,200
"the body and soul are literally
at war with each other."

272
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,301
Blah, blah, blah.

273
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,600
And you believed me,
'cause you always do.

274
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:14,403
But I think your truth might be
a little more grounded.

275
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:16,700
Is this what you saw, Melinda?

276
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,902
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,002
Yeah, well, this is very common
in degenerative diseases

278
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:25,000
that affect motor skills.
Multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy.

279
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:28,100
Maybe the ghost that took over
this body had a similar handicap.

280
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,903
- Uh, defect, whatever.
- He's not clumsy anymore.

281
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:33,502
Right! He's not clumsy,
'cause he's in his new body.

282
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:34,600
He's getting the lay of the land.

283
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:38,202
He's saying, hey, this isn't the old
dead me. This is the new dead me.

284
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,603
Not to mention,
living out his wildest dreams.

285
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:41,301
What do you mean?

286
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,003
If you couldn't walk, and you saw kids
running and jumping and doing

287
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:47,403
all the things you dreamed of doing,
when you could, wouldn't you

288
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:50,601
trade up for a new body? Wouldn't you
even come back from dead for a new body?

289
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,302
Ok, so you're telling me that
this kid waited for somebody to die

290
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:56,000
so he could come back and live
again without a handicap?

291
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,703
Do you think it's easy being
this brilliant, Melinda?

292
00:18:58,808 --> 00:18:59,803
It's not.

293
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,401
Sometimes it makes...

294
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,203
it makes my head hurt, right here.

295
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,003
Ok, well, there may be more to it than that.

296
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:09,601
He said they had to find her
and finish some kind of list.

297
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:10,702
What do you mean, "her"?

298
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,502
He didn't say.

299
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,303
- You might have a problem.
- Why?

300
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,501
You said that ghost was 16 years old?

301
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,701
No you're dealing with something
that's more unpredictable

302
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:22,201
than a haitian death culture.
You're dealing with a teenage ghost

303
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:26,500
inside a man's body with raging
hormones looking for a girl.

304
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:29,200
Good luck.

305
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,500
Hello?

306
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,702
Hi, can I speak with Alyssa Adams, please?

307
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:16,503
- This is Alyssa.
- Oh, great! Hi! This is Melinda Gordon.

308
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:20,003
I'm actually looking for some
information on Jason Bennett.

309
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:23,701
I read your, uh, memorial page
in the yearbook.

310
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,802
Is this for the reunion reel?

311
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,201
Sorry?

312
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,101
For the 10-year reunion.

313
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:34,001
I was already contacted about this,
and I think his parents are
contributing something.

314
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,903
Yes! Yes, this is for the reunion.

315
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,400
The one this weekend, yeah.

316
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,601
You know, could we meet?

317
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:47,902
Because I'd really like to
talk to you more about him.

318
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,301
Hello?

319
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:01,301
Sorry. Did I set the ringer too loud?

320
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:04,102
Are you watching me?

321
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:08,203
Only in the fun way.
Not in that crazy stalker way.

322
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:11,300
What do you want?

323
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:12,903
Say I'm sorry.

324
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:16,102
You already did that.

325
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,302
This is phase two.

326
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,702
Look, you don't get to cue
your way out of this.

327
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,500
You left me standing on the street
waiting for you.

328
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,503
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that was?

329
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,901
And then I had to walk
home after that?

330
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:32,603
- I got no phone call, no explanation...
- But I have an explanation now.

331
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:35,101
It's too late.

332
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:40,702
And... since it took you this long,
you're even lamer than I thought.

333
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:42,301
True.

334
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:46,303
Completely, totally true. But...

335
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,402
if I could just buy you a cup of
coffee, you know, or any dark liquid.

336
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,400
Just have a minute.

337
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,401
Tim, I gave you a minute.

338
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:58,702
In fact, I gave you 30 long minutes.

339
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,000
And you blew it.

340
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:08,703
Well, we found one of his old yearbooks,

341
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,101
and there was a reference
to a special girl.

342
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:15,002
I was just wondering if you...

343
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:20,003
We loved each other,
but... just friends.

344
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,700
- He was so active.
- Yeah.

345
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:33,101
He had muscular dystrophy, but he didn't
like to let one day go by

346
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,300
without feeling like
he accomplished something.

347
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:37,703
Like on the day we met,
it was in detention.

348
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:38,900
Hmm, detention.

349
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:43,001
He was in detention all the time.

350
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,600
Do you know those old
showers in the chem lab

351
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:49,601
with that emergency handle just in
case some kid sets himself on fire?

352
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:55,701
He rolled himself under one of those
and shouted, "name the movie."

353
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:00,901
Jason dripping wet in detention and
just furious that no one figured it out.

354
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,300
- Flashdance?
- Yeah.

355
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,902
I was the first to give him
the right answer.

356
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,302
And he said, I had no choice.

357
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:12,703
We would have to be
best friends from then on.

358
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,700
It's been 10 years,
and I still miss him.

359
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:19,503
We pulled so many schemes together.

360
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,400
Just to feel like he could live.

361
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:25,600
Is that why you took out
the page in the yearbook?

362
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,002
"Not one day wasted"?

363
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah.

364
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,001
What's this list?

365
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:39,402
At the end, Jason spent
a lot of time in the hospital.

366
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:44,202
And it should have been
the worst time, but it wasn't.

367
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:47,803
We dreamed up a list of things
to do before we died.

368
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:52,303
- "Bungee jump off Grand Canyon"?
- Him.

369
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:57,303
- "Open a studio in Paris."
- Yeah, so I could work on my collages.

370
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:00,203
He knew that he would
never leave that room,

371
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:05,203
and it couldn't stop him from
dreaming. It meant so much to him.

372
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:08,100
Well, you kept the list. It must
have meant something to you too.

373
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,800
No.

374
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:10,801
The further the you get
from high school,

375
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:15,002
the harder it is to make
your dreams come true.

376
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:18,002
I still enjoy my art,
but I am not going to be selling it

377
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:21,902
next to the Eiffel Tower anytime soon.

378
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,900
Jason's the one that could
have done it. Not me.

379
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:29,101
What about this last thing?
"Find Stephanie Hardwick"?

380
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,003
Homecoming queen.

381
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,300
The girl everybody loved.

382
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,503
He wanted to find her
at the reunion and kiss her.

383
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:38,603
Really?

384
00:24:38,707 --> 00:24:41,001
What guy wouldn't wanna
kiss the homecoming queen?

385
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:45,703
But... why at the reunion?
I mean what was special about it?

386
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:48,600
By 2007, Jason...

387
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,600
he was sure they'd have
a cure for his M.D.

388
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:54,402
And he'd be able to walk
into the reunion, and...

389
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:58,301
Be the man he dreamed of being.

390
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,102
I mean, who doesn't want to go
to their high school reunion

391
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,900
- not looking like a rock star?
- Yeah, I know.

392
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:06,000
Jason waited for a body he knew
would fit in at the reunion.

393
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:09,700
Someone his own age, someone handsome.
Even the clothes he took.

394
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,701
Yeah, just to impress miss Stephanie.

395
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,102
Before he plants one on her.

396
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,603
Oh, god. If he gets to her
before I can stop him...

397
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,803
You should slip her
an altoid at least.

398
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:24,100
Ok, you know what?
That is not funny.

399
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:28,401
Here she is.

400
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:35,602
You know, what if the body that
Jason took wasn't an accident?

401
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,301
What do you mean?

402
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:39,702
Stephanie Hardwick.
Homecoming queen.

403
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:40,603
Yeah?

404
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,401
Look at the homecoming king.

405
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:48,700
Bryan and Jason were classmates.

406
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:51,002
Jason didn't pick a random body.

407
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:53,100
He picked the body.

408
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:56,002
Of her date 10 years ago.

409
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:59,303
"Varsity quarterback, valedictorian."

410
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:02,403
Well, looks like the most popular guy
at school is gonna be going to his

411
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,000
high school reunion after all.

412
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:09,402
Yeah. He'll just be a lot
different than they remember.

413
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,301
Usually a corpse is gonna
take 6 to 8 days to decay.

414
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:42,902
We're only on day 3.

415
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,903
That's assuming a perfect stress-free
environment here. Which we don't have.

416
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,403
I mean, this guy is really putting
his body through the ringer.

417
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,301
So how long will it be
before he breaks down?

418
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:52,900
- I would say 6, maybe 8 hours.
- That soon?

419
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:55,302
Maybe less, if he keeps jumping
through flaming hoops.

420
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:57,201
My gosh, nature's running
its course on this guy.

421
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,902
When we first found him,
he was trying to set his ribs.

422
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:01,602
Well, he probably knows
his body won't hold out on him.

423
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:05,203
So if you were trying to preserve
your body for as long as possible,
what would you do?

424
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:08,900
I would get some kind of makeup.
Maybe the type a mortician would use.

425
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:11,302
Cover up the appearance of dead skin.

426
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,801
Ok. There's only one
mortuary in Grandview.

427
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:15,601
Thanks.

428
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,902
Jim?

429
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:34,102
Hey, dead guy.

430
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:36,303
Can I have my ring back?

431
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:37,603
How's he been?

432
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:41,403
Fine, once I restrained him.

433
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:45,500
Is this really necessary?
I'm sorry, all right?

434
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,203
Jason, we can't let you
go to that reunion.

435
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,200
Why not?
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

436
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,702
No, but you wanted to kiss that
Stephanie Hardwick, you know?

437
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,702
The last thing on your list? Come on.

438
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:59,303
I was never actually gonna do that.
That was... that was just a goof.

439
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:02,802
I just wanted to go and enjoy myself.

440
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:06,601
Ok, even if that's true, your body's
breaking down, and you're not Bryan.

441
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:09,100
You lived your life, and you
can't steal somebody else's.

442
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,300
I didn't steal it.

443
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:15,201
He abandoned it.
There's a big difference.

444
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:19,201
You've been haunting him
this whole time, haven't you?

445
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,603
Not haunting, just...

446
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:23,802
checking in.

447
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:26,403
I was curious to see what
mr. Most Likely To Succeed

448
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:30,102
was gonna do with his life
after he dropped out of college.

449
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,901
Whoa. Back up.
He dropped out of college?

450
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:38,402
- He barely made it through a semester.
Isn't that right, Bryan? - Shut up.

451
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:42,000
You wanna tell her what happened
after graduation, or should I?

452
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,303
Shut up.

453
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:49,103
- You don't know what it was like.
- Well, actually, I... do.

454
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:53,500
You see, life wasn't so kind
after senior year.

455
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:57,602
College ball was a little tougher,
classes took a little bit more effort,

456
00:28:57,707 --> 00:29:01,803
Bryan just couldn't juggle it all
like he could when he was 17,

457
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,401
and he ended up getting
cut from the team,

458
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,601
eventually dropped out from the school,
and basically spent the last 10 years

459
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:10,503
studying his life from
the bottom of the class.

460
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:12,300
Is that true?

461
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:14,601
I mean he coasted on charm for a while.

462
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:20,002
He was always good with the girls,
but even that faded.

463
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,200
It gets to a point where girls
really aren't interested in guy

464
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:26,800
who can't keep a job
for longer than 6 months.

465
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:29,502
I mean, even Stephanie,
the homecoming queen

466
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,100
moved on,
got engaged to that, uh...

467
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,900
that guy, uh, Rick.

468
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,703
Second string on the football team.

469
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,901
That wasn't fair.

470
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:43,703
He didn't deserve her.

471
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,601
I mean, how could I show up
at a reunion and...

472
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:51,400
- I didn't have a choice.
- He ended up in a bar, alone.

473
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:55,100
Trying to convince a complete stranger
to go to our reunion with him.

474
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:57,901
Come on! You'll be doing me
this huge favor.

475
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,502
No, look. I just met you.

476
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:01,600
Look, please.

477
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:05,401
Oh, god. Just leave me alone.

478
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:09,600
What do you do when you realize
you peaked in high school?

479
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,002
I mean when you got nothing to
live for, how do you talk to all

480
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:16,501
those people and all they remember
is how you used to be?

481
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,702
Do you face them like you
freeze yourself in time

482
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:26,201
and leave nothing but a memory
and a good-looking corpse?

483
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,902
No!

484
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:37,300
You were too scared to live?

485
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,900
It was too hard.

486
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,402
All of it was just too hard.

487
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,800
Oh, boo-hoo.

488
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,500
Tell that to the kid who spent
his life in a wheelchair.

489
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:50,802
Bryan, you told me that you
didn't have any unfinished business.

490
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:55,000
This reunion is your
unfinished business.

491
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:57,701
I can't...

492
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:01,601
I can't walk in there
and just see all those people.

493
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,202
And what?

494
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:07,501
Face a difficult choice
for once in your life?

495
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:13,400
I mean, do you realize what
I would have done with just... one?

496
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:19,102
Just one of those chances
that you... threw away.

497
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:27,003
Do you promise that you
won't harass Stephanie?

498
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:30,203
I swear on my life.

499
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,401
You konw what I mean.

500
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,102
Cut Jason loose.

501
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:40,901
- Uh, you sure about this?
- Yes, I am sure.

502
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,802
It's the only way I'm gonna be
able to cross both of them over

503
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:47,503
is to get both of them
back to the reunion.

504
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:51,802
Let's go back to the high school.

505
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:02,603
Are you sure this looks natural?
This foundation seems a little heavy.

506
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,302
Jason, this is the least
of your problems, ok?

507
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:08,903
Just stay out of direct light.
It'll make the makeup look better and...

508
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:12,102
well, stop you from melting.

509
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,802
Got it.

510
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:15,303
And what about me?

511
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:19,303
And what happens when everybody
asks me, "hey, man, you know."

512
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,903
"What you been doing with
yourself the past 10 years"?

513
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,300
I don't know.
Tell 'em the truth.

514
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:26,203
Another guy is going to my
reunion in my body, Melinda.

515
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,500
I think we're being a little loose
with the truth, don't you think?

516
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:31,702
Ok, fine.
We'll make a deal.

517
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:36,203
Jason goes in, he will say
and do exactly what you want.

518
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:38,501
Trade-off is that you
have to be honest

519
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,900
with your old friends
and even with yourself.

520
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:43,901
- Deal?
- Deal.

521
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:48,103
Fine, I'll do it.

522
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:52,403
- But I won't enjoy it.
- Me neither.

523
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:24,600
Hey, man, what you been doing
with yourself the last 10 years?

524
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:27,202
I was a paramedic
for a couple of years.

525
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,301
Paramedic? Cool.

526
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:34,800
All right, this is not helping.

527
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:37,401
Ok, guys.

528
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:38,700
What?

529
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:42,901
You lying about Bryan's past.
That was not part of our deal.

530
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,103
Fine with me.
Really.

531
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,200
Bryan had to tell the truth.
You didn't say anythinlg about me.

532
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:50,400
Besides, you were the one
who was worried about anybody

533
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:56,401
noticing a corpse in the midst.
I had to come up with some ali...

534
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:59,903
There she is. Wow.
She hasn't changed a bit.

535
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:01,403
Oh, god.

536
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,000
This is it.

537
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:05,602
I gotta go and say hi.

538
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,400
No. Hold it.

539
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:12,300
You made me a promise and so far,
you are batting zero on your word.

540
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:16,301
Hey, talk.
That's all. I swear.

541
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:20,502
Thank you.

542
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,502
Bryan!

543
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:26,103
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, hey. Uh, Rick.

544
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,102
So, what's been going on with you?

545
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:29,402
Uh, not much.

546
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:32,701
- I was, uh, I was just gonna say hi...
- Yeah, you know we're engaged now?

547
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:35,302
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I read that.

548
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,002
- Congratulations.
- God, that must kill you a little bit.

549
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:40,302
'Cause you guys were so cute
as a couple, and then,


550
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,800
the star quarterback
loses her to the backup.

551
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:46,001
Ok, you know what? Maybe we should
go and talk to somebody else. Hello.

552
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:49,603
No, you're not going anywhere.
This guy's a jealous punk.

553
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:51,402
He always has been.

554
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,902
So I heard you're a big,
heroic paramedic now.

555
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:56,001
That is great.
I'm so happy for you.

556
00:34:56,106 --> 00:35:01,603
But that was after you blew
the big game against state, right?

557
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:04,801
- Man, that was a long time ago.
Who cares? - I care.

558
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:07,200
Because some things don't change.

559
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:10,403
Like what coach used to tell us.
"You gotta want it."

560
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,400
You still want it, Bryan?
Or did you give up?

561
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:17,102
Ok, Jason, you're gonna
repeat everything I say.

562
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:22,501
- We really don't have time for this.
- We made a deal.

563
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:27,603
All right, here's what
you're gonna say.

564
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:30,503
You're right, Rick. I did give up.

565
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:34,800
And another day goes by right on
think about how much I wasted,

566
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:40,403
how many opportunities I let
slip because I was too scared.

567
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:44,500
But you come to the point where
you need to let your regrets go, too,

568
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:47,100
or they take over your wife.

569
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,203
I was lucky.

570
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:51,402
I got that chance.

571
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:57,300
Not everybody does.

572
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:05,003
Also, 3 years ago,
I totally nailed your sister.

573
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,602
Was that last part really necessary?

574
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:11,602
Yeah. Did you see
the look on his face?

575
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:15,400
Yeah, and he's pissed at me.

576
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:23,200
Stay away from her, you loser.

577
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:32,400
Why you gotta be such a jerk?

578
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:39,501
Bryan! I'm so sorry about Rick.
Are you all right?

579
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm fine.
I'm just gonna go get cleaned up.

580
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:45,200
You look great, bu the way.

581
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:49,803
It's all right.
We are leaving right now.

582
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:56,300
Just a little further, ok?

583
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:57,502
What can we do?

584
00:36:57,608 --> 00:37:03,502
I don't know. We can't send him
to a hospital. He's already dead.

585
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,703
This does not... feel good.

586
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:14,001
This is all my fault.
Why can't I keep my mouth shut?

587
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:16,303
Jason, you don't have a lot of time.

588
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:18,200
Is there a message that you
want me to give to Stephanie?

589
00:37:18,308 --> 00:37:22,600
Anything that you want me to tell her?

590
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:25,903
What's that light?

591
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:30,200
No. No, Jason, you stay with me, ok?

592
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:34,401
Jason, just stay with me, please?

593
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:56,603
What are you guys looking at?

594
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,603
You're here.

595
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,502
Well, yeah, I'm here.

596
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:04,600
I mean, I'm a ghost again,
but you know that. That's ok.

597
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,701
Yeah, but I thought you were
going into the light.

598
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,700
You said "what is that light?".

599
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:12,303
Yeah, I think that was actually the,
uh, the streetlamp.

600
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:16,202
Behind you, it was giving you a kind of a weird glow.

601
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:18,803
It made you look like angel.

602
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:23,101
- I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.

603
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,901
I do have one last favor.

604
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:30,601
There is a girl I need
to get a message to.

605
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:41,201
- How's Bryan?
- Oh, he's... he's fine.

606
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:43,902
- Um, could I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.

607
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:48,902
No problem. Maybe my
fiance's sobered up by now.

608
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:53,401
So it turns out that
I have something to give you.

609
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:56,203
What is it?

610
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,903
Jason wrote this.

611
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,600
It's his handwriting.

612
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:06,300
How is this possible?

613
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:09,303
It's a little hard to explain,
but the important thing is

614
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:12,003
that Jason wanted you to have it.

615
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:13,602
I don't deserve it.

616
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:16,500
Jason is the one who
accomplished everything.

617
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,202
I never did anything.

618
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:21,201
- No, that's not true.
- That's not true.

619
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:25,102
She looked at me and saw me...

620
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,700
and not just a kid in a wheelchair.

621
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:34,102
Do you remember how the really good
things that you said you saw in Jason?

622
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:36,500
He felt that.

623
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,803
He cherished it.

624
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:45,200
And he wouldn't have been able to...
live as much if it weren't for you.

625
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,302
Tell her to look at
the bottom of the list.

626
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:54,503
Oh, yeah. You should look
at the bottom of the list.

627
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:11,601
I wasn't even sure I wanted
to come to this reunion.

628
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,303
Thank you.

629
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:23,602
So... you guys ready to cross over now?

630
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,502
Well, you know, they're about to
present awards next, maybe...

631
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:33,501
maybe we'll get
"traveled furtherest to be here."

632
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:37,703
Jeez.

633
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:44,401
Are you as scared to go
into that as I am?

634
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:46,800
Uh...

635
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:49,302
yeah.

636
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,401
You don't have to be scared.

637
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:55,400
- But what if I don't get it right?
- Not possible.

638
00:40:55,507 --> 00:41:00,103
There's no way you could
get it wrong, so...

639
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:05,100
Let's...

640
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,101
let's go live a little.

641
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:11,003
Let it all go.

642
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:33,001
- So was Harold happy to have
his missing body back? - He was.

643
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,902
And he didn't even ask why
dead guy was wearing suit.

644
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:37,603
The estate sale worked out well.

645
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,200
Hey, have you ever heard
of hair jewelry?

646
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:44,303
Yeah, it's a little bit of a scam.

647
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:48,100
What?

648
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:04,300
If you won't go to coffee,
the coffee will come to you.

649
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:07,801
He'll stay out there all day.
Believe me, he will.

650
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:13,600
Yeah, maybe you should just
go out there and get it over with.

651
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:54,803
