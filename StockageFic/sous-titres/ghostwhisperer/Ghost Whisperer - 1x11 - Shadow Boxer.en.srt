1
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:10,301
My name
is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,900
I just got married,

3
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:16,034
just moved to a small town,
just opened up an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,900
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:20,900
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

6
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,067
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

7
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:25,367
Grandmother:
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,900
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

9
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,234
the ones who have not
crossed over

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,534
because they have unfinished
business with the living,

11
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,767
and they come
to me for help.

12
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,067
To tell you my story,
i have to tell you theirs.

13
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:04,833
Double jab cross.
Ok.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,034
Double jab cross!

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,501
Stay on top of him.
Stay on top of him!

16
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,934
Be first! Be first!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
1, 2, 1, 2.

18
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,668
Get inside... and time!

19
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,833
Nice work,
nice work, nice work.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,401
Hey, teo, don't make me
come up there and show
you how it's done, huh?

21
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:21,000
Keep dreaming.

22
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,100
What's going on?
We selling those tickets?

23
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,167
We had to print more.

24
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,034
I'm gonna go hit up
the ladies in the
self-defense class.

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,800
Nice. Ladies.
My new target audience.

26
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:32,800
Hah!
Hah!

27
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:34,733
And again, and attack!

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,967
Hah!
Hah!

29
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,534
Ok. I can't wait
to see you all
next time.

30
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:42,301
Ladies, don't forget,
next saturday,
it's fight night

31
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,867
right here
in our own beautiful
village square.

32
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:46,434
It's our own
teo de la costa

33
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,301
vs. Jackie o'callahan
from centerville.

34
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,634
I have to tell you,
i do not get boxing.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,301
2 guys hit each
other over and over
again on purpose

36
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,534
until one of them
falls down.

37
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,367
Oh, well,
it's quicker than football.

38
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:59,634
All the proceeds
go right to the firehouse
reconstruction project, too.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,733
So, i'll see you
at the store?

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,733
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,067
Oh, bring coffee?

42
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,367
Of course. Muffin?

43
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:06,733
I think
i've earned it.
Pumpkin.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,467
Ooh! Done!

45
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:09,800
Girls, stone cold.

46
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,334
Ho ho! That's right.
Hey.

47
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:15,501
Hey, come on.
I want you to
meet teo.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,767
Uhh!

49
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,034
Teo, sorry to interrupt.

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,167
I wanted to introduce
you to my wife.

51
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,334
Mrs. Clancy,
it's a pleasure.

52
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,467
Mrs. Clancy
is my mother-in-law.

53
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,201
Please,
just call me melinda.

54
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,167
Melinda.

55
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,201
That's what
i taught him.

56
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,700
Never to
call a grownup
by their first name

57
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,000
unless
given permission.

58
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:40,601
Um... just one thing,
though.

59
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:42,401
Do you think you could
take a dive in the eighth,

60
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,201
'cause i got a couple
hundred bucks on o'callahan.

61
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,401
You made a bad bet,
my friend.

62
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,467
Take a dive.

63
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,467
My son would never
do such a thing.

64
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,867
It was a joke.

65
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:53,167
No, no,
it's not a joke.

66
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:54,634
I gotta cover
all my bases.

67
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
You're crazy, dude.

68
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,434
All right.
Do what you do best.

69
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:58,434
I'll check you later.

70
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,833
All right.

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,501
Hey, jim.
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

72
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,334
[Speaking spanish]

73
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,668
My spanish is
a little rusty.

74
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,568
Can you see me?

75
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:10,367
Come on.

76
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:13,201
Something terrible has
happened to my family.

77
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,777
???

78
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:01,051
i know you can see me.

79
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,483
I know. I can
tell by the way

80
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,851
you're pretending
not to see me.

81
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,851
Not here. I can't
talk to you here.

82
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,350
Can you see me now?

83
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:17,617
Ok, new policy.

84
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:19,951
No more talking
to ghosts in public.

85
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,084
Too many people staring,
and nobody is buying
the cell phone excuse.

86
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,984
Is this some kind
of stream of
consciousness thing

87
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,483
you picked up
in yoga class?

88
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:30,084
Oh, um, ok. Su...
uh...

89
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,851
i'll be
in the back room

90
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,184
doing some stuff.

91
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,517
You have to help me.

92
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,350
With what?
My husband.

93
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:43,984
He was always
with my son, always
watching over him,

94
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,884
protecting him,
and now they're not even
talking to each other,

95
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,284
and i don't know why.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,017
Do you know when
they stopped talking
to each other?

97
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,184
Was it before you died?

98
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,617
I don't remember.

99
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,084
All the medicine
that they gave me
made me so foggy.

100
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:57,450
Do you remember
your name?

101
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,717
Oh. I'm so sorry. Yes.

102
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,984
My name is
estella de la costa.

103
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,517
Estella,
let me be honest.

104
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,051
I think this is
a domestic problem

105
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:06,851
between 2 living people,

106
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,383
and they need to work it
out for themselves.

107
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,017
It's not really what
i do. Hi.

108
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:11,951
So, then,
what do you do?

109
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,951
I help people
cross over.

110
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,383
I cannot even think
about cross over

111
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,784
before i know
what happened to them.

112
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,550
Look, i'm sorry.
Family disputes are
none of my business.

113
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:22,817
This is something
you need to make peace
with and move...

114
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:25,017
it's not
a family dispute.

115
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,218
It's not that simple.

116
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,550
It can't be.
[Bells on door
jingle]

117
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:30,717
They just love
each other so much.

118
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,151
Oh, hi.

119
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,550
Just once, i wish
one of those ghosts
following you around

120
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,251
would actually
buy something.

121
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,750
Ok. I don't understand
something about you.

122
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,218
Plain pizza?

123
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:07,184
Uhh! You don't like
anything on it at all?

124
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,750
I'm a purist.

125
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:11,517
You, mr. Gourmet cook,
and you have naked pizza.

126
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,218
That is just indecent.

127
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,951
As soon as you
put meat and fish and
pineapple on a pizza,

128
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:18,617
it's not pizza anymore.
It's frankenpizza.

129
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,817
It's unnatural,

130
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,483
and actually, it's
insulting to the pizza.

131
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,717
Now you're saying
i'm insulting pizza?

132
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,984
I'm surprised it's
even speaking to you.

133
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,284
You need help.
I am begging you

134
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,251
to get help
for that whole thing.

135
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,318
All right.
Ha ha ha ha!

136
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,884
I met someone
interesting today.

137
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,550
Should i be jealous?

138
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,650
A living person?

139
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,117
Oh, right.
Of course not.

140
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,650
How could that be
interesting?

141
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,117
Teo's mother.

142
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,450
No kidding.

143
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,251
You know anything
about the family at all?

144
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:53,550
Not really. Well,
his dad used to train
him at that gym,

145
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:56,117
but he hasn't been
around for a long time.

146
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,251
Well, apparently,
he hasn't talked to
his dad in a long time,

147
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,784
and his mom
doesn't know why.

148
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:04,450
What happened to her?

149
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,951
I don't know.
She doesn't know.

150
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,117
I don't know if
there's anything i can do.

151
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:10,417
I mean,
i want to help her,

152
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,218
but then, am i
getting involved in
their family business?

153
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,383
Yeah.

154
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,450
I just feel
like i have to start

155
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,318
setting some boundaries,
you know?

156
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,584
What do you think?

157
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,951
That's a tough call,

158
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:22,117
because when you
start talking
about boundaries,

159
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,084
i start thinking about
uninterrupted dinners,

160
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,483
nights at the movies,
and weekends
out of town, and...

161
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,650
right.
Am i a bad person?

162
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:31,051
No. Because then i
start thinking about
teo and his dad,

163
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,184
and they used to be
at that gym 24/7.

164
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:37,084
I mean, his dad was
training him to get
ready for the olympics.

165
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,951
Well, the least i can do
is let teo talk to his mom

166
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,784
and see if she can
get them back together.

167
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:42,984
Right, yeah.

168
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,318
Hey, i think one
of your anchovies

169
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,951
is violating
the air space of my
perfectly plain pizza.

170
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,218
Embrace the anchovy.
Embrace it.

171
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,483
Come on, do it.

172
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,851
You need help.
You know you want to.

173
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,483
I'll embrace it.
You think
i need help?

174
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,318
This is me,
embracing it.

175
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:58,550
Ooh!
Oh, my god.

176
00:07:58,617 --> 00:07:59,750
It's alive.

177
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:01,151
Out, demon.

178
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:02,650
Ha ha ha!

179
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:41,383
You need
a sparring partner?

180
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,517
No way. I'd definitely
be outclassed by you.

181
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:47,084
Oh, it's true.
I am undefeated
in my weight class.

182
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,550
Ha ha ha ha!

183
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:49,917
Did i interrupt?

184
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,784
No. Melinda, right?

185
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,184
Right.

186
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,984
Everyone's
really excited
about the fight.

187
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,584
Yeah? Good.

188
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,917
It's gonna be
a good one.

189
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,117
Do you ever get scared
in the ring?

190
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:03,350
I mean, when somebody's
coming at you like that,
attacking you?

191
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,684
I look forward to it.

192
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,684
Oh. 'cause i get
scared when i
have to fend off

193
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,584
a 70-year-old woman
named edith in my
self-defense class.

194
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,251
You know, even
if you're afraid,
you should never show it.

195
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:17,350
If you let your opponent
sense your fear,
then you're done.

196
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,517
The first question
i ask every time
i step in the ring,

197
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,517
is this guy scared?

198
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,517
They usually are.

199
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:27,251
Your parents must be
very proud of you.

200
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,417
Are they coming?

201
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,251
My mother died last year.

202
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,617
Well, maybe
she'll be watching you
on saturday anyway.

203
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,617
You believe that stuff?

204
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,784
Actually, yes.

205
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:40,884
Well, i don't.

206
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,051
There's nothing
after this.

207
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:44,417
There's no heaven,
there's no hell.

208
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,517
You're born,
you live, you die.

209
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:47,784
That's it.

210
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,084
Are you sure?

211
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,151
Yeah, i'm sure.

212
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,417
I'm here to do one
thing in this life,
and that's fight,

213
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,817
so that's what
i'm gonna do.

214
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:01,717
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't talk
about my mother.

215
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,817
Not like that.

216
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:12,383
Stubborn as a mule,
just like his <i>mami.</i>

217
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,517
Ha ha ha ha!

218
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,750
Oh, i laughed at them...
the doctors...

219
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,750
when they told me i had
a tumor in my brain.

220
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,084
I didn't care about
the odds or statistics.

221
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,917
I got out of
castro's cuba.

222
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:30,350
I come to this country
with nothing,

223
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,951
made a home,
raised a child.

224
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:37,017
I had so many challenges
in my life.

225
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:40,951
I never thought cancer
was gonna beat me.

226
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:46,284
But then the tumor
spread out
like a spider web.

227
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,017
The doctors
couldn't operate.

228
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:54,784
I started feeling
like i was disappearing.

229
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:59,350
They said i had
6 months to live.

230
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,184
6 months?

231
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,318
Teo and my husband

232
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:07,517
were away in a tournament
when i died.

233
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:15,584
I watched.

234
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,717
I saw him win.

235
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,517
That is the last thing
i remember.

236
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,450
After my funeral,

237
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:41,117
teo packed up
and left our house.

238
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:44,450
It's a mother's
worst nightmare.

239
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:49,851
She died, and her husband
can't protect your child.

240
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,951
If i just could talk
to gilberto,

241
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:56,884
ask him what happened
between the two of them.

242
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,117
Look, abby,
you're dragging
your feet!

243
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,151
Come on!
Look alive!

244
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,750
Not gonna beat
holy family looking
like that, girls.

245
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:19,218
Look at him.
So focused.

246
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:23,550
Everything he does,
he does 100%.

247
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,984
You'd never say his
heart is breaking.

248
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:28,450
All right.
Work on your headers.

249
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,184
Excuse me.
Mr. De la costa, hi.

250
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,184
Hi.

251
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,184
I'm melinda gordon.

252
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,218
Nice meeting you.

253
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:38,750
I'm a friend
of estella's.

254
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:43,184
Oh. I'm sorry,
have we met before?

255
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,483
I don't remember you.

256
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,184
I'm really more of an
acquaintance of estella's.

257
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:50,617
Um... she spoke to me
about you.

258
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:54,984
She loved you...
very much.

259
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,117
Sorry.

260
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:03,350
Sometimes it's like
i find a new little
piece of her every day.

261
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:09,483
My friends told me
i would get over this

262
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,051
and that i'll move on.

263
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,584
It just doesn't
get any better.

264
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,917
My heart is so sore.

265
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,017
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,483
I know
how much it hurts.

267
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,417
You do, don't you?

268
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,218
Ok. That's it for today!

269
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:35,750
Make sure you get some
orange and water inside you!

270
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:37,984
And stretch!

271
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,251
Do you ever
feel like sometimes
she's still with you?

272
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:44,218
Yes. Yes, i do.

273
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:47,151
Little hints
here and there.

274
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,350
I'll be on the field on
a beautiful, sunny day,

275
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:52,584
and i'll feel
a surge of happiness

276
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,218
just like i used to feel
when i was coming
home to her.

277
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,717
And for an instant,
i feel like if i just
turn around and look,

278
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,151
she'll be there
beside me.

279
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:04,151
And, of course, i look,
and she's not there.

280
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,650
Hmm.

281
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:07,917
And i die a little bit
more inside.

282
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:11,684
So, how did you meet?

283
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,617
In cuba. I was walking
across the town square

284
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,750
in havana
with my friend miguel,

285
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,917
and i saw her walking
toward me.

286
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,251
He took my picture
before we even met.

287
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,917
You took her picture
before you even met.

288
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:27,984
With an
old-fashioned camera.

289
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,151
Yes.
It was the last moment

290
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,584
you two
didn't know each other.

291
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,084
I don't understand.

292
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,417
Look, the reason i know
your wife, how i know her,

293
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:43,218
is that i can see her.

294
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:44,750
It's a gift i have.

295
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:54,450
You... estella's here?

296
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:55,884
She hasn't passed
over yet,

297
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,650
and she
wants to talk to you.

298
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,383
I knew it in my bones
that if i had faith,

299
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,884
that she'd come back
to me.

300
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,383
Is she ok?
No more suffering?

301
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,750
No. Not from sickness.

302
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,951
From something else, though.
She's confused.

303
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,884
Why are you not
training him for
the olympics?

304
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,151
What happened?

305
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,951
She wants to know why
you're not training teo

306
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:16,984
for the olympics.

307
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,650
You tell her...

308
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,851
you can tell her.

309
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,951
She's standing
right in front of you.

310
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,917
Where?

311
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:28,483
What's done is done.
I did what you asked
me to do.

312
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,251
What did she
ask you to do?

313
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,784
That's between us.

314
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,483
Excuse me, miss gordon.
I gotta go.

315
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:42,951
What did you
ask him to do?

316
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:45,784
????

317
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:20,687
teo. Remember me?
Anthony majors.

318
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,987
We met in brooklyn,
kid gloves,
a couple years ago.

319
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:25,053
You saw me fight
fast louie leone.

320
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,053
Tko, third round.

321
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,154
You never had a fight
that went more than 5.

322
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,888
You signed
my fight card.

323
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:33,154
I still have it, sir.

324
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,320
Well, now we know
we both have
excellent memories.

325
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:38,320
What are you doing here?
I mean, in grandview?

326
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:39,953
I'm looking for you.

327
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,087
Me?

328
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,521
A couple of years ago,

329
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,754
your old man was training
you for the olympics.

330
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,953
I read that you qualified
for the national team.
You were big...

331
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,087
then you just dropped
out of sight.

332
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:53,587
And when i finally
hear your name again,

333
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:55,621
they tell me
you're fighting in
these little towns,

334
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,053
so i had to come up
and see for myself.

335
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,320
What happened?

336
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,888
We had a death
in the family.

337
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,120
My mother.

338
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:08,721
I'm sorry to hear that.

339
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:12,087
I lost my old man when
i was about your age,
so i know how it feels.

340
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,788
I just want to
keep fighting.

341
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,053
The olympics?

342
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,087
Don't really matter
to me anymore.

343
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:21,320
Is your father
still training you?

344
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:22,788
No, sir.

345
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,354
Look, teo, i didn't
come all this way

346
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:26,987
just to talk
about the past.

347
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:29,053
I want you to come
to my training camp
in florida,

348
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,087
work with my guys,
real trainers.

349
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,287
All due respect.

350
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:37,154
Take you along slow,
steadily,

351
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,587
the right fights,
the right opponents.

352
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:43,621
In a year or two,
you'll be the main event.

353
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:49,254
This is your time,
my friend. Your shot.

354
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,987
I've never been to florida,
mr. Majors.

355
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:55,387
Well, i guess you could
use a change of scenery,

356
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,554
find the joy
in the sport again,

357
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,721
make nice money.

358
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,621
Make a lot of money.

359
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:06,621
Look, teo, i know this
is a lot at once,

360
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,020
so why don't we
just hang out for
a couple of days,

361
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,020
let me work with you.

362
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,254
Ok.

363
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,654
Attack!
Yah!

364
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:14,788
Aah!
Oh, my god!

365
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:16,754
Oh, i'm sorry!
Ow!

366
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,788
Ow!
Oh, i'm so sorry.
Are you ok?

367
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:20,888
Have you been
practicing
at home?

368
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,287
A little.

369
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:25,554
What are you
planning on being,
an urban vigilante?

370
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,053
Well, i don't have
big, strong jim

371
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,587
beside me to protect
me all the time.

372
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:31,020
Well, i don't always
have big, strong jim
beside me, either.

373
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,854
Ok, then. So you
want to go again?

374
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,053
No.
Uhh!

375
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,554
Ok, class, that's it!

376
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:37,953
Let's give it up for us!

377
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,220
Whoo!

378
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:46,987
...get to know
each other.

379
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:08,654
I love this coat.
I got it at an estate
sale in saratoga.

380
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,654
It belonged to a woman
whose great-grandmother's
best friend

381
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,821
was eleanor roosevelt.

382
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,487
There's a problem.

383
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,920
Andrea can ring that up
for you.

384
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,788
Explain to me something.

385
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,788
Why is it bad
for teo to sign up
with a promoter?

386
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,487
I mean, isn't that
what fighters do?

387
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:24,888
Well, only amateur
fighters can go to
the olympics.

388
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,654
Once you turn
into a professional,
that's it.

389
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:28,020
It's all
about the money.

390
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:31,020
And he's too young
to deal with all that.

391
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,387
We have to talk to
gilberto.

392
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah. I'll talk to him.

393
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,788
Do you know a promoter
named anthony majors?

394
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,387
I knew him when his name
was tony mangione.

395
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,854
He's made a name for
himself on the back
of a lot of boxers.

396
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,354
He wants to take teo
with him to florida,

397
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,888
wants him to turn pro.

398
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:51,920
What did teo say?

399
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:55,187
He seems to be
thinking about it.

400
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,020
Your wife came to me
about this.

401
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,220
She's very upset.

402
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,454
I've seen what majors
does to his fighters.

403
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,287
He'll use teo
as cannon fodder

404
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,554
for his top contenders.

405
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:09,087
He came to me several
years ago in brooklyn,

406
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,287
and i told him,
i am teo's trainer.

407
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,621
We don't need you.

408
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,621
I guess now that i'm
out of the picture...

409
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:17,920
estella needs you
to talk to teo,

410
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:20,254
even if it's just to
warn him about majors.

411
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,521
He doesn't have
anyone to guide him.

412
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,754
He needs you.

413
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,888
My son, eh?

414
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,687
You know how it is
between us.

415
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,754
If i tell him to stay
away from majors,
he'll run to him.

416
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:35,754
Maybe, but if he does
go with him and
something bad happens,

417
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:37,187
can you live with that?

418
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:39,521
Majors: That's the advantage
of having a manager

419
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:40,654
and a promoter.

420
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,154
I make sure that
you're taken care of,

421
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,354
win or lose.

422
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,654
All your contracts
are air-tight.

423
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,120
I meant what l...

424
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,020
what are you
doing here?

425
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,754
I came to talk to you.

426
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:53,587
I'm anthony majors.

427
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,254
I'm teo's father.

428
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,854
Nice to meet you.

429
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,854
We met several years
ago, mr. Mangione.

430
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,454
I came to talk to him,
not you.

431
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:05,254
Whatever
you want to say to me,
you can say to mr. Majors.

432
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,354
Son, i know we don't
see eye to eye,

433
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,754
but you're smarter
than this!

434
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,220
This man's
not your friend.

435
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,521
I can take care
of myself, pop.

436
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:17,287
Mr. De la costa, i
assure you, i just want
what's best for him.

437
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:19,621
You want
what's best for you.

438
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:22,287
Well, that's teo's
decision, isn't it?

439
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:24,454
Mr. Majors thinks
i'm ready to go pro.

440
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:25,721
So do i.

441
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:29,621
Son, you were heading
towards the olympics.

442
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,287
You were this close.

443
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,053
We both know what happened
with that, don't we, pop?

444
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,621
Your mother
wanted that for you!

445
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,387
Who are you to talk to me
about my mother?

446
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:39,220
You know what she wanted.

447
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:41,888
Anyway, she's gone.

448
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:43,387
All that matters now
is what i want.

449
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,421
Don't you see
that what she wanted

450
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,587
is more important now
than ever because
she's gone?

451
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:50,387
I don't have to listen
to you,

452
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,387
not anymore.

453
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,587
You don't think i feel
what you feel?!

454
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:56,154
Look at me, boy!

455
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,154
She was your mother,
but she was my wife!

456
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,587
And i wasn't with her,
either.

457
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:04,554
Please, don't do this
to each other.

458
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:10,354
It's too late, <i>papi.</i>

459
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,788
It's too late.

460
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:23,287
Please, don't go!

461
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:25,387
????

462
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:36,694
So far, we've raised
5 grand for the firehouse,

463
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,794
and with this fight...

464
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,360
i thought you were
hoping for 1,000.

465
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:43,028
Ah, people in the town
are just really
turning out for teo.

466
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:44,627
It's great to see.
Hmm.

467
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,093
They all want to say
they knew him when.

468
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,093
Did you get his father
to talk to him?

469
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,594
Apparently, it only
made things worse.

470
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:56,093
He's really hurting.

471
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,827
What is so hard about
people just talking
to each other?

472
00:22:57,894 --> 00:23:01,193
Talk, listen,
talk, listen.

473
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,961
Was it ever that
simple for you
and your parents?

474
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:08,227
Ok. We had the talking
part down pretty good.

475
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:10,494
I don't know. There's
something else, though.

476
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,160
Something
they're keeping from me.

477
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:13,227
What do you think it is?

478
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,260
I don't know.
Family stuff.

479
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,260
Hard to unravel.

480
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:19,594
I'm not really sure
it should be unraveled,

481
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,327
at least not by me.

482
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:22,994
Anything i can do?

483
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,327
Funny you should ask.

484
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:10,227
I fight for you, <i>mami.</i>

485
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,894
Everything i do is for you.

486
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:17,360
Every time i win,
i feel closer to you.

487
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:19,527
I wish you were here.

488
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:36,494
Who would you say
your greatest influence is?

489
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,160
Definitely
oscar de la hoya.

490
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,028
I remember watching him
win the gold in barcelona.

491
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:42,894
Against marco rudolph...
the only u.s. Gold medal.

492
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,827
Wasn't your dad
training you
for the olympics?

493
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,861
Why does everyone want
to talk about my father?

494
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,093
He's dead to me.

495
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,494
Oh, i know
what you mean.

496
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:51,861
My dad's
dead to me, too.

497
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:52,894
What? You mean...

498
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:55,227
yeah. Dead dead.

499
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,627
Listen, i'm sorry.

500
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:58,694
I didn't mean to bring...
don't worry about it.

501
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,227
It's all the same.

502
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:02,561
We weren't really
speaking at the end.

503
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,694
Why not?

504
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,627
I don't know.
He didn't like who i was

505
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:07,227
or who i became,
i guess.

506
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:08,260
Come on.
You're kidding,
right?

507
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:10,527
No. He wanted
my brother and me

508
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,028
to go into
his brokerage business,

509
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,028
one of these huge
wall street companies.

510
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:17,160
A lot of people
with very nice shoes.

511
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:18,794
Then my brother died

512
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:19,861
and the pressure
was really on me

513
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:20,961
to step up and,
you know,

514
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,794
take my place
in the family dynasty.

515
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:24,227
What do i do?

516
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:28,227
I become a paramedic,
a civil servant.

517
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,761
I was never happier,
but him, he was never
more miserable.

518
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:34,761
So what happened?

519
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:35,894
You know,
he cut me off,

520
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,227
i cut him off.

521
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,394
It's what men do,
right?

522
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,861
You don't need me.
Watch me not need you.

523
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:43,294
The thing is,
you know, somehow

524
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,861
you always think
it'll get sorted out,

525
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,861
and you always
think there's time.

526
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:49,928
Anyhow, that's just me.

527
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:51,561
I'm sure you guys
have plenty of time.

528
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,360
You know, i bet
it's been a while

529
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,961
since you've had
a home-cooked meal.

530
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,561
Why don't you
come over tonight,

531
00:25:56,627 --> 00:25:57,961
have dinner
with me and my wife?

532
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:01,928
Listen, you know,
i gotta wake up early,

533
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:02,994
and i gotta
watch what i eat.

534
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,193
Great. See you
tonight around 7:00?

535
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,661
Ooh, that's great.

536
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,327
I'll swing by
the grocery store
on my way home.

537
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:17,127
Hey, i am very capable
of making a wonderful
dinner under pressure.

538
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,827
I'll see you
in an hour. Bye.

539
00:26:20,494 --> 00:26:21,427
You're leaving?

540
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,127
It's closing time.

541
00:26:23,193 --> 00:26:24,627
And?

542
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:28,227
And i'm going home.
That's what closing
time means.

543
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,761
That's funny,
'cause tonight,

544
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:30,994
i thought it meant
self-defense class

545
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,994
and dinner after.
You forgot.

546
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,761
Completely forgot.

547
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:38,761
It's just that i got
jim to invite teo
for dinner, and...

548
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,794
i'm sorry.

549
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:43,394
It's, um... it's fine.
It's totally fine.

550
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,694
I'll find out if we can
take a makeup class.

551
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:48,127
I feel terrible
about this.
Don't.

552
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:49,827
You take your responsibilities
very seriously,

553
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:51,994
and i really
admire that.

554
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,761
Are you mad?

555
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,527
Melinda, stop.

556
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,928
All right?

557
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,761
Wait a minute.
You're planning
on cooking?

558
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,994
Wish me luck.

559
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,994
I should wish teo luck.

560
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,494
Gee, thanks.

561
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,561
Have fun.

562
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:08,594
1, 2...

563
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:12,561
honey, you need
way more red pepper
than that.

564
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:15,127
Don't worry.
It's not gonna hurt you.

565
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,894
Why are you
so distracted?

566
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,360
Let's just say
i won't be getting

567
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:21,861
my own cooking show
on the food network
anytime soon.

568
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,227
I'm telling you,

569
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:26,894
<i>churrasco estilo cubano</i>
is teo's favorite dish.

570
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,661
Now, if it is not spicy,
he's not gonna like it.

571
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,594
Didn't your mother
teach you how to cook?

572
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:34,761
I am already
stressed out.

573
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:35,794
Please do not
bring up my mother.

574
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:43,494
Oh, wow! That is
really good! Ha!

575
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,160
I can't believe
i made it myself.

576
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,594
Right. Being dead
means i get no credit?

577
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,294
I would have never
thought to use
this much seasoning,

578
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,193
but whoo! Ha ha!

579
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,260
A lesson you should apply
for the other parts
of your life.

580
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,861
Yeah.

581
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,694
Yeah.

582
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:04,427
Teo. Hey,
how you doing?

583
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:05,861
Nice house.
Thanks.

584
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,193
Just don't take
too close a look

585
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,193
at the plumbing,
the wiring, or the roof.

586
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:11,827
Hi.

587
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:12,894
Hi, melinda.

588
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,093
Nice to
see you again, teo.

589
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,294
Thank you.

590
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,227
Look, i'm sorry
about what happened

591
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,294
at the gym
the other day.

592
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,394
Forget it.

593
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,894
I tend to have
that effect on people.

594
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:21,894
Wine?

595
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:22,894
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

596
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,594
Told you. Water?

597
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,294
Yes, please.

598
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:29,561
Hello, son.

599
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:51,380
Dinner is served.

600
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:52,380
Smells great.

601
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:53,614
Here we go, guys.

602
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:55,781
We eat like this
every day.
What is that?

603
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:58,214
<i>Churrasco estilo cubano.</i>

604
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,414
It's my favorite.
How'd you know?

605
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:03,214
Oh! Put that spoon down!

606
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,547
Put your spoon down.

607
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,080
Estella:
Where are your manners?

608
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,314
We don't eat
until we say grace.

609
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,547
I would like to say grace
first, if that's ok.

610
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,881
I'm sorry.

611
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,414
God bless this house
and this family.

612
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:23,814
God bless this house
and this family.

613
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,414
Make us grateful...

614
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,914
make us grateful...

615
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,380
for your mercy...
for your mercy...

616
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:30,547
and mindful for
the needs of others.

617
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:31,781
And mindful
of needs of others.

618
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:33,848
Amen.
Amen.

619
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:45,414
Mmm! This tastes
just like my wife's.

620
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,848
It's almost
as if she's here.

621
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:49,980
Is she?

622
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,080
What's going on?
Teo.

623
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,414
You rigged
this whole thing,
didn't you?

624
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,647
No, i didn't.

625
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:57,948
You gave her
<i>mami's</i> recipe.

626
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,314
You told her how
she always said grace,

627
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,113
the exact words
she said.

628
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,747
Teo, i promise you,
i didn't say a thing.

629
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:05,481
No, it's true.
He didn't say anything to me.

630
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,814
Look, the truth is...

631
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,414
the truth is,
your mom is here,

632
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,881
and that's why
i invited you to dinner...

633
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,848
because i can see her.
I can talk to her.

634
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:22,147
You're lying.
Teo.

635
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:24,614
My mother is dead.

636
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:25,980
He put you up
to this

637
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,647
'cause he's trying
to get me to do
what he wants.

638
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,481
I don't care
what you want!
No, that's not...

639
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:31,047
i do what's best
for me.

640
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,481
Teo.

641
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:38,180
I know you have
my photo in your bible.

642
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:40,047
You have a picture
of her in your bible.

643
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:41,980
What is this?

644
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,347
What are you doing?

645
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:46,380
All i want is peace
between you and
your father.

646
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:48,881
She just wants you
and your father
to be at peace.

647
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,447
It's true.
Your mother's here.
I can feel her.

648
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:54,047
You got to
sense her, too.

649
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,380
I always feel her.

650
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,247
You can't hate me forever.

651
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,347
She doesn't want that.

652
00:30:58,414 --> 00:30:59,948
I don't hate you, <i>papi.</i>

653
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:02,581
But i can't forgive you
for taking me away
from her.

654
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:04,547
You let her die alone.

655
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,314
Teo, stop. Please!

656
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,447
Leave me alone!

657
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:14,914
How did you know
those things?

658
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,514
How did you
know that i had
that photo?

659
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:19,280
Think about it.
How could i have known
unless she told me?

660
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:26,380
My mother... is she
really here with me?

661
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:29,848
Yes. She's right here.

662
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:35,347
I can't believe that.
I can't. How can...

663
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,180
you have you gifts,
and i have mine.

664
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:43,080
I am so proud of you.
I'm proud of everything
you've done.

665
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,414
She's so proud of you, teo.

666
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:47,948
Although i never
liked you to be
a boxer.

667
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:50,681
Did you know that
she never wanted you
to be a boxer?

668
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:51,848
What?

669
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:52,848
What mother would
want to see her baby

670
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:55,914
get beaten up?
Ha ha ha ha!

671
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,581
She would have
wrapped me in band-aids
if i would have let her,

672
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,314
from head to toe.

673
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,481
No.

674
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,914
I couldn't
protect her.

675
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,948
I wasn't there
when she died.

676
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,747
I'll never forgive
him for that.

677
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:16,881
No one's perfect.

678
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:21,080
Everyone makes mistakes,
even your parents.

679
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,948
She's saying that
no one is infallible.

680
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,814
Please, <i>mami.</i>
Stop making
excuses for him.

681
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:28,581
He took me away.

682
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:29,581
He made me go
to that tournament.

683
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,047
I didn't want to go,
but...

684
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:32,481
he insisted.

685
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,647
I didn't want
to leave you.

686
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,280
Now i'm never gonna
go to the olympics

687
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:45,881
because i don't
deserve to go.

688
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,514
I wasn't with you.

689
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,814
This is my punishment.
No.

690
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:52,013
She wants you to let go
of your anger.

691
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,681
Everything
that happened
is in the past.

692
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,614
Melinda: You can't
live in the past.

693
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,314
You have to
forgive yourself.

694
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,481
I can't.

695
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,647
I can't.

696
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm sorry.

697
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:17,581
Why did you take him away
to the tournament?

698
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,914
Estella wants to know
why you took teo away.

699
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,314
She's saying
she doesn't remember?

700
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,948
Yes.

701
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:27,013
<i>Mi amor,</i>

702
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,714
it's because
you told me to.

703
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,761
jim: Good evening,
grandview!

704
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:42,227
And welcome to the fight
of the century!

705
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:46,060
Thank you. Because of you,
we have raised over $7,000,

706
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:47,360
so give yourself a big hand.

707
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,861
Let's go, baby.
Tonight's
the night.

708
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,027
Be the man
out there, ok?

709
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:56,427
All right.

710
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:00,993
Where's your head,
champ?

711
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,194
I'm here.

712
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,527
Good.

713
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:04,960
Listen, after you
knock this guy out,

714
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:06,561
i got some papers
for you to sign

715
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,661
and a first-class
plane ticket
to miami.

716
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:12,661
Oh, what is this?
Grand central station?

717
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,661
I came here
to talk to my son.

718
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:16,160
It won't take long.

719
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:17,561
It's important.

720
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:20,360
If you need me,
i'll be right outside.

721
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,394
Your mother and i
need you to know

722
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,993
why we made that
decision for you to
go to the tournament.

723
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,194
She's here?

724
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,794
Estella:
Teo, i told you

725
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,993
that everybody
makes a mistake.

726
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,394
I was talking
about me.

727
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,928
One of the last times
she was able to
talk to me,

728
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:37,928
before her mind went,

729
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,561
before she started
to fade away...

730
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,694
my will is in
the safety deposit box,

731
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:48,694
along with the birth
certificates and
our marriage license.

732
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:51,894
You're not
gonna die, ok?

733
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,527
So stop talking
like that.

734
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:56,360
You must do as i say.

735
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:03,027
This is going to happen.

736
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,160
I know it's hard,

737
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:09,794
but soon enough, i...

738
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:13,661
i won't even know
we had this talk,

739
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,993
and you have to
remember this for me.

740
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,861
I'm listening.

741
00:35:17,928 --> 00:35:21,527
Teo's career
must come first.

742
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:22,627
Do you understand?

743
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:24,260
Yes.

744
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:25,894
Yes.
Do you?

745
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,027
Look at me.

746
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,661
I don't want teo
to miss his moment

747
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:37,694
because he's at my bedside
watching me die.

748
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,861
We only have one chance
to live this life.

749
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,761
Don't!

750
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:46,427
I had my chance.

751
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:48,527
He must have his.

752
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,894
Now, promise me.

753
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Tell him someday
to forgive me.

754
00:35:56,027 --> 00:36:01,861
Hey, he's gonna
have to forgive me,
not you. Never you.

755
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,661
I was just trying
to protect you.

756
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:09,561
She didn't realize she
was taking away your
chance to say good-bye.

757
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,227
It was
my mistake, teo.

758
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,227
My mistake,
not your father's.

759
00:36:13,294 --> 00:36:15,427
She needs you
to forgive her.

760
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:19,360
Of course i forgive her.

761
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,127
And she needs to know
that you forgive
your father.

762
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:26,461
He was only
doing what she
asked him to.

763
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,527
All this time, <i>papi...</i>

764
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:32,727
you let me think
it was you?

765
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,993
I thought you were
putting the olympics
ahead of her.

766
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,527
Why didn't you say
something?

767
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,794
You know it was
easier for you to be
mad at me than at her.

768
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:42,027
I didn't think you
would understand, son,

769
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:45,761
and i'm sorry,
'cause your mother
and i made a mistake.

770
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,661
Estella: You need
to be a family again,

771
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,027
stay together.

772
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,327
She needs you
to stay together,

773
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,294
be a family.

774
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,594
Teo.

775
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:00,894
She's giving you
the chance to say
good-bye.

776
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:38,794
I'm ready.

777
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,993
She wants you to win
tonight. She also said

778
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,727
not to hurt the guy
too badly.

779
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,394
No single punches.

780
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:47,561
Combinations.

781
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:49,661
And i want you to be
first, always first.

782
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,727
Be aggressive.

783
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:54,993
Crowd: Teo! Teo!

784
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,894
Teo! Teo!

785
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,694
Teo! Teo!

786
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,327
Teo! Teo!

787
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,527
Teo! Teo!

788
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:03,360
Teo! Teo!

789
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:04,461
Teo! Teo!

790
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,060
You're gonna go
all the way, teo.

791
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:07,794
Tonight's just
the beginning.

792
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,360
You're right, mr. Majors.
I am...

793
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:12,027
but not with you.
Thanks for everything.

794
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,294
Teo! Teo!

795
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,727
Teo! Teo!

796
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,461
Teo! Teo!

797
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,394
I have one more
good-bye to say.

798
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:28,060
Gilberto, estella knows
that she took your chance
to say good-bye away,

799
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:29,928
and she
wants to fix it now.

800
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:31,594
So...

801
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:37,327
You make my life
so beautiful.

802
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,160
[Speaking quietly]

803
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:41,794
I hope you find
love again.

804
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,993
[Speaking quietly]

805
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,960
I will never forget you,
estella.

806
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:50,993
I will raise our son,
and everything i do,

807
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,160
i'll do like if you're
watching me, so...

808
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:02,360
Hey!
Ha ha ha!

809
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:09,960
Jim: Ladies and gentlemen...
and firemen...

810
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,661
you know who you are...

811
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,527
uh, without further ado,
i'd like to introduce
tonight's fighters.

812
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,260
In the blue corner,
in green trunks,

813
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:22,894
weighing 140 pounds,
centerville's best...
jackie o'callahan.

814
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:33,727
And in the red corner,
in the red trunks...

815
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:42,894
teofilo de la costa!

816
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:58,993
I won't quit
my day job.

817
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:03,727
Teo! Teo! Teo!

818
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,794
He's down!
