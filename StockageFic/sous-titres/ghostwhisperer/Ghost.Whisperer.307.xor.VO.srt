1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,800
spirts all around us.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,100
They can fuse their psychic energy
into objects in our everyday lives.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,900
You take something like this.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,100
This is a powerful totem.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Through it, i can feel the future,
sometimes the past, but always the truth.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Now,whose earring am i holding?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Uh,that's mine.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,800
And you are?

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,900
- Delia.
- Delia.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,500
- You're a skeptic.
- Guilty.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,400
Ahh, i love skeptics.
You're always the most fun to convince.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,100
Delia.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,900
Let's see what the spirits
can tell me through this earring.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
- It is a gift.
- That's right.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,900
You treasure it,
but your husband didn't give it to you.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Right again.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm getting an "N" Name.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,000
N-n-na.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Ned. Is that right?

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Your son gave it to you?

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,500
That's absolutely right.
I'm... Very impressed.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,700
A round of applause for skeptic delia.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
I don't know what's funnier,
that you're here or that i'm here.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
- Can i get another volunteer?
- Uh,yeah, right here.Right here.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,700
I hate you.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,700
You come to this bookstore as much as i do.
Now give him love.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,500
Wonderful.
And who do i have the pleasure of meeting?

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
- Melinda.
- Melinda.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,000
And you're happily married,aren't you?

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Oh. Did your little spirit friends tell you that?

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,300
No,your wedding ring did.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
May i?

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm getting an "M" Name.

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Mary ann.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Who's mary ann?

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,600
- It's my grandmother's name.
- You were very close, right?

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
Well,yeah.
I mean,all little girls love their grandmas, right?

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,900
No. No,this affection caused a rift.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,300
A problem. Uh,your mother's war
with her got turned against you.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,200
And your relationship with your father.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,300
He's no longer with us,is he?

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey,how about it,huh?
Just keep breathing,ok?

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
You,sir.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
A very strong message about you.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
- You ok?
- yeah,i'm good.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm good,i just feel like
i've had a glass of wine or 15.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
- Something's here.
- Like something something.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
No,put it into words.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,900
Put it into words that i can understand.

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,800
It's ok. It's all right.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,000
Guess the spirits want you to buy my book.

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
Is it him? Is it something he's doing?

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,100
It's the ghost attached to him that he can't see.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,200
It's not a shock this guy's haunting

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,600
The ghost is not a fan.

ok,check this out.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,500
According to this baby name website, 48% of
women born in your grandma's time had "M" Names.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,200
Mary ann,mildred, maynard.

62
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,800
- Maynard?
- Yeah,that's how guys like casey work.

63
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
It's called a cold reading.

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,100
- You've heard about things like this?
- Oh,sure.

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll start off with something like...
Ok,i'm getting an "M" Name.

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,600
'cause somebody in my family
has got to have one,right?

67
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,500
Like an aunt,cousin, or whatever.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,700
Anyway,then you take my age. You can pretty
much assume that my grandmother's passed.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
I throw out mary ann and presto.

70
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,000
Ok,but how did he know that my son's name was ned?

71
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,500
I mean,that goes beyond an educated guess.

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Unless you told him without realizing it.

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,900
No. No way. I was very careful.
I didn't give him anything.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,900
Yeah,except for the fact that sometimes
those guys put microphones in the audience.

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Yeah. They'll record conversations beforehand,

76
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,700
And then give it back to you
as if it's a part of the show.

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you see why i am skeptical
of people who have "Gifts"?

78
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,800
Whoa. Hey.
No,not all sensitives are like that,ok?

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,700
Just the ones who want to make a profit and don't
know that there's a ghost standing behind them.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,900
- Are you gonna confront him about it?
- Nope.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,500
That's a can of worms that i'm gonna keep closed.

82
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Well,maybe you are, but i'm not.

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Just stay in touch with your inner spirit.

84
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Thank you.

85
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,600
- can i have your
- How you doing?

86
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
yeah Thank you.

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
- thank you
- Hi. Oh,delia.

88
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,800
Casey. Hey,good memory.

89
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,800
Not really.
Spirit guides told me i'd see you again.

90
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
I bet they did.

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,900
- Hey,can i ask you a question?
- Sure.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Um,did you use a microphone
to pick up my son's name?

93
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I most certainly did not.

94
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,500
Does it ever hurt your conscience,
doing what you do?

95
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,700
- Excuse me.
- thanks

96
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Because people believe you,you know.
They trust you.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,500
And you just string them
along with your parlor act.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
What i do is no act.

99
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,200
I've consulted with celebrities,politicians,
and no one has ever asked for their money back.

100
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,800
Just because you convince a lot of people
doesn't mean it's true.

101
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,400
Ok,if i am such a fraud,why have i been asked to
consult on the sydney drake disappearance?

102
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
The police called you in on that?

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,100
The family did.

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm gonna find this girl.

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,000
And when i do,
maybe i'll make a believer out of you.

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Look at this family.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,200
It's just been the mom and the 2 girls
ever since the dad died a couple of years ago.

108
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
- Is that sydney on the right?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,800
The drake family made a small fortune
with real estate holdings in town.

110
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,100
You know,jim was telling me something about this.

111
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
And he said the police were totally frustrated

112
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,800
'cause the night that she went missing everything
was in perfect condition.

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,500
The bed was made,
cell phone and keys were on the table.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
And the kidnappers didn't even make any demands.

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,700
No note,no clues,nothing for the police to go on.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,300
Can you imagine how that must feel?

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,300
Your child just vanishes and
you have no idea what happened?

118
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Sad thing is it's been 2 weeks.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
In most cases,
if they haven't been found in a couple of days--

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah,i know.

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,600
There isn't any way that you could go
and talk to mrs. Drake is there?

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Why would i want to do that?

123
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,400
Just because casey is gonna go there
and spin whatever story he wants.

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,400
But if you get there first,you might,

125
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,800
i don't know, see something.

126
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,908
Wait a minute,

127
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:21,531
- i thought you didn't buy what i do.
- I don't.

128
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:24,800
But i buy what casey does even less.

129
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,700
If it were me,mel,

130
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,300
if this was my kid,the last thing i would want
is somebody lying to me about it.

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,100
So,how can i help you, melinda?

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,700
I know that this is none of my business.
I just don't want to see your family get hurt.

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Ahh,too late.

134
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,900
I know that you're consulting with casey edgars.

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,300
- You know casey's work?
- I know his type.

136
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,200
Oh. Well,you're not the first
person to warn me about him,

137
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,500
but he confirmed what i know in my heart--

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Sydney is out there.

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
He'll tell me where she is.

140
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Look,um...

141
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,500
I have some insight into the supernatural as well.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,500
And the casey edgars of the world are just
trying to take advantage of people's pain.

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,900
It's really not as easy as just closing your eyes
and seeing where somebody is.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,900
Do you communicate with spirits?

145
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,900
Do you know anything about sydney?

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,700
No. No,i don't know anything,but...

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,700
I wouldn't make you promises until i had proof.

148
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh,excuse me.

149
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Who's there?

150
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,300
Hey.

151
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,800
Hey,what do you want?
Why won't you just talk to me?

152
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,900
Please.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you doing in here?

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
What happened?

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Uh,i--i'm sorry.I heard this strange noise.
That's why i came in here.

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
I was talking to your mom.

157
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,900
Yeah,i heard you two.

158
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,900
I know exactly what you are.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,100
You're another one of those phony psychics
poking through our house.

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
No,please,that's not what this is.

161
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
It's just the feeding frenzy
doesn't stop around here.

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
Nikki.

163
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,500
You know,i think i've come at a bad time.

164
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,500
But if you want to talk some more,
I'd--i really would love to help.

165
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Well,there is someone here
who would like to speak to you.

166
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,900
Excuse me?

167
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,200
Casey,this is the woman i
was just telling you about,

168
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
Melinda gordon.

169
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
We've met.

170
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
So what did you do?

171
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
Well,i got out of there as fast as i could.

172
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
The last thing i wanted
was a showdown with the guy.

173
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
And you didn't see sydney's ghost?

174
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,000
No. I saw the ghost
that's been haunting casey instead.

175
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,886
Wait,does that mean the
ghost is attached to you now

176
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,074
since he knows you can see him and casey can't?

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
i don't know.

178
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,800
It's too hard to figure out
when he's making me this woozy.

179
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,500
You shou have seen the look in her eyes.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,700
I mean,she was calm on the outside,
but her heart was breaking.

181
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,300
You know,and who am i to take away her hope?

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,100
Please tell me tha
what i do is not as bad as casey.

183
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,500
What you do has nothing to do with casey.

184
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,700
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Stop it.

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,900
Please,you know that i can't hear you.

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
- are you worried?
- Am i worried about finding sydney drake?

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Of course.

189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,900
Listening to the spirits is not an exact science.
You have to be attuned to everything.

190
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,200
You never know
what the spirits might send your way.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,300
- here you go
-  alright Keep the change.

192
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
You have a ghost attached to you.

193
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
Tell me something i don't already know.

194
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,000
No,i'm not talking about your inner spirit.
I'm talking about a real ghost.

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,600
He's wearing a red plaid shirt,
Loose jeans, and hiking boots.

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
So,sounds like a ghost.

197
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,700
You've actually seen it?

198
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes. And he's angry with you.
And he had a message.

199
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
He wanted me to make you tell the truth.

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Oh,really? About what?

201
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sure there could be any number of things,

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,200
but i'm gonna start with the fact that you
don't know anything about where sydney drake is.

203
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh,i get it.

204
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm cutting in on your turf.
Are you the town psychic or something?

205
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,500
Uh,this has nothing to do with turf.

206
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
It has to do with 2 words--Paranormal envy.

207
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,200
I am here because a ghost has a message for you.
You can do with that whatever you want.

208
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,600
ok.

209
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Maybe you have a gift.
Or maybe you just think you do.

210
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,700
But the real struggle is hiding it.

211
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,800
You've had this gift since you were a little girl
and that's the worst time to be different.

212
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Are you a psychic or a therapist?

213
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,200
You couldn't get rid of this gift.

214
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,800
So you open up a nice little business.

215
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,400
It keeps you in contact with people
who recently lost loved ones, Like,um...

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,900
Selling antiques.

217
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
Oh,you really are touching.

218
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,900
I told the truth. Mission accomplished.

219
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh,and one more thing.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,100
Sydney drake is alive.

221
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
If you're mad because i beat you to the punch,
I make no apologies.

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,600
This is the big leagues.
A girl is missing.

223
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,000
Step aside, let the professionals handle it.

224
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Hey. Wait.

225
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Nikki.

226
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,600
I didn't mean to spy on you.

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,200
There's just been so much media attention
since sydney disappeared.

228
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,400
I definitely don't want to get recognized
checking out a so-called psychic.

229
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,400
So,when were you listening to us
and how much did you hear?

230
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,200
Enough.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,400
What you were saying to casey and my mom,
that you can see the dead.

232
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Is it true?

233
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,500
Yeah,it's true.

234
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Have you seen my sister?

235
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,000
No,i haven't.

236
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,800
But that doesn't mean anything.

237
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
It's just that...

238
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,800
I think my sister is dead.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
I don't think my mother can face that.

240
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
She wishes it was me.

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,600
- That's not true.
- It is.

242
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,500
My mom pushed us both,
but sydney was the one who always succeeded.

243
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,200
She had all the brains.

244
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
She sailed into medical school.

245
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,900
- Were you two close?
- Not as close as sydney and my mother.

246
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,700
When dad died, it just got worse.

247
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,800
It was all about sydney.

248
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,100
She was mommy's little princess.

249
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,300
Sydney used to call me the toad.

250
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm sure that she knew how much you loved her.

251
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
I need your help.

252
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Ok,explain to me again how this isn't a seance.

253
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Because the one we're
looking for is alive,i guess.

254
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Casey calls it a visitation.

255
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,200
This guy is so pretentious
it makes me want to throw up.

256
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Oh,what i wouldn't give to see this.
The real deal vs. The real real deal.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
Honey?

258
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Mel? Honey?

259
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,000
Uh...i'm gonna-- i'm gonna call you back.

260
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,400
I am just a portal.

261
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,800
I can feel the love and belief of everyone
in this room and so can my guides.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,100
They are here with us.

263
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,100
Now.

264
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,300
Every single person has
a different spirit watching over them,

265
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,200
Protecting them.

266
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,500
Now,show us what we seek.

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Please shine a lot on sydney drake,
beloved daughter, sister,friend.

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,800
Please show us where she is.

269
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
I see her.

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,000
Where? Where is she?

271
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,400
She's alive. She's close.

272
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
There's a man next to her.

273
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,800
A man wearing a red sweatshirt.

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,200
Yes,i can see it clearly now.

275
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,600
His shirt is red,and he's wearing hiking boots.

276
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,200
Are you kidding me?

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,100
i'm right here.

278
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm standing right behind you.

279
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm not alive, you liar. I'm dead.

280
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,400
Sydney?

281
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,600
you have to tell them the truth.

282
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,400
you have to tell them that i'm dead.

283
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes,i'm fine. I'm so sorry.

284
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Melinda,did you say my daughter's name?

285
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,600
Look,i know how this is gonna sound.

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Yes.

287
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,500
Sydney's spirit was here with us.

288
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,800
And she wanted me to
tell you that she's not alive.

289
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm so sorry.

290
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,500
Do not listen to her.
Your daughter is alive.

291
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,800
This woman is trying to sabotage my work.

292
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,600
She came to me earlier claiming i was a fraud,
and now she says she's a seer?

293
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,100
What are you talking about?

294
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,600
I was invited to come here.

295
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
Why are you using your doubt to block me?

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Why have you insinuated yourself in this family,
taking away their only hope?

297
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,300
What kind of scam are you running?

298
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,500
I am not running any scam.
And you're the only one that's getting paid.

299
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
We're not paying him.

300
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,900
We offered him money several times,
but he said no.

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,700
I know what i saw.

302
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,700
Lower.

303
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,900
Lower.

304
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
Ooh,not that low.

305
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,100
Casey went for blood,huh?

306
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,600
The only thing that guy values more
than his paycheck is some good p.r.

307
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,400
I can't believe he accused me of scamming them.

308
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
I mean,why didn't i see that coming?

309
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,500
Hey,it wasn't a total loss.

310
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
At least you found out the truth about sydney.

311
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,100
- Poor girl. She's dead,huh?
- Right.

312
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,100
And we know that the ghost wasn't attached to
casey, that it was attached to the drake family.

313
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah,but then why was she at the book signing?

314
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,600
Because nikki was there trying to check out casey.

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Why would the fair
sydney drake be wearing men's clothes?

316
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
i mean, Any ideas about that?

317
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,300
None,but if that's how she's appearing to me,
then that is the clothes she died in.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,900
This sense of you feeling dizzy,
Are you still feeling that?

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Yeah,which makes me think that she was drugged,

320
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,100
Which is why i go through reefer madness
every time she appears,

321
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,300
And why she's remember things in bits and pieces.

322
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,700
Is there any way i can talk
to one of your cop friends?

323
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
On a cold case file, sure.

324
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,100
But on an on-going investigation,
it's just not gonna happen.

325
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,900
Sorry.

326
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
- There is one person you could talk to.
- Who?

327
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Casey.

328
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,300
Now you're on drugs.

329
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,700
Ok,go with me for a second,all right?

330
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Look,obviously this guy's not a sensitive.

331
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,300
But from the way you describe him,
He's a profiler.

332
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Well,maybe he's a good one.

333
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,800
He's close to the drake family.
They probably let him talk to the cops.

334
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,200
He might have clues he doesn't even know he has.

335
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,600
- I hate this idea.
- Yeah,i know.

336
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
But if you can get casey on your side, You might
have a better chance of crossing this ghost over,

337
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
And that's really what it's all about,huh?

338
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,700
I hate this idea.

339
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,200
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

340
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,900
- I hate this idea.
- Me,too, believe me.

341
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
So why would i work with you on this?

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
Because at the end of the day, it's not about us.
It's about sydney.

343
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,100
We both want to help this family.

344
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,700
You're good at picking up on clues about people
and their behavior,

345
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
and you might see something i miss.

346
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm a solo act. I don't need your help.

347
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes,you do.
You've got nothi on sydney and you know it.

348
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
I've seen her. I know she was drugged.

349
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,600
I know that she died with
handcuffs around her wrists.

350
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,000
You think she's dead. I think she's still alive.

351
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,400
We're not exactly a mind meld.

352
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
All the more reason to find out the truth.

353
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,400
oh,please tell me you are not actually trying to
figure out the definition of "Truth."

354
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm consulting with the spirit guides.

355
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,200
All right,tell your spirit guides this:

356
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,000
If we find sydney,
i'll step away and you can take all the credit.

357
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
If we don't,then i'll never bother you again.

358
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
The spirit guides have spoken.

359
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,800
So,your thing is crossing over,right?
Into the light?

360
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah,that's my thing.

361
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,300
What's in the light?

362
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,100
I've never really crossed over, so i don't know.

363
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Your knowledge of the
paranormal is really limited.

364
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,400
You should tell people
that ghosts reside on 9 planes of existence.

365
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,300
It sounds smarter. Just a suggestion.

366
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
Can we focus on the ghost,please?

367
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,100
Right. Uh,let's see what we have--

368
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,900
Handcuffs,drugs, outdoor clothing.
What else we got?

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Frogs.

370
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Excuse me?

371
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,000
I heard them the other night out of nowhere--
Hundreds,maybe even thousands.

372
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
What does that mean?

373
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
I was hoping it meant something to you.

374
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,300
It's a signal that sydney wants me to have.
I just can't figure it out.

375
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,800
All right,well, let's forget for a moment
what frogs might mean to sydney.

376
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,300
- What do they mean to you?
- How is that relevant?

377
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,700
Most paranormal experiences begin
as an inward exercise.

378
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,000
The answer might not be
some vague mystery out there.

379
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,900
It might be some specific thing
that you already know.

380
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,200
Like what?

381
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,600
Maybe the spirit is trying to communicate with us
through your memories,give us a clue.

382
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
- Just close your eyes.
- No.

383
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,800
Free associate.
When you think of frogs, you think of...

384
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Gross.

385
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,300
All right, that's a start. What else?

386
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,900
Warts.

387
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
Kermit. Girl scouts.

388
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,700
You know, Jim and i went camping
for the first time last year,

389
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,400
And we had to move
because the sound of the frogs was so loud.

390
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,000
Where was that?

391
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,300
Red mountain forest.

392
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,100
You know,i don't mind sharing credit with you.

393
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,500
As long as you present yourself as my prot?
Of course.

394
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
- You don't like me,do you?
- Not much.

395
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,300
Why not? I'm so likeable.

396
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,700
I don't like what you do.

397
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Ah. You don't approve of me.
That's different. Less personal.

398
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,600
No,it's personal.

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,900
Heh. You're made
because i make a living at this and you don't?

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't want to.

401
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,800
Oh,i do, and that makes me bad?

402
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,000
Look,i just think it's wrong,ok?
To make up little messages from the other side.

403
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,743
Like,"My spirit guides are
telling me that your mom and dad

404
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:59,186
are really proud of you and will always love you."

405
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,100
What if mom and dad aren't proud?

406
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,000
What if what they  really wanted to say
was something meaningful but painful?

407
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,200
You just tell people whatever
it is that they want to hear,

408
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,500
And that's the part i don't approve of.

409
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Listen,i help people.
It's the best part of what i do.

410
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,646
And the afterlife i believe in doesn't have ghosts

411
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,302
running around spreading
terrible news to the living.

412
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:21,552
So,if my gift allows me to tell right away
what someone needs to hear,

413
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,300
what's the harm in saying it?

414
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,100
No one has ever been helped by being lied to.

415
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,300
Ok,this is it. This is where we went camping.

416
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
- Wait. Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

417
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,900
Ok,there's gotta be something over here.

418
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,000
What is that?

419
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
A body.

420
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,300
It's her.

421
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,800
- I can't go down there.
- Excuse me?

422
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,000
I have a problem with death,
specifically,dead bodies.

423
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
Casey,you said that you talk to the dead.

424
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,100
No,i talk to spirits.
Corpses are something totally different.

425
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Ok,fine. Well,
step aside and let the professionals handle it.

426
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,100
Is that really her?

427
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,300
Yeah,look at her wrists.

428
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,400
- She was held.
- Yeah.

429
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,900
And if she was wandering around drugged,
then she escaped...

430
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm guessing from somewhere close by.

431
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
You really saw her.

432
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Protect her.

433
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,400
Ealing with cops. They always complicate things.

434
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,700
You're the one who wanted to take all the credit.

435
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't deal with cases like these.

436
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,800
Do you think sydney crossed over?

437
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,300
No.
I think we only got a small piece of the puzzle.

438
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,700
And now we have to figure out who did this to her.

439
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
She said, "Protect her."

440
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,900
- Protect who?
- I don't know.

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,722
Maybe she was talking about herself. I mean,

442
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:29,250
there's something there. We're just missing it.

443
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Yeah,something ways bothered me about her...

444
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,600
The handcuffs.I mean,
there are a million easier ways to kidnap someone.

445
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
Such as?

446
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,500
Drugs,restraints-- simple coercion,even.

447
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,300
If you're using handcuffs, you're an amateur.

448
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,400
You didn't do  your homework.

449
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
You're winging it.

450
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,800
- You got all that from handcuffs?
- No,it's just a hunch.

451
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,000
I really thought she was alive.

452
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,100
I really thought i could feel it. I--

453
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Look,i think you did feel something--

454
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,700
Her presence. It was just her ghost.

455
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,900
Maybe i do have something.

456
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,400
You know what? Be careful what you wish for.

457
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,700
A lot of responsibility comes with this gift,
and it's not always just giving people hope.

458
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Sometimes you have to give them bad news.

459
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,900
You think i should tell the drakes.

460
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
It'll be easier coming from you.

461
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,300
Jim?

462
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Time for your bathroom break.

463
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,400
jim

464
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,400
- no!
- Hey,no,shh,hey, It was a dream.

465
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,000
Shh,quiet. It's all right.

466
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,400
It was a vision--

467
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,000
Something that happened to sydney.

468
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
She was in a place, like a cabin or something.

469
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,500
And they had her handcuffed to the bed,
and she hit a guy  with a mirror.

470
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,500
What guy?

471
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,300
It was the guy that was holding her,except...

472
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,600
He had your face.

473
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,600
- And you had to hit it with a mirror?
- No,i get it now.

474
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,300
Casey was right.
She's using my life to tell her story.

475
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,100
How do i fit in?

476
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,200
She's telling me
that she was taken by someone she loved.

477
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
Hello.

478
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
Hey,melinda.

479
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,800
Ok. All right,thanks.

480
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,900
You think someone in her family killed her?

481
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,600
Or has taken her, anyway.

482
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,000
In the vision,she used this guy's clothes
to go through the woods.

483
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,100
- You saw the cabin in the vision?
- No.

484
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
But i've seen some just like it on red mountain.

485
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,500
We know if the police found anything,
they'd be all over this area.

486
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,100
Yeah,but you and i haven't been to this area.

487
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,300
- Is this the cabin from your vision?
- It looks like it.

488
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
What are you doing?

489
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,900
Remember when you were talking about
psychic energy infusing with everyday objects?

490
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,100
Yeah.

491
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I think you might have been right.

492
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Brandon?

493
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
She can't take much more.

494
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300
Brandon!

495
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,000
we have to go.

496
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,500
We know that this is gonna
be hard for you to hear.

497
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,100
But we wanted you to be the first
to know brandon took sydney.

498
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
That's not all.

499
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,700
He had help.

500
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,200
Who?

501
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
You.

502
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,200
me?

503
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
You think i did this to my sister?

504
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,500
You were the forgotten child.

505
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
You were living in sydney's shadow.
Even after she was gone,

506
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,300
You still couldn't get your mother's attention.

507
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
You and your boyfriend,
you planned the whole thing.

508
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,700
You guys are so far off. You don't have a clue.

509
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
Brandon is sydney's ex-boyfriend,not mine.

510
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,800
Just tell us what happened.

511
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Sydney was not as perfect as everybody thought.

512
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,500
I don't have to explain anything to you.

513
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,100
The cops are gonna connect brandon's clothes.
It's only a matter of time.

514
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Wait a minute.

515
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,300
Think about sydney's message, "Protect her."

516
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Yeah?

517
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,900
Well,what if she meant from this?

518
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,200
What if she meant "Protect nikki"?

519
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Will you just let me talk to you? Please--

520
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,100
Please,look, i'm not here to judge you,ok?

521
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
But you're gonna have to tell
the truth sooner or later.

522
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
Not to you,i don't.

523
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,400
I know that your sister loves you.

524
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,600
And i know that she wants me to protect you.

525
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,900
- How do you know that?
- Because she told me.

526
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,500
Did you kill your sister?

527
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,600
Do you know what the worst thing is
about being  the star of a family?

528
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
The expectations.

529
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
So,what happened?

530
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
She started taking pills...

531
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,500
First,so she could stay awake.

532
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,000
Then,so she could get through finals.

533
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,900
Then,because she couldn't live without them.

534
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,200
By the time she got to med school,
it was,like, the perfect storm.

535
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,800
She was pushing herself harder than she ever had.

536
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,300
She had easier access  to prescriptions.

537
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,527
There were times when i wondered
what my mother would think of

538
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:23,586
her wonder girl turning into a drug addict.

539
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
I thought about telling her.

540
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,300
But then i just realized she would resent me
even more for bursting the bubble.

541
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
I tried to cfront sydney about it.

542
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,900
- I'll quit tomorrow. I swear.
- No,you won't!

543
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,700
You've said that before.

544
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
Please,please,i have my chem final tomorrow.
No,give me those--

545
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,000
Don't you do that. Oh,my god,nikki!

546
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,700
No...what did you do?!

547
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
nikki,no!

548
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,700
Nikki, what are you doing?!

549
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,900
God! Please! Nikki!

550
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,500
That was the last conversation we had.

551
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,900
- How does brandon fit in?
- He went out with sydney in college.

552
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,000
She taught him the secrets
of staying up 3 nights in a row to study.

553
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,700
But he got addicted,too, except that he got help.

554
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,700
Sydney didn't want to. That's why they broke up.

555
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
And that's why you called him for help.

556
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,100
I called him
because i knew how he had kicked his habit.

557
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,000
He had some friends take him to an abandoned cabin
so he could go cold turkey.

558
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,500
It's the hardest way to go,
but it was the only thing he could do.

559
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,700
So,it was was never a kidnapping.

560
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
It was an intervention.

561
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
We thought we could do it in private.

562
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,700
get me out of here,please!

563
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,700
We moved her to this cabin after she passed out.

564
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Let me go!

565
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,400
We took turns taking care of her--

566
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,400
Feeding her, getting her through it.

567
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Who did this? Who did this?!
Get me out of here!

568
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,300
I went out for an hour, just to get some air.

569
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Time for your bathroom break.

570
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,000
- But when i did...
- Brandon,no.

571
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,600
Brandon took her to the bathroom and she hit him.

572
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,000
She put his clothes on and left.

573
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,100
We searched for hours...days.

574
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
But we couldn't find her.

575
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Why didn't you call the police?

576
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,100
We just kept telling ourselves
that she would show up...

577
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,000
Back at school or home.

578
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
Then it just started to snowball.

579
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,000
We didn't want my mom knowing
what was wrong with sydney.

580
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,800
And i didn't want her knowing what i had done.

581
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,600
I knew mom would really hate me

582
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,200
if anything happened to sydney because of me.

583
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,500
And then she called the police.

584
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
And i was so scared.

585
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
I didn't know what to do.

586
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,500
So,i did nothing.

587
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,800
I don't believe you.

588
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,300
I would have known
if sydney had a problem like that.

589
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,100
She would have told me. I would have seen it.

590
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
No,you wouldn't have,mom.

591
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,100
You only saw flaws in me, not sydney.

592
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
- That's not true.
- It is.

593
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
It is true.

594
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,100
Susan...

595
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,800
Sydney is here with us, right now.

596
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,900
And she wants you to listen to nikki.

597
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,400
No. This is some trick.

598
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,800
The two of you couldn't stand each other,
and now you're working together?

599
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,400
I trusted you.

600
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,300
But you are a fraud and a liar, just like the rest.

601
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,900
If i wanted to lie to you,
I'd tell you what you want to hear.

602
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Get out of my house.

603
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,400
Now.

604
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Tell her it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

605
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,600
She says it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

606
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,700
That's something my dad used to say...

607
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,900
Whenever someone was
complaining something was too hard.

608
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,700
I know how difficult this must be for you.

609
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,500
But sydney does have a message for you.

610
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,800
She can't move on until you hear it.

611
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
I know nikki was trying to help me.

612
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,400
I couldn't find my way through those woods.
I just fell.

613
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
Please tell her to believe me.

614
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,700
She knows that you were just trying to help her

615
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,200
and everything that happened wasn't your fault.

616
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't deserve that.

617
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,100
I don't deserve forgiveness.

618
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
She lost so much because of me.

619
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,819
And that's why i had to stay here.

620
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,211
I had to make sure
mom wouldn't be too hard on her,

621
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,600
Wouldn't see her as a disappointment.

622
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,700
She doesn't want you to blame nikki.

623
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,300
Nikki did what she did because she loved me.

624
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Even though mom always put her second,
even though  she lived in my shadow,

625
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,300
She looked out for me.

626
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,300
Tell her nikki needs her now more than ever.

627
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,100
I want my mom to see her, to know her...

628
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Not who my mom wants her to be, but who she is.

629
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,300
It's her turn now.

630
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,400
I'll tell her.

631
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,400
You were always the princess.

632
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,200
I was the toad.

633
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,100
I think i can go now.

634
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,500
She's ready to cross over.

635
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Bye-bye,sweetheart.

636
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,600
Tell them i'm happy now.

637
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
They should be,too.

638
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,100
She's happy now. She's at peace.

639
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,800
There are some things she wanted us to tell you...

640
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,800
go from your heart.

641
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,300
<i>{a6}Sarah Mclachlan "world on fire"</i>

642
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,000
Sydney loves you.

643
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,300
I just don't know how to describe that experience

644
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,800
So simple but yet so profound.

645
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,200
No smoke and mirrors,
just people trying to reach out to each other.

646
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,700
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

647
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,900
Nikki gonna be ok?

648
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,400
Yeah,i think so.

649
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,000
County said they wouldn't file any charges.

650
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,200
You know,if i could do what you do,
I would shout it from the rooftops.

651
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,700
In fact, i can't do what you do,
but i still shout it from the rooftops.

652
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,300
You have a gift, you kn--

653
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,600
An instinct about people,
to make them see things they're not aware of.

654
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,900
I couldn't have done this without you.

655
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,500
Thank you.

656
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Uh,excuse me, are you casey edgars?

657
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,400
- Uh,yes.
- Oh,can i...please?
