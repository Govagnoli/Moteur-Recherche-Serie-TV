00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,894
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,110
<i>I'm married,</i>

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,403
<i>I live in a small town,</i>

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,481
<i>and I own an antique shop.</i>

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,490
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

7
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,235
<i>Except that from
the time I was a little girl,</i>

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,696
<i>I knew that I could
talk to the dead.</i>

9
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:23,870
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

10
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,200
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

11
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:29,664
<i>They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living</i>

12
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,415
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

13
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,259
<i>In order to tell you my story,</i>

14
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,461
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

15
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,722
So...

16
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,972
this is really,really great.

17
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:53,510
Out in nature,
no one but us for miles.

18
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:56,091
Who knew that camping
could be so much fun.

19
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,661
What'd I tell you?
The clean air. The smell.

20
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,231
- There's nothing like it.
- Yeah. I'm getting that feeling.

21
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:06,453
I'm just glad you
came this time, ok?

22
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:09,982
Besides, I thought when you said we were
going to the woods,you meant the woods.

23
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:12,243
That place where Delia
always wants to take you to?

24
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:16,493
Yeah. Salt scrubs,
seaweed wraps, massages.

25
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:17,583
That would be the one.

26
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:19,213
Pushaw! Uhh!

27
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:23,290
Besides, we got all
the luxury right here.

28
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,051
Ahh. And these hands,

29
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,420
they got more magic in them
than any seafood wrap.

30
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,592
Seaweed.

31
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,340
Oh, right. That's it.

32
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:35,550
Ahh. Yep.

33
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:39,642
Ahh. This place hasn'
changed a bit.

34
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,603
You used to come out
here with your father?

35
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:43,903
Yeah.

36
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,122
Me, my brother...

37
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:48,311
and my old man.

38
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:49,151
No mom?

39
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,690
No. She loved camping
about as much as you do.

40
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,070
Hey! Ha ha.

41
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,942
Oh, no.

42
00:01:56,248 --> 00:02:00,742
Sorry. The wood
probably was just green.

43
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:06,623
All right.

44
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,753
Oh!

45
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:09,871
Why don't you-

46
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,043
I'll go-

47
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,753
This the crisp air you
were talking about?

48
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,881
Did I forget to mention-ahh-

49
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:18,090
we might get a little weather.

50
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,763
Zip it.

51
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,863
Hey, do you hear that?

52
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,483
Hmm? Crickets.

53
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,570
Not that.

54
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,610
- Lanie.
- That.

55
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,961
Lanie.

56
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,053
Hello?

57
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,301
Somebody out there?

58
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,821
Lanie.

59
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:06,232
Come out,come out,
wherever you are. Come out,

60
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,642
come out

61
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,060
Hello?

62
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,943
Crap.

63
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,903
Oh, where is it?

64
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,160
Where is it?

65
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,080
Hey. No, no, no. It's ok.

66
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:07,200
It's ok, it's ok.

67
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:08,253
You all right?

68
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,963
Oh, I'm so glad it's you.

69
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm glad I saw your light because when
I woke up and you weren't in bed,

70
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:15,492
- ... I almost freaked out.
- Sorry. I heard something.

71
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,253
A woman's voice.

72
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:20,090
I found this.

73
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,302
That's been there for a while.

74
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,840
Yeah. Look at this.

75
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,940
The, uh...

76
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,470
the  moldy sippy cup?

77
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,973
No. No, there was a-

78
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,602
there was a creepy baby doll.

79
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,281
A baby doll.

80
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,152
The woman's voice,
it sounded desperate, and...

81
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:41,233
I don't know. I just feel like maybe
I should stay in case she comes back.

82
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:42,741
No.

83
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:46,913
I think she knows where you're staying.
We're the only ones up here for miles.

84
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:49,120
Ok. You're right. If she
needs me, she'll find me.

85
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,662
Yeah. Come on. Let's
go and get some sleep.

86
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,080
I got some plans for tomorrow.

87
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,841
Lanie.

88
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:12,801
Come out,come out, wherever you are.

89
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,432
Hello?

90
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,731
Don't be afraid.

91
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,690
I wanna help you.

92
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,783
Lanie!

93
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,211
Morning, sunshine.

94
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,510
It's disgusting how cheerfu
you are in the morning.

95
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,762
Well, you sleep much
deeper out here in the...

96
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,060
fine air.

97
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,061
Speak for yourself.

98
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,483
Ah. Breakfast smells
so good. I'm starving.

99
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,140
Yeah. Breakfast was about 4 hours ago.

100
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,111
This would be lunch.

101
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,481
Just tell me there's coffee.

102
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,520
All right.

103
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:11,901
Do I sense a less than
perfect night's sleep?

104
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,072
Well, between the ghosts,

105
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,170
stinking air-

106
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:18,200
Air mattress,

107
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,583
I didn't sleep all night.

108
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,072
She came back? Why didn't you wake me up?

109
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:24,491
'Cause I didn't have any dynamite?

110
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,920
You know, it's weird.

111
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,832
She made the doll appear in the fire.

112
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,380
That's creepy.

113
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,151
What's the message?

114
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,841
I don't know. Stay away?

115
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:37,013
She's done everything she can to get
rid of us,even that weird windstorm.

116
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,311
You know, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,340
I hope I haven't tainted
this place for you.

118
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:43,443
No. I feel sorry for your ghost.

119
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:45,730
Yeah. That hide and seek
song she keeps singing

120
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:47,730
makes me think
she's looking for a child.

121
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,861
Well, that would explain
why she's so territorial.

122
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:52,560
She's trying to say something else.
I just don't know what.

123
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,231
Yummy. I'm starving.

124
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:57,702
You're going to need it.

125
00:07:57,736 --> 00:08:00,651
- Oh? - I was thinking that
we'd go on a little hike.

126
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,161
A hike sounds nice.

127
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:05,320
Might have to make a small detour.

128
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,701
Oh, come on. You got to admit,
this is kind of exciting.

129
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,682
Ah, I don't know. To me,

130
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,591
a swimming hole's exciting.

131
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,882
Haunted, rusty cars,not so exciting.

132
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,880
It doesn't look like
there was an accident.

133
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,012
Maybe they just ran off the road.

134
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,342
but  there is no road here.

135
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,641
Aha. There used to be.

136
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,732
The main road used to
run through the pass

137
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,022
till the forest service took over
and made this all a reserve.

138
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,601
Look at you with that thing.

139
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,733
Maybe this was a side road.

140
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,281
Well, how long ago was that?

141
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:41,612
I don't know. My dad and I first started
coming out here about 20 years ago.

142
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,361
car's been here at least that long.

143
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,180
I think I found a registration.

144
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:02,674
- Only thing I can make out is Anna.
- Well, it's a first name anyway.

145
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,005
Hey,  do you think you can trace this
license when you get back to work?

146
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,519
I can do better than that.

147
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,180
I can request a history of all
911 calls made out of the region.

148
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:13,943
I can do that if we get out of here now

149
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:17,222
because I'd really like to
make it to the falls by dark.

150
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,731
Last one there gets pushed down!

151
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,993
Oh, um, there's some really great
vintage baby rattles over there.

152
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,493
Thanks. I'm just waiting on a friend.

153
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:34,453
Ok.

154
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:37,073
These alabaster lamps
are really hard to find.

155
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,203
You've got a good eye.

156
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,250
No. Absolutely not.

157
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:46,250
That skateboard park is an
accident waiting to happen.

158
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,252
You sure grant's mom
is going to be there?

159
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,223
Is my receipt in the bag?

160
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,061
Can you just put
her on the phone?

161
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:56,130
- What? What do you mean she's not there?
- Here's your receipt.

162
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:59,141
No solvents. Just some
soap and water and, um...

163
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:00,601
something for your next purchase.

164
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,772
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:07,272
Ok, fine,but if I find out that you
didn't wear a helmet, you are dead.

166
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,852
Yes. I love you, too.

167
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:10,652
I am so sorry.

168
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:13,423
That woman is never
coming back again, is she?

169
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,150
Oh, I think she will. I gave
her a 20% off coupon.

170
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,243
You definitely don't miss a trick.

171
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,493
Thanks for covering for me.

172
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,533
Anytime. Was that ned?

173
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

174
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,491
I always thought I'd worry
about him less as he grew up,

175
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:27,160
but I worry about him more.

176
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,872
You know, at this rate, I won't stop
worrying about him until I'm dead.

177
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,133
If you're lucky.

178
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:36,383
- Chances are, I'll still be worrying
from my grave. - Lanie!

179
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,681
It sounds like I chose a
bad time to leave you...

180
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:40,721
- Come out,come out, wherever you are!
- With the store.

181
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,523
Oh, no. Just the opposite.

182
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:46,143
It was great to take my
mind off the little daredevil.

183
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:49,722
So, was camping as dreadful
as you thought it would be?

184
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,401
Actually, it was kind of exciting.

185
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:56,480
It was good for jimmy and
i to have some time alone.

186
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:02,440
Aha. Fess up. Do I detect a little
biological alarm clock going off?

187
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,492
Uh, ooh. No, nothing like that. Mm-mmm.

188
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:05,502
Come on. You can tell me.

189
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,490
I know I gripe,but motherhood rocks.

190
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,463
You are going to love it.

191
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:12,251
I'm sure I will. Can you just
excuse me for a second?

192
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,710
What are you doing?

193
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,173
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,592
I just wanted to
see your adorable baby,

195
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,212
and, oh, my god. She's so cute.

196
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,170
Thanks.

197
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:32,191
It's like she's testing me,

198
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,940
trying to see if she can trust me.

199
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:36,681
You think this ghost
is a worried mom...

200
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,692
looking for her kid.

201
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:42,020
Yeah, but I didn't realize until
today how intense that feeling is.

202
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:43,401
Wait a minute.

203
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:45,783
What happened today?

204
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,581
I just had a couple of anxious
moms at the store. Delia being one.

205
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:52,491
Please tell me that this is not the same
stove that you used with your dad.

206
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:54,002
Yes, miss change the subject.

207
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,623
That is the same stove
I used with my father.

208
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:57,793
And it works like new.

209
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,713
I got a little something for you.

210
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:05,422
That's the trace, with an
address for one anna fowler.

211
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:06,961
You traced the license already?

212
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,052
Yep. That's how I roll.

213
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,683
It expired in '86.

214
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:12,471
That's probably around when she died.

215
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:16,011
Well, we'll know that for sure
when the 911 trace comes back,

216
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,981
which will probably take
a couple of weeks,

217
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:21,103
because anything more than 10
years old is in the main archives.

218
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,940
You're my hero.
This is brookside. It's close.

219
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:24,901
Don't get too excited.

220
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:28,573
Anybody who lives in that house
probably never heard of... anna fowler.

221
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,241
Well, I have a secret weapon.

222
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,621
Delia can trace real
estate transactions for me.

223
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:35,291
You know, one of these days
she is going to get suspicious.

224
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,532
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm going
to have to do something about it.

225
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,413
<i>Come out,
come out, wherever you are.</i>

226
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:43,960
Uh, you know,I'll be right back.

227
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:46,790
Can you throw this thing
in the trash for me?

228
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,331
Yeah, sure.

229
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,503
Anna?

230
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:59,641
Anna, I can't help you if
you won't talk to me.

231
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,720
Are you looking for someone?

232
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:06,861
I have to find her.

233
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,352
Who do you have to find?

234
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:10,200
My baby girl.

235
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,990
She's lost.

236
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,613
Can you tell me
what happened?

237
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:17,870
I... I was cold.

238
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:21,032
Mel, where'd you put the, um...

239
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,990
I scared her away,didn't I?

240
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:26,791
Yeah.

241
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:30,960
But  she left us something.

242
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,370
Lanie was a baby

243
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:48,721
she must dead too

244
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:51,771
I really shouldn't be doing this.

245
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:54,031
You said you wanted to keep
a foot in real estate.

246
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:57,561
Yes, to make money,but not
to snoop on other people's records.

247
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:58,743
Well, it's for a good cause.

248
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,493
A little girl's missing her doll.

249
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:05,492
Well, she wouldn't be a little girl anymore
if we're looking at records this far back.

250
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,003
Ok. Here it is.

251
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:13,370
The house was sold in 1991 and
the owner's name was brad fowler.

252
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,090
Does it say anything else about him?

253
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,750
Like what, he's a gemini and
likes long walks on the beach?

254
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:21,791
I mean, like his occupation.

255
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,300
Uh...  he was a therapist.

256
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,671
Hey, maybe you can kill
two birds with one stone.

257
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:29,763
You're hilarious. Thank you.

258
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,301
Sure.

259
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:35,851
I just thought you'd like to
know that the car was found.

260
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,731
This is, uh...

261
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,602
this is strange.

262
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:43,400
All those years...

263
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:46,691
I'm guessing it
belonged to your wife?

264
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,070
My wife is dead.

265
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:54,083
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

266
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,912
it's just I found something in the car that
I thought may have belonged to a child.

267
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,843
Lanie.

268
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:12,301
This was my little girl'S.

269
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:16,511
It was really very,very thoughtful
of you to go to all this trouble.

270
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:19,352
It was no trouble.

271
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:24,890
My wife, anna, we were...
separated at the time.

272
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:29,362
She died up in those woods...
in a snowstorm.

273
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,481
Just a bit of a shock seeing all of this.

274
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,400
I understand.

275
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:41,003
I'd rather not have this.

276
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,911
Maybe you can give it to
a hospital or something.

277
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,913
Brings up some pretty
tough memories.

278
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,712
I don't mean to pry,

279
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:50,311
but did something happen
to your daughter also?

280
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,882
Worse thing that can
happen to a little girl.

281
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,510
I'm so sorry.

282
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,472
She was abandoned
by her mother.

283
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:59,343
You mean she didn't
die in the storm?

284
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:00,683
No.

285
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,432
She wasn't even in the car.

286
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,723
She was at home with me.

287
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,200
Where's my baby?!

288
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:24,161
I don't know yet.

289
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:25,743
Are you hiding her?

290
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,923
No.

291
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,701
I'm trying to help you, but I need
to know what you remember.

292
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:33,342
Nothing. I don't remember anything.

293
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:36,672
Ok. I know that this is hard,
but you have to try.

294
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,963
It will come if you're not
afraid of remembering.

295
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,343
But I am afraid.

296
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,563
Look at the doll.

297
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,733
That's what you were protecting.

298
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:00,111
I was scared.

299
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,400
It was bad out.

300
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:08,361
I knew it was stupid
to be on the road,

301
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:11,660
but I felt like I couldn't stop.

302
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,331
Like I shouldn't stop.

303
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:17,791
I don't know why.

304
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,570
I panicked.

305
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,652
Where was my baby?

306
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,693
I couldn't remember.

307
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,272
Anna, I...

308
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,492
I found your husband.

309
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,453
Lane was with him that night.
She wasn't in the car with you.

310
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:58,541
What?

311
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:00,911
She's alive.

312
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,831
I can't believe it.

313
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:08,841
Can I see her?

314
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,441
No, I haven't found her yet.

315
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:14,012
But there's something else.

316
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,862
Your husband said
that you left him...

317
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,641
and lane, that
he raised her alone.

318
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,190
No.

319
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,103
No. No, I would never do that.

320
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,940
She's my life,she's all I have.

321
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,852
Yeah. I'm sure that
that's true,but brad said-

322
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:31,232
no! I didn't abandon my baby!

323
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,522
Ok.

324
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,572
Maybe I should talk
to her alone first.

325
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:42,793
See how she feels.

326
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,913
Brad said that she
lives nearby, so...

327
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,250
I have to see her.

328
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,632
You will.

329
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,423
I swear. Just...

330
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:53,961
let me do this first.

331
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:56,960
My baby's alive.

332
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,390
Hi. I'm melinda gordon.

333
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,643
I own the antique
shop in town.

334
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,352
I found something that
I think you might want.

335
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:08,282
I talked to your dad-

336
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:10,182
oh, my god. My muffins.

337
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,850
Come in. Come in.

338
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,481
please don't burn

339
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:18,651
Hot, hot, hot!

340
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:20,942
Oh, oh!god

341
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,532
You'd never guess
I do this for a living.

342
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,033
Ah. Chocolate peanut butter cup.

343
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:28,543
My new greatest invention.

344
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,412
Those aren't the ones they
sell at village java, are they?

345
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,592
The very same.

346
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,541
I love those. I'm totally addicted.

347
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:38,041
It's part of my evil plan.

348
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:40,013
I do birthdays, too.

349
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,010
So, you were saying that,
uh, my father sent you?

350
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,170
But if what you found is a wedding dress,

351
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,921
- ... you can forget about it.
- A dress?

352
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:50,180
I know he means well, and I'm sure
your vintage pieces are very sweet,

353
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:54,773
but I told him a gazillion times,
it's a hawaiian luau.

354
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,891
I mean, I love the guy to bits, but

355
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:59,231
it's my wedding, right?

356
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,943
I'm-you know-actually-

357
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,210
ah! Oh!

358
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:03,441
Lanie!

359
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:09,113
I'm  such a klutz.

360
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:12,332
Don't scare me like that.

361
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,621
I thought you were
at the library studying.

362
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,871
Well, I couldn't stay
away from you so long.

363
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,132
Ok. Enough with the flowers.
I get it. You're sorry,

364
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,633
but we are running
out of vases.

365
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,112
Oh, god. I'm so rude.

366
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,511
Todd, this is melinda.

367
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:34,342
She owns that cute
antique store downtown.

368
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:36,483
Oh, yeah. It was nice to meet you.

369
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,640
Hey, babe, I'm gonna squeeze in a
couple more hours before dinner.

370
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:39,812
Great.

371
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,852
As if getting married
wasn't enough,

372
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:44,693
he's studying for the bar.

373
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,522
Mmm. Why all the flowers?

374
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,112
he feels bad.

375
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,651
It was a nothing argument really.

376
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:52,701
It was my fault.

377
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:55,080
But who's complaining, right?

378
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,573
Right. Um, actually,
I didn't come here about a dress.

379
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:01,203
I wanted to return
something to you.

380
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,503
Uh, no. That's-that's not mine.

381
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:07,052
Why would you think it is?

382
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:10,171
Because I found it
in your mom's car.

383
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,390
Lanie

384
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:14,090
It;s yours,isn't?

385
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,053
What?

386
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:23,512
we should go
outside and talk.

387
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,061
Ok.

388
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,272
My mom left
when I was 3,but

389
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:35,750
it still gets to me.

390
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,191
So you remember her?

391
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:40,242
Some.

392
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:43,500
How she used to sing along to the radio,

393
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:46,790
the way she smelled when
she kissed me good night.

394
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:50,602
The rest I just
learned from my dad.

395
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:53,711
Did your dad
tell you why she left?

396
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:57,723
Look, um...

397
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:01,133
you're real
easy to talk to, but...

398
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:03,970
why are you asking me this?

399
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:07,231
Your mother...

400
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:09,101
her spirit is still here.

401
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,442
I've seen her.

402
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:12,680
I've spoken to her.

403
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:16,520
You're telling me you've
seen my mother's ghost?

404
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:18,363
I know.

405
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,231
Believe me, I know
that it sounds crazy,

406
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,361
but... it's my gift.

407
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,743
She's the one who
gave me this doll,

408
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:32,053
and she wanted to find you very badly.
She loves you very much.

409
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,292
What are you doing?

410
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,673
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:38,833
What?

412
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,041
Nothing. I'm just
telling you the truth.

413
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:44,212
My mother was mentally ill.

414
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:47,630
My father said she had
delusional paranoia.

415
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:50,131
She left us.

416
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:52,411
She left me,
and then she died,

417
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,102
so I couldn't even know her.

418
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:00,353
Uh! What the hell!

419
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:07,981
- What happened?
- I don't know.

420
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:10,453
it just explosion

421
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:11,913
Anna.

422
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,701
What are you doing?

423
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:15,413
I'm sorry. I-I think

424
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,832
anna is doing this.
I'm just not really sure why.

425
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:23,922
Look,I don't know what you're trying to
pull, but I want you out of here,ok? Now.

426
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,042
You ok?

427
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:29,213
Uh... yeah.

428
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,642
- What happened in there?
- I had to see her.

429
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:45,942
She needs me.

430
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:47,602
She's a big girl now.
She grew up really well.

431
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:49,231
You don't have to worry
about her anymore.

432
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:50,490
Yes,I do!

433
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,573
Look,if your marriage ended badly,
I'm really sorry about that,

434
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,580
but you can't take
it out on lane and todd.

435
00:23:55,615 --> 00:24:00,030
Believe me,the best thing that you can do
for your daughter is just to move on.

436
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,413
No.

437
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,661
As long as my baby needs me,

438
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,622
I'm never leaving.

439
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:54,750
Please!

440
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:59,343
- Todd?!
- No!

441
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:03,592
What's going
on in there?!

442
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,221
Todd?!

443
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:16,903
Hello?

444
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:20,523
You have to get
over here quick.

445
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,690
I think I need you.

446
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:26,580
The door's jammed.

447
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,202
Don't worry.
Jim will get us in.

448
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,743
Todd?!

449
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:34,460
Todd,

450
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:36,082
where are you,man?

451
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:39,461
Oh,my god!
Baby!

452
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:41,331
It's all right. He's all right.
Come over here. Come over here.

453
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:42,502
Oh,my god.
He's bleeding.

454
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:43,260
Go away!

455
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:45,011
He's gonna
need stitches.

456
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,053
- I'm gonna go grab
- my kit. Pressure.

457
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:48,932
It wasn't enough
that she abandoned me?

458
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:51,182
She's got to come back from
the grave to haunt me?!

459
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,780
I don't know why
she's not moving on,

460
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:56,350
but I'll try to fix it,ok?
I promise.

461
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,550
I have no idea
how to fix this.

462
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,693
Oh,yeah?
Maybe this'll help.

463
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:03,100
911 report. We just
got it faxed to us.

464
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,570
"Anna fowler.
Female. Caucasian.

465
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:08,230
Cause of death, hyperthermia.
"Page one of 3". Where's the rest of it?

466
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,191
Hey,hey,hey. That was before
we got computerized.

467
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,240
We're lucky to have
gotten anything at all.

468
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:14,873
I'm sorry
I'm so grumpy.

469
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,620
Grumpy? You got a crazy ghost
making you crazy.

470
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:19,463
Oh,I married
a comedian.

471
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:22,080
Hey,the guy who wrote this report,
do you know him?

472
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,711
Yeah. I know andy.

473
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:27,883
Sure,I remember
that night.

474
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,882
Changed me forever.

475
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:37,180
Got a call that morning
from the woman's sister...

476
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:40,182
she was worried because she
hadn't shown up the night before.

477
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,772
Andy,you led
the rescue team up,right?

478
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:46,183
Not right away. That storm
was something fierce.

479
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,690
Worst I'd seen up
till then.

480
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,772
Had to wait until it was
practically dark for it to subside.

481
00:26:53,118 --> 00:26:56,362
It couldn't have been easy finding her
with all that snow falling.

482
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:58,993
You're not kidding.

483
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:02,243
There was no sign of her
along the main road, so we split up.

484
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:08,541
The footprints were pretty well
covered already.

485
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,081
But I knew
they had to be hers.

486
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,593
So I followed them
for quite a ways.

487
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,301
I knew right away that
she didn't make it.

488
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:34,522
I went to check
her pulse...

489
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,650
and that's
when I realized...

490
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,570
what?

491
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,363
What did you realize?

492
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,671
The little girl...

493
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,421
was alive.

494
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,112
It was a miracle.

495
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:06,093
A true miracle.

496
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,351
Her mother used the warmth
of her own body to keep her kid alive.

497
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,771
Lane was with her mother
that night.

498
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,981
Anna died trying
to save her baby.

499
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,691
Why would her husband
lie about that?

500
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:31,540
y would bradlie about that?

501
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:34,082
I don't know. But I think
that you do and...

502
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:37,621
I hope bringing you back here
will help you remember.

503
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,380
She was with me.

504
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,642
She was with me.

505
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,972
Yes. She was. Anna...

506
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:54,513
no. You don't
understand. It...

507
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:57,183
it all makes sense now.

508
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,651
Mommy!

509
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:18,623
Mommy,my dolly!
Mommy!

510
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,791
I knew I should stay
in the car,but...

511
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,581
it was like
a refrigerator.

512
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:26,253
Mommy,I'm scared.

513
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,751
I thought if
I just kept moving.

514
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:36,723
Come on,sweetie.

515
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:40,012
I was scared.
I was trying to get away.

516
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:42,803
I just couldn't
let him find me.

517
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:45,523
Who?
Who were you running from?

518
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:48,183
- My husband.
- Brad?

519
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,440
- Yeah.
- Why?

520
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:54,192
He hit me.

521
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:57,780
- Again.
- Anna...

522
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:00,400
I always thought
it was my fault.

523
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:04,621
If I could just be
a better wife.

524
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,001
Until that night...

525
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:11,040
Come back here!
I'm not done!

526
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,093
Open the door!

527
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,250
And we had another one
of our fights.

528
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:16,383
Anna!
Open the door!

529
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,942
I thought
she was asleep,

530
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,472
but our fighting woke her up.

531
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,182
Oh, baby.

532
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:28,610
- Oh, baby.
- Anna! let me in!

533
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:31,041
Mommy,don't
let him in.

534
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:33,000
Please don't
let him in.

535
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,940
I saw how scared she was.

536
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,023
And I knew
we had to get out.

537
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:40,361
But if you
were being abused...

538
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:43,241
why didn't your friends
or anyone help you?

539
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:46,033
I was too ashamed
to tell them.

540
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,712
I wore long sleeves
to cover the bruises.

541
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,542
And if anyone did notice,
I'd just laugh it off.

542
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:54,830
Clumsy me.

543
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,583
Everyone thought we were
the perfect couple.

544
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:01,920
And we were when
we weren't fighting.

545
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,883
Brad would feel so bad
after one of our fights,

546
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:08,381
he'd spoil me
like crazy,presents,

547
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:11,841
big bouquets of flowers,
the works.

548
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:16,353
Is that why
you attacked todd?

549
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:19,563
Because you saw him give
lane the bouquet of flowers?

550
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:22,183
When I saw him
with that bouquet,

551
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:24,963
something just snapped
inside of me.

552
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:27,691
She has to know
what you went through.

553
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:31,113
What you did for her.

554
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:42,541
Please tell me
she's not here.

555
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:44,833
It's just me.

556
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,640
She gone for good?

557
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:52,130
No,but she said she'd stay away
until you're ready to see her.

558
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,262
That would be never.

559
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,143
Anna didn't abandon you.

560
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,393
What?

561
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:05,480
I talked to the paramedic
who rescued you.

562
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,731
You were with her
when she died.

563
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:12,400
I was with her
when she left my dad?

564
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:14,863
She took you
with her.

565
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,650
But...

566
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,620
why would my dad
lie about that?

567
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,160
Maybe he feels ashamed.

568
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:23,913
Ashamed of what?

569
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,373
My dad? He's the greatest dad
anyone could ask for.

570
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:29,662
Did some pretty bad
things to your mom.

571
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:31,881
Look,my dad would
never hurt anyone,ok?

572
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:34,673
If she said he did,
it's because she's crazy.

573
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:38,800
I don't know. Maybe she hates me.
You saw what she did to todd.

574
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:40,810
That was because
of the flowers.

575
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:43,020
Your dad always gave
her flowers after they had a fight.

576
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:45,392
It was a gut reaction when she saw todd
give you the bouquet.

577
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:47,443
Ok. Stop.
You've gone too far.

578
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,850
I don't need you
meddling in my life.

579
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,190
It's complicated
enough right now.

580
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,653
Your mom died trying to keep you safe.
She wanted to protect you.

581
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,651
And now she needs to
know that you're ok so she can move on.

582
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:01,572
Would it kill you
to just at least talk to her?

583
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:05,032
That ship's already sailed.

584
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:15,832
At least I know I can trust my instincts.
Anna isn't crazy.

585
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:17,092
But lane didn't
believe you?

586
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:20,003
When I told her her mom was abused,
she just shut down.

587
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:22,401
Well,that's a pretty big
bomb you dropped on her.

588
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,390
Kind of blows away
everything she grew up believing.

589
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,111
Yeah. Her father is a therapist.

590
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:27,871
I mean,you'd think he'd
have it all figured out.

591
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:28,732
I guess she
never really know.

592
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:32,431
Yeah. Well,I wouldn't
mind meeting that guy in a dark room.

593
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,730
You are a bigger
softie than me.

594
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:42,773
It was a nothing argument.
My fault really.

595
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:45,401
I always thought
it was my fault.

596
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,581
- It's happening.
- It's happening.

597
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:55,123
Oh,my god!
I gotta go!

598
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:20,100
Lane! Lane,
it's melinda!

599
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,521
Are you ok?

600
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:30,532
I'm fine.

601
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:32,453
Now isn't a good time.

602
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:34,531
Do you want me
to get you out of here?

603
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,741
Are you crazy?

604
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:39,831
You've done
enough damage.

605
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,503
Lane, get in here

606
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:43,040
Lane!

607
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:55,971
I left so this would stop.

608
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,053
But it didn'T.

609
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,102
It never will.

610
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,142
Then we have
to do something.

611
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,891
She won't listen to me...

612
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,003
or to you.

613
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,882
Not now.

614
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,703
What?

615
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,692
Is this some
twisted joke?

616
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:14,621
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:16,401
I would normally
do this slowly,

618
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,121
explain gently
that I have a gift,

619
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,241
I can see spirits,I can
cross them over,yada,yada.

620
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,321
Frankly,I don't have
the patience or the time.

621
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,750
- Lane needs you.
- What do you mean?

622
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:28,662
I think she's being abused,
just like you abused her mother.

623
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:34,632
What,um...
what makes you say that?

624
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,433
Look,brad,you don't have
to believe I can see ghosts,

625
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:39,261
but please believe
what I'm telling you about your daughter.

626
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:45,601
Ok. Ok. I'll admit
I had doubts about todd.

627
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,303
I always thought it was
just my own paranoia,

628
00:35:48,337 --> 00:35:50,031
projecting my own
demons onto him.

629
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,901
But I know he loves her.

630
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:55,603
You loved me,too.
Said you couldn't live without me.

631
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:58,650
You always said
your heart beat only for me.

632
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:01,653
You said your heart beat
only for her.

633
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,741
Is she really here?

634
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,001
Can-can-can you tell her-

635
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:13,913
tell her that I'm not
the same person anymore?

636
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:17,792
That I've gotten help,and
now I'm helping others.

637
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,300
I know that look of his,

638
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:24,303
so full of guilt
and remorse.

639
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,972
She can hear you.

640
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:29,640
Anna...

641
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:34,181
I'm so sorry for...

642
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,110
for what I did.

643
00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:40,813
I just...
hope you can forgive me.

644
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:51,860
All those times
you begged me to forgive you,

645
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,670
and I did...

646
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:57,371
because I loved you,

647
00:36:58,005 --> 00:37:02,173
because I believed
you could change.

648
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,593
And it looks
like you have,

649
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,932
but I can't
forgive you.

650
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:15,303
I forgave you too many
times when I was alive.

651
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,721
She wishes she could,
but it's too late.

652
00:37:20,148 --> 00:37:21,600
Right.

653
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:26,152
Of course...

654
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:30,321
brad,the reason that anna is earthbound
is not because of what you did to her.

655
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:31,911
It's lane.

656
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:34,543
You have one chance
to redeem yourself,

657
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:37,530
to help your daughter, please
tell her the truth about you,

658
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:40,123
so she that can she
can know the truth about todd.

659
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:49,382
I didn't want you to know.
That's why I lied.

660
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,423
I know it was wrong.

661
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:57,341
I hated myself
for what I did to her.

662
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:02,800
I couldn't live
if you hated me,too.

663
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:06,733
My mom didn't abandon me?

664
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,693
No.
She didn'T.

665
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:16,863
So you let me believe
that my mother left me?

666
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:21,031
That she didn't love me?

667
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:25,123
Lanie, the only reason I'm
bringing this up now

668
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:30,083
is because I don't want you to make
the same mistake your mother did.

669
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:32,132
What do you mean?

670
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,250
Anna thinks todd
is hurting you.

671
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,553
Lanie...

672
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:45,141
they say that little girls
marry their fathers-

673
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:47,140
just stop it,ok?

674
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:49,151
Todd and I are happy.

675
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:51,561
We're getting married,
he's gonna pass the bar,

676
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,891
and everything
is gonna be great.

677
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:55,771
Just stop this.

678
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,613
Lanie,please.

679
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,201
No.

680
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:09,952
My head is spinning.

681
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:14,702
I can't even think
about this right now.

682
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:23,592
So you think she's waiting
to see if lane's okay?

683
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:26,511
Sure. And believe me, she'll know.
She's got the mommy-radar.

684
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:30,390
You know,I always wondered how my mom
knew I spiked the punch at junior prom.

685
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,981
Go ahead, make fun of me,
but,you know what, it's powerful stuff.

686
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:37,820
See, I think anna was in limbo.
Earthbound but unaware.

687
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:39,431
Her daughter got engaged,

688
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:42,173
and it sent a ripple effect through
the universe that woke her up.

689
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:45,110
Oh, to be continued.

690
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,780
Is my mother here?

691
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:58,951
I always told myself
it would get better.

692
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,962
When he passed the bar...

693
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,551
when we got married.

694
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,672
When we moved
into a bigger house.

695
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:16,092
He wasn't going
to change.

696
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,561
You did the right thing.

697
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:21,433
My mother did
the right thing.

698
00:40:21,977 --> 00:40:24,360
Is that why
she stayed here?

699
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:27,812
To stop me from
staying with him?

700
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:34,913
Can I...

701
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:37,863
can I thank her?

702
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:41,370
You just did.

703
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:44,123
She's here?

704
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:48,801
She's so beautiful.

705
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:53,251
I can't believe this is the
tiny little girl I held in my arms.

706
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:54,970
Mom?

707
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:57,840
She wants you to know
how proud she is of you.

708
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,680
No,mom. It was you.

709
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:09,522
I can't believe how strong you were
to do what you did.

710
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:12,153
How tough you were.

711
00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:16,151
You protected me.

712
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:19,993
You saved me.

713
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:24,532
We saved ourselves.

714
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,872
I'm so scared,mom.

715
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:32,872
I don't know
what I'm going to do now.

716
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,633
Yes,you do.

717
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:40,421
It's inside you.

718
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:43,923
Remember
how strong you are.

719
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:47,640
And just think of me,

720
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:49,850
and I'll be with you.

721
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:53,103
I'll be watching you
from wherever I am.

722
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:56,692
She wants you to remember
how strong you are.

723
00:41:57,736 --> 00:42:00,481
She will always
be watching over you.

724
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:06,322
I love you,mom.

725
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:10,911
I feel like I never
got to say it to her.

726
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:13,872
You don't have
to say it.

727
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:17,000
We both know it.

728
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:33,342
Thank you
for everything.

729
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,063
She's gone?

730
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,780
Yeah.

731
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:49,861
But she's happy.

732
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:53,651
At peace.

733
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,721
I can't
thank you enough.

734
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,311
I don't know
what else to say.
