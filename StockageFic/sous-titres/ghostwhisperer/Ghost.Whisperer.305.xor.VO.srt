1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,240
previously on ghost whisperer...

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,310
we're getting ready.

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,710
For what?
- For what's coming.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,720
It's time for you
to know who you are.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,920
And to know who your brother is.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,890
Do you really think it was
your father in the light?

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,290
If he's dead, I have to
find out what happened.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,060
You are so over your head.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,010
And I really wouldn't come back.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,410
Ever.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,210
All right, I get it.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,240
I understand.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,870
I'll make dinner.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,860
I'll do the dishes, but, uh,

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,490
you just relax. Take it easy.

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,970
Look, I offered to help.

17
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,210
Did I miss that?

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,900
Look at me. Doing my part,
going to get the door.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,320
Don't hurt your hand on
the doorknob. Take it easy.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,940
Mel, who is it?

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,960
What the hell are you doing here?

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,320
Wow.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,720
You're angry.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,620
I was there when you got hurt.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,663
You think it's my fault.

26
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,960
You were there, smiling,
and she wasn't just hurt.

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,880
For the longest minute
of my life, she was dead.

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,280
Yeah.

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,450
You know, a part of me didn't
mind seeing you like that.

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,680
For a very long time I blamed my entire
family for leaving me locked up in that...

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,320
where I grew up.
- Too bad.

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,010
Go.
- I'm trying to find dad.

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,390
Mine or yours?

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,580
Ours.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,940
My father's dead.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,890
Why should that keep either
of us from looking for him?

37
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,710
We both see ghosts.
- Are you done?

38
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,110
Look, I...

39
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,120
I figured you'd still be in denial.

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,250
Who would want to admit that their old
man had an extra family on the side?

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,050
But are you gonna tell
me you haven't seen him?

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,780
He hasn't come to visit
you in your dreams?

43
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,340
Yeah, I thought so.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,620
He's been haunting my dreams, too.

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,250
How do you think I found
out you were my sister?

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,340
Jim asked you to leave, nicely.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,140
What are you hiding from?

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,470
We're both trying to find him.

49
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,120
We both have unfinished
business with him.

50
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,480
We... we should be
working together...

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,540
that's enough! Go!

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,030
Look.

53
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,430
My mother gave this
to me when I was a kid.

54
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,290
It belonged to my dad.

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,770
It'll mean a lot more to
you than it ever did to me.

56
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,670
Patient Personal Property

57
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,540
For you, they were family.

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,430
For me, they were just more
people he had to hide me from.

59
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,270
Where was your mother for all this?

60
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,960
She was always close by.

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,360
In the next ward
the mental hospital

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,860
This is my dad's parents
right after they got married.

63
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,870
And, uh,

64
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,915
my dad told me that
he got these cufflinks

65
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,870
from his aunt and uncle right
after he graduated college.

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,660
Honey, you know, gabriel could have
gotten this stuff from anywhere.

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't trust him either.

68
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,440
But

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,370
I just can't shake the feeling that he might
be telling the truth about being my brother.

70
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,570
Why do you think that?

71
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,720
Too many coincidences.

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,160
Gabriel showed up right after
that dad told me I had brother.

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,740
And let's face it... my dad was

74
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,250
in and out of the house
for a lot of years,

75
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,780
so he could have had kids,
and I wouldn't have known.

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,220
Gabriel didn't get his gift from
dad, but he got other things.

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,240
Well, he certainly got your dad's
gift for tying you up in knots.

78
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,160
I left the lights on downstairs.
I'm going to turn 'em off.

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,940
You need anything? Tea? Water?

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,340
No.
- Ok.

81
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,220
So who do you think
the picture's of?

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,220
It's gotta be some
relative of my dad'S.

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
I mean, all these photos are his.

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,240
Well, so gabriel says.

85
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,130
Don't worry. I'm not taking
anything gabriel says on faith.

86
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,458
I just faxed a request
for his medical records to

87
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,698
that mental institution
he said he grew up in.

88
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:40,190
"Trust, but verify. "

89
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,990
Yeah, sounds good. Only my
motto is slightly different.

90
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,420
Trust, but caffeinate.
What will it be?

91
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,590
The usual. Twice the foam, please.

92
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,990
Ok.

93
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,130
Hello?

94
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,860
Who's there?
- Shh!

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,540
Who are you?

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,750
Why are you here?
- Please. Quiet.

97
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,880
They're everywhere.

98
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,460
Who?

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,860
They told me I was crazy.

100
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,660
They took my baby.

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,010
Who are you?

102
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,410
What's your name?

103
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,600
Wait a minute.

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,810
Gabriel gave this to me, and he...

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,420
he said that his mother was
in the same hospital he was.

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,960
You're gabriel's
mother, aren't you?

107
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,970
Help me!

108
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,370
Help me!

109
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,230
First it was ray billings, then there was
the stalker guy I saw get sucked under,

110
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,280
and now this one, gabriel's mother.

111
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,240
Well, if you're asking me to tell you that
there are no dark spirits under grandview,

112
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,810
get comfortable,'cause
it's gonna be a long wait.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,980
You've taken all of the smug
certainty out of being a skeptic.

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm waiting for you to
tell me how they work.

115
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,950
How can dark spirits trap other
ghosts, and why are they underground?

116
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,150
Well?

117
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,960
Oh, sorry, I thought
we were waiting.

118
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,860
Look, the basic gist of it is that the
dark spirits feed on the darker emotions...

119
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,700
hate, anger, fear, jealousy,
greed, all of that stuff.

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,690
And it's very powerful emotion,
so it's hard to break their grip.

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,980
Yeah, but not impossible?

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,270
No, it's not impossible.

123
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,670
The things that better them are the
same things that better them in life.

124
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,670
All the good stuff...

125
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,470
love, joy, happiness,
forgiveness, melted cheese,

126
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,060
6
- way adjustable bucket seats, that dress...

127
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,230
great. Thanks.
- Where are you going?

128
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,740
You're not actually going to go through with this, are you?
- Why wouldn't I?

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,150
You're going to take
a tip from this...

130
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,540
this gabriel guy to go find
your untrustworthy deadbeat dad?

131
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,560
Your untrustworthy
deadbeat dead dad?

132
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,070
I'm simply following some leads.

133
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,770
Leads? How? Think about this.

134
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,170
I will. Don't worry.

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,260
I'm worried.

136
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,550
Hey.

137
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,950
I got your call. What's up?

138
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,010
I was trying to summon
gabriel's mother...

139
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,940
if that's who she is...

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,340
and while I was
waiting, I got this.

141
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,660
It's the treatment records from
gabriel's institution, correct?

142
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,660
Yeah, I asked the doctor for
copies,'cause I wanted to know the truth.

143
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,600
Melinda, look, I'm sorry.

144
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,400
I know that I can't imagine
what this feels like for you,

145
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,410
but there's nothing in here
you didn't already know,

146
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,580
outside of the fact that
he attacked other patients.

147
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,010
He told them he could see ghosts.

148
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,070
They thought he was crazy.

149
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,470
It's why they put him in there.

150
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,240
That could have been me.

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,860
No, you have a gift.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
He is violent. He is mentally ill.

153
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,640
He's my brother. We have
a lot of the same genes.

154
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,290
You don't know that yet.

155
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,690
Actually, I do.

156
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,830
That's why dr. Lawrence wanted
to see my birth certificate.

157
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,050
He needed proof that I
was family, and he got it.

158
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,390
Gabriel's father was tom gordon.

159
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,950
He's my half brother.

160
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,300
And now you want to save him?

161
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,920
After what he did?

162
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,320
But this is what I do.

163
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,980
I help people fix
their worst mistakes.

164
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,795
Yes, hello.

165
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:40,450
Um, you have a guest staying with
you under the name gabriel gordon?

166
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,350
Well, could you check?

167
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,750
Sure. Thanks.

168
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,953
Hello?

169
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,473
Mr. Gordon is not answering.

170
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:03,628
would you like to leave a message?

171
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,220
Yeah!

172
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,743
No.

173
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:10,300
You know what? I'll... I'll
call back later, thanks.

174
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,058
So this wasn't a haunting,
it was more like a vision?

175
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,303
Uh, yeah.

176
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:26,018
Sometimes I get them, and
ghosts try to show me things,

177
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,900
and I don't always know why.

178
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,748
But it felt like it was real?

179
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:30,663
Oh, very.

180
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:33,213
My heart was still
pounding an hour later.

181
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,528
And did you get a chance
to talk to gabriel about it?

182
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:36,383
No.

183
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,203
The thing is this... this vision,

184
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,588
it was like... I think it's something
that happened to the ghost...

185
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,333
gabriel's mother...
and I, you know,

186
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,278
at first, I thought it maybe
was the moment that they

187
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,328
took her to the hospital,
but that wasn't right.

188
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,160
I mean, these guys
were rough, you know?

189
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,923
They had a big axe
with blood on it.

190
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:54,078
Right. Bloody axe doesn't
really say hospital, does it?

191
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,993
I have to find out more
before I talk to gabriel,

192
00:10:56,092 --> 00:11:00,588
which is my roundabout way of
asking you to please watch the store.

193
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:03,348
Only if you promise to
tell me everything you find.

194
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,715
Deal.
- Ok.

195
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,723
I'm not hurt.

196
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:09,998
Uh, just so you know.

197
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:11,238
I'm bigger than that.

198
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,913
Ok. Good.

199
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,343
I'm a talker. I know I talk a lot.

200
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:17,093
I can't expect people to listen
to every single word I say,

201
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:19,808
and that's why it didn't surprise
me you didn't listen to me.

202
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,053
What do you mean? I listened.
- You listened?

203
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:25,728
Then why are we down here with all of
these creepy, spooky ghosts where they live?

204
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:29,298
Because you had some advice
from your evil twin half brother.

205
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,683
Look, it was your idea.

206
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:33,783
You said that we needed to
check all the town death records

207
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:36,848
and that any place where there
was a dark spirit infestation

208
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,510
would probably have
a lot of deaths.

209
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,138
No, no, no. Not...
not a lot of deaths.

210
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:41,860
A lot and lot of deaths.

211
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,548
And grisly, awful deaths.

212
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:44,473
And simultaneous.

213
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,303
Like they all happened
at the same time.

214
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:48,673
Ok, so shouldn't we check
the records like you said?

215
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:51,008
All right, I don't like
being quoted back to myself.

216
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:51,893
Especially when I'm right.

217
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,348
While we are looking, why
don't you go that direction,

218
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,628
and I will go this way?

219
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,980
Ok.

220
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,380
Let's see.

221
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,638
I've been looking for
you. Where have you been?

222
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:03,783
Quiet.

223
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,153
They can hear you.

224
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,223
Please tell me what happened.

225
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:08,518
I can help you cross
over into the light.

226
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:09,883
Oh, no, no.

227
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:11,068
I... I can't do that.

228
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,093
I can'T.

229
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,518
I... I don't deserve to be free.

230
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,773
Why?

231
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,953
I lost my baby.

232
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,063
It's all my fault.

233
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:23,778
What do you mean? What happened?

234
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,458
They all died because of me.

235
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:28,820
Who?

236
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,113
Give up.

237
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,978
You won't find what
you're looking for.

238
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:34,608
And what am I looking for?

239
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:35,553
It doesn't matter.

240
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,518
Whatever it is, you won't find it.

241
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:38,773
That's my job.

242
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:43,460
I make sure what's
buried stays that way.

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,768
Oh, my god.

244
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,850
What are these?

245
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,217
These are teeth.

246
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,003
"Clay 48"?What does that mean?

247
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:08,868
I don't know, but whoever these belonged
to is going to have a hard time eating beef.

248
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,858
She said they all
died because of me.

249
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,050
Who?
- The ghost.

250
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,266
Gabriel's mother.

251
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,413
You think she... what?

252
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:15,528
She killed all these people?

253
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:16,493
I don't know.

254
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:19,890
But what does she have to
do with all these deaths?

255
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,823
You gave those things to find dad.

256
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:28,628
Is it just about dad, or are you
looking for someone else, too?

257
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:30,263
Like who?

258
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,003
I spoke to your mother's ghost.

259
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,668
She said,"they all
died because of me. "

260
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:35,443
What does it mean?

261
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,168
I don't know who you're talking
to, but that wasn't my mother.

262
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:38,763
How do you know?

263
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,698
To start with, my
mother's no ghost.

264
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:42,043
She's alive. And insane.

265
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:44,733
And living in some halfway
house in crested butte.

266
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:47,353
Well, then, who is the
ghost that you led me to?

267
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,543
I mean, I have followed all
the leads in the envelope,

268
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,663
and that's the only ghost
I can make contact with.

269
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:56,430
If there were any ghosts attached to dad's
stuff, it was something you did, not me.

270
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,678
So who's this ghost you met?

271
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:01,138
You know, I'll call you.

272
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:04,360
If I find anything.

273
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,618
Of course his mother
wasn't the ghost.

274
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,818
I could have told you that.

275
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:10,403
Then why didn't you?

276
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:13,628
Ok, technically, I could not have told
you that until about a minute or two ago,

277
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,263
but I would have told you.

278
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,838
See, I have a friend that
teaches forensic pathology,

279
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:18,173
and he's been looking
at these teeth.

280
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,603
Did you know that these
teeth are over 150 years old?

281
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:22,713
So then how are those teeth
connected to this ghost?

282
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,793
He's going to run some
tests on the smoke stains

283
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,803
and caraway seeds that are
stuck inside these teeth.

284
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:29,808
But I'm pretty sure the message
is going to remain clear.

285
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,783
Never underestimate
the power of floss.

286
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:35,428
So then the mystery is, is who is this
ghost, and why did she lead us to that box?

287
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,948
The real mystery is, who is this ghost,
and why did she lead us to that box?

288
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,635
That is what I just said.

289
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,253
Well, what did you mean?

290
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:45,678
I mean, are you suggesting that possibly
all these deaths happened somewhere else,

291
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,253
and that's why there's no recorded
history of them here in grandview?

292
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,338
No, because ghosts usually have some
sort of attachment to where they died,

293
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:55,158
which is weird, because these
ghosts seem to be stuck underground.

294
00:14:55,257 --> 00:15:00,350
Well, then, the real mystery
is, is, uh, is what you said.

295
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,840
What is it about this thing?

296
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,643
You remember it, don't you?

297
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:29,840
People did terrible
things to each other.

298
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,208
Do you remember your name?

299
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,023
He called me tessa once.

300
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:38,843
Tell me how all those people died.

301
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,588
You made it sound
like it was your fault.

302
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,413
I don't know anymore.

303
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:45,518
So many ghosts tell the story.

304
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,588
They each tell it differently.

305
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,150
What's your version?

306
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,716
I tried to warn them.

307
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,213
But they wouldn't listen.

308
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:55,348
What did you try
to warn them about?

309
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,123
I saw a ghost.

310
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,553
He was from weston.

311
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:02,448
I gave them the
warning that he gave me.

312
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:03,968
I don't understand.

313
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,983
Were you dead?

314
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,863
I was as alive as you.

315
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,878
So you saw ghosts
when you were alive?

316
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:16,058
Why are you so surprised?

317
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,233
You see me.

318
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:23,678
I guess maybe there were more of us
doing what we do than I ever knew.

319
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,870
Until they find out.

320
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,993
Then they kill us.

321
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:30,503
Is that why they killed you?

322
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,978
That doesn't matter anymore.

323
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,250
All that matters is...

324
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,888
Tessa, wait. Where are you going?

325
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,123
I... I can help you.

326
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:40,828
Find out what happened
to my baby, please.

327
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,548
That's all that matters.

328
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:45,050
Tessa, wait!

329
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,088
I thought you said you
were going to the archives?

330
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,453
I am.

331
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,053
This isn't the archives.

332
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,583
There's no dust, no cobwebs.

333
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,778
Tessa said that she was
warned by a ghost from weston.

334
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:57,098
These are the weston archives.

335
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,433
They're all online.

336
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:01,130
You're kidding me. Let me see.

337
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,090
And here come my search results.

338
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,273
Wait.

339
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:06,533
Listen to this.

340
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:10,818
"Rumors from grandview said residents
there became sick "with a strange fever.

341
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,618
"The unknown disease killed dozens,"but
not before making them insane.

342
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,050
The fever caused many to murder
their friends and family. "

343
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,433
"The worst rumor
told of a preacher "

344
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:27,420
who slaughtered his flock after
locking them up in his church. "

345
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,863
What church is that?

346
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:30,943
St. Agnes church on clay street.

347
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,638
Well, that's why the
box said "clay 48."

348
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:34,263
It was the name of the
street and the year.

349
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,518
Yeah, but the weird thing is I've never
heard of a st. Agnes church or a clay street.

350
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,323
That's what's weird to you?

351
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:40,008
The slaughtered flock... nothing?

352
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,223
All right, listen to this.

353
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,683
"Weston doctor eustace
green wrote in his diary

354
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:46,383
"that he treated patients with
symptoms "like those in grandview.

355
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,048
"He mentions a theory that it
might be linked "to tainted bread.

356
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:52,808
"No traces of the bread
survived to confirm his theory. "

357
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,528
Ergot poisoning. Of
course. That's it.

358
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:55,613
What's it?
- Ergot!

359
00:17:55,712 --> 00:18:00,158
It's a toxin that's found in a
fungus that grows on grain, even rye.

360
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,918
The symptoms are everything
they're explaining here.

361
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:02,983
Seizures, vomiting.

362
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,703
The psychosis. Even gangrene.

363
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:07,318
That explains why
they lost their minds.

364
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,863
I think I found the
ghost who warned tessa.

365
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:12,698
"Soon after writing this diary
entry,"dr. Greene died of exposure. "

366
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,738
He was traveling through a
blizzard towards grandview,

367
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:17,683
presumably to treat
victims there. "

368
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:21,570
Tessa said that she was
warned by a ghost from weston.

369
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,800
Hey.

370
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,483
my girl.

371
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,143
You look tired.

372
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,583
Delia doesn't come
for another hour.

373
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:34,598
You could take a nap
before dinner if you want.

374
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,543
If I lay down, I will
sleep until next thursday.

375
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:40,288
Any luck confirming some of that
stuff you found in the weston archive?

376
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,508
I spent all afternoon
there, and I finally found

377
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:45,173
one box of grandview papers from,

378
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:49,438
like,1848, and not one of them mentioned
the deaths from the weston records.

379
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:50,833
It's bizarre.

380
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,188
Did gabriel ever call me back?

381
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,555
No. Did you expect him to?

382
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,623
Then I asked delia to check
her real estate sources.

383
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,898
You know, hoping that maybe clay
street had been renamed or something.

384
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,903
Came up dry there, too.

385
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,408
You know, it's like the
whole thing was so shameful,

386
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:09,170
the town just decided to bury it.

387
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,803
Bury it?

388
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,223
What do you mean?

389
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:15,608
Well, you know.

390
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:16,473
Hide it.

391
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,420
Sweep it under the rug.
Put something heavy on it.

392
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,438
I wonder if that's why they're
all trapped underground?

393
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,658
It's maybe the why,
the who, or what?

394
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:26,723
No. Wait a minute.

395
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:27,848
Hey, delia's going
to be here at 8:00.

396
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:29,093
No, no, no. Just keep cooking.

397
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:30,663
Seriously. I'll be
back in. Like, an hour.

398
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:34,720
I just... I want to find
out what else they buried.

399
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,210
Hello?

400
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,050
Tessa, are you here?

401
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,520
St. Agnes church.

402
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,350
Clay street, it's underneath.

403
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,700
St. Agnes church, clay street.

404
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,580
Sorry, jim.

405
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,050
Oh, my god.

406
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,020
Clay street.

407
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,463
You startled me.

408
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:06,830
He surprised us, too.

409
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,920
"Us"?

410
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,958
You lived here once, didn't you?

411
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,313
And died here.

412
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:21,373
Is that why you're
all trapped underneath?

413
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:24,018
Because you died here,
and then you were buried?

414
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:27,648
They didn't like the
story our bones told,

415
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:31,260
so they pretended we never lived.

416
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,180
Built your town
right on top of ours.

417
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,360
If you hear anything from her,
please, give us a call, ok?

418
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,988
Mel!

419
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:45,908
Melinda!

420
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:46,683
Oh.

421
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:47,583
It's you.

422
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:49,118
Is it that painful to see me?

423
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,123
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

424
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:51,768
We just thought you
might be melinda.

425
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:52,903
Where is melinda actually?

426
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,998
Because some test results came
back, confirming a theory, we...

427
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,943
where is melinda?

428
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,898
Look, I don't know.
It could be nothing.

429
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,818
But she said she'd
be back in an hour.

430
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:02,473
When?

431
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:03,923
3 hours ago.

432
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:04,868
This isn't like her. Ok?

433
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:05,743
She doesn't disappear.

434
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:07,283
She doesn't leave
her cell phone off.

435
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,663
What was the last thing she said?

436
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,008
We were talking about the ghost.

437
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:11,163
Tessa.
- Right.

438
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:12,753
And I said, you
know, something about

439
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:15,638
how I felt like the whole town had
buried what had happened to her.

440
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:18,488
She pops up and says,"I'm going to
go find out what else they buried. "

441
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:21,240
The archives.

442
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,448
Tessa, I know that you
don't remember it well,

443
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:28,153
but I need you to try.

444
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:31,368
I need you to make peace with
what happened and then move on.

445
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,603
It won't work.

446
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:35,878
There's too many others who
won't ever make peace with me.

447
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:37,433
Ok, so talk to them.

448
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:38,618
We'll make them understand.

449
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:39,493
No.

450
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:40,503
I can'T.

451
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:41,443
Why not?

452
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,748
They're not out here.

453
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,115
They're in there.

454
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,280
Tessa, please tell me what
happened in that church.

455
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,223
Half the town was already sick.

456
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:02,128
Brother davis, he thought he was
locking them in to protect them

457
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:05,673
from the sickness and
everyone out here who had it.

458
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:09,918
But all they brought in to
feed them was water and bread.

459
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:14,283
Later, after they'd
all lost their minds,

460
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,968
brother davis decided he
needed to destroy the evil.

461
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,323
So he started the fire.

462
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,513
With everyone locked inside.

463
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:25,120
He killed them all... even himself.

464
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,110
So what happened to
you and your baby?

465
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,848
When I told them the fever
was coming before it came,

466
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:39,828
and that I'd heard the
news from a ghost...

467
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:43,058
what else could they think?

468
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:44,983
I must be a witch.

469
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,453
Yeah, but you knew it wasn't true.

470
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:49,298
All I know is they locked
me up in that church,

471
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:50,873
dragged me away from my baby,

472
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:54,230
said I could spend the rest of my
days with the ones I had killed.

473
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,990
No!

474
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,433
It wasn't your fault.

475
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,488
There was no magic that did this.

476
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,073
It was just a disease.

477
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:15,808
No, they... they've told me
again and again and again...

478
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:17,633
well, they were wrong.

479
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:21,238
You risked your life to give them
that warning, and you were right.

480
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:24,580
Weren't you?

481
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,988
I wish someone could tell them.

482
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,953
I will.

483
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,068
And you'll tell them with me.

484
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,123
No!

485
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:34,783
Wait, please! We can't!

486
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,960
You don't know what lives in there.

487
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,548
No, please! We can't go in!

488
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:41,913
We have to.

489
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,160
It's the only way
you can cross over.

490
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,320
Hey, you guys. Look at this.

491
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,938
That's melinda's handwriting.

492
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:05,543
What does this mean?"S. A"?

493
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:08,688
St. Agnes church. That's
what she was looking for.

494
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:11,168
It's a map. That's
town square, right?

495
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,535
Yeah.

496
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,190
Hey...

497
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,693
this is recent.

498
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,928
Who would move these bookcases?

499
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,710
Come on, give me a hand.

500
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,320
One of them must have
gone through here.

501
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,600
Damn it.

502
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,953
Damn it.

503
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:45,568
There's no way we
can go through there.

504
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,333
Oh, my god. Jim!

505
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,870
Wait, if melinda went in there...

506
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,758
No, she's alive.

507
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,573
I'd know.

508
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:57,983
What is youe emergency?

509
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:00,350
Yeah, I need driscoll
country rescue and recovery.

510
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,783
Yes. I'll hold.

511
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:04,873
Guys, it's melinda
we're talking about.

512
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:09,220
If she wasn't alive, she'd
find a way to tell us.

513
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,483
It won't work.

514
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,830
What's done can't be undone.

515
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,810
Why'd she do this to us?

516
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,983
They're both witches.

517
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,350
Witches did this to us.

518
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,480
Witches...

519
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,483
look, this is a map.

520
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,448
I think it shows the
way she was headed.

521
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:26,380
Sir, you want to find
your wife. I understand.

522
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,243
But I've been in the
tunnels a hundred times.

523
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:31,350
There are no branches
where this says there are.

524
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,478
This is going to sound a little
strange, ok, but these lines...

525
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,968
I don't think these are
tunnels that you've been in.

526
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:37,793
They're something else, ok?

527
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:41,258
They're what's leftover
of old roads, alleyways...

528
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,688
they're what's leftover of
another town, underground.

529
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,268
Another town underground?

530
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,558
Actually, this town.

531
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,153
The way it was.

532
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:50,383
About 200 years ago.

533
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,868
Actually, there's lots of cities that
have been built on top of entire towns.

534
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,365
I mean, edinburgh, scotland...

535
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:56,793
they covered the royal mile.

536
00:31:56,892 --> 00:32:00,348
Look, I'm sorry, but I've got to
go where I know the tunnels are.

537
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:01,760
Right.

538
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,127
Excuse me.

539
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,760
Wait a minute.

540
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,270
Come with me.

541
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,558
I know you're all angry.

542
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:27,620
I can feel that.

543
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:30,613
And I understand.

544
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:33,853
You died too soon and too horribly.

545
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,518
Your hearts tell you there
has to be a reason for that.

546
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,333
And there is.

547
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:40,858
But it's not what you think.

548
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:43,348
No evil killed you. Or witches.

549
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,538
It was just a disease.

550
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:46,675
What disease?

551
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:47,743
Think back.

552
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,868
The food brought into the
church... it was bread, wasn't it?

553
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,098
Bread that was made of rye.

554
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:54,428
How do you know that?

555
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,253
They found some.

556
00:32:56,352 --> 00:33:00,458
After you died. And
that bread carried...

557
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,003
a disease.

558
00:33:02,102 --> 00:33:05,248
And made people so ill
that they lost their minds.

559
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:08,440
Is it true?

560
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,398
A doctor was coming to warn
you, but he didn't make it.

561
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:15,298
So he asked tessa to
give you the message.

562
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,023
It couldn't be true. Could it?

563
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,618
That's the only reason
that she knew before you.

564
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,180
Could be true.

565
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,708
It could be true.

566
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:25,123
Lies.

567
00:33:25,222 --> 00:33:27,328
Lies from another witch.

568
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:30,660
It's him.

569
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,363
Melinda, go!

570
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:35,818
What about the other
ghosts? They need help, too.

571
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,388
You're not powerful enough. Run!

572
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:41,430
Powerful...

573
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,920
finally.

574
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,918
my fault, it was my fault.

575
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,285
Help!

576
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,308
Don't waste your breath.

577
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,243
You'll need it.

578
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:32,908
You're not the first to come
down here and look for us.

579
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:35,258
Others have come and
been trapped, too.

580
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,533
I... I've watched them panic.

581
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:40,198
Help comes, but they don't
last until it gets there.

582
00:34:40,297 --> 00:34:42,908
Is help coming for me?

583
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,550
Yes.

584
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,380
But it's too far away.

585
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,163
Ok.

586
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:59,100
Tessa, I have to cross
you over into the light.

587
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,178
I told you...

588
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,653
I can'T.

589
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,428
What's done can't be undone.

590
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,168
Yeah, but you didn't do anything.

591
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:07,913
Yes, I did.

592
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:10,653
I abandoned my baby.

593
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:14,788
If I hadn't carried that message,
I never would have lost her.

594
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,520
It's all my fault
she was left alone.

595
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,053
You can't keep blaming yourself.

596
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:24,553
You were just trying to save lives.

597
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:27,768
That's a subject you
know something about.

598
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:30,590
Don't you, melinda?

599
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,590
Dad?

600
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,563
Ok, if this is city hall,
and that's the old theater,

601
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:50,550
then the closest building to the
alley that fed into church street is...

602
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,603
right there.

603
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,103
What a coincidence.

604
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:57,618
I don't know about you, but I'm beginning
to think that there's no such thing.

605
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,673
How did find me?

606
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,188
Where have you been? Did you die?

607
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:02,613
I don't understand.

608
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:03,703
Melinda, there's no time.

609
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:07,093
I can't be here for
long, and neither can you.

610
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:10,448
I can't believe I let
myself walk into this.

611
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,108
I... everybody told
me to stay away.

612
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,958
You didn't walk into anything.

613
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:15,650
You were led here.

614
00:36:15,749 --> 00:36:17,308
By who? Gabriel?

615
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,975
By me.

616
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,573
Why?

617
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,303
Did you want me to die?

618
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:24,193
You needed to know the truth.

619
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,013
Why couldn't you just tell me?

620
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:29,158
Would you have believed
any of this if I'd told you?

621
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:30,860
Would you believe anything I sd?

622
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,528
Ai I don't know if believe you now.

623
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:35,223
I mean, what's going on?

624
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:37,448
What is it that I need to know?

625
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:38,423
Everything.

626
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:41,018
The truth about
grandview, why you're here,

627
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,373
the dangers you're facing,

628
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:46,368
but also, the power that you
have and what you can do with it.

629
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:49,380
Open your locket.

630
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,993
My baby.

631
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,503
I don't know what
your mother told you,

632
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:04,178
but the real reason
why we split was... you.

633
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:06,265
It was nothing you did.

634
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,283
It's what you could do.

635
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:12,448
I wanted you to revel in
your gift, not hide it.

636
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:13,663
I don't understand.

637
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:16,558
The locket is not from my side of
the family. It's from your mother'S.

638
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,010
She wanted to bury
that part of your past,

639
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:21,428
so she packed up the
photos and the keepsakes,

640
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:22,980
and she threw them away.

641
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,463
I found them and saved them.

642
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:27,758
How do I know that
any of this is true?

643
00:37:27,857 --> 00:37:31,020
Tell melinda your baby's name.

644
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,400
Julia lee lucas.

645
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,640
Wait. I know that name.

646
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,530
That's my great-great
grandmother's name.

647
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,743
Your daughter...

648
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:51,218
is my grandmother's grandmother?

649
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:53,678
You're descended...

650
00:37:53,777 --> 00:37:57,230
from me?

651
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,043
You see?

652
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:03,003
Your baby was ok.

653
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:07,018
I know because otherwise,
I wouldn't have this...

654
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:10,240
beautiful daughter.

655
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,643
I'm sorry. I'd like...

656
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:18,378
to stay and help you
if I could, but...

657
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:19,343
I have to leave now.

658
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:20,758
But I have so many questions.

659
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:21,583
I know.

660
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:23,318
I'll come back and find you.

661
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,685
Soon.

662
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,253
Jim, have some water.

663
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:37,898
You haven't taken a
break in over an hour.

664
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:40,988
No. I'm almost
through. I can feel it.

665
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:42,925
Thank you. Is there any ice?

666
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,930
This is room temperature.

667
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,743
Damn it!

668
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,428
She was right. It's just
like on melinda's map.

669
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,548
There's some kind
of tunnel in here.

670
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,443
Come on. Back up. Look out.

671
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:55,188
I'm going to make this
big enough to get through.

672
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,095
The air's getting thin.

673
00:38:57,194 --> 00:38:58,933
Your friends are close.

674
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:01,588
But they won't know where to
look if you don't make noise.

675
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:02,763
Noise?

676
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,023
Use your voice.

677
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,218
You have to call out now.

678
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:07,100
Quickly!

679
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,226
Hello?

680
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:09,283
Louder!

681
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:11,168
They won't hear you like that.

682
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,003
I can'T.

683
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:15,068
There's no air. I just...

684
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,480
can'T.

685
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,113
Which way should we go?

686
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:26,878
We're already way past where
the church is supposed to be.

687
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,343
You have to try.

688
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:33,380
I can't lose my baby again.

689
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,733
Your baby?

690
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:42,298
Don't you see?

691
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:45,250
You came for me.

692
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,200
You have to live.

693
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,973
Hello?

694
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:53,548
Can you hear me?

695
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:55,940
That's good.

696
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,330
Now louder.

697
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,340
Hello?

698
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,723
Did you feel that breeze? That way.

699
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:10,248
I can't believe I'm about to
say this, but I feel something.

700
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:11,843
Ok. It's not possible. I...

701
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,493
look, no, hey.
Maybe it is possible.

702
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:15,108
Maybe it's that ghost.
Her name is tessa.

703
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,740
Melinda's that way.

704
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,148
guys, I think we
should go that way.

705
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:21,338
Wait, wait. I hear something.

706
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:22,163
Down here!

707
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:23,428
Can you hear that?

708
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:26,253
Hello?

709
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:28,203
I'm in here!

710
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,680
That's melinda. Come on. Come on.

711
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,573
I'm down here!

712
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:39,640
Move back. They're almost here.

713
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,853
Mel!

714
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:44,220
Jim!

715
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,930
I'm coming. almost there

716
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,318
It's ok. Come here.

717
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,685
That's ok.

718
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,710
You know you're 12 hours late
for dinner. That is so not ok.

719
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,900
I... I am so sorry.

720
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,390
I am so sorry.

721
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,100
As long as you're ok,
babe, nothing else matters.

722
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,948
Your town is so beautiful.

723
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:48,483
It's your town, too.

724
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:51,478
I'm glad I was the one
that got to show it to you.

725
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:54,138
I wish the other spirits
beneath could see.

726
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:56,243
They will.

727
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:59,360
I'll find a way.

728
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,293
There it is.

729
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:06,378
Hey, it's so bright.

730
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,745
So beautiful.

731
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,860
I... I didn't think I'd ever...
- you deserve it.

732
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,428
Especially for what
you've done for me.

733
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:18,265
And for this town.

734
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:21,100
It's what we do.

735
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,328
Yeah, I guess that's true.

736
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,323
You and I, we...

737
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:30,028
we've seen so many people
go into the light, but...

738
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:32,988
until the end, we
never see it ourselves.

739
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,853
That's ok.

740
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,220
I think I'll wait.

741
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,263
That's right.

742
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:40,983
You wait.

743
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:45,330
Wait a long, long time.

744
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,720
Be careful, melinda.

745
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,090
I will.

746
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,398
next time I tell you to
help me with your sister...

747
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,968
try not to kill her instead?

748
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,760
So you saw her?

749
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,370
Can't keep this up for much longer.

750
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,543
I won't have to.

751
00:43:33,642 --> 00:43:35,403
It's already in motion.

752
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:36,863
Soon she'll be with us.

753
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:38,228
And what if she won't?

754
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:39,523
She's a smart girl.

755
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:42,493
She'll make the right choice.

756
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:45,460
Because if she doesn't...
