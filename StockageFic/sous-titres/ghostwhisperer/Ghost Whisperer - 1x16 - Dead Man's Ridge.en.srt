00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:08,730
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,701
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,931
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:15,747
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:21,055
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,661
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

8
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:25,710
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

9
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,535
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

10
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:29,543
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:33,075
<i>because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.</i>

12
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:35,816
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

13
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:37,566
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

14
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,582
It's Andrea.

15
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,680
Melinda, hi. Um...

16
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,252
look, I'm

17
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:41,161
sorry to call you this late, but there is something very wrong over here.

18
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:42,143
What?

19
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,833
Some very weird stuff, and-and

20
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,552
I wouldn't have bothered you if I could have figured it out myself.

21
00:02:58,526 --> 00:02:59,310
I heard that.

22
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,210
Hello?

23
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,120
Hello?

00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:34,002

25
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,400
I don't see anybody here.

26
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:39,650
Well, something was here, trust me.

27
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,131
Tell me everything you did tonight.

28
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:42,863
All right.

29
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,122
After we closed, I exercised for an hour and a half,

30
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,620
ate a salad, and read the new Stephen Hawking book until I fell asleep.

31
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:51,680
Fine, ate a pint of cherry garcia and watched survivor.

32
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:54,072
Aha. Maybe you're being haunted by your conscience.

33
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,700
Seriously, Melinda,

34
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,561
this thing scared the hell out of me.

35
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,023
You're used to this stuff, but I am not.

36
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:02,361
Did anybody else in the building feel anything?

37
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:03,953
Not that I've heard.

38
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,460
Has anything weird ever happened here before even though it didn't

39
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:08,790
feel like it at the time?

40
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,072
The water takes five minutes to get hot. Does that count?

41
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,811
Five minutes? You are so lucky.

42
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,533
Well, is there any chance this could be just like a random thing, like a...

43
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:19,812
like a drive-by haunting?

44
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:21,963
No. These things are almost never random.

45
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,000
Unless this place wasn't haunted to begin with,

46
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,921
it probably means that you brought something home with you somehow.

47
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,060
Great.

48
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:27,963
A take-out ghost.

49
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,062
Don't worry.

50
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,190
We'll get through this.

51
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:32,961
Do you have any more ice cream?

52
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:44,902
Hey.

53
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:45,761
How you doing?

54
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,663
Tired?

55
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:47,801
No, not really.

56
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:48,912
I'm, just...

57
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,003
I have this kind of sense of dread.

58
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:53,683
You know, like someone's watching me.

59
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,180
Then it goes away and I feel fine.

60
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:57,470
I'm kinda freaked out.

61
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,040
Don't worry, okay?

62
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:01,940
Okay. Thanks.

63
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,313
Are you all right?

64
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,043
Are you okay?

65
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,991
It was such a quick look. You know, he was...

66
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,140
He was tall.

67
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:36,450
Brown hair, early thirties, scratches all over his face. He was moving backwards,

68
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,901
like he was being sucked away. And he was shouting.

69
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:41,551
None of this means anything to me.

70
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,292
He saw me.

71
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,192
He knows that I can see him.

72
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,040
Good.

73
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,923
Maybe now he'll figure out it's you he's supposed to be haunting.

74
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,430
Thanks. But I don't think so. He seemed pretty focused on you.

75
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:51,130
What do you mean, focused?

76
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:55,002
You know, maybe you should come and stay with Jim and I tonight.

77
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,650
Is he gonna hurt me?

78
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:58,870
No.

79
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,450
I didn't see anything like that. It was more like...

80
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,482
desperation, fear, like he was confused.

81
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,573
Things to look forward to when you're dead.

82
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:06,933
Come on.

83
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,043
Just stay with us. We'll watch a movie or something. It'll be fun.

84
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,341
No. Not a chance.

85
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,412
I  am not gonna be chased out of my own home,

86
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,152
small and drafty though it may be.

87
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:15,662
I am woman.

88
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:16,642
Hear me roar.

89
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,513
You know, I've heard you scream, and it is not inspiring.

90
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,100
Thanks a lot.

91
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,323
Nevertheless, I'm staying put.

92
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:25,171
But promise me you'll call me if anything happens.

93
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,652
Do not show him that you're afraid.

94
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:29,122
It makes him stronger.

95
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:30,420
Okay.

96
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:31,703
I'll be fine, all right?

97
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:33,331
See you in the morning.

98
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,251
- I'll sleep with the phone by my pillow.
- Okay.

99
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:36,630
'Night.

100
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,202
All right. Bye.

101
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,110
I am not afraid of you.

102
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,032
Do you hear me?

103
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,030
So just--

104
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:14,793
just get out of here and leave me alone!

105
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:32,152
I am never,

106
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:33,052
ever

107
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,493
setting foot in that place again.

108
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:36,681
Hey, you're good to stay here as long as you want.

109
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,053
You hungry? You want some food?

110
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:40,463
No.

111
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,373
Thanks, Jim.

112
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:43,950
What are we gonna do?

113
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:45,580
Why is this...

114
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,023
whatever it is, after me?

115
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,131
I need to be with you when the spirit comes again,

116
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:51,713
see if I can

117
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:52,880
figure out what he wants.

118
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,420
Well, if he's after my last pint of cherry garcia, he can

119
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:56,792
pry it out of my cold, dead fingers.

120
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,860
Hey, Andrea, it's okay to be scared. You don't have to make jokes.

121
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,132
Who's joking?

122
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,300
He's here.

123
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,781
- He fell down.
- Who fell?

124
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:24,670
Andrea.

125
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:37,633
He's  gone.

126
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:39,610
He definitely knows you.

127
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,420
I got a better look at him this time.

128
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,242
Oh, this is right after college, we took a train trip to Europe.

129
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:56,490
No ghost boy in here.

130
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:57,663
Yeah.

131
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,691
Well, that takes us through the 90's.

132
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,683
- I liked your hair in college.
- Right.

133
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,741
I'd rather be chased by the haunted hiking boots than look like that again.

134
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:04,932
Blech.

135
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:07,803
Oh.

136
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:08,922
That's when I was at the D.A.'s office.

137
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,271
You never talk about that.

138
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,381
You know, it seems like two lifetimes ago.

139
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:15,073
I don't even really remember who I was back then.

140
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,852
Were you happy?

141
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,131
I don't know.

142
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean, I thought I had everything I wanted, but

143
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:21,863
there was always something missing.

144
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:23,775
I could never quite put my finger on it.

145
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:25,926
Well,

146
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,516
it looks like the search for it's been fun.

147
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:29,962
Ah, but the search is not over, my friend.

148
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,471
Oh! That's him! There he is.

149
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,893
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Totally.

150
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,261
God, that's Dennis.

151
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:36,930
Dennis McMartin.

152
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,722
I can't believe it. That guy was only in the office a couple months.

153
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,092
What do you remember about him?

154
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,182
U h...

155
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,083
god, he was, uh,

156
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,623
kinda quiet, you know?

157
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:45,932
Shy.

158
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:47,520
Cute.

159
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:51,182
Um, he quit to take a trip around the world.

160
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,552
We had so many conversations about that.

161
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,191
He was gonna give up the whole suit-and-tie thing and...

162
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:58,331
god.

163
00:09:58,707 --> 00:09:59,602
Now he's dead?

164
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,161
Do you remember where he lived?

165
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:05,511
Uh, Manhattan, but that was a few years ago.

166
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,080
I don't-- I don't understand.

167
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,563
I mean, why is this guy haunting me? I never did anything to him.

168
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,381
Well, he's obviously trying to reach you for some reason.

169
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:17,302
Let's find out why.

170
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,221
You guys are too good to me.

171
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:22,953
That's what couches are for.

172
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,252
Is there gonna be a chocolate on my pillow?

173
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:26,973
Not unless the cat throws it up.

174
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,741
Listen, if anything happens, you just yell.

175
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,451
You might want to sleep with the light on.

176
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:33,772
Are you kidding me?

177
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,271
I'd arrange stadium lighting if I could.

178
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,731
I am woman, hear me roar.

179
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,920
Hey, I'll make the jokes, thank you very much.

180
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,072
Melinda.

181
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:45,820
I don't know what I would do if I didn't know you.

182
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:48,011
I can't imagine going through this alone.

183
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,191
Hey.

184
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:50,342
Don't even think about it.

185
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:53,753
We're gonna get through this.

186
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,473
You know, there's plenty of room here on the floor if you guys wanna crash

187
00:10:58,597 --> 00:10:59,500
down here with me and--

188
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:00,943
No?

189
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:03,500
'Night.

190
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,103
She's really shaken up.

191
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah. I just feel so bad for her, you know? She's never been

192
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:18,192
targeted like this by a spirit.

193
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,270
Yeah, not like us old pros.

194
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:21,871
Pros, maybe. Old?

195
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,130
Never.

196
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,381
Do you think that we've done enough?

197
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,183
What about?

198
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:30,111
You know, in life...

199
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,830
so far. Do you feel like we've...

200
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:33,570
done enough?

201
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:34,512
Ask me in 40 years.

202
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,752
Well, if I can still hear you then.

203
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,361
I was just

204
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,181
looking through Andrea's photo albums today, and she's just

205
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:44,693
done everything.

206
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:47,880
You know, traveled the world, had

207
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,023
an important job in the big city. She's interested in everything.

208
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,093
And yet she is now sleeping peacefully

209
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,072
- on our living room couch.
- Yeah.

210
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,682
All roads lead to Grandview.

211
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,510
That was good.

212
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,141
Well, you can't compare her life

213
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,171
to ours anyway.

214
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:06,813
Who  knows where you're gonna be in five years.

215
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,361
Yeah.

216
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:09,852
I wonder sometimes.

217
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:12,962
I just--

218
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:13,840
I don't know--

219
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:14,741
feel a little trapped.

220
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,100
No...

221
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,001
of course not.

222
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:22,061
I mean by what I can do.

223
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,301
It just feels like nothing's ever gonna be...

224
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,382
any different no matter where we are or what we do.

225
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:32,930
I think you're right.

226
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,403
I don't think it's gonna be any different.

227
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:38,813
It's gonna be you and me...

228
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:40,693
in love.

229
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:42,302
Grandview or Egypt.

230
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,762
And I can't think of a bigger life than that.

231
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,361
- Melinda.
- Don't be afraid.

232
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:23,122
I'm

233
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,433
not

234
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:25,473
dead.

235
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,060
Honey,

236
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:29,293
what's up?

237
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,260
Why would a ghost say he's not dead?

238
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:42,772
Sometimes they don't know.

239
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:44,460
They can't believe it they're

240
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:45,972
in denial so they don't cross over.

241
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,670
But he must have died pretty recently, right?

242
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:50,371
I can't tell yet.

243
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:51,610
Okay, so this is a home number,

244
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,990
phone in the city, and an emergency contact, brother Charles.

245
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,060
Works at a gas station over 59.

246
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,440
All  right, guys, I'm gonna start calling the morgues.

247
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,622
That number's been disconnected. I'm gonna try to track down the brother.

248
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:05,282
I'll see if I can find another family member.

249
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:06,901
And, uh,

250
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,583
which of us is actually gonna be making a living today?

251
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:09,820
- Yeah.
- Okay.

252
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,293
Hi.

253
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,040
God. I am...

254
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,702
I am so sorry. I...

255
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,652
oh, yeah, that's okay. I'm knocking things over all the time.

256
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,560
Can you tell me if a Charlie McMartin works here?

257
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:51,052
You're looking for Charlie?

258
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,363
Yeah...

259
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:53,220
kind of.

260
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,291
Well, you shoulda called 'cause Charlie doesn't work here anymore.

261
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:59,150
I tried his place and just got his machine, and no one answered here.

262
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:00,470
It gets busy sometimes.

263
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:03,161
Look, I really need to see him. Do you know where he is?

264
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:04,473
What for?

265
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,490
- Do you know Charlie well?
- Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

266
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:09,221
Oh. Uh,

267
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:10,491
that's great.

268
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,101
I'm an old friend of his brother

269
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,340
Dennis.

270
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:14,300
Oh. Right.

271
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,102
Good. I thought you're probably too tall for Charlie.

272
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:20,851
Andrea Moreno.

273
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:21,823
Libby Grant.

274
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:23,201
Got a customer. Excuse me.

275
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:27,012
Libby, do you know where either of them are?

276
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,072
The thing is, Charlie's not really my boyfriend.

277
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:32,181
I figured if I kept saying it, it might come true, but he quit a couple weeks ago.

278
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,271
- 10 bucks and a quart of 40-weight.
- Sure.

279
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:36,573
- Do you know why?
- Uh, not really.

280
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,291
About the time his brother came in to see him.

281
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,172
- Dennis?
- Yeah.

282
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:41,340
Here you go.

283
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:42,822
Charlie hadn't seen him in a long time.

284
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:44,541
Didn't seem like they liked each other very much.

285
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:47,610
Dennis wanted him to go on some trip, some guy thing.

286
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:48,952
Did he go?

287
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:50,492
You ask a lot of questions.

288
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,801
I'm not trying to put you on the spot here,

289
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,972
but no one's heard from Dennis in a really long time.

290
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:59,410
I have a feeling that things may not be very good for him right now.

291
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,333
I don't know if Charlie went.

292
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:03,841
I haven't talked to him since he quit.

293
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,101
I've left messages.

294
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,250
When was that?

295
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,092
A week and a half, two weeks ago.

296
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:09,991
Is there any other family?

297
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,453
Charlie takes care of his father, but he doesn't talk about those kinda things.

298
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,391
He's a hard guy to get to know, believe me, I've been trying.

299
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you spoken to the father?

300
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:20,280
I drove by the house once, but no one came to the door.

301
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,140
I'm sorry, but I really should--

302
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:23,692
I'm sorry. Look, um...

303
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,812
here's my cell.

304
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,262
Please get in touch with me if you hear from Charlie.

305
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:28,960
- Sure.
- Thanks.

306
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,162
Is it a bible passage?

307
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:03,593
Not from any bible I've ever heard.

308
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,190
That is so weird. I ran every database on Dennis. It's like he was a phantom.

309
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,122
The parents?

310
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,231
Libby said she thought Charlie was taking care of his father.

311
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,611
Came up with tons of listings of people with the same last name.

312
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:14,981
No luck.

313
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,091
So Dennis leaves his job, drops everything,

314
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,621
starts a new life, and leaves no trace of himself?

315
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,100
We know he went to see his brother,

316
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,831
and we know they went somewhere together.

317
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,523
St. John.

318
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,202
Do you remember him being religious?

319
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:28,582
Not really.

320
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:31,380
I do remember him volunteering at a hospital and

321
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,491
doing some pro bono work at a senior center.

322
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:34,751
Wait a minute.

323
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,850
Maybe it's a hospital. There's a St. Johns hospital over in Bay Ridge.

324
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,330
Yeah, but he's dead.

325
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:42,102
Maybe he's in the morgue.

326
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,451
Family doesn't know that he's dead, his body's unclaimed.

327
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,691
What do the numbers mean then?

328
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,962
Could be numbers they use to I.D. dead bodies.

329
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:50,880
Oh, god.

330
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,053
Do we really have to do this?

331
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:52,981
No.

332
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:53,833
We could just let him

333
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:54,893
haunt you for the rest of your life.

334
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,373
I'm sorry. We just can't give out names.

335
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:08,481
No, I understand. My husband's a paramedic. I just thought maybe you could tell us

336
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,173
if there were any unidentified or unclaimed bodies in your morgue.

337
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,071
I don't know.

338
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,301
We're looking for a friend of mine.

339
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:15,590
It's really important.

340
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,101
- You can see me.
- Not now. Sorry.

341
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:19,712
But nobody'll tell me what happened.

342
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:21,913
Please.

343
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,333
You know I hate coming to hospitals.

344
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,302
Nothing's coming up. I'm sorry.

345
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:29,000
Uh, will this help? It's like an I.D. number.

346
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:30,800
This is a unit number.

347
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:32,250
Three west, 28-B.

348
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:33,502
That's intensive care.

349
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,772
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

350
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:01,503
His name is Dennis McMartin.

351
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:02,790
I used to work with him.

352
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,202
Family? Relatives?

353
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:06,393
He has a brother, but we haven't been able to find him.

354
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,721
No one missed him?

355
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,231
We did.

356
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:14,100
Couple of park rangers brought him in. He was found by a hiker up on Saddle Mountain.

357
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:17,902
Looks like he fell a good distance. Head trauma, at least some brain damage.

358
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:22,420
And from the looks of his clothes and the abrasions on his knees and elbows,

359
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:26,622
he crawled a long way before he passed out. No I.D. No backpack.

360
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,620
We took him in as a John Doe.

361
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,543
Did you have to resuscitate him at any point?

362
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,333
Why do you ask?

363
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,542
I was just wondering how close he came to dying.

364
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,170
As a matter of fact he did die.

365
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,290
Several times, total flatline. But we brought him back with the paddles.

366
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,542
And there was nobody else found with him?

367
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,762
Nope. Just like he dropped in from the sky.

368
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,472
Who else should we notify?

369
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:46,922
We're still looking for his family.

370
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,881
We need to stick close by in case he flatlines again.

371
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:58,673
Dennis has been coming to us when he dies, then going away when they bring him back?

372
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,332
This is a first for me too. I'm gonna call Jim and get a search going.

373
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:09,020
Your guy didn't register with the station,

374
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:11,971
which is something all climbers are required to do.

375
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:13,382
Maybe he didn't know that.

376
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:17,080
What your guy probably did was climb dead man's ridge, which is a no-no.

377
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,671
We have people getting hurt and killed up there all the time.

378
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,892
Not supposed to be on that side of the mountain.

379
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,080
- You started a search yet?
- Search for what?

380
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:26,231
For who?

381
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,690
We think his brother might have been with him.

382
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,332
Nobody's told me anything about that.

383
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:30,901
I'm telling you now.

384
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:32,262
You sure? You got proof?

385
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:36,262
I can't go calling search-and-rescue out on a wild goose chase.

386
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:39,223
I  need to know for sure if somebody's up there and really needs help.

387
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,602
I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job.

388
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:44,770
I'm just asking you.

389
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,621
Trust me. I'm sure the guy's brother is up there.

390
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:53,891
What if it was your brother,

391
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,443
your son?

392
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,413
One of my guys found this up near the ridge.

393
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,381
It was going to lost and found.

394
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:19,003
That's him. That's his brother. He is here.

395
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,203
This is ranger Neher.

396
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:26,801
We're gonna need a chopper.

397
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,023
Copy that, we will be airbone in about 10 minutes.

398
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,180
You're right Mel, he's here.

399
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,722
They're putting a search party together.

400
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:36,431
Thanks. Jim, that's great. I'll see you at home.

401
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:38,060
-Okay.
- Drive safe. Bye.

402
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:42,991
Hey.

403
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,162
How you doing?

404
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,530
How's Dennis?

405
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:48,493
I just came from there.

406
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,260
No change.

407
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:51,922
Do you think he's gonna make it?

408
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,561
I like to have hope.

409
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:56,662
You know, you seem like a really nice person.

410
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,190
Thanks. So do you.

411
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:02,020
I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you're also

412
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,073
incredibly beautiful.

413
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,170
Are you flirting with me?

414
00:22:08,886 --> 00:22:09,782
Yes.

415
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,400
Would that just be totally inappropriate?

416
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,582
-In every way possible.
- Ah.

417
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:17,311
Okay.

418
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:20,442
Hey.

419
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:22,483
What'd I miss?

420
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,000
<i>Code blue. 3 west. Dr. Peltier.</i>

421
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,192
<i>Code blue. 3 west.</i>

422
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:38,291
- Tell them to stop.
- Where's your brother?

423
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:39,482
He's up on the ridge.

424
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:42,570
They'll never know where to look.

425
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:43,452
Is he alive?

426
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,381
I left him alive.

427
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:45,820
I have to show you.

428
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:46,333
Tell me.

429
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,233
I can't I have to--

430
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,250
Don't let them bring me back.

431
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,592
Tell them to let me go.

432
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:56,850
- I can't do that.
- Please, my brother will die!

433
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:58,421
Clear!

434
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:03,312
Don't let them bring me back. I'm broken. I can't help in that body.

435
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:04,530
Clear!

436
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:14,641
What is going on?

437
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:18,641
He wants to die.

438
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,922
You want me to delay resuscitating my patients so you can talk to his

439
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:29,002
spirit guide or whatever that is?

440
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,893
I'm not sure if that's what I'm asking. I'm just trying to talk to you about this.

441
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:33,052
You want me to risk his life!

442
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm asking for a matter of seconds to save someone else's life.

443
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:38,062
No. Anything else?

444
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,032
Doctor,

445
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:40,803
I know how this sounds, but Melinda's telling the truth.

446
00:23:41,427 --> 00:23:44,313
Dennis's brother is still on that mountain. The park rangers found his backpack.

447
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:48,581
I think the park rangers are better equipped to find him than my comatose patient is.

448
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,100
Make fun of me if you want.

449
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,952
I know you're doing all you can do to help Dennis, and I respect that.

450
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,382
All I'm asking for is a chance to do the same.

451
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:58,262
This is not a magic show, miss Gordon.

452
00:23:58,697 --> 00:23:59,593
There are protocols.

453
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:02,962
There are strict medical procedures that have to be followed.

454
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,422
It's very cut and dried and clear.

455
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:08,860
There is nothing cut and dried or clear about my world or yours.

456
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:09,963
You just don't get it.

457
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,312
Why don't we just take a breath for a minute, okay?

458
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:14,930
I've got work to do.

459
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:22,063
He's really not a bad guy. He's just always been this way.

460
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:24,160
If he doesn't see it,

461
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,572
then he doesn't believe it.

462
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:29,721
That was Libby.

463
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,050
- She needs to see me.
- Okay.

464
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,313
I found this last night. I woulda called you, but it was pretty late.

465
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:40,580
This is Charlie's handwriting.

466
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:43,860
Oh, my god.

467
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,512
They were both up there with him.

468
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,183
Look,

469
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,341
did Charlie ever talk about his dad?

470
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:49,893
He mentioned him once.

471
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,452
When?

472
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:52,480
The night he quit.

473
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:55,942
<i>Charlie was talking about his brother and how much he resented him.</i>

474
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:57,802
<i>Said he left him holding the bag.</i>

475
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,902
<i>Charlie and Dennis were supposed to take turns going to college.</i>

476
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:03,660
<i>Dennis was supposed to get his degree and then come back</i>

477
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:05,853
<i>and take over his dad's print shop so that Charlie could go.</i>

478
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:09,591
But Dennis didn't come back.

479
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:11,671
He came to work in New York,

480
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:13,012
which is where I met him.

481
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,073
Charlie had to try to run the business by himself,

482
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:16,692
then he lost it.

483
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,121
He tried to go to college,

484
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:19,383
his father got sick.

485
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:21,873
So he had to take dead-end jobs like this one.

486
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:23,353
Guess he blamed Dennis.

487
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:28,903
He just, uh...

488
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:31,042
he just looked so sad.

489
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:33,833
I thought that maybe I could

490
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:36,941
make him a little happier if he ever gave me the chance.

491
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:42,731
Libby, we...

492
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:43,823
we found Charlie's brother.

493
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:46,562
He's in the hospital.

494
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,943
He's in a coma.

495
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,171
What about Charlie?

496
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:51,223
We don't know.

497
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:51,953
He

498
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,753
could be hurt, or his father could be hurt.

499
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,770
One of them would have had to stay behind.

500
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,952
Look, I-- I have to get back to the hospital. But

501
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,881
- thank you so much for this.
- No, wait.

502
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,041
I have to do something. Just tell me how I can help.

503
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:07,203
I promise as soon as I know anything,

504
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:09,002
I'll call you, okay?

505
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:20,460
I think they found the money in his right-hand pocket and the keys were in his left.

506
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:24,552
You really look stressed.

507
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,580
Andrea,

508
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:29,920
you can't neglect your own health.

509
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:32,192
Why don't we do a quick exam

510
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:34,820
while you're here. If you'd just remove your top...

511
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,353
Will you get lost?

512
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,391
Where's your sense of humor?

513
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,561
I could never get away with this stuff when I was alive.

514
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,190
- It's not like she can hear me.
- Go away.

515
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:45,482
Who are you talking to?

516
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:46,912
Never mind.

517
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,441
Even ghosts can act like eighth-graders.

518
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:50,723
What's up?

519
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,211
Stuff they found in Dennis's pockets.

520
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,323
Dr. Peltier gave it to me to look through.

521
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:55,812
I gave this to him.

522
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:58,882
<i>I threw him a going-away party.</i>

523
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:02,152
<i>We didn't know him very well, but we felt like we should do something.</i>

524
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:05,601
<i>I cannot believe he'd still have that.</i>

525
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:08,222
God, you know, I really envy you,

526
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:09,961
traveling around the world.

527
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:12,292
Everyone says you've already been around the world.

528
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:13,631
You know, it's like, uh...

529
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:17,021
it's like when you know someone is about to watch a great movie they haven't seen before

530
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:21,670
and you're almost more excited that they are about what's gonna happen next, you know.

531
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,391
I think this guy had a thing for you.

532
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,363
Dennis.

533
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:35,571
Dennis, can you hear me?

534
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:39,712
We know your dad is up there with Charlie.

535
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:43,070
We're gonna find them, okay?

536
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,173
I had the biggest crush on you back then.

537
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:55,812
You didn't know that, did you?

538
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,072
You were so mysterious...

539
00:28:02,188 --> 00:28:03,080
and quiet...

540
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:06,151
and smart.

541
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,241
I was so lost.

542
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,683
I-I couldn't show it to anyone.

543
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:20,193
And I could see that you were lost too.

544
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,211
But the difference between us was that...

545
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,450
you had the guts to do something about it.

546
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,282
You saw that it was time to move on and you...

547
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,083
and you changed your life.

548
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:39,761
And it made me see that...

549
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,212
that I had been standing still.

550
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:47,300
You gave me the courage...

551
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:49,990
to go forward again.

552
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,613
So thanks for that, Dennis.

553
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:11,733
For what you did for me...

554
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:14,322
without even knowing it.

555
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:17,843
Hey.

556
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:20,341
Look.

557
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:27,461
Dr. Peltier.

558
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:30,713
-What?
- Uh...

559
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:31,873
Um, he was crying.

560
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:39,743
Now, that is just an accumulation of fluid. It doesn't mean he's responding to you.

561
00:29:40,116 --> 00:29:41,500
How do you know he's not feeling something?

562
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:42,941
I don't know, miss Gordon.

563
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:46,820
All I have is my medical training and 15 years of experience, but

564
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:49,050
I know that's no match for the things you know.

565
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:50,792
Not an exact match, no.

566
00:29:58,585 --> 00:29:59,482
Code blue!

567
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:01,311
Get them outta here.

568
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:18,691
And clear!

569
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:25,381
Freeze me up. Let's go again.

570
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:29,291
And clear!

571
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:33,652
Dennis?

572
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:40,682
Dennis, don't do this!

573
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,850
Call it.

574
00:31:12,728 --> 00:31:13,623
We lost him.

575
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:25,831
We have to find my family.

576
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,310
Hey look, we're gonna be there now in half an hour.

577
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:35,063
And you might have a lead on the location, right?

578
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:40,890
You okay?

579
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:43,521
I will be.

580
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,993
Is he here?

581
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:49,200
Ask him, why'd he come to me?

582
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,083
It... it took a while.

583
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,022
A while for me to know what was happening.

584
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:57,183
I had the feeling of waking up...

585
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,052
<i>I was looking down on someone.</i>

586
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:03,401
<i>I was watching 'em work on me and I wondered why because...</i>

587
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:04,983
<i>I felt so good.</i>

588
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:07,211
<i>Light</i>

589
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:08,241
<i>clear-headed.</i>

590
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:10,460
<i>I remember thinking</i>

591
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,530
<i>I didn't wanna go back into that body.</i>

592
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:15,743
<i>I never wanted to give up this feeling I had.</i>

593
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,630
<i>Then...</i>

594
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,582
<i>I remembered my brother.</i>

595
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:23,981
<i>He was still up there with my father. I had to help.</i>

596
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:27,312
<i>No one could see me or hear me.</i>

597
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,370
<i>I tried to move.</i>

598
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:31,980
<i>I tried to pull the tubes outta me.</i>

599
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:34,990
<i>I couldn't do anything. I started to panic.</i>

600
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:36,861
<i>And then I thought of Andrea.</i>

601
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:38,872
<i>Her face just came into my head.</i>

602
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,250
<i>How kind she was to me at work...</i>

603
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:47,880
<i>how good she was to everyone around her, and I just kept thinking of her, and...</i>

604
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:51,142
<i>it was as if the thought itself pulled me away.</i>

605
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,611
<i>I couldn't control anything.</i>

606
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,181
<i>Just felt like I knew where I was going.</i>

607
00:32:57,988 --> 00:32:59,030
<i>I was screaming at her.</i>

608
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,103
<i>Andrea!</i>

609
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:01,002
<i>She couldn't hear me.</i>

610
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,102
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

611
00:33:07,128 --> 00:33:08,792
<i>I felt myself being pulled back.</i>

612
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:11,780
<i>And I didn't wanna come back.</i>

613
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:16,130
<i>I was cold in that body, in pain, and I didn't wanna feel any of that anymore.</i>

614
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,070
<i>I remember wanting to cry.</i>

615
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,282
<i>I would go to sleep for a while...</i>

616
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>and then feel that pull again.</i>

617
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,761
<i>I kept coming back to Andrea.</i>

618
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:26,970
<i>I didn't even know how. I just</i>

619
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:29,272
<i>had to get to her, somehow.</i>

620
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:32,922
He wanted to get through to you.

621
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:34,463
Thought maybe you'd help.

622
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,560
He barely said a few words to me the entire time we were in that office.

623
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:42,003
I guess you made more of an impression than you thought.

624
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:53,501
<i>This is air support 9. We have visual contact.</i>

625
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,082
<i>Your search party is in sight.</i>

626
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,520
Air support, air support, this is ranger groundleader. Do you copy?

627
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,570
Ranger groundleader, we copy.

628
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:07,550
Stay on course.

629
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:09,230
We're headed west,

630
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,413
the upper trail. Monitor channel 3 open.

631
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:13,541
We'll call you when we get to the ridgeline.

632
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:15,483
Let's go, guys!

633
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,482
Move it! Move it!

634
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,383
Keep your distance. Keep spacing going up the hill.

635
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:21,500
They're going the wrong way.

636
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:22,660
But this is where they found you.

637
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,610
I crawled from another trail, up that way.

638
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:26,791
You know what? You're going the wrong way.

639
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,060
Excuse me? How do you know that?

640
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:31,460
Tell him, we always took the back way up to dead man's ridge.

641
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,290
That's the way they always went, the back way.

642
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,050
You people don't belong here.

643
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,723
Why don't you head back to the trailhead and wait there?

644
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,081
We'll let you know when we find something.

645
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,391
Look, I'm going. Do what you want.

646
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,292
You know, A., she's my wife, and B., she's right.

647
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:45,252
It doesn't matter how, but I'm telling you, she's right.

648
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,402
Have a little faith. Deal with it.

649
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:01,272
You're close.

650
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,770
My father used to bring us here when we were kids,

651
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:05,362
whenever we were getting out of control and he wanted us to bond.

652
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,063
That's why you brought them up here again?

653
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,890
Yeah, halfway up Charlie slipped and I went off the ridge trying to grab him.

654
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:11,190
He fell down there.

655
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,173
Charlie?

656
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,053
<i>This is air support 9er.</i>

657
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:28,671
<i>We have climbers on the east slope.</i>

658
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:45,651
Hey, there he is.

659
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:47,412
Hey, buddy,

660
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:48,873
You're gonna be okay.

661
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:52,483
Where's his father?

662
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:53,483
Where's your dad?

663
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:57,793
I never kept a promise my whole life,

664
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:00,973
but I promised I scatter his ashes on this mountain.

665
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:03,172
It's a place where he was always so happy

666
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:05,220
and tried to make us happy.

667
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,081
Guys, right here, he's reponding, he's got a pulse and he's breathing.

668
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:09,790
He could have internal injuries but

669
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:11,201
he's stabilized. I don't think it's spinal.

670
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:13,981
How did you--

671
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,323
Make sure they take care of him.

672
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:32,760
It's looking good.

673
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,870
If you're looking for the brother, he's over there.

674
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:40,200
You okay?

675
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:42,841
Not sure.

676
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,312
What the hell happened

677
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:48,471
when Dennis died in that room?

678
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:50,043
How did we lose control like that?

679
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,653
We found his brother

680
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,332
alive and well. That's all that really matters.

681
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,592
What would have happened had I delayed resuscitation?

682
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:58,812
Would it really have made a difference?

683
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:03,860
Look, you live in a world where you can sometimes influence life and death, and

684
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,363
I respect that, but sometimes it's just out of our hands,

685
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:09,860
at least on earth.

686
00:37:10,455 --> 00:37:12,602
Are you telling me people come back after they die?

687
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:16,140
Do you know a Dr. Norris?

688
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,970
He was my intern. He died last year.

689
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:22,302
He wants to say thank you.

690
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,162
What are you talking about?

691
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:29,493
About the time he was scared.

692
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:32,140
A patient had died on him.

693
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:34,312
You knew how upset he was and you

694
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:36,041
told him,

695
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:39,650
"you'll save many more people than you'll lose, and no one can save them all."

696
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:41,790
That's what got him through it.

697
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:45,342
I barely remember that.

698
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,150
Oh, he never forgot it,

699
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:50,191
and he wants to give that back to you now.

700
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,671
He wants you to know that you were like a big brother to him.

701
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:56,363
I was?

702
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,781
Look how surprised he is.

703
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:01,890
Tell him

704
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:03,183
I'm sorry he never knew

705
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,880
how much I got from him.

706
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:08,303
He's a great teacher.

707
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,163
He's saying you're a great teacher.

708
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:15,642
This can't be happening.

709
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:17,702
It can't be.

710
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:21,340
And he's sorry that he couldn't say goodbye.

711
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,102
He was my best intern,

712
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:31,752
even though he couldn't keep his mind off of the girls.

713
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:38,830
I had high hopes for him.

714
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,862
You have no idea how hard that was for him to say.

715
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:54,482
Hey,

716
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:56,173
tell him...

717
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:58,181
"what you can see

718
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,361
is only half of what there is."

719
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,150
If you ever want to talk more about this,

720
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:13,630
I'll be there.

721
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:20,991
Thank you.

722
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:53,213
I should never have left.

723
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:56,431
Charlie was the smart one. He had the brains.

724
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:00,773
I should have come back and taken over for him.

725
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:05,743
You came back now, son, when it counts the most, when you had the most to give up.

726
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,731
You did good, Dennis.

727
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:09,952
I've been waiting all this time

728
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:12,503
for the two of you to make things right with each other.

729
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:20,591
Will you tell my brother that

730
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:23,371
everything's good with me now,

731
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:25,833
that, um...

732
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,032
I'm okay.

733
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:31,742
Tell him that, uh...

734
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,010
he's free to take his shot.

735
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,943
Tell him that I'll always be looking out for him,

736
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:53,341
me and the old man.

737
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:58,342
Come with me now. Everybody's waiting for you.

738
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:02,521
Who?

739
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:04,212
You'll see.

740
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,850
Will you tell Andrea that I had a crush on her too?

741
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:15,542
I will.

742
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:30,383
Are they gone?

743
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,062
Yeah.

744
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,253
Wow.

745
00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:37,772
Never been this close when it's happened.

746
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:40,501
You know what?

747
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:43,082
He wanted you to know he has a crush on you too.

748
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:47,141
Great.

749
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,103
Well,

750
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:50,463
that's another one that got away.

751
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:53,510
Come on.
