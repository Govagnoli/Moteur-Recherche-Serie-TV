00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:11,907
My name is Melinda Gordon.

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:14,787
I'm married,
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,644
and I own
an antique shop.

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,632
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:24,050
Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:28,007
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

8
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:31,108
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

9
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:33,516
and they come to me
for help.

10
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:41,687
In order to tell you my
story, I have to tell you theirs.

11
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:45,259
<i>Previously
on ghost whisperer...</i>

12
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,655
there's a plane in the air...

13
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:49,954
no one is flying it!

14
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,232
Yeah, I really don't get the feeling
that he was on that flight.

15
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:57,981
I mean, what are the chances?

16
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,961
I can't lose
my brother, melinda.

17
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:04,381
- Wait!
- They're mine.

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,847
I've been trying to work up
the courage to go in there,

19
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,997
- look at the passenger list.
- Andrea...

20
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,016
there's
something I have to tell you.

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,045
- You saw mitch.
- Andrea--

22
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:26,807
- Don't! No. No.
- But I'm not sure--

23
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,805
no way.
It's not him.

24
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,914
It was 250 people, jim.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,176
Do I really have
the right to ignore that?

26
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,453
What about the thousands people
you could help the rest of your life?

27
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,105
You can't trick those souls
into staying here.

28
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:43,191
I will release
all your precious souls.

29
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,960
And in return,
I'll take...you.

30
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,660
Mitch!

31
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,411
- Mitch?
- I'm so sorry, Mitch.

32
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,549
I was supposed
to be on that plane, Melinda,

33
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,547
I can't believe Andrea
it's dead.

34
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,347
How'd it happen?

35
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:08,126
She was driving
to your apartment in the city.

36
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,316
She tried so hard
to reach you.

37
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,905
I guess her car got caught in the
path of the plane.

38
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,377
- Do you think she suffered?
- No.

39
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,963
No, I don't think so.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,313
This can't be happening!

41
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:33,232
she's mine!

42
00:02:56,262 --> 00:03:01,326
- Andrea! Andrea!
- Melinda, I don't know what's happening!

43
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,655
- Please, help me!
- I've been looking for you, where are you?

44
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,806
At the store.
I'm so scared!

45
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,735
- Well, can you get to my house?
- I don't know!

46
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:13,204
Ok. I'll come to you.
I have really good news.

47
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,302
Hello?!

48
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,274
How is she calling you?

49
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,891
She had her cell phone with her. You know,
maybe she can tap into the energy fields.

50
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,650
- I'll come with you?
- No, she's gonna want to talk to me alone.

51
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:27,582
She's gonna be so happy!

52
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,155
Don't!

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,076
The light hurts my eyes.

54
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:56,156
Andrea, I've been
so worried about you!

55
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:59,754
- Tell me everything's gonna be ok.
- I think maybe it is.

56
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,314
You may not really be dead.

57
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,464
- What?
- It's truim found you,

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,415
Jim found you,
your body.

59
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,693
You're in a coma at mercy hospital,
but you're gonna be ok.

60
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,534
You're just out of body until ypu come out
of the coma. Doctors are working so hard.

61
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:17,133
You're not lying to me? You're not just
trying to make me feel better?

62
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:20,152
Look, you're not out of the woods.
You have some injuries.

63
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,429
but the doctors think that
you're gonna pull through.

64
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:26,281
We've been with you
at that hospital every day.

65
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:30,389
- It's scary here.
- What's it like?

66
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:34,419
I don't really like to look around too
much. There...there are people here.

67
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,677
- People?
- Not people...

68
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:42,306
I guess, maybe, um, beings or something?
They're dark, and they're always watching.

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,673
- I can't really see.
- Melinda!

70
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,314
Melinda... Open the door!

71
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:56,872
- Open the door, let me in!
- I can't!

72
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:59,204
- The door!
- It won't open!

73
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:03,512
Andrea!...
No... No!

74
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,311
- No!
- It's ok, it's ok.

75
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,830
- Shh, just a dream.
- Sorry.

76
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,759
Want some water?

77
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,448
I dreamt
that she was alive,

78
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:18,519
that you found her body
and that she was gonna be ok.

79
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,598
Think she's trying
to come to you in the dreams?

80
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:25,087
It doesn't usually work that way.
Scared the hell out of me, though.

81
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,566
No kidding.

82
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,438
- Sorry I woke you.
- Yeah, me, too.

83
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:33,937
I was dreaming that I was floating on
a river of beer and I had a big cup.

84
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,487
Are your dreams
always that complex?

85
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,644
Pretty much.

86
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,676
Gonna be able to sleep?

87
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:45,524
I don't want to keep you up. You know what,
I think I'm just gonna go downstairs and read.

88
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:59,561
Romano.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,035
Mine.

90
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:08,689
Help me.

91
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:50,691
Death is nothing at all.
It does not count.

92
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:53,944
I have only slipped away
into the next room.

93
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,485
Everything remains
as it was.

94
00:06:56,763 --> 00:07:00,139
The old life that we live so fondly
together in unchanged.

95
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,269
Is andrea here?

96
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:06,702
Whatever we were
to each other, that we are still.

97
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,995
- I am but waiting for you. For an inverval,
interval, somewhere very near... - No.

98
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:17,608
I just don't understand why
she's not coming to me.

99
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:20,000
- Maybe she's crossed over.
- No, she hasn'T.

100
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,163
I would know if she did.

101
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,442
I just can't figure out
what's keeping her here.

102
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,753
...How we shall laugh at the trouble
of parting when we meet again.

103
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:33,759
Maybe she's still in the department.
I will be going to see later

104
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,260
Thanks for everything
you did, melinda.

105
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:57,592
I hope you know
how much andrea loved you.

106
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,333
I loved her, too. So much.

107
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,775
You were like her sister.

108
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,751
Do you ever...feel like
she's with you??

109
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,601
In some ways, you know,
like she's near you?

110
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,972
No. Not really.

111
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,154
Do you?

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,127
I'd like to.

113
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:24,938
Andrea said that you understood death
in ways that most people don'T.

114
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:27,772
What else
did she say?

115
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:32,311
Just that you knew
how to help people who were grieving.

116
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,635
Now I'm one of them.

117
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,238
We both lost a sister.

118
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,814
Here in the stricken
town of grandview,

119
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,085
residents struggle to resume
their normal lives

120
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,048
after the tragedy
of flight 395.

121
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:56,318
We're here today to see
how they're doing. Excuse me,

122
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:59,759
We're here in grandview today to see
what kind of progress the town is making

123
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,551
in the aftermath
of the plane crash.

124
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:03,802
How do you think
things are going?

125
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,694
Um...I can only say that the people
in this town are really strong,

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,626
they're survivors.

127
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,118
- We're gonna be ok.
- Thank you.

128
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,978
Well, there you have it
from a local merchant.

129
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:18,891
This town is grieving, but determined
to get back to business as usual.

130
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,599
Andrea?...
Are you here?

131
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:39,234
I just want
to talk to you, please.

132
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,865
I know that you're scared.

133
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:40,029
- Where's andrea?
- I'll be glad to take a message.

134
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:43,812
- What are you doing to her?
- I don't have to do anything.

135
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,895
- She's doing it all to herself.
- Who are you?

136
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,905
I was alive once.
Just like you.

137
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:53,945
- ...I had names, I had lis.
- Romano... Is that your name?

138
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,129
- I'm just a humble teacher.
- Teacher?

139
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,721
Trying to spread the word.

140
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:02,214
- Much like yourself.
- What are you doing here? What do you want?

141
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,505
- I have what I want.
- No. No, you don'T.

142
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:08,885
Andrea will not go with you. I
know her. She's going into the light.

143
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:12,379
I'm going to have her,
and I'm going to have you, too.

144
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,398
It's just a matter of time.

145
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,991
Andrea, you have to cross
over. Please let me help you.

146
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:25,953
- I can'T. - Why not?
- You could never understand why!

147
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:43,160
<i>Cloudy and cold in the seattle area
tonight. Possible showers tomorrow,</i>

148
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,103
<i>but the rest of the week
looks like we might see some sunshine.</i>

149
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,544
<i>In other news across the nation,
the small east coast town of grandview</i>

150
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:52,308
<i>is still recovering from
that tragic plane crash.</i>

151
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:58,669
<i>Um, all I can say is that people in
this town are strong. They're survivors,</i>

152
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,952
<i>and we'll be ok.</i>

153
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,066
<i>Thank you.</i>

154
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,526
Melinda...

155
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:13,480
That brings us back
to the power of the mind.

156
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:18,071
Something so powerful that it creates
that which we want to be true.

157
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,204
That's why athletes are taught
visualization techniques

158
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:23,308
because if you imagine it,
it will happen.

159
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:26,028
Now, how do we extrapolate this
theory to the world of the supernatural?

160
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,088
Specters, demon n tities,
poltergeists, hauntings.

161
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,910
Well, what do we do? We say that all
these things are complete bull,

162
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,723
or they're all explainable
in some way or another.

163
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,913
Now, my question
to you is this--

164
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:40,975
could it be all of these phenomena
are just an extension of brain function,

165
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:45,998
an extension of our collective minds
creating myths, filling in the blanks,

166
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:49,660
if you will... And that is what we will
be studying in this class.

167
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,664
Professor payne,
hi, I'm melinda gordon.

168
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:54,265
- Good for you.
- No, we spoke on the phone, remember?

169
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,396
- About what?
- I read about your work.

170
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,398
- Why?
- I need some help.

171
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,988
I need a lot of help, too, more
than you can imagine,

172
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,949
but I don't come to your
workplace and ask for it, do I?

173
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,751
Look, you're supposed to be the
expert on the history and beliefs

174
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,102
of the occult and the supernatural--

175
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:09,002
As it pertains to contemporary
psychology. If you want to find

176
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,426
your dead aunt's will,
I can't help you.

177
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,864
- Is it necessary to be this rude?
- Necessary, no. Amusing, always.

178
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,870
Hey, you're the go-to guy,
and I need somebody to go to.

179
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:16,879
They say
you're a genius.

180
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,909
I can't believe you can't spare
half an hour!

181
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,370
Makes me crazy the way they throw the
word "genius" around, all right?

182
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,802
Although, coming from you,
it does give me a certain tingle.

183
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,836
- Will you buy me food?
- Yes.

184
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:29,446
- Follow me.
- Great!

185
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,126
I don't teach
the supernatural.

186
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,610
I teach society's need to believe
in the supernatural,

187
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:38,541
the myths and the legends
throughout the ages.

188
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,504
There are lots of myths about
dark spirits and light spirits.

189
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,355
I'm just trying to
find out more about them.

190
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,567
- Why?
- Because I really need to.

191
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,226
Well, most cultures
favor the same motifs.

192
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:52,058
Basically, it's demons, dark entities,
shadows, phantoms.

193
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:55,940
You know, the relationship between
good and evil has always been symbiotic.

194
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,512
You can't have one without the
other... And speaking of evil,

195
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:01,485
- don't try that shrimp.
- What function do they serve?

196
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,857
- Apparently to make us violently ill.
- Are you still talking about the shrimp?

197
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:08,259
- Aren't you?
- Spirits, dark spirits.

198
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:10,852
Dark spirits. Dark spirits and
light spirits are linked--

199
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:14,983
at opposite ends, obviously, and the
dark spirits are here to create evil,

200
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,816
not only create evil but to grow it.

201
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:18,094
And the light spirits?

202
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,475
The light spirits make sure that
the dead pass on to the other side.

203
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,190
The light, heaven,
whatever you want to call it.

204
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,190
They're the protectors
of the souls.

205
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:28,190
They, uh, they just go
around spreading all things good.

206
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,463
Love, happiness,
blah blah blah.

207
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:33,553
And can one dark spirit become
more powerful than the others?

208
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,236
Well, that depends on how many
souls they can take up,

209
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:39,118
and that's why the dark spirits
hate the light spirits so much,

210
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:43,449
because the light spirits are always
taking souls away from them.

211
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:46,373
Well, uh, there's
an east african version

212
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:49,821
where if a dark spirit can take over
the soul of a light spirit,

213
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,534
that's like triple bonus
points right there.

214
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:57,478
By engulfing the soul of a light spirit,
the dark spirit becomes invincible.

215
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,230
- You ok?
- Yeah. Have you ever...

216
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,152
come across this image?

217
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,812
- Heh, a villain from old-time radio?
- That's not funny.

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,524
- Do we have a name?
- Romano, maybe, I'm not sure.

219
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,458
Ok. Is your romano
a dark spirit or a light spirit?

220
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,208
Oh, you're right. They are too careless
with the word "genius."

221
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,270
That's harsh.
Who are you again?

222
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:23,382
Just someone who wants some help.
Someone who needs to learn.

223
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,765
- Can you just check the sketch for me?
- I'm already on it. Good-bye.

224
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:36,229
I'm just not sure what you hope to
get talkin' to this professor guy.

225
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,692
I'm not exactly sure, either, but at
least, if I can find out who this romano is,

226
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,806
then I can keep her
away from him.

227
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:44,087
Does he know what you can do?
The professor.

228
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,310
- Why don't you tell him?
- I don't tell people.

229
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:51,540
- You told andrea.
- Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have.

230
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:55,232
Maybe this whole spirit thing evaded
her life just as it has ours.

231
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:58,673
Maybe she would have been
better off not even knowing.

232
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:03,607
Hey. Slow down. You gotta realize you're
hurting, too. You've been through...

233
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:06,660
a terrible shock.
Take a beat.

234
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,051
Yeah, I can'T.

235
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:11,700
- Why? - Because, if I stop
and think, I just feel so guilty.

236
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,792
You know, like maybe
what happened to andrea is my fault.

237
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:17,175
I mean, it's only because of me that
she knew about the plane.

238
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,856
It's only because
of me that romano went looking for her.

239
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,870
Maybe...

240
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:25,261
Maybe... I unleashed something
that even I don't understand.

241
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,440
Just do the best you can
do with what you know.

242
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,583
I can't believe
that she's gone.

243
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:34,414
I can't believe that she's not gonna
walk in this door at any minute

244
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,339
with her coffee and a joke.

245
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:43,159
I would give anything just to hear
her laugh one more time.

246
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,792
She never doubted me.

247
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:53,297
- Even for a minute. - Ok, there's
something that you should know about me.

248
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:59,021
- Ooh, uh-oh.
- Yeah. And it's gonna sound crazy.

249
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:01,020
And I'm telling you
for 2 reasons.

250
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:05,694
One, because I have a good feeling about
ypu. You don't seem like you're judgmental.

251
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:09,044
- Ok...
- ok, so here it is.

252
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:15,728
Uh, sometimes when people
die, their spirits don't leave.

253
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,443
They stay earthbound
for all kinds of reasons.

254
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,445
And, well... I can see those people.
Those...spirits.

255
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:29,229
They talk to me,
I can help them.

256
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,619
You should say
something soon.

257
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,943
That...is... the...

258
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:45,396
-... coolest thing I've ever heard.
- You don't think I'm nuts?

259
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:50,769
Ooh, ahh, no more nuts
than I am.

260
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,004
I mean, I buy it. I like it.
I knew you'd get it, I just knew it.

261
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,614
Yeah, but you said there was another
reason that you were telling me.

262
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:59,957
Yeah, you have a ghost
attached to you.

263
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:03,419
I'm sorry, what?
What--where? Where?

264
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:08,121
I thought you could see me!

265
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:12,101
He's, uh, behind you. He's been
following you for the last 2 weeks.

266
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:14,474
What--why?
What does he want?

267
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,247
Finally!
Ok, it's like this all right--

268
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:21,977
you don't have to shout! Just because you're
dead doesn't mean that I can't hear you.

269
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,471
All right, all right, what do I know?
I thought I was talking

270
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,114
from the great beyond or something.

271
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:30,263
Anyway, the point is, I used to live
in the apartment she lives in now.

272
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:33,936
Ah, he's an older man who used to live
in your apartment.

273
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,837
Ok, please tell me he didn't die
in my apartment.

274
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,929
I didn't die there. I crapped out on
a bus one day coming home.

275
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:44,974
Heart attack.
But I digress. The point is this.

276
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:50,444
There's a stack of pictures of my
grandson that fell behind the stove,

277
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:55,346
and I never got around to gettin' them out,
and my daughter would love those shots.

278
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,272
Oh, there's pictures of his grandson
behind your stove.

279
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,774
My daughter's name is nancy howard.
She's in the phone book.

280
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,763
He wants you to send the pictures
to his daughter. I have her name.

281
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:05,404
She's in the phone book.

282
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,849
Hey, you're kidding, right?

283
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:19,894
Ok, I am so gonna
love this job.

284
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,076
Andrea?

285
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:58,407
Got here about
a half hour ago.

286
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,710
My key won't turn in the lock.
I knock, but no one answers.

287
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:06,763
Hello? Who's in there?

288
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,615
Try your key again.

289
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,189
Who could have
done that?

290
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,589
That's sick.
I don't get it.

291
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:16,411
The words... that name, romano.
I have no idea who that is, do you?

292
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,766
- Everything just seems a bit crazy right now.
- Should I call the police?

293
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:24,759
- If it'll make you feel better, but I don't--
- Melinda, if you know something,

294
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:26,181
please, tell me.

295
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:29,602
I really don't know
what's going on.

296
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:32,184
You feel like you
could know a person...

297
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:35,785
I mean, really know who they
are through and through?

298
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,835
- I do.
- I do, too.

299
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:40,937
And I know my sister.
I know it sounds crazy,

300
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:45,708
but I feel like something's wrong.
Like she's not at rest somehow.

301
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,374
I can't shake it.

302
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,034
You probably know things weren't
always great with us.

303
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,248
She told me you didn't talk
for 2 years..

304
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,859
It's worse than that.

305
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:01,411
There's somethin'
I never told her.

306
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,162
Something she should
have known.

307
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,603
- What?
- What difference does it make?

308
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,076
It's too late.

309
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:21,862
Andrea?
Are you here?

310
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,649
Andrea?

311
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,643
He told me not to believe
a thing you say.

312
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,953
Romano?

313
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,176
I don't want to be dead!
I shouldn't be dead!

314
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:53,916
Please...help me. I don't want
to be here. But I deserve it.

315
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,711
- No, you don't!
- What'll happen to me if I go with him?

316
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,553
He'll turn you into something,
something just like him.

317
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:06,087
- He makes me want to be with him!
-Andrea, it's all lies!
Please don't let him do it--

318
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:09,821
- I have to go.
- Where?

319
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:10,591
Back to the beginning.
Oh, my god.

320
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,143
Andrea, please!

321
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:20,027
- I have to go now.
- Andrea!

322
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:19,020
- Hello.
- Hi, melinda, it's rick payne.

323
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,354
Uh, I just got back
to my office.

324
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,185
Is there any chance you can
come over here? Right away?

325
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,267
Could this wait till morning?
It's been kind of a long night.

326
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,746
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe not.

327
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:33,921
Ok, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

328
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:36,190
Is there any chance
you'll pass a noodle parlor?

329
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,425
- None.
- Fair enough.

330
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:13,183
- when did this happen?
- Today. I'm teaching a class,

331
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:14,635
and then I go out to
dinner--polynesian food.

332
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,497
Have you ever had tongue
and papaya? I don't recommend it.

333
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,829
I come back to my office to get some
books, and all this has happened.

334
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:24,819
I--who could have done this?!
Some disgruntled janitor? No. No. No.

335
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:28,323
Please. I don't think so.
And then--ooh-- check this out.

336
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,412
Here's a drawing that i
didn't even know I had.

337
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:34,105
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah, sure.

338
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,998
- Well?
- Oh, sorry, uh,

339
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,787
basically it's a warning.
It's a dark motif favored by the incans.

340
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:44,829
"Back off or die" being
the fundamental message.

341
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:49,350
Who are you really? Come on, you come here
asking me some very interesting questions.

342
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:53,922
Next thing I know, my office is redecorated.
And I'm on the wrong end of
an incan death threat.

343
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:56,415
Look, I'm really am
just kind of a student.

344
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,436
There are some things that I know and
some things that I'm trying to find out.

345
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:01,438
Ok. That's--
that's great.

346
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:04,460
But are you going to tell me this all
happened because of a supernatural event?

347
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:07,342
- Yes.
- Come on! That's crap!

348
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,903
Who--who sent you here?
Who put you up to this?

349
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,815
Is it spiegelman from princeton,
that son of a bitch?

350
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,436
Ok, the sketch that I gave you.
Did you find out anything about him?

351
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:16,466
Oh, yeah.
I did actually.

352
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:21,295
There's an obscure sect in algeria,
sort of a quasi devil worship...

353
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:25,648
sort of a quasi devil worshiping group. They
use this image as the object of their reverence.

354
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:28,982
I also found another group in morocco,
and there's another one in portugal.

355
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:32,003
Wow.
This is amazing.

356
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:34,924
Come here!, you maybe want
to see this.

357
00:27:39,364 --> 00:27:41,358
Is this...

358
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:44,427
that's an american cult leader living in
Spain-- went by the name romano.

359
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:46,721
This guy had 115 followers.

360
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:50,183
And he convinced them all to
commit themselves to their dark sides.

361
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:53,993
And like you were telling me that dark
spirits like souls to be angry and toxic.

362
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:58,013
Toxic is an understatement. This guy convinced
these people to commit the ultimate dark act...

363
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:00,818
That would assure them
a place alongside him in eternity.

364
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:03,306
- Suicide?
- On a grand scale.

365
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,901
You say you've seen
this guy recently?

366
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:08,219
- Kinda.
- You know, that's fascinating to me,

367
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:12,752
this happened in 1939! And romano
killed himself with all the others.

368
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,845
And became
a dark spirit?

369
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:17,583
Let's say the sake of argument
that dark spirits are real.

370
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:20,835
I would say your friend romano there
was a dark spirit long before that happened.

371
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:23,109
- A living one?
- As these entities get stronger,

372
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,459
they have the ability
to take over a weaker human.

373
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,458
Literally take over
their bodies?

374
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:29,600
In theory-- look, that's a picture of
some loser named romano

375
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:33,011
with an evil heart and a weak will.,
But once the spirit got ahold of him

376
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,182
all the negative energy
from that mass suicide--

377
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:39,926
he was 100 times stronger. And then when
he died, he was released back into
the ether badder than ever.

378
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:43,017
- And now?
- Now...

379
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:45,528
regrouping
for a bigger bite.

380
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:49,041
Maybe he's just sucking
up soul after soul and building more

381
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,140
and more strength until the next
human being he takes over

382
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,661
he could do some real
hurt to the world.

383
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,174
And this guy's not gonna stop
until he destroys everything that's good.

384
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,266
- You sound like a believer.
- I'd like to believe.

385
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,765
I'd like to believe there's more than
this short rocket trip to the grave.

386
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:06,791
I'd like to believe in
an afterlife.

387
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:11,080
I believe in science. I need proof.
I need facts and figures.

388
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,533
I can't just take it on faith
alone. And there lies the rub.

389
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:17,433
No faith, no belief.

390
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:26,989
I--I have
to plan breakfast now.

391
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:32,642
Um...romano-- he didn't kill
anybody himself, did he?

392
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,334
I mean, he just convinced them
to kill themselves.

393
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,564
That also fits in
with the dark motif.

394
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,555
In order for these things to win,
they have to take over a soul

395
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,188
that acts with its own free will. They
have to cooperate in their own destruction.

396
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,913
Hey, where the hell
have you been, kyle?

397
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,764
- Well, I've been busy.
- I can see.

398
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:27,339
Man, what's with you
and this chick...melinda?

399
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,139
Like you're obsessed
with her.

400
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:36,293
She and I--we have some
unfinished business.

401
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:40,904
So the fact that romano
never physically killed anyone

402
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,594
means that he has less power
than you thought.

403
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:43,995
Means he has more power.

404
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:48,678
Imagine being able to convince people--
100 of them-- to kill themselve

405
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:51,428
- Gets in their heads, huh?
- No, he gets inside their souls.

406
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,731
Makes them feel like
they're worthless, that they're bad.

407
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:56,953
He poisons their spirits. And the weaker
they get, the stronger he gets.

408
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:59,332
- He's doing this to andrea?
- Yeah, he's trying.

409
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:03,063
And it makes me so frustrated, because
she's the only one who can turn him away.

410
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,257
And I have to make her
understand that.

411
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,049
- You don't know where she is?
- She said that she was going

412
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:11,780
back to the beginning,
but the beginning of what?

413
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,871
Your friendship?
The store?

414
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:17,983
Wait a minute...

415
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:23,115
I used to tell andrea all the time that
death isn't the end, it's the beginning.

416
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,585
That's where she is.

417
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,719
She went back
to where she died--

418
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,738
where this began.

419
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,894
- I can't cross over.
- Why not?

420
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,894
Romano said I'd be punished.

421
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,894
- For what?
- That night

422
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,127
when mitch
came to the store

423
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,159
and when you told him
I was dead.

424
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:36,099
When I realized that was true--
that mitch was alive and I was dead...

425
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,983
for just one minute

426
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:44,604
I wanted to trade places.
I wanted to live so badly

427
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:48,706
that I wished it was mitch who had
been killed by the plane and not me.

428
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:51,877
I prayed for it.

429
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,948
We were all in shock.

430
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:59,352
But you have to talk to mitch. And he has
something that he has to say to you, too.

431
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:04,201
My own brother,
and I wished him dead!

432
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,825
I can't be forgiven for that.

433
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:11,446
- Yes, you can.
- I don't want to be.

434
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:37,630
I know you're packing,
but, I have to talk to you.

435
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:44,793
I know this is a lot
to take in.

436
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:47,735
- Ahh, you think?
- You tell me how well you know andrea.

437
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:51,736
That she's not at rest, that
something's wrong. You can feel it.

438
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:56,820
Did andrea know about this? That
you could... that you see the dead?

439
00:33:56,825 --> 00:34:00,061
Yes. I used to talk to her
about it all the time.

440
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,253
I can't believe she never
said anything to you.

441
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,152
- Did she believe you?
- Yes.

442
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,434
She was so open
and curious.

443
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,476
She had lots of questions,
always wanted to know more.

444
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:18,169
That night...
in front of the store,

445
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:20,811
when I saw you and you told me
what happened to andrea.

446
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:23,231
Are you saying
that andrea was there?

447
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,022
That you saw her? She
saw us, and she couldn't--

448
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,726
she couldn't let me
know she was there?

449
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,857
She was confused, mitch.

450
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:35,529
She thought that you were the one that
was dead. It was hard for all of us.

451
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:37,631
She's in a bad place.

452
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:41,470
She can't cross over
into the light, and you're the reason.

453
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:45,542
You have one last chance to do
something good for your sister.

454
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:57,068
There's a lot of her in this place.
It'll help us to be here.

455
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,963
So...how do we..

456
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,665
- what am i supposed to do? - The best
way is tell me something about andrea.

457
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,958
Just tell me a story.

458
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,213
she was traveling
all the time,

459
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:30,325
always away and never too good
about being in touch.

460
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:34,796
My father was sick,
and it got bad real fast.

461
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,448
And I think my dad was hanging on
so he could see her one more time.

462
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,571
But we couldn't find her.

463
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,663
I was with my pop
the night he died.

464
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:49,384
He knew andrea would be heartbroken
about not being with him...

465
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,006
how guilty she'd feel.

466
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:56,977
And he wanted me to tell her
that it was all right,

467
00:35:57,266 --> 00:36:00,548
that he loved her,
and that he knew she loved him.

468
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,040
And that he'd see her again.

469
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,072
He didn't want her
to hurt.

470
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,724
You never told me that.

471
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,037
She's here, mitch

472
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:18,210
Now?

473
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:20,251
In here with us?

474
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:23,599
She wants to know why you never
told her what your father said.

475
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:28,221
Because I was so mad
about her not being there.

476
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:33,253
And I know it's wrong. And I'm sorry.
I was going to tell her someday.

477
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,305
I just--I never thought
it would be too late.

478
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:38,678
Will you tell him, melinda?

479
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:45,000
Mitch, the night that you came
to the store, andrea was there.

480
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:48,742
She was watching when I told
you that she was dead.

481
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,764
And for a moment, when she realized the
truth she wanted to change places with you.

482
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:57,258
She wanted to be the one who was alive even if
it meant that you were the one that was dead.

483
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:59,518
It was only for a split second.

484
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:02,058
And she feels
full of shame about that.

485
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:08,683
It's part of what's keeping her here.
She needs your forgiveness.

486
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,347
- Tell her I--
- she can hear you.

487
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,159
Andrea...

488
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:25,799
I wished the same thing.
I wanted it to be me on that plane,

489
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:28,462
and you still safe--

490
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,745
still alive.

491
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:34,584
I mean you were always
the one who lived.

492
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:39,386
I was always so cautious,
and so worried about the rules.

493
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:41,479
And what people think...

494
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:49,292
you always charged ahead. You're the
one who should have gotten more life.

495
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,626
She needs to hear you say
that you forgive her.

496
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:57,496
There's nothing to forgive.
She didn't do anything wrong.

497
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:06,332
Can you forgive me?

498
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,884
Let's just say we're even.

499
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,906
She says you're even now.

500
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,005
He says I'll be judged
in the light.

501
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,476
Don't be scared.
Don't let him into your head.

502
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:43,957
Why isn't he coming inside?

503
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,001
He can't now.

504
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,262
There's too much love
in here.

505
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:51,264
And that's what's in
the light, not judgment.

506
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:56,995
Look, we all feel guilt
about what happened that night.

507
00:38:57,162 --> 00:39:01,205
But it's time that we let it go.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

508
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,378
I'm scared.

509
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,379
I know you are.

510
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:11,541
Just try and remember l the good
things that you're leaving us with.

511
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:15,424
Remember that every person
that knew you is better for it...

512
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,964
especially me.

513
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:20,736
You taught me
to be fearless.

514
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,457
And you loved really well,

515
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:27,550
and you were loved. And that's what you're
bring into that light, nothing else.

516
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,523
Ahh...I see it.

517
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,805
The light...ohh.

518
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:48,629
It's more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

519
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:51,142
Then go into it.

520
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:57,403
You're free.
This is how it's supposed to be.

521
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,788
Melinda...

522
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:07,927
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

523
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,690
You'll see me again.

524
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,152
And when I get to that light,
you better be waiting.

525
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:18,073
You better be
the first face that I see.

526
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,995
I'll be waiting.

527
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:26,418
Good-bye.

528
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,633
Say hi to pop for me.

529
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,256
He says hi back.

530
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:12,530
She's gone.

531
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:45,043
Let's see, you're going to driscoll
county, connecting in chicago.

532
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:48,198
You're all set. Just need
to see a photo I.D.

533
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:54,668
Oh, shoot. I left
my I.D. In the car.

534
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:58,636
Got time. Go and get it, and just
come back to the front of the line.
