00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,645

anybody's hurt.

He's gonna be ok.

42
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,812
Oh. I was so afraid.
I thought...

43
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,711

He's ok.

44
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,011
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be just fine.

45
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,912
Wait a minute.

46
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:11,344

47
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,711
Please? My husband

48
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,678

00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,011
Yes. He'll be fine. This is
jim's clancy's wife, melinda.

00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,711
Now you have to help him.

54
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:31,578
Please?

55
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,944
I'm desperate.

56
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,011
Can you see us?

57
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,880
I was driving.

58
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,312
Where are you going?

59
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,212
We had a blowout.

60
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,379
I couldn't hold it.

61
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,379
Hey!

62
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,513
We were transporting.

63
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,980
Patient didn't make it.

64
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,980
Oh, my god.
Does jim know?

65
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,479
No.
Guy had a broken leg,

66
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:31,646
ruptured femoral artery.

67
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:33,413
Doc says he
might've died anyway.

68
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,980
Hello?
I need your help!

69
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,147
I need to be with
my husband right now.

70
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:38,680
Hey, no problem.

71
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,680
If it wasn't for mine, you may
not have a husband right now.

72
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,813
Tell jim i'm sorry.

73
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,946
Oh, am i dead?

74
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,880
No.

75
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:15,246
Hmm. You never know
with you.

76
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,780
Bobby?

77
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,147
He walked away
without a scratch.

78
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:26,446
Wh... the patient?

79
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:29,613
Jim...

80
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,212

81
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:43,312

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,880
Sorry.

83
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,013
Nobody can see me
except you.

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,179
Why?

85
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,312
Uh, it's a gift i have.

86
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,147
Can i just tell you,
you're a little pushy.

87
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,147
If you were in my position,
you would be, too.

88
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,446
Don't you think?

89
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,946
Sorry.

90
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:32,780
It's been a long night.
Who are you?

91
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,613
My name is hope.
Paulson.

92
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,147
How long have you
been dead?

93
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:38,613
Since july 4th.

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,880
They said everything
was gonna be fine.

95
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,646
They told me i had
an ectopic pregnancy.

96
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:53,813
I didn't even know
i was pregnant.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,980
I'm only 26 years old.

98
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,846
This wasn't supposed
to happen to me.

99
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:00,080
Not now.

100
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:05,646
I was gonna be a mommy.
How is that fair?

101
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:06,913
It isn't.

102
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,179
Sometimes...

103
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:12,346
in situations like this
after people have passed away,

104
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:14,513
i help them cross over.

105
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,413
Do you know
what that means?

106
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,013
Yes.

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,446
Is that what you want?
No.

108
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,246
No, um...

109
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:25,013
my husband hasn't been
the same since i...

110
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,413
he blames himself
for what happened.

111
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,813
That's why you
have to help him.

112
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,646
Have you been
with him since...

113
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:36,813
yes. He hasn't been sleeping,
or all he does is sleep.

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,212
He doesn't see his friends
or his parents or mine.

115
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,212
He hasn't read a book
or gone camping.

116
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:49,980
See, i know him.
He's a wallower.

117
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:53,212
He could wallow in this
for the rest of his life.

118
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:56,713
And i don't want that.

119
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,047
You have to make him
see that.

120
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,179
Please?

121
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:06,913
I'll try.

122
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,980
Oh, hey, whoa. Whoa.
I'm sorry, luv.

123
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,279
That's ok. I gotta go. Call you back.

124
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,113
I didn't hurt you,
did i?

125
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,279
No bumps?
No bruises?

126
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,513
I'm fine. Really.

127
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,613
'Cause i would hate to
have to buy you lunch.

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,946
Oh, you're too late.
Oh.

129
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,413
Love the accent, though.

130
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,312
Morning.

131
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,479
Hey!

132
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:44,680
How's jim?

133
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:45,780
Coming home today.

134
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:48,047
Sexy, sensitive,
and indestructible.

135
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,680
I've gotta get me
a man like that.

136
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:53,312
Oh, i think you just did.
Tall, australian, hot.

137
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,980
Oh, yeah, mate.

138
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:58,479
The previous owner of
this 14 karat yellow gold

139
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,013
oyster perpetual
with matte dial,

140
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,780
luminous mercedes hands,

141
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:05,646
center second sweep,
and screw down crown.

142
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,813
Ooh. Screw down crown,
my favorite part.

143
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,047
Guess how much
i paid for it.

144
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,846
Can i see it?
$1,100.

145
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,446
And he was happy
to get it.

146
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:16,346
Oh. I think that's worth a
little shrimp on the barbie,

147
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,346
don't you?
Hmm...

148
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:19,913
what?
Hmm...

149
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,346
what?

150
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,513
It's a fake.

151
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,013
No... no. No way!

152
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,513
Vietnamese, probably.

153
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,346
If it was real, you'd see
the model number. Sorry.

154
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:32,813
Ooh! God, i can't believe
a guy that cute is a crook!

155
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,346
Oh, and i bet his stupid
accent was fake, too.

156
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:38,813
It is possible that he did not
know that the watch was fake.

157
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,713
I have a feeling
he'll be back.

158
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,279
Ok...

159
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:46,746
he found a sucker
he could sell to.

160
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,312
A sucker, huh?

161
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,113
When he comes back, we'll
tell him we want our money,

162
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,279
or we call the cops.

163
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:52,780
Gee, thank you.

164
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,080
I just wanna thank you again
for being such a good samaritan.

165
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:20,346
Oh, i... i didn't do
anything. Anybody would've.

166
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,179
No. Not anybody.

167
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,746
Thank you.

168
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,179
How long have you
been married?

169
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:28,746
7 months.

170
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,179
3 years next march
for me.

171
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:37,346
My wife hope,
she died last summer.

172
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:41,346
So... i know what you were
going through last night.

173
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,013
You want to talk
about it?

174
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,379
I mean, you don't
have to. Just...

175
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,147
sometimes it helps.

176
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:55,113
It was the fourth of july,
we were at a barbecue.

177
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,047
We were having a fight.

178
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:00,212
I don't even remember
about what.

179
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,413
Something stupid.

180
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,147
She was complaining about
having a stomachache.

181
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,446
She wanted to go home.

182
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,646
I was having too much fun
to go home.

183
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:15,279
I thought... she doesn't wanna be here,
so she's making it difficult for me.

184
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,346
Typical, huh?

185
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,846
So we stayed.

186
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,413
Played softball
like we did every year.

187
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,880
She just fell over.

188
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,913
I thought she was messing
with me, you know?

189
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:50,746
She wasn't.

190
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,946
She was really hurting.

191
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,513
Someone said to call 911.

192
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,446
So we did.

193
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,212
She was really hurting.

194
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,613
When we got to the hospital,
she was in shock.

195
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:30,379
Then they told us
she was pregnant.

196
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,513
And i thought this will be
a good story to tell the kid.

197
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,379
There'll be no problem
whatsoever.

198
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:44,047
The doctor told us the
fallopian tube had ruptured.

199
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:45,513
She was hemorrhaging.

200
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,413
That's why she had
the stomachache.

201
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,746
They were gonna
have to do surgery.

202
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:54,513
Afterwards,
everything seemed fine.

203
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,413
The doctor said everything
went smoothly.

204
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,713
So i sat with her
for a little bit.

205
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,113
She was still so out of it...

206
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,446
so i thought it'd be ok
to go home...

207
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,279
take a shower
and change my clothes.

208
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:21,513
And that's when i
got the call.

209
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:30,047
There was a nurse there
when i got back.

210
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,746
He had been in the surgery
with her.

211
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,413
He was crying.

212
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,713
When i saw that, i knew.

213
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,080
I just didn't expect that.

214
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,446
But it wasn't your fault.

215
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,080
It was my fault.

216
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,413
And now she's dead.

217
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,306
uh, i'm looking for
my husband, jim clancy?

218
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,317
Cat scan. Room 133.

219
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:40,651
Thank you.

220
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:41,751
Ahh! Oh.

221
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,250
Do you have to do that?

222
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,651
Sorry. Have you
talked to brad?

223
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,117
Yes.
And?

224
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,751
You two really loved
each other, didn't you?

225
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:51,917
Yeah. Yes, very much.

226
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,850
Did he tell you we
met in high school? No.

227
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,117
Detention. I got caught gluing
sharon scomer's locker shut.

228
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,217
He was there because he refused
to tell the principal

229
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:02,517
that our friend david went to new
york city with our other friend...

230
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:04,284
yeah. There are
a lot of us here.

231
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,250
How's jim?

232
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,017
Fine.

233
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,584
Yeah. I get to
take him home today.

234
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,684
Oh, i'm sorry.
I'm a crier.

235
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,751
I cry at the drop of a hat,
just like my mother.

236
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:24,617
I lied to you before.

237
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,617
When i told you i didn't know
i was pregnant.

238
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,551
I did.

239
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:34,551
I just hadn't told brad.

240
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,617
I knew the moment
we conceived her.

241
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,117
And i just knew
it was a girl.

242
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,284
He wanted a girl.

243
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:52,384
I had such big plans.

244
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,784
We had so many plans.

245
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,084
Where were you?

246
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,917
Oh, i, uh...

247
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,250
i know. I figured
the hospital...

248
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:10,417
you must be
in hog heaven.

249
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,818
You know, sometimes it's not
all it's cracked up to be.

250
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,084
Who is it this time?

251
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,017
A young woman
about my age.

252
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,850
Oh, yeah?
What's her deal?

253
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,551
What's her deal?

254
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:25,284
Her deal i'd say is she will
never get to enjoy with her husband

255
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,050
all the things
i love about you

256
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:30,617
and will never ever take
for granted.

257
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,150
Good answer.

258
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,217
Hey...

259
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,584
i'm happy that it's
not you i'm helping.

260
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:47,784
Me, too.

261
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,050
Ok, let me
get the door.

262
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,584
Oh, yeah.

263
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:57,250
I don't have any money.
I can't tip you.

264
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,250
Yeah, right.

265
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,050
Don't get used
to it.

266
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,751
Hey, jim get home ok?

267
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,417
Safe and sound.

268
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,084
And why aren't you
there with him?

269
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,917
As soon as i finish this, i'm
going back and making him dinner.

270
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:18,351
And he likes this special parmesan
that you can only get at bianchi's.

271
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:20,751
What?

272
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,484
Well, well, well.

273
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,351
Speaking of
foreign cheese.

274
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,017
All right.
Wait.

275
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:28,117
Wait. Let me do it.

276
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:29,684
What, you think
i can't handle it?

277
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,117
I just think maybe we should
keep the emotion out of it.

278
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:35,117
Fine.

279
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,551
Hi.

280
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:39,184
Oh, it's you.

281
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,384
Can i help you?

282
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:41,517
How lucky
am i?

283
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:42,818
Yeah. I don't get out much.

284
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,384
Pity.
Isn't it?

285
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:48,551
Look, i was wondering if i
might interest you in something.

286
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:54,384
Antique, art deco platinum, european
cut diamond and pearl necklace.

287
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,551
May i?

288
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,451
Elegant lustrous spheres...

289
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,084
strung between diamond clusters

290
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,850
with a perfectly formed
teardrop pearl

291
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,484
just hanging from the strand.

292
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,617
It's lovely.

293
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:13,983
Now i can let it go
for say $2,800.

294
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,351
Suppose i sell you
something...

295
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:21,718
for, let's say, $1,100 and nobody
but you and i know the truth?

296
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,917
What are you suggesting,
i sold you a bad watch?

297
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,517
Oh, i'm not saying
it's bad,

298
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,484
i mean, it keeps very
good time for a fake.

299
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:29,250
So you say.
So i say.

300
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:35,317
Now, how do i know you didn't replace
my watch with that piece of junk?

301
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:37,351
How do i know you're not
trying to highjack me?

302
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,651
This is a small town,
you know.

303
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,050
Why don't you take that into
account when casting aspersions?

304
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,284
And how'd that go down?

305
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,250
It's better with cheese.

306
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,284
I got the kind you like
from bianchi's.

307
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:06,317
Do you believe in fate?

308
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:10,584
Or do you believe we've got some
kind of control over our destiny?

309
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,917
Is that a trick question?

310
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,584
Nope. Serious.

311
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:17,751
Ok, i guess i'd say
i believe in free will.

312
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:18,850
What do you mean?

313
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:22,017
I don't have to love you.
I want to.

314
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,751
I choose to, and however
that affects my destiny,

315
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,584
or whatever god, or the gods
have in store for me,

316
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,050
so be it.

317
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:35,084
What about, um,
accidents?

318
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,150
Hey, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

319
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,617
I should've checked
the tires on the rig.

320
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,818
Yes. Today you know that.

321
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,184
I knew it yesterday.

322
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,784
It's what i do before
every shift, you know.

323
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,317
I check the meds,
i check the supplies,

324
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,950
i check the gas,
the oil...

325
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:53,451
i check the tires,
but i didn't yesterday

326
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,451
because
i was late for work.

327
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,317
Because i made you late,
you mean.

328
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:58,784
No, no.
I didn't mean that.

329
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,317
I didn't mean that
at all.

330
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,017
I love that you, uh...

331
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,050
wanted to make me
french toast

332
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,684
for breakfast.

333
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,017
I love that you
wanted to do that...

334
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,184
for me.

335
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,050
Jim, it was an accident.

336
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,617
It cost someone
his life.

337
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,417
Yes, it did.
You didn't.

338
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,317
Accidents happen. They're
a necessary part of life.

339
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,284
So this happened to me
for a reason.

340
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:42,517
Now a person is dead.

341
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,317
What kind of reason
is that?

342
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,844
You don't have to be in
for 2 hours.

343
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:01,510
Yeah, i know.

344
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,211
But i should
get there.

345
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:05,744
2 hours early?

346
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,410
What are you working on?

347
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:16,278
"Hope paulson. "
Related to brad?

348
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:17,444
His wife.

349
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,178
Aw, man.

350
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,944
He saved me.

351
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:22,944
You save her.

352
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,777
No. She's already dead.

353
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:27,311
I don't know if you can call
what i'm doing saving her.

354
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:29,311
It's weird how things
work sometimes.

355
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:30,644
True.

356
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:32,311
What are you gonna do?

357
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:34,011
Brad mentioned a nurse.

358
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:37,311
His name is derrik lee. He was
there during hope's surgery.

359
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:40,144
If i can get him to tell brad
exactly why his wife died,

360
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,811
specifically that
he's not responsible,

361
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:44,978
then maybe i can help
get him some closure.

362
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:45,978
Hmm.

363
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:47,144
What?

364
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:49,711
You realize this all
started with you...

365
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:52,744
making me french toast?

366
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,311
Yeah. Track it. It led to the
accident, which led to brad,

367
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:58,711
which led to the hospital,
which led to hope.

368
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,178
I mean, are we
the puppet masters...

369
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,944
or are we just the puppets?

370
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:04,844
You know, i learned
a long time ago,

371
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,611
never question the cosmic
law of french toast.

372
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,577
Gotta go.
All right.

373
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,410
The what?

374
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,611
Hope: He does this
every day,

375
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:29,944
hammers the sign
into the ground,

376
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:31,444
pulls it up before
he goes to work.

377
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,444
Hi.
Hi.

378
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,211
Wanna buy a house?

379
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:36,211
Got one. Thanks.
You moving?

380
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:39,278
Yeah.
I hate this house.

381
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,477
It's nice.
It's nice.

382
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:43,311
That's what she
used to say.

383
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:44,911
Can i ask you
something?

384
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:46,278
About hope's surgery?

385
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:47,444
Put me in a good mood.

386
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,811
I know it's none
of my business.

387
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,644
It's just you were so
helpful to jim and me,

388
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,311
and i'd like to
return the favor.

389
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,744
You wanna set me up
with someone?

390
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,477
No.
Good.

391
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:59,078
I have this ability to help
people during otional crisis.

392
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,978
I'm not a shrink
or anything or a kook.

393
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,811
It's just something i've
always been able to do,

394
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:04,144
and i would love to...
you know what?

395
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,677
I don't need any help.

396
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:07,644
I don't deserve any help.

397
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,611
Brad, wait.

398
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,944
You know how many houses
i've sold since my wife died?

399
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,744
Exactly none.

400
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,444
I just think it would be
helpful if you'd maybe

401
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,978
talked to someone who was
actually there when hope died.

402
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,611
What's the point?

403
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,677
Because i think what's
causing you so much pain

404
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:27,944
is the guilt you're feeling
because you weren't there.

405
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,278
I already talked
to the surgeon

406
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:31,944
and the hospital
administrator.

407
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,644
I even hired a lawyer
who charged me 5,500 bucks

408
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,345
to tell me that whatever we
accomplished wouldn't bring my wife back.

409
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:40,144
So, you just wanna be
like everyone else

410
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,311
who tells me to get on
with my life. Well, fine.

411
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:45,144
How 'bout you get on
with my life?

412
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:47,211
I'll take yours any day.

413
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,345
There. That's derrik lee.

414
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,144
May i?

415
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,811
Mm, please.

416
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:11,011
Thanks.
Melinda gordon.

417
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:12,444
Derrik lee.

418
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:16,144
I haven't seen you
around.

419
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:17,510
What department
do you work in?

420
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:18,844
Oh, i'm not
with the hospital.

421
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:19,844
Oh.

422
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,278
I, um...
how should i say this?

423
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:26,811
I represent
a former patient of yours.

424
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:28,111
Former, as in
discharged?

425
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,510
Former as in
dearly departed.

426
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:32,510
Hope paulson.

427
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,078
You were her surgical nurse,
right?

428
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,144
Are you her lawyer?

429
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,677
No, no, no.
Um, i'm her advocate.

430
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:43,611
Actually, i'm here
about her husband brad.

431
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:46,978
I think you met him.
I've a favor to ask.

432
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:50,444
I'm sorry,
but i can't help you.

433
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,544
Oh, uh, mr. Lee.

434
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:55,477
Mr. Lee?

435
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:56,878
Mr. Lee, please.

436
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:00,978
Derrik, how are you?

437
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:02,611
I'm good, doctor.

438
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,377
That's the doctor
who operated on me.

439
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:05,911
Hi, i'm melinda gordon.

440
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:09,144
Oh, how you doing?
I'm dr. Devine.

441
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,978
You know, derrik was just telling
me what a wonderful surgeon you are.

442
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,144
Really? Well, you know,
without his help,

443
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:18,477
i'd probably be bagging
groceries down at the supermarket.

444
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:19,878
That's what happens

445
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,611
when they put old codgers
like me out to pasture.

446
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:23,278
I doubt that very much,
doctor.

447
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:25,944
Hope to see soon again,
mrs. Gordon.

448
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,011
Nice to meet you.

449
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,878
What do you want?

450
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:43,611
Your help.
Really, that's all.

451
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:47,144
Brad paulson hasn't been doing
so well since his wife's death.

452
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:48,944
He blames himself.
You were there.

453
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,311
I thought maybe you
could just talk to him.

454
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,744
It won't do any good.

455
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:54,844
Why not? It's not
like i'm asking you to...

456
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:56,410
hey. You don't know
what you're asking.

457
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,311
I am asking you to have
a little empathy

458
00:25:58,377 --> 00:26:01,711
for someone whose wife died
in your care.

459
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,410
Ok.

460
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:13,811
Ok, you wanna know
what happened?

461
00:26:13,878 --> 00:26:17,911
I'll be in the hospital
archives after my shift, 4:00.

462
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,477
I'll show you.

463
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:48,944
Long time no see.

464
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:51,111
You stalking me,
sweetheart?

465
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,444
Hardly.

466
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,944
It's a small town.

467
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,878
Perhaps we're just
fated to meet again.

468
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:57,444
Hmm.

469
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,878
Allow me.

470
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:04,477
7 bucks.

471
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:05,811
Fate is cheap.

472
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,677
You're quite funny.

473
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:08,878
You're easy.

474
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:09,878
Have dinner with me.

475
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:10,978
I said you were easy.

476
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:12,011
Why not?
Are you married?

477
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,011
No.

478
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,544
Boyfriend?

479
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:15,744
Not at present.

480
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:18,111
I'll let you choose
the restaurant then.

481
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:23,477
I'll think about it.

482
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,144
Lovely.

483
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:46,844
Hello?

484
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:13,711
Aah!

485
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:20,022
Are you crazy?

486
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:21,022
I'm sorry.

487
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,154
I didn't mean
to scare you.

488
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,287
I just about
had a heart attack.

489
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:25,055
Ok, well, you weren't
in the archives,

490
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,388
so i came looking for you.

491
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,454
I got lost, ok?

492
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:37,388
You know, they say
this place is haunted.

493
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,321
I've got news for you.
They're right.

494
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:40,688
Now let's go.

495
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,354
I don't know
where i'm going.

496
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:54,888
What's this?

497
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,122
You'll see.

498
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:01,855
Doctor on videotape:
Suction. Suction.

499
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,554
Doctor, the back
of the tube...

500
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:07,955
dr. Devine closed without suturing
the backside of the fallopian tube.

501
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:12,354
That's what i think
killed hope paulson.

502
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,721
What? How is
that possible?

503
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,888
Ego, incompetence.

504
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,221
An accident.

505
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:19,721
Things happen.

506
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:21,055
But if you've
got it on tape,

507
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,055
why hasn't anybody
done anything about it?

508
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:27,254
Because dr. Devine
has been here for 30 years.

509
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:30,088
He's respected and beloved,

510
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:33,088
so he's damn near
untouchable.

511
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:35,321
So nobody did anything?
You didn't?

512
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,254
I tried. Ok?

513
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,755
I filed a complaint
with the review board.

514
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,988
It was investigated
and dismissed.

515
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:46,755
It's my word against his,
and nobody's gonna take my word.

516
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,955
I can't believe it.

517
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,888
Look, melinda, i'm sorry,
but...

518
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,688
that's just the way it is.

519
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:55,088
Can i keep this?

520
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,254
Yeah, why not?

521
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,721
This case is dead and buried.

522
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:15,354
So how did a nice girl like you
end up in a small town like this?

523
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:18,721
Shouldn't you be off running
the world somewhere?

524
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:21,655
Actually, i already did.

525
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:25,287
I was an assistant d. a.
In new york.

526
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,521
Fraud cases, mostly.

527
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:29,788
Tough guys.

528
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:36,921
You sold me a counterfeit
watch, didn't you, anthony?

529
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:39,022
Hi. Would you like
to hear the specials?

530
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,354
Hold on, junior.

531
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,955
You're gonna do the
right thing here, anthony,

532
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:44,354
starting with
paying me back.

533
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:45,955
And if you don't,

534
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:49,788
i'm gonna make it my singular
ambition to put your ass in jail.

535
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:51,788
I can just come back.
That's no problem.

536
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:52,788
Don't bother.

537
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:54,855
You know where
to find me.

538
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:03,588
Ah, just the check then?

539
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,354
Ok. Ok.

540
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:26,354
Woman: I love you.

541
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,421
Bye-bye.

542
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:31,788
Drive carefully.

543
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,788
See you tonight.

544
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:52,488
Come in.

545
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,421
Mrs. Devine?

546
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,588
Yes.

547
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,088
Hi. I'm melinda gordon.

548
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,554
Yes?

549
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:15,788
I was just wondering if i could
talk to you about your husband.

550
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:18,788
My husband has an illness.

551
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:23,721
Early onset dementia.

552
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:27,221
I was in denial for years.

553
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:31,621
On any given day,
he still is.

554
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,321
He's this bad?

555
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,888
Not yet.

556
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,388
But he will be.

557
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,955
I made those cards for him.

558
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,388
It'll help here
in the house.

559
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,421
But i can't protect him
out there.

560
00:32:45,488 --> 00:32:48,187
At work, for example.

561
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:53,788
It must be so devastating to see
your husband going through this.

562
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,655
I've been praying for somebody
to help me help him.

563
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,788
I don't know
where you came from,

564
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,921
but you are a blessing.

565
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:06,621
I think my husband
might say it's fate.

566
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,655
Fate or not,
mine won't go gently.

567
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,022
No.

568
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:13,588
But you'll be right
there to hold his hand.

569
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:14,921
Yes, i will.

570
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:24,221
Dr. Devine's
losing his mind?

571
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:26,855
Losing his mind
would be a blessing.

572
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,888
It's deteriorating
slowly.

573
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:35,721
Sometimes people know what's happening
to them and are able to hide it

574
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:39,554
until they can't,
and then...

575
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:41,855
sometimes
people get hurt.

576
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,454
You mean like me.

577
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:47,122
Yes, like you.

578
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,055
Because of his illness,

579
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:53,254
dr. Devine forgot to properly
suture your fallopian tube,

580
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,921
something he's done
a thousand times.

581
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:58,488
He made a mistake?!

582
00:33:58,554 --> 00:33:59,988
Is that what
you're telling me?

583
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:08,055
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,588
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,114
Am i supposed
to feel good

586
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,281
that my wife
was the victim

587
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:29,781
of a doctor's
stupid mistake?

588
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:34,614
No. But if you'll allow
yourself, maybe relieved.

589
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,781
At least now you know
you weren't to blame.

590
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:42,714
Brad, if you could talk to hope
right now, what would you say?

591
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:46,948
I can't,
so what's the point?

592
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:47,981
Why can't you?

593
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,881
She's dead.

594
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:51,315
Can you talk
to the dead?

595
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,714
He always was
a know-it-all.

596
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:57,514
Brad, if you could say
anything at all,

597
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,014
anything, what would it be?

598
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:01,381
I'd say...

599
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:07,214
i'd say...

600
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:11,647
good-bye.

601
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:16,415
I can't.

602
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,614
"Brad...

603
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:29,048
"i know you feel
like this is your fault,

604
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:32,114
"but i want you to know
that i don't blame you.

605
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:35,781
"You've always taken better care
of me than i have myself.

606
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:37,214
"From the day i first...

607
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,547
hope, takes over: ... laid
eyes on you in detention.

608
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,948
And that hasn't
changed today.

609
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,948
I never felt more
in love with you

610
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:49,114
than when i watched you all
worried and sweaty and care-worn,

611
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,014
running beside the gurney
when they wheeled me in here.

612
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:57,447
So please, please...

613
00:35:57,514 --> 00:36:00,881
don't wallow.

614
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:10,647
Oh, and if i'm not awake
when you get back...

615
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:14,480
don't forget to feed
daisy and walk her.

616
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:20,480
Melinda's voice joins:
See you tomorrow.

617
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,814
I love you.

618
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,148
Hope. "

619
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:40,248
Well...

620
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:48,181
i guess we're even.

621
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:00,014
Thank you.

622
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,480
Oh. Heh.

623
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:34,981
Can i help you? Um, do
you have an appointment?

624
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:39,214
No. No, but i'd like to help you
if you'll let me.

625
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:40,981
What do you mean?
I don't, uh...

626
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:43,014
i know about your condition.

627
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:45,647
What condition?

628
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,714
I talked to your wife.

629
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,148
Margaret?
Yes.

630
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:50,781
I've been to your house.
I've seen the cards.

631
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:51,914
She told me everything.

632
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:55,181
I don't believe you.
She would never...

633
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:58,948
your wife has been dead
for 2 years.

634
00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:00,547
Margaret?

635
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,114
For god's sake.

636
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,514
You have to stop practicing
medicine, matthew.

637
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,148
That's why i stayed.

638
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:12,914
That's the only reason i
stayed, to help you do that.

639
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:15,847
She says you have to stop
practicing medicine.

640
00:38:15,914 --> 00:38:17,681
She stayed to help you.

641
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:20,248
You had such
a wonderful career.

642
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:22,415
You've achieved everything
you ever wanted to.

643
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,148
It's time to let go.

644
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,547
I'm calling security.

645
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:27,148
Wait.
Wait.

646
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:30,014
There was a proverb he used
to quote. He'll remember.

647
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,381
She says that you used
to quote a proverb.

648
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:37,781
Who is this skilled physician,
but he who prevents illness?

649
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,081
She says, who's this
skilled physician...

650
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:41,114
but he...

651
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:45,681
it's he...
who can prevent...

652
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:49,248
illness. Yes.

653
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:53,881
You're not that man
anymore, my love.

654
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,447
Margaret:
I think you know that.

655
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,348
But how?

656
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:02,415
How could you
possibly have known?

657
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,281
She says it
breaks her heart,

658
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:07,981
but you're not
that doctor anymore.

659
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,847
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

660
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:17,948
She's giving you
permission not to.

661
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:37,547
Hey! Guess what miracle
happened while you were out.

662
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:39,114
Can't imagine.

663
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,480
The watch guy showed up.

664
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,614
Apparently, he just
couldn't live with himself

665
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,447
knowing
he'd ripped us off.

666
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:48,781
Huh...

667
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:51,348
i guess the glass
really is half full today.

668
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,348
Thanks, bobby.

669
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:57,547
Bobby: Hey,
no problem.

670
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:08,114
That was bobby.

671
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:10,580
You told him no softball tonight, right?

672
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:13,081
The police id'd
my john doe.

673
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:18,315
Turns out he was released
from prison last week in ohio.

674
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,514
7 years
for attempted murder.

675
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,514
God.

676
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,181
Told his cellmate
that when he got out

677
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:28,681
he was gonna find his old
lady and "fix her for good. "

678
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:32,647
He was 2 miles from her house
when he crashed the motorcycle.

679
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:35,381
So... if i hadn't
picked him up

680
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,881
or if he'd recovered...

681
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:40,348
he might have come back
and killed his wife.

682
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,514
Well...

683
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,315
once again...
cosmic law of french toast.

684
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:49,547
]sighs]

685
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,681
Come in.

686
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:55,981
oh...
