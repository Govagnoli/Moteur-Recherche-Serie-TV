1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,100
I'm married,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,300
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,200
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,400
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,200
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,500
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,900
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,700
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:33,500
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:40,407
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:47,406
Ok, this is ridiculous.
Tim stiffed you again?

14
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,101
Yeah. And it had to be the night
I find a possible homicide.

15
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:55,200
And guess who gets to drive
all the way down to central?

16
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:59,602
Oh, that really is a long drive.
Listen, don't try to be a hero, ok?

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,303
Get yourself a bed down there.
Bet you're sleepy.

18
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:07,703
Well, why don't you give me a little
something to stay up for? Like...

19
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:11,103
what are you wearing?

20
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:12,402
Nothing.

21
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,403
No! No, no, no. Tonight it's
pink flannel pyjama, isn't it?

22
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:17,703
Ok, yes, it is.

23
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:20,102
But you know what? You either get
sexy wife or sensible wife,

24
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,502
and you're not home, so it's sensible.

25
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,503
Fair enough.

26
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,601
Climb into bed.
I'll be home soon.

27
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,300
Ok. Love you.

28
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,201
Love you, too.

29
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,600
Evening, sir.

30
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,001
Clancy. Long time no see.

31
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,603
- What's happening, Harold?
- The usual party.

32
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,700
Just don't ask what we use for piÑatas.

33
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:50,400
- Need a hand?
- Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.

34
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:55,403
All right, on 3.
And... 3.

35
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,603
You couldn't take time
to aspirate the guy for me?

36
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,302
Sorry. I'm flying solo.

37
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,601
Flaherty was supposed to come with
but he bagged out on me.

38
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,803
- How about you? Busy night?
- Not really.

39
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,700
Although mr. Krushenzo should
lighten things up for us.

40
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,500
- Autoerotic asphyxiation, huh?
- God bless the weird ones.

41
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:24,202
- What's this guy's deal?
- John Doe. No I.D.

42
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:30,602
Nothing in the files. He's gonna
have to stay on ice until
somebody comes forward.

43
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,302
He's missing his middle toe.

44
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,803
That looks new.
Did you check records on him?

45
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, I did. He hadn't had
any foot surgery recently, so...

46
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,901
I'm back at square zero.

47
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:48,202
- Say hi to Melinda for me, will you?
- All right. Will do.

48
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,801
Thanks, Harold.

49
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,903
All right, you take it easy here.

50
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,200
Great.

51
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,802
Episode 2x16
"The Walk-In"

52
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,501
Who are you?

53
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,002
Can you show me?

54
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:39,201
Ok, maybe you're confused.

55
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:43,803
And you don't understand yet
that you're dead.

56
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:45,301
No.

57
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:50,902
Do you remember anything about
what happened when you died?

58
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:54,302
I don't think I did.

59
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,902
Hi Mel.

60
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:59,401
It's not a look I was hopen to see.

61
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,303
Yeah, we had a...

62
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,003
a visitor, but he's gone now.

63
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,202
Well, I hope I didn't
bring him home with me.

64
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:08,103
Didn't you tell me once
that ghosts hate morgues?

65
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:11,601
Yeah, they do.
There's no energy for them.

66
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:15,100
It seemed like a new spirit, though.
Maybe he was confused?

67
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,301
Well, let's hope so.

68
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,600
???

69
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:24,102
Oh, no, thanks.

70
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,502
Ok.

71
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,702
Ok.

72
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:48,100
- You have a good night's sleep.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

73
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,002
Are you...

74
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:56,702
not wearing what I think
you're not wearing?

75
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,901
Hey, buddy.

76
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,700
No.

77
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,800
No no.
You don't get to "hey, buddy" me.

78
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,503
What the hell happened to you?

79
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:13,700
Do you know how much grief I've gotten
from my wife because of you?

80
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,101
You stood up Delia, Melinda's
friend and my friend, and...

81
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,000
Look, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:21,503
I... I didn't know
how to face you or her.

83
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,400
What happened?

84
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,003
Look, it was the pressure. All right?

85
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,701
We... we were just running
into each other round town.

86
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:33,000
???

87
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,403
Ok.

88
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,703
So then you just don't show up.

89
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,201
What are you trying to do,
get her to hate you?

90
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:45,502
Sometimes it's more fun to think
about things than actually have them.

91
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:51,201
All right, Flaherty.
You're my friend. I won't judge.

92
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,703
Much.

93
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:56,301
Wait. I got totally turned around.
That's why I'm back.

94
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:56,802
What?

95
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,501
I'm gonna make it right with you,
I'm gonna make it right with Delia.

96
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,703
At least you realize you're a moron.
That's a good first step.

97
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:05,400
But Delia?

98
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,901
Good luck with that one.

99
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,600
You watch.

100
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,800
Flaher...
Did you see my ring?

101
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,102
No.

102
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:40,401
All of this because you lost
your paramedic ring?

103
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:44,002
- No, really, it was stolen.
- How do you know?

104
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:46,800
I saw these.

105
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,403
And that's not all.

106
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:53,001
You see how the middle toe's
missing on the right foot?

107
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,001
I've seen that before.

108
00:07:56,106 --> 00:08:00,500
Tell me this is just a prank or a dream.
I'll accept either one.

109
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,803
Harold, how do you lose a body?

110
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,902
My boss wants to know the same thing.

111
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,902
It's gonna be my ass if I can't
come up with an explanation.

112
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:11,200
All I can tell you is,
last night the power went out.

113
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:14,801
I went to check the circuit breaker.
I hear this bang.

114
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:18,802
Come back in here...
he's gone.

115
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,802
All I got are the digitals
that I took of the body.

116
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,800
Can I see them?

117
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,800
- Look, Harold, could somebody
have stolen the body? - No! No.

118
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:32,401
We're locked up solid. You know that.
We haven't had a break-in since
the early nineties.

119
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:37,201
- What about the guy I brought in?
- He's fine. Still here. He hasn't moved.

120
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,302
- How did this guy die?
- It was an anonymous hit-and-run.

121
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,903
You're sure he's dead, right?

122
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,101
She's got a point.

123
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,902
- He could have got up and walked out.
The guy I brought... - Excuse me.

124
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:50,500
I've been doing this a while.
I know dead.

125
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:53,702
Look. Take a look at this.

126
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,602
This is a morbidity thermometer.
We use it to measure body temperature.

127
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,901
Helps us determine when somebody died.

128
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,502
I haven't cleared it since
I took John Doe's temp last night.

129
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:03,901
90 degrees.

130
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,402
See, a body cools one degree per hour.

131
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:11,002
This is not a prank.
This is rigor mortis.

132
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:17,502
I gotta go let somebody in downstairs.
Don't touch anything.

133
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,501
Thanks, Harold.

134
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,803
All right, are you sure that
the ghost from last night

135
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,600
- is the guy in the photograph?
- Yeah, positive.

136
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,703
- I got a really good look im last
night. - How can this be happening?

137
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,102
Somebody came back from the dead.

138
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,500
- No, and if he has, why would he
also appear as... - I'm sorry.

139
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,101
I'm sorry. It's not me.

140
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,501
What?

141
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,602
He's here.

142
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,602
The--the--in the photo?

143
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,100
They can't hear me.
Why can't they hear me?

144
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:47,200
- Who?
- Them!

145
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,807
- Ok, tell me what's happening.
- Tell me what's happening.

146
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,706
My body is moving.

147
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:56,103
- You mean your body's being moved.
- No! I'm running. My feet are bleeding.

148
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,403
I cut them trying to escape.
I... but I didn't want to escape.

149
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,801
What's wrong with me?

150
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:17,703
People are starring at me.

151
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:23,102
I've stolen something.
There's--there's people.

152
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,901
Soldiers.

153
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,601
Soldiers?

154
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,701
Statues.

155
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:32,003
He's moving.
He's in village square.

156
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:36,001
How can they see me if I'm dead?

157
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:51,001
This footage is from the security
cameras at the dry cleaners. Jim got it.

158
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,802
Big brother comes to Grandview.

159
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,601
Can we just watch
and try not to speak?

160
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:57,403
You're not gonna ask me
to solve a crime, are you?

161
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,903
I mean, I appreciate the fact that you
think I'm all things to all people.

162
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,901
- The shoplifter is dead. - Dead,
that seems like a harsh punishment.

163
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,201
They don't fool around
at this dry cleaners.

164
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,901
He is dead while he's shoplifting.
We are watching him dead.

165
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:11,000
- Dead man walking.
- Dead man shopping.

166
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:14,403
We think that he took Jim's ring.

167
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,400
- What do you know about voodoo?
- I don't know.

168
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,502
- What I've seen in horror movies?
- That's unfortunate, but it's typical.

169
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:20,901
It's all right.

170
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,503
The voodoo culture is very,
very rich in history.

171
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:25,902
They believe in something
called tri-bon-age.

172
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,801
Which roughly translates to
"earth soul".

173
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:31,802
The haitians believe that when you die,
your earth soul is released to the cosmos,

174
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:35,102
but sometimes your earth soul gets
stuck. Maybe it even comes back

175
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:37,303
and gets put into a corpse.

176
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,100
- Ever heard of zombies?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,701
Yeah, probably what you've
seen in the movies.

178
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,300
Well, the myth starts, somebody,
usually a voodoo priest

179
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,902
can take that earth soul, put it
into a corpse, and control it,

180
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:49,002
make it do whatever it wants.
Walk, talk, whatever.

181
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,102
But sometimes the earth soul...
not very happy about it.

182
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,203
And that's why it's coming to me.

183
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,702
Did you see how clumsy
it was in that video?

184
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,301
Yeah, like he couldn't
stand on its feet.

185
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,603
Yeah, it's like the soul is trying
restore control over the body.

186
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,403
They're literally at war
with each other, Melinda

187
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,403
Ok, so if the ghost in the body
is coming to me,

188
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,200
then who's actually in the body?

189
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,100
We've been talking for, like 3 minutes.
You might want to give me 8-9 minutes

190
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,000
before I unravel the entire mystery, ok?

191
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,401
- Ok, sorry.
- It's ok.

192
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,402
- You know what I say about
instant gratification? - What?

193
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,403
Takes too long.

194
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,503
So here's what we got.

195
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:20,803
We have an occupying force in the body
that we must have leave the body.

196
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,203
Which means you are going to need this.

197
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,102
Didn't I get this at the 99 cent store?

198
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,403
Maybe. I got mine at bed,
bath, and voodoo.

199
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:33,100
But this one was blessed
by a haitian voodoo shaman.

200
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,400
Oh, what that is is actually a spirit jar.

201
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:41,400
You light a fire inside and it guides
the earth soul to it, helps it cross over.

202
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,802
Or it's for keeping mosquitoes away.
It might be a candle or something.

203
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:48,302
It's useful either way.

204
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,302
I like this.

205
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,700
It makes me feel calm.

206
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,900
My name is Melinda.

207
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:09,400
Can you tell me something about
yourself, like your name?

208
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,902
Bryan.

209
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,103
- Bryan Curtis.
- Bryan, great.

210
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,803
That's a great start.

211
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:24,003
This candle's supposed to help you
cross over into the light.

212
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,602
Do you see a light?

213
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,202
Not yet.

214
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,403
Not while these things
are happening to my body.

215
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,003
Who's controlling you?
Can you see him?

216
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,900
No.

217
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:42,302
But it's... it's hard.

218
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,503
I loose track of who I am,
when he is doing this.

219
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,203
Where I am.

220
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:51,803
You were able to give me a detail
last time to help me figure out

221
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:54,803
where you were.
Can you do that again?

222
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,902
There's a light.

223
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,302
A blue or white light.

224
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:05,001
Wait, I... I can see it.
It's... it's neon.

225
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,100
- There's a neon sign.
- What does it say?

226
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,502
Uh... there's... it's an "x"!

227
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:15,202
Or letter... a "p", "r"...

228
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know if this is the right place,
but it's the closest I can figure out.

229
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:32,500
I think, someone got here
before we did.

230
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:35,500
Mel, I'm sure the cops are coming.
You think this is a good idea?

231
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,102
Well, it's the only way we can
free Bryan from whoever

232
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:44,003
or whatever's controlling him.
I can't do that if he's in jail.

233
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,503
It's the body from the morgue.

234
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,003
That's him.

235
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,001
Why is he making that noise?

236
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:01,400
I think he's trying to set his own ribs.
Remember, he got hit by that car?

237
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,101
Uhh... Bryan?

238
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,102
It's me. Melinda.

239
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:10,103
Do you remember?
You came to me.

240
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:15,403
Do all your ghosts look like this?

241
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,901
No.
He's a zombie.

242
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:24,502
- Are you ready to cross over yet?
- I can't. Not till he's out of my body.

243
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,103
No... I need to find her.

244
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:33,300
Um... who are you?

245
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,303
What's going on?

246
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,600
There's another ghost inside
Bryan's body. He's just a kid.

247
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,803
I have to find her.

248
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:45,001
I need to finish the list.

249
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,701
That's not normal.

250
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:10,101
Yeah.

251
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,601
Now I have to cross over 2 ghosts.

252
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,028
The idea of a ghost in a dead body
is not as out there as it sounds.

253
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,232
See, the thing that bothers me
is that usually when a ghost

254
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,035
takes over a living body,
it's in short spurts.

255
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,039
But this ghost is just running
full-bore over this person.

256
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,842
Which takes everything you and I know
about the supernatural and pretty much

257
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:32,248
just blows it out of the water.

258
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:35,853
Hey, let's say Kurt Cobain
takes over Elvis' body.

259
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,359
Does Elvis know new licks
on the guitar now?

260
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,763
Is he grundge?
I mean... what happens?

261
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,065
How much of your old body
do you bring into your new body?

262
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,969
And... and do the hips still work?

263
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:48,070
When I saw Bryan and the ghost
inside him, he looked like teenager.

264
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,577
Except there was something wrong
with one of his eyes. It drooped.

265
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,780
Drooped how? Like a muscular
spasm or a purposeful effect?

266
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,286
Spasm.

267
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,389
Spasm...

268
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:01,291
Do you remember how clumsy that
ghost was that we saw on the video?

269
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:04,397
- How he was having such a hard
time with his body? - Right.

270
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,504
Yeah. And then I gave you
some weirdo line. I said,

271
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,804
"the body and soul are literally
at war with each other."

272
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:10,910
Blah, blah, blah.

273
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,211
And you believed me,
'cause you always do.

274
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:18,018
But I think your truth might be
a little more grounded.

275
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,322
Is this what you saw, Melinda?

276
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,528
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,630
Yeah, well, this is very common
in degenerative diseases

278
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,633
that affect motor skills.
Multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy.

279
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,739
Maybe the ghost that took over
this body had a similar handicap.

280
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,547
- Uh, defect, whatever.
- He's not clumsy anymore.

281
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,150
Right! He's not clumsy,
'cause he's in his new body.

282
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,252
He's getting the lay of the land.

283
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:41,856
He's saying, hey, this isn't the old
dead me. This is the new dead me.

284
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,263
Not to mention,
living out his wildest dreams.

285
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:44,964
What do you mean?

286
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,667
If you couldn't walk, and you saw kids
running and jumping and doing

287
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:51,072
all the things you dreamed of doing,
when you could, wouldn't you

288
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:54,275
trade up for a new body? Wouldn't you
even come back from dead for a new body?

289
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,981
Ok, so you're telling me that
this kid waited for somebody to die

290
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,683
so he could come back and live
again without a handicap?

291
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:02,391
Do you think it's easy being
this brilliant, Melinda?

292
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,495
It's not.

293
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,095
Sometimes it makes...

294
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,901
it makes my head hurt, right here.

295
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,703
Ok, well, there may be more to it than that.

296
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,304
He said they had to find her
and finish some kind of list.

297
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:14,411
What do you mean, "her"?

298
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,213
He didn't say.

299
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,017
- You might have a problem.
- Why?

300
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,217
You said that ghost was 16 years old?

301
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,421
No you're dealing with something
that's more unpredictable

302
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,924
than a haitian death culture.
You're dealing with a teenage ghost

303
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:30,229
inside a man's body with raging
hormones looking for a girl.

304
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,936
Good luck.

305
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,301
Hello?

306
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,505
Hi, can I speak with Alyssa Adams, please?

307
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:20,311
- This is Alyssa.
- Oh, great! Hi! This is Melinda Gordon.

308
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,817
I'm actually looking for some
information on Jason Bennett.

309
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:27,521
I read your, uh, memorial page
in the yearbook.

310
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,627
Is this for the reunion reel?

311
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,030
Sorry?

312
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,932
For the 10-year reunion.

313
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:37,835
I was already contacted about this,
and I think his parents are
contributing something.

314
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:41,745
Yes! Yes, this is for the reunion.

315
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:44,248
The one this weekend, yeah.

316
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,453
You know, could we meet?

317
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:51,757
Because I'd really like to
talk to you more about him.

318
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,177
Hello?

319
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:05,179
Sorry. Did I set the ringer too loud?

320
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,987
Are you watching me?

321
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:12,092
Only in the fun way.
Not in that crazy stalker way.

322
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:15,195
What do you want?

323
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,804
Say I'm sorry.

324
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,005
You already did that.

325
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:22,210
This is phase two.

326
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:24,613
Look, you don't get to cue
your way out of this.

327
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,415
You left me standing on the street
waiting for you.

328
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,423
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that was?

329
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:31,824
And then I had to walk
home after that?

330
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:36,529
- I got no phone call, no explanation...
- But I have an explanation now.

331
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,035
It's too late.

332
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:44,640
And... since it took you this long,
you're even lamer than I thought.

333
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,248
True.

334
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:50,252
Completely, totally true. But...

335
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,358
if I could just buy you a cup of
coffee, you know, or any dark liquid.

336
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,362
Just have a minute.

337
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,366
Tim, I gave you a minute.

338
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:02,670
In fact, I gave you 30 long minutes.

339
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,975
And you blew it.

340
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:12,689
Well, we found one of his old yearbooks,

341
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:15,092
and there was a reference
to a special girl.

342
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,996
I was just wondering if you...

343
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:24,004
We loved each other,
but... just friends.

344
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,717
- He was so active.
- Yeah.

345
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,123
He had muscular dystrophy, but he didn't
like to let one day go by

346
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:39,329
without feeling like
he accomplished something.

347
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:41,735
Like on the day we met,
it was in detention.

348
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:42,936
Hmm, detention.

349
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:47,039
He was in detention all the time.

350
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:49,645
Do you know those old
showers in the chem lab

351
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:53,650
with that emergency handle just in
case some kid sets himself on fire?

352
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:59,756
He rolled himself under one of those
and shouted, "name the movie."

353
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:04,965
Jason dripping wet in detention and
just furious that no one figured it out.

354
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,373
- Flashdance?
- Yeah.

355
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,981
I was the first to give him
the right answer.

356
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,386
And he said, I had no choice.

357
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,790
We would have to be
best friends from then on.

358
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,791
It's been 10 years,
and I still miss him.

359
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:23,599
We pulled so many schemes together.

360
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,502
Just to feel like he could live.

361
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,706
Is that why you took out
the page in the yearbook?

362
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:32,113
"Not one day wasted"?

363
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,515
Yeah.

364
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:38,121
What's this list?

365
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:43,527
At the end, Jason spent
a lot of time in the hospital.

366
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:48,335
And it should have been
the worst time, but it wasn't.

367
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:51,944
We dreamed up a list of things
to do before we died.

368
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:56,449
- "Bungee jump off Grand Canyon"?
- Him.

369
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,457
- "Open a studio in Paris."
- Yeah, so I could work on my collages.

370
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:04,364
He knew that he would
never leave that room,

371
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:09,369
and it couldn't stop him from
dreaming. It meant so much to him.

372
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:12,274
Well, you kept the list. It must
have meant something to you too.

373
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:13,978
No.

374
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:14,982
The further the you get
from high school,

375
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:19,185
the harder it is to make
your dreams come true.

376
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:22,191
I still enjoy my art,
but I am not going to be selling it

377
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:26,096
next to the Eiffel Tower anytime soon.

378
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:30,100
Jason's the one that could
have done it. Not me.

379
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:33,307
What about this last thing?
"Find Stephanie Hardwick"?

380
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,214
Homecoming queen.

381
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,514
The girl everybody loved.

382
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:41,721
He wanted to find her
at the reunion and kiss her.

383
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,828
Really?

384
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,227
What guy wouldn't wanna
kiss the homecoming queen?

385
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:49,933
But... why at the reunion?
I mean what was special about it?

386
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:52,837
By 2007, Jason...

387
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,842
he was sure they'd have
a cure for his M.D.

388
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,649
And he'd be able to walk
into the reunion, and...

389
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,552
Be the man he dreamed of being.

390
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:04,359
I mean, who doesn't want to go
to their high school reunion

391
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,160
- not looking like a rock star?
- Yeah, I know.

392
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:10,263
Jason waited for a body he knew
would fit in at the reunion.

393
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:13,969
Someone his own age, someone handsome.
Even the clothes he took.

394
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,976
Yeah, just to impress miss Stephanie.

395
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:19,382
Before he plants one on her.

396
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,887
Oh, god. If he gets to her
before I can stop him...

397
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:24,091
You should slip her
an altoid at least.

398
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:28,391
Ok, you know what?
That is not funny.

399
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,701
Here she is.

400
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:39,911
You know, what if the body that
Jason took wasn't an accident?

401
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:41,617
What do you mean?

402
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,021
Stephanie Hardwick.
Homecoming queen.

403
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:44,925
Yeah?

404
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:48,725
Look at the homecoming king.

405
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,033
Bryan and Jason were classmates.

406
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:55,338
Jason didn't pick a random body.

407
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,440
He picked the body.

408
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,345
Of her date 10 years ago.

409
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:03,651
"Varsity quarterback, valedictorian."

410
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,756
Well, looks like the most popular guy
at school is gonna be going to his

411
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,358
high school reunion after all.

412
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:13,763
Yeah. He'll just be a lot
different than they remember.

413
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:45,715
Usually a corpse is gonna
take 6 to 8 days to decay.

414
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,321
We're only on day 3.

415
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:50,325
That's assuming a perfect stress-free
environment here. Which we don't have.

416
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:52,829
I mean, this guy is really putting
his body through the ringer.

417
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:54,731
So how long will it be
before he breaks down?

418
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,333
- I would say 6, maybe 8 hours.
- That soon?

419
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,739
Maybe less, if he keeps jumping
through flaming hoops.

420
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:01,642
My gosh, nature's running
its course on this guy.

421
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,346
When we first found him,
he was trying to set his ribs.

422
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,050
Well, he probably knows
his body won't hold out on him.

423
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,654
So if you were trying to preserve
your body for as long as possible,
what would you do?

424
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:13,357
I would get some kind of makeup.
Maybe the type a mortician would use.

425
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:15,765
Cover up the appearance of dead skin.

426
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:18,267
Ok. There's only one
mortuary in Grandview.

427
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,071
Thanks.

428
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,375
Jim?

429
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:38,601
Hey, dead guy.

430
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,805
Can I have my ring back?

431
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:42,109
How's he been?

432
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:45,911
Fine, once I restrained him.

433
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,014
Is this really necessary?
I'm sorry, all right?

434
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,723
Jason, we can't let you
go to that reunion.

435
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:53,723
Why not?
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

436
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,228
No, but you wanted to kiss that
Stephanie Hardwick, you know?

437
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:58,232
The last thing on your list? Come on.

438
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,836
I was never actually gonna do that.
That was... that was just a goof.

439
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:07,344
I just wanted to go and enjoy myself.

440
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:11,148
Ok, even if that's true, your body's
breaking down, and you're not Bryan.

441
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,653
You lived your life, and you
can't steal somebody else's.

442
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:15,857
I didn't steal it.

443
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,762
He abandoned it.
There's a big difference.

444
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:23,768
You've been haunting him
this whole time, haven't you?

445
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:26,176
Not haunting, just...

446
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:28,379
checking in.

447
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:30,983
I was curious to see what
mr. Most Likely To Succeed

448
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,686
was gonna do with his life
after he dropped out of college.

449
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,491
Whoa. Back up.
He dropped out of college?

450
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:42,997
- He barely made it through a semester.
Isn't that right, Bryan? - Shut up.

451
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,603
You wanna tell her what happened
after graduation, or should I?

452
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:47,912
Shut up.

453
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:53,714
- You don't know what it was like.
- Well, actually, I... do.

454
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:58,120
You see, life wasn't so kind
after senior year.

455
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:02,229
College ball was a little tougher,
classes took a little bit more effort,

456
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,436
Bryan just couldn't juggle it all
like he could when he was 17,

457
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,041
and he ended up getting
cut from the team,

458
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,244
eventually dropped out from the school,
and basically spent the last 10 years

459
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:15,151
studying his life from
the bottom of the class.

460
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,954
Is that true?

461
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,258
I mean he coasted on charm for a while.

462
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:24,662
He was always good with the girls,
but even that faded.

463
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,869
It gets to a point where girls
really aren't interested in guy

464
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,472
who can't keep a job
for longer than 6 months.

465
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:34,181
I mean, even Stephanie,
the homecoming queen

466
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,784
moved on,
got engaged to that, uh...

467
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:39,589
that guy, uh, Rick.

468
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:43,395
Second string on the football team.

469
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,599
That wasn't fair.

470
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:48,405
He didn't deserve her.

471
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:51,307
I mean, how could I show up
at a reunion and...

472
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:56,111
- I didn't have a choice.
- He ended up in a bar, alone.

473
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:59,818
Trying to convince a complete stranger
to go to our reunion with him.

474
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,625
Come on! You'll be doing me
this huge favor.

475
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,230
No, look. I just met you.

476
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:06,331
Look, please.

477
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,135
Oh, god. Just leave me alone.

478
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:14,340
What do you do when you realize
you peaked in high school?

479
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:17,749
I mean when you got nothing to
live for, how do you talk to all

480
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:21,253
those people and all they remember
is how you used to be?

481
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:25,460
Do you face them like you
freeze yourself in time

482
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:30,965
and leave nothing but a memory
and a good-looking corpse?

483
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,677
No!

484
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:42,222
You were too scared to live?

485
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,818
It was too hard.

486
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,317
All of it was just too hard.

487
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:48,714
Oh, boo-hoo.

488
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,411
Tell that to the kid who spent
his life in a wheelchair.

489
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:55,710
Bryan, you told me that you
didn't have any unfinished business.

490
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:59,904
This reunion is your
unfinished business.

491
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:02,601
I can't...

492
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,498
I can't walk in there
and just see all those people.

493
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,095
And what?

494
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:12,393
Face a difficult choice
for once in your life?

495
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:18,287
I mean, do you realize what
I would have done with just... one?

496
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:23,982
Just one of those chances
that you... threw away.

497
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:31,873
Do you promise that you
won't harass Stephanie?

498
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,070
I swear on my life.

499
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:39,264
You konw what I mean.

500
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,961
Cut Jason loose.

501
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:45,756
- Uh, you sure about this?
- Yes, I am sure.

502
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:47,655
It's the only way I'm gonna be
able to cross both of them over

503
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:52,354
is to get both of them
back to the reunion.

504
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:56,648
Let's go back to the high school.

505
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:07,438
Are you sure this looks natural?
This foundation seems a little heavy.

506
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:10,132
Jason, this is the least
of your problems, ok?

507
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:13,731
Just stay out of direct light.
It'll make the makeup look better and...

508
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,926
well, stop you from melting.

509
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,623
Got it.

510
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:20,122
And what about me?

511
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:24,120
And what happens when everybody
asks me, "hey, man, you know."

512
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,716
"What you been doing with
yourself the past 10 years"?

513
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:28,111
I don't know.
Tell 'em the truth.

514
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:31,012
Another guy is going to my
reunion in my body, Melinda.

515
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,306
I think we're being a little loose
with the truth, don't you think?

516
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,506
Ok, fine.
We'll make a deal.

517
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,004
Jason goes in, he will say
and do exactly what you want.

518
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:43,297
Trade-off is that you
have to be honest

519
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,694
with your old friends
and even with yourself.

520
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,692
- Deal?
- Deal.

521
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:52,890
Fine, I'll do it.

522
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,187
- But I won't enjoy it.
- Me neither.

523
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,352
Hey, man, what you been doing
with yourself the last 10 years?

524
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,948
I was a paramedic
for a couple of years.

525
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,045
Paramedic? Cool.

526
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:39,540
All right, this is not helping.

527
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,137
Ok, guys.

528
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,433
What?

529
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,633
You lying about Bryan's past.
That was not part of our deal.

530
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,830
Fine with me.
Really.

531
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,925
Bryan had to tell the truth.
You didn't say anythinlg about me.

532
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:55,122
Besides, you were the one
who was worried about anybody

533
00:33:55,225 --> 00:34:01,121
noticing a corpse in the midst.
I had to come up with some ali...

534
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:04,617
There she is. Wow.
She hasn't changed a bit.

535
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:06,113
Oh, god.

536
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:07,709
This is it.

537
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,309
I gotta go and say hi.

538
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,104
No. Hold it.

539
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:17,002
You made me a promise and so far,
you are batting zero on your word.

540
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:20,998
Hey, talk.
That's all. I swear.

541
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,194
Thank you.

542
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,191
Bryan!

543
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:30,790
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, hey. Uh, Rick.

544
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:32,785
So, what's been going on with you?

545
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,083
Uh, not much.

546
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:37,381
- I was, uh, I was just gonna say hi...
- Yeah, you know we're engaged now?

547
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,978
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I read that.

548
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,676
- Congratulations.
- God, that must kill you a little bit.

549
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:44,973
'Cause you guys were so cute
as a couple, and then,

550
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,469
the star quarterback
loses her to the backup.

551
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:50,667
Ok, you know what? Maybe we should
go and talk to somebody else. Hello.

552
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,266
No, you're not going anywhere.
This guy's a jealous punk.

553
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,061
He always has been.

554
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:58,559
So I heard you're a big,
heroic paramedic now.

555
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:00,656
That is great.
I'm so happy for you.

556
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:06,255
But that was after you blew
the big game against state, right?

557
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:09,448
- Man, that was a long time ago.
Who cares? - I care.

558
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,843
Because some things don't change.

559
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:15,044
Like what coach used to tell us.
"You gotta want it."

560
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,038
You still want it, Bryan?
Or did you give up?

561
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:21,737
Ok, Jason, you're gonna
repeat everything I say.

562
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:27,132
- We really don't have time for this.
- We made a deal.

563
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:32,228
All right, here's what
you're gonna say.

564
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:35,123
You're right, Rick. I did give up.

565
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:39,417
And another day goes by right on
think about how much I wasted,

566
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,016
how many opportunities I let
slip because I was too scared.

567
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:49,107
But you come to the point where
you need to let your regrets go, too,

568
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,703
or they take over your wife.

569
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:52,803
I was lucky.

570
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:56,001
I got that chance.

571
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:01,893
Not everybody does.

572
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:09,590
Also, 3 years ago,
I totally nailed your sister.

573
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,182
Was that last part really necessary?

574
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:16,180
Yeah. Did you see
the look on his face?

575
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:19,975
Yeah, and he's pissed at me.

576
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:27,767
Stay away from her, you loser.

577
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:36,957
Why you gotta be such a jerk?

578
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:44,052
Bryan! I'm so sorry about Rick.
Are you all right?

579
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:47,146
I'm fine.
I'm just gonna go get cleaned up.

580
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,743
You look great, bu the way.

581
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:54,343
It's all right.
We are leaving right now.

582
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:00,832
Just a little further, ok?

583
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:02,031
What can we do?

584
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:08,030
I don't know. We can't send him
to a hospital. He's already dead.

585
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:16,218
This does not... feel good.

586
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,514
This is all my fault.
Why can't I keep my mouth shut?

587
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,814
Jason, you don't have a lot of time.

588
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,708
Is there a message that you
want me to give to Stephanie?

589
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:27,106
Anything that you want me to tell her?

590
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:30,403
What's that light?

591
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:34,698
No. No, Jason, you stay with me, ok?

592
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:38,895
Jason, just stay with me, please?

593
00:37:57,377 --> 00:38:01,074
What are you guys looking at?

594
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,070
You're here.

595
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,967
Well, yeah, I'm here.

596
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:09,062
I mean, I'm a ghost again,
but you know that. That's ok.

597
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:11,160
Yeah, but I thought you were
going into the light.

598
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:13,157
You said "what is that light?".

599
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,758
Yeah, I think that was actually the,
uh, the streetlamp.

600
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,653
Behind you, it was giving you a kind of a weird glow.

601
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,250
It made you look like angel.

602
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:27,545
- I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.

603
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,340
I do have one last favor.

604
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:35,038
There is a girl I need
to get a message to.

605
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:45,626
- How's Bryan?
- Oh, he's... he's fine.

606
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:48,323
- Um, could I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.

607
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:53,320
No problem. Maybe my
fiance's sobered up by now.

608
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:57,813
So it turns out that
I have something to give you.

609
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,612
What is it?

610
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,307
Jason wrote this.

611
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,001
It's his handwriting.

612
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,698
How is this possible?

613
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,698
It's a little hard to explain,
but the important thing is

614
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:16,395
that Jason wanted you to have it.

615
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:17,992
I don't deserve it.

616
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:20,888
Jason is the one who
accomplished everything.

617
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,587
I never did anything.

618
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,584
- No, that's not true.
- That's not true.

619
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:29,482
She looked at me and saw me...

620
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,075
and not just a kid in a wheelchair.

621
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:38,474
Do you remember how the really good
things that you said you saw in Jason?

622
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,867
He felt that.

623
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:43,167
He cherished it.

624
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:49,562
And he wouldn't have been able to...
live as much if it weren't for you.

625
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:53,656
Tell her to look at
the bottom of the list.

626
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:58,854
Oh, yeah. You should look
at the bottom of the list.

627
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,934
I wasn't even sure I wanted
to come to this reunion.

628
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:18,631
Thank you.

629
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:27,923
So... you guys ready to cross over now?

630
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:32,817
Well, you know, they're about to
present awards next, maybe...

631
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:37,812
maybe we'll get
"traveled furtherest to be here."

632
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:42,007
Jeez.

633
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:48,700
Are you as scared to go
into that as I am?

634
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:51,095
Uh...

635
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:53,594
yeah.

636
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,690
You don't have to be scared.

637
00:40:55,794 --> 00:40:59,687
- But what if I don't get it right?
- Not possible.

638
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,386
There's no way you could
get it wrong, so...

639
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:09,376
Let's...

640
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:12,374
let's go live a little.

641
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:15,273
Let it all go.

642
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:37,249
- So was Harold happy to have
his missing body back? - He was.

643
00:41:37,352 --> 00:41:40,147
And he didn't even ask why
dead guy was wearing suit.

644
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,845
The estate sale worked out well.

645
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:44,440
Hey, have you ever heard
of hair jewelry?

646
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,540
Yeah, it's a little bit of a scam.

647
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,332
What?

648
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:08,515
If you won't go to coffee,
the coffee will come to you.

649
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:12,014
He'll stay out there all day.
Believe me, he will.

650
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:17,809
Yeah, maybe you should just
go out there and get it over with.

651
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:54,803
