1
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:09,897
My name is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:14,664
I just got married.
Just moved to a small town.

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,597
Just opened up
an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:18,397
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,364
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

6
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,531
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

7
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:26,130
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:28,364
"Earthbound spirits"
my grandmother call them.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,698
They stay here because
they have unfinished business

10
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:32,963
with the living,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,397
and they come to me
for help.

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,531
To tell you my story,
i have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:01,397
No. I can't.
I can't do it.

14
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:02,897
[Laughing]
Yes, you can.

15
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,597
You're gonna be fine
when you get out there.

16
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,064
I won't. I am a coward.
I don't know
how i missed that.

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,331
Will you stop it?
You are the bravest
woman i know.

18
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:11,997
Now, take
a deep breath.

19
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,064
A better one.

20
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,130
Let's go out there.

21
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,264
Ok, ok. Can i have
your attention, please?

22
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,164
Uh... ok, ok.

23
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,431
I need to get
everybody's attention.

24
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:30,897
Uh, before we open

25
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,930
the mic tonight, i have
a little announcement
to make.

26
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:35,997
After 28 long years,

27
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:37,930
the club will be closing.
Aw...
aw...

28
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,230
see,

29
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:41,197
the truth is,
i lost my lease.

30
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:42,963
They want us
outta here.
Boo.

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,297
Time to move on.

32
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:46,997
But before we do,
we are gonna

33
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:48,631
part-ay.

34
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:50,698
That's right.

35
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,664
Every night
for the next 2 weeks,

36
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:55,331
we are gonna celebrate
the comedy cave...

37
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:58,030
and some
of the biggest comics
in the business today.

38
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,331
Yep.

39
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,731
They will all be back
to say good-bye...

40
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:02,897
louie kleinman,

41
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,731
the santander twins,

42
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,764
and on the 15th
and the 16th,

43
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,664
sandra holloway.

44
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,830
But w let's get down
to the business at hand.

45
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:17,297
It is cold.
It's rainy outside.

46
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:19,264
Must be open mic night.

47
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:20,364
Yeah!

48
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,597
Here we go.
First up...

49
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,497
mr. Bryce avalon.

50
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:32,431
Greetings, everybody.

51
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:33,464
All right.
Whoo!

52
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,030
Uh, the other day,

53
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:36,564
i was in my basement,

54
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,030
and i was eatin'
a can of spaghettl...

55
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,130
Francie... what's
wrong with the mic?

56
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,830
Why the mic so hot?

57
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,397
You get the mic
from hell?

58
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,698
Is there special
electronics

59
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,863
in hell or somethin'?

60
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,164
Don't try it tonight.
It's not your night.
What?

61
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,297
There's a really
nasty ghost up there.

62
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,664
I'm next.

63
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,997
Just go
to the restroom,
ok? And... and fake

64
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,830
stage fright
or something.
Trust me, you

65
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,164
do not want
to go up there.

66
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,331
Ok.

67
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:15,731
That's what y'all
do now, francie?

68
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:16,731
That how it is?

69
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:17,930
What happened
to a hook

70
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,397
or a horn
or... somethin'?

71
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:21,731
Hey, francie,

72
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:22,930
i think i'm
gonna really need

73
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,097
some first aid up here.

74
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:26,698
Ok, just...
keep drinking.

75
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,798
I'll... i'll
figure it out.

76
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:30,431
How many people'll
be willing to testify

77
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,297
he set his own hand
on fire?

78
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,297
Andrea?

79
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,130
I went out
for a walk.

80
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,331
Oh!
Melinda?

81
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,631
Is the coast
clear?

82
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,130
Uh...

83
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,197
no.

84
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:56,863
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

85
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,497
uh... i'm gonna keep
the best stuff.

86
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,998
Actually, uh,
andy kaufman left
a sleeping bag there.

87
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:38,531
Yeah. But i'm...
but i'm sure
some of this stuff

88
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:41,130
is worth selling.
L... i have bar glasses,

89
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,430
i have cds, i have
signed photos.

90
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,864
This stuff is great.
I mean,

91
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,063
we've never had
anything like it.

92
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,430
But are you sure
that you want to sell it?

93
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,297
There's so many memories
here.

94
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:52,697
Well, memories
are very romantic
when you're young.

95
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,063
When you're my age,
they're like needles

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,063
that stick
into your heart.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,197
So i'd rather
take the cash.

98
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,631
So whatever you get,
i'll split it with you
50/50.

99
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:06,631
Wow. You have mentored
so many people, francie.

100
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:07,898
Yeah.

101
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,097
Hmm. There's
a lot of history

102
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,063
in that little club
of mine.

103
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,998
You know, melinda
thinks the club
is haunted.

104
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:18,531
I do not. A...

105
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,163
haunted. [chuckles]

106
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,364
That's a very strong word.

107
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,397
Yes... it is...
haunted.

108
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:26,397
Really.

109
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:28,063
That's what
people say.

110
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,597
Monday nights,
the club is closed.

111
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,664
And our cleaning guy
swears that they come in,

112
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,430
they rearrange the tables,
and they do their own show.

113
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,497
But i'm not fooled.

114
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:42,230
Being haunted...
very good for business.

115
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:43,697
All right, girls.

116
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:45,497
Let me know
how you do
with this stuff.

117
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,597
Thanks.
I'll walk you out.

118
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,764
Boy, she's a character,
isn't she?

119
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,497
Hey, have you seen
my keys?

120
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:00,330
I swear i put them
up here on the desk.

121
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,330
Coat pocket?

122
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,664
Hmm.

123
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,597
Behold...

124
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,230
your keys.

125
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,097
Am i imagining it,

126
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,163
or are they defying
the laws of physics?

127
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:26,364
Andrea has nerves
of steel. I mean,

128
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,297
i can't imagine
anything scarier

129
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:29,964
than having to get up
in front of a bunch
of people

130
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,464
and make 'em laugh.
Could you do that?

131
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:34,063
Me? No. Heck,
i was linus

132
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,531
in our third grade
production

133
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,797
of <i>you're a good man,</i>
<i>charlie brown,</i>

134
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,097
and i almost
threw up on snoopy.

135
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,564
That's not about
our third grade play,

136
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,564
now, is it?

137
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,564
We're turning a profit.

138
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,731
Th... the store
is turning a profit.
Really?

139
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,130
Congratulations.
Yeah! [laughs]

140
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,898
It's right there
in black and white.

141
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,898
We should celebrate.
My treat.

142
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,964
Congratulations.
[Laughs]

143
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,430
Oh, i have to call
andrea. She is
going to <i>freak.</i>

144
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:57,497
All right.

145
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:10,330
So, you know, i mean,
i was just thinkin'
ahead here,

146
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,230
but, you know,
maybe we should
expand.

147
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,264
Oh, andrea, it's
one month's profit.

148
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,430
We're not
wal-mart yet.

149
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,497
That's it.
We should franchise.

150
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,931
Ok. I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

151
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,297
and say that that
was ghost-related.

152
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:26,297
That's not funny.

153
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,297
I wasn't joking.

154
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,631
Not you. Him.
You are messing

155
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,130
with
the wrong person, pal.

156
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:32,931
[Sighs] can't
we just ignore
this guy and maybe

157
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:33,931
he'll go away?

158
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,130
That's always
my first plan.

159
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:36,130
Never works.

160
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,564
Well... where
did he come from?

161
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,464
My guess is he's attached
to one of these things
of the comedy club.

162
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,797
He was in my house
last night. Rearranged
my furniture.

163
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,330
Really! How'd it look?

164
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,063
Not bad, except
for the arm chair

165
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,664
balancing
on the coffee table.

166
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:51,130
So... how do we get
rid of this joker?

167
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,497
I guess he'll
eventually get bored
and show himself.

168
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,464
Ok.

169
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:07,497
Melinda... i, uh, think
you'd better... see this.

170
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,264
I hate this guy.

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,898
I think it's time
to pay francie a visit

172
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,297
Mondays.

173
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,631
...transplan
when the transplant
does not work out,

174
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,697
right? His body
has rejected...

175
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,130
Uh, we don't serve
your kind here, honey.

176
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,097
What are you all
doing here?

177
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:38,097
How come
you can see us?

178
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,464
Just lucky, i guess.

179
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,030
Why haven't you all
crossed over?

180
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:43,297
We like it in front
of the light.

181
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:44,597
Who knows
what's behind it?

182
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,831
Besides, they love us
here, right?

183
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,230
Oh, bein' dead.

184
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,764
Is it just me,
or do your clothes
fit better?

185
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:51,998
Deb agrees with me.

186
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,998
When my wife asks me
to take out the garbage,

187
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,597
i finally have
a good excuse.

188
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,731
Sorry, honey...
rigor mortis.

189
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,130
Can we please stop?
I'm looking for someone.

190
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:04,063
Uh, he's one of you...
a comic, i guess.

191
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,831
Oh, that really
narrows it down.
[Laughter]

192
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:09,197
H-he's 28. um...
really into

193
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:10,964
practical jokes.
And tennis and

194
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,631
long walks
on the beach.

195
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,697
Shut up, bob.
What does he look like?

196
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,831
I haven't really
seen him. Just a...
a flash. Dark hair.

197
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,664
Um, he haunts the club
when it's open.

198
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,464
Um, marty.

199
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,130
Marty golden.

200
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,998
All right!
I remember him.

201
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,531
Oh, yeah.
Marty.

202
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,030
Yeah,
very conceptual.

203
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,364
Always took things
to the next level.

204
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,831
Yeah. Remember the night
when he made the audience

205
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,831
wear oxygen masks?
Told 'em there was gonna

206
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,831
be a big chemical attack?
Right! Ha ha ha!

207
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,197
He was unique,
that's for sure.

208
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,497
What happened to him?

209
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:41,797
The kid had
problems.

210
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,297
He couldn't get
arrested. And
he was great.

211
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:44,731
He had
a tremendous
talent.

212
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:46,597
Very original,
but that doesn't
always mean

213
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:48,063
you're gonna
make it.

214
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,163
Anyway, to make
a long story short...

215
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,564
too late.
Yes, dan.

216
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,364
Just 'cause we
have all eternity
doesn't mean

217
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,531
we want to spend it
listenin' to this story.

218
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:56,998
Yeah, well,
go take a shower,
and i'll finish.

219
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,430
[Laughter]
Ha ha ha.

220
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:01,330
Anyway,
one night he walks
out of the club.

221
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:04,531
He was really down,
depressed, feelin'
sorry for himself.

222
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,831
And?

223
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,864
That's it. We never
saw him again.

224
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,063
Yeah. He must've
signed with my agent.

225
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,464
Oh.

226
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,130
Right.

227
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:16,330
Well, thank you...

228
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,631
for your help.
Remember, folks,

229
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,197
be good to your...
seriously.

230
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,497
Man: Every monday!

231
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:24,998
I love dead people.

232
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:26,330
I love you.

233
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:43,898
So she says to me,

234
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:47,764
"marty, you've got to look
at the big picture.

235
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,664
"In a hundred years,
none of this will matter,

236
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,831
and we'll all be dead."

237
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:53,731
All new people.

238
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,464
Isn't it beautiful?

239
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,931
So i fired her.
What, are you
kidding me?

240
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,731
I don't need to take
that kind of crap
from a therapist.

241
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,998
I mean, really.
That's what we pay 'em
for, right?

242
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,898
Subsidized denial.

243
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,430
But you know,
she's right.

244
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,063
I mean, let's face it...

245
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,097
we're all gonna die.

246
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:19,130
Oh, yeah. Sure, we are.

247
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,797
Yeah.

248
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,063
<i>You're</i> gonna die...

249
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,631
and you're gonna die...
[echo] gonna die...

250
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,063
and you're gonna die.
You're not funny.
Come on!

251
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,697
And you, sir,
in the back,
boo!

252
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,597
Stuffing your face
with the cheeseburger,

253
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,330
are going to die.
Get off the stage.

254
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,831
Yeah, let's...
let's just say it
all together.
Boo!

255
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,597
Ready? Ok.
Boo!
Boo!

256
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,931
I'm... gonna... die!

257
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:42,831
die! Die!

258
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:50,197
Am i dead?

259
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,164
I asked you a question.

260
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:02,463
Am i dead?

261
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,298
Um... very.

262
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,564
Um... what's
with all the water?

263
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,897
I mean,
the... fish tank,

264
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,397
the restroom?

265
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,397
My floor.

266
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,597
I don't know.

267
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,931
I can't
figure it out.

268
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,897
One minute,
i'm dying figuratively
at the club,

269
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:25,630
and the next...
well, what's the last
thing you remember?

270
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:26,697
It's hard to say.

271
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:31,064
I remember...
feeling...

272
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:33,097
hopeful.

273
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,931
But also
something really bad.

274
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,430
Well, the thing is,
usually...

275
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,964
when i see spirits,
they look normal.

276
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:45,064
So, what are you sayin'?
I look as bad as i feel?

277
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,097
I'm telling you
that when a spirit
comes to me

278
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,131
looking like you do,
it usually means

279
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:51,330
that they've had
a sudden or very
violent death.

280
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,564
Which is also why
you don't remember.

281
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,931
So, what do i do?

282
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,664
Well, you're
in the wrong place now.

283
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,664
You need to cross over.

284
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,864
Oh, yeah. My agent
said the same thing,

285
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:05,530
but... i never needed
to appeal to everyone.

286
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:08,764
I meant cross over
to the other side.

287
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,497
Look. This all feels like
a really big mistake.

288
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:17,630
Ok? Now, i have to
find out what happened to me.

289
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,664
Will you help me?

290
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,198
Ohh!
Sorry.

291
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,198
Ohhh...

292
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,131
uh, the door
was open, so...

293
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:45,530
no, it's all right.
Come on in.

294
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,497
Um, i just wanted
to talk to you

295
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,831
about a cd
that i listened to
last night.

296
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,330
It really
made me laugh.

297
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,664
Well, good.
Who was it?

298
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,463
Marty golden.

299
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,764
Yeah.

300
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,264
He's kind of a sore subject
around here.

301
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:03,463
How come?

302
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,231
[Sighs] well...

303
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,131
well, marty, uh,
marty was the real deal.

304
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:11,430
An original.

305
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:13,097
Very complicated guy.

306
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,264
You either loved him
or you hated him.

307
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,564
And you?

308
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,330
Did you love him
or hate him?

309
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,164
Yeah.

310
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,764
I guess it kinda
depended on the day.

311
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:28,730
Couldn't do either one
for too long.

312
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:33,764
He, uh... he came
to the club one night...

313
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,264
he left, and no one
ever saw him again.

314
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,530
Just about destroyed
anybody who ever
cared about him.

315
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,630
And i'm not talking
about mommy or daddy,

316
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,897
because they'd
written him off
years ago.

317
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:48,797
I'm talkin' about
his real family...

318
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,031
here.

319
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:53,864
Especially sandra.

320
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,497
Poor kid.

321
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:58,430
Sandra?

322
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:00,397
I really, um...

323
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,397
i can't talk
about this right now.

324
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,397
I, um... i have
this mountain of paperwork

325
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:08,430
i have to get
to my accountant, so...

326
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,497
ok.

327
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,430
So, does marty know
you've seen francie?

328
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:20,630
Marty hasn't really
come around today, but

329
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:22,764
francie said
when he disappeared,

330
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:24,797
his friend sandra
took it the hardest.

331
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:25,964
Hmm.

332
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,198
Um... sandra holloway?
Have you seen her?

333
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:29,597
Yeah. She was
on <i>letterman</i>
a couple weeks ago.

334
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:30,697
She's fine.

335
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:31,697
She's performing
at the comedy cave

336
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:32,797
next weekend.
You wanna go?

337
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,764
Yeah. And i'll spring
for that one.

338
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,931
Oh, no need.
We're practically
rolling in it.

339
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,264
Look...

340
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,031
how much money exactly
are we talkin' about?

341
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,530
I'm thinkin' about
havin' it framed.

342
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:42,831
Oh, yeah? Wow.

343
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,097
Check the comma...

344
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,831
where the decimal point
usually goes.

345
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:46,831
Here.

346
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:47,897
Wow.

347
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,864
I'm proud of you.
I give it up.

348
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,797
Yeah, well...
who's your mama now?

349
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:54,897
You.
So, i'm walkin'
down the street
the other day,

350
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,463
and i see this guy,
and he's wearing
capri pants

351
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,964
for men. The dude
was a mansaster.

352
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:02,897
[Chuckles] manprise.

353
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:05,797
I'm trying to be original,
thank you very much.

354
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,064
God, everybody's a critic.

355
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,564
Hey, so, was jim excited
that we're finally

356
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,164
makin' some money
around here?

357
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,897
Yeah.
He was happy.

358
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,131
A little weird.

359
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,831
Oh, you think
it bothers him?

360
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:20,363
Jim? No way.
He's too evolved
for that.

361
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,931
Right. Most men are.

362
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,264
She's funny.

363
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,363
What?

364
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,198
She's good.

365
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,864
She could
slow down
a little.

366
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:32,764
Who's here?

367
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:33,864
Speaking of critics...

368
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,363
huh. Is this
our friend marty

369
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,031
who thinks it's funny
to break glasses?

370
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:41,031
One and the same.

371
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:42,031
Have fun.

372
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,264
You know...

373
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,031
you look better.

374
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:53,630
Why, thank you.
I've been dieting.
[Chuckles]

375
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,797
I <i>feel</i> better.

376
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,298
Well, it happens. Once
you start to interact
with this world,

377
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:00,031
you start to look
a little bit
like your old self.

378
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,831
Do you remember sandra?

379
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,397
Sandra holloway?

380
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,497
Sandra.

381
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:17,430
Yeah, i do.

382
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,997
You loved her,
didn't you?

383
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,463
[Sighs] let's just say

384
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,864
we understood
each other very well.

385
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,198
She's gonna be here
tomorrow.

386
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,330
She's performing
at the comedy cave.

387
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:36,864
What really happened?

388
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,831
I don't remember
exactly, but

389
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:44,298
it... feels like
a lot of pain.

390
00:18:45,864 --> 00:18:47,497
Do you want me
to help you talk to her?

391
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,630
Talk to her?

392
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,363
You would do that?

393
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,363
Will that help you
move on?

394
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,198
What if i did
something bad to her?

395
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,131
If you really want
to know what happened

396
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,931
to you...
will you...

397
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,497
will you
go see her first?

398
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:11,330
Are you sure this is
where she'd be staying?

399
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:13,964
This is usually
where comics crash
when they come to town.

400
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:16,097
I don't know. Maybe
this is a bad idea.

401
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,198
Well...

402
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:18,530
you stay here,
and i'll go up.

403
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:22,997
That's her.

404
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,363
I always... wanted
to make her laugh.

405
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:32,697
It was the hardest
damn thing to do.

406
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:40,231
W-where's she goin'?

407
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:44,164
Uh... let's find out.

408
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:25,231
What's she doing?

409
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:54,997
[Whispering]
Here's to you, baby.

410
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:23,397
What?

411
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,064
This is where
it happened.

412
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,897
This is where
i killed myself.

413
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:47,897
On this bridge.

414
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:49,564
This is
where it happened.

415
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,430
This is where
i killed myself.

416
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:09,230
I knew the minute
i stepped off

417
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,964
that... i made a mistake.

418
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:16,764
And in that moment, i...

419
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,397
i felt so alive.

420
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:23,731
I felt everything.

421
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,364
I couldn't help
but appreciate
the irony, you know?

422
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,864
All this time
and effort to try
and feel nothing,

423
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,764
to make myself numb,
but...

424
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,130
in those last seconds...

425
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:36,297
i felt it all...

426
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,430
realized...

427
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:42,130
i loved it.

428
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:50,597
And then i couldn't
believe i was about to...

429
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:52,731
feel nothing ever again.

430
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,697
My heart broke
into a hundred pieces

431
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:58,897
before the water
ever stopped it.

432
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,764
And a... 9.5, 9.6,

433
00:23:07,831 --> 00:23:09,597
and from the french
judge,

434
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:12,031
he gives old marty
a 7.5.

435
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,098
Why?

436
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:17,597
Why did you do this
to yourself?

437
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:22,831
I don't know.

438
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:28,397
You don't supposed
i can undo it, do you?

439
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,731
I wish we all could,
but we only get one shot.

440
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:39,631
You have to figure out
why you did this to yourself.

441
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:44,064
You'll never have
any peace if you don't.

442
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,697
So, i, um,
i made a decision.

443
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:01,130
Please tell me
that it's not
to put your end down.

444
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:03,731
No. I'm gonna give
open mic another shot.

445
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,130
I'm gonna go see
francie tonight

446
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:06,430
and see if she'll
give me another chance.

447
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,031
Oh, that's
a great idea.
Hey, you know what?

448
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,497
When you see francie,
can you get her

449
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:10,897
to tell you more
about marty and sandra?

450
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:12,998
'Cause i kinda hit
a wall with her.

451
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,631
Yeah, i'll try.
I'm actually really
curious myself.

452
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:16,697
Oh.

453
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:17,697
Um...
ask

454
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:19,130
and you shall receive.

455
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:20,130
Melinda: Hi.

456
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,964
Hi.

457
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:24,464
I was told you're selling
the comedy cave stuff...

458
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,430
marty golden cds,
posters...

459
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:27,564
yeah.
It's on display
over there

460
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:28,864
and some
in the window.
Oh, great.

461
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,364
I'll take it all.

462
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,530
All?

463
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:34,064
Yes. Please.

464
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:39,397
That should cover it,
i think.

465
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:41,864
I think! Yeah. Yes.

466
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,430
Please box it up
for me.

467
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,364
I'll have
someone come by
and pick it up.

468
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:48,530
Uh...

469
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,664
sandra holloway
bought it all?

470
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:51,664
Yeah.

471
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:53,197
She was really interested

472
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,697
in the marty golden
items.

473
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:57,597
Hmm. Here.
Make yourself useful.

474
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,697
One on each table.

475
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,197
So, what ever happened
with marty and sandra,
anyway?

476
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:05,897
Well, she owes him
a lot.

477
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,998
She knows it.
First time sandra

478
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:10,564
came in here,
she was like a deer
in the headlights.

479
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:14,697
Marty: So this cop
pulls me over
the other day.

480
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:19,364
Francie: Sandra always
had great material.

481
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,464
But she never had
the nerve to stand up there
and go for it.

482
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:26,064
Her fear, her talent...

483
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:30,297
i think he saw
some of himself in her.

484
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,130
He wanted to help her
the way he couldn't seem
to help himself.

485
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,464
So, i'm drivin'
the other day, and...

486
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,064
but after the first night
he pulled her up there,

487
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,697
it all changed.

488
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,731
The crowd loved her.

489
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:43,597
She really took off
for real.

490
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:49,430
They fed off each other...
in the best ways

491
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:52,197
and in the worst ways.

492
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:54,297
They couldn't be
without each other.

493
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,364
They were like
vampires in love...

494
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,697
live by night,
sleep by day.

495
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:01,064
Then he disappeared.

496
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,864
No explanation
at all? Just gone?

497
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:08,464
<i>Nada.</i> they didn't find
a body or signs of anything.

498
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,064
[Sighs] she didn't
leave her apartment
for 2 months.

499
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,831
Wow. Do you think
she's still...

500
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:18,197
oh, enough. Let's
not talk about it.
How about you?

501
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:19,831
Ready to give it
another shot?

502
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:21,597
Yes. L... i am
gonna sign up

503
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,931
for open mic
next week.

504
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,064
Well, good!

505
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,897
Don't punk out
on me this time.

506
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,897
I know.

507
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:51,564
Know what?

508
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,064
Europe. She left me

509
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,263
to go to europe.

510
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,098
What are you talking about?

511
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:16,931
I couldn't get
any traction.

512
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,263
I couldn't get
out of that club.

513
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,697
Sandra started
to get tv gigs.

514
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,864
And when i tried,
they said i didn't
test well.

515
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:26,564
They said my material
was too cerebral
for a young audience.

516
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,630
I was outraged.
Even after i looked up
the word "cerebral,"

517
00:27:29,697 --> 00:27:31,464
i couldn't agree.

518
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,031
And that tour...

519
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,864
it was gonna turn it
all around for her.

520
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,363
She was gonna become a star.

521
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,964
We'll never make it.

522
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,997
You know, i thought
you would kinda
be happy for me.

523
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:42,997
We won't make it,
sandy.

524
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:44,964
We'll never last
that long apart.

525
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,530
You know what? If this
were happening to you,

526
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,263
i would be
cheering for you.
No.

527
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,031
No. You wouldn't.
You would be afraid

528
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:51,230
that i would
never come back.

529
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,297
I have to do this.
It's my shot,

530
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:54,797
and i have to take it.

531
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:56,731
It sounds to me
like you already
made up your mind.

532
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:57,731
Well, m...
yeah.

533
00:27:57,797 --> 00:27:59,230
Look,
i'm not leaving you.

534
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,597
I'm just going away.

535
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:02,797
Yeah. It's
the same damn thing,
right?

536
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,564
No.
Ok.

537
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,964
Just... the thought
of sandra gone so long and...

538
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:13,131
knowing that she'd be
over there with the best

539
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:14,897
while i was stuck here?
You know?

540
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:16,731
The guy
who doesn't test well.

541
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:19,297
How come nobody knows
what happened to you?

542
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:24,664
Now, that...

543
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:26,430
is a fitting coda
for my life.

544
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,363
Failed comedian
makes dramatic exit,

545
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,098
but nobody notices.

546
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:32,464
Everybody noticed,
marty.

547
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,664
You broke their hearts.

548
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,530
I know.

549
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:46,064
I know, i know, i know.

550
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:49,397
[Snickers]
I was stupid.

551
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,597
Cerebral,
my ass.

552
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,964
You have to make it
right for sandra.

553
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:03,397
I mean, think about all
that she's been carrying
around with her.

554
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:04,964
I'll help you.

555
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:08,263
[Sighs] i don't know
that i can face her yet.

556
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:11,997
Ok.

557
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,464
Then let's start
with francie.

558
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,697
He wants to say
thank you...

559
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:19,864
for letting him
stay on your couch...

560
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:22,198
for giving him a chance,
for believing in him.

561
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,098
For never
giving up on him.

562
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,330
I c... i can't
believe this.

563
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:31,064
He killed himself?

564
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:32,964
He wants you to know
that he's sorry.

565
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:35,697
He sees me?

566
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:37,764
Hears me?

567
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:39,997
How?

568
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:42,697
Everybody
has a talent.

569
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:43,697
This is mine.

570
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,530
I never meant
to hurt anyone,

571
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,363
least of all her.

572
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,198
He wants you to know
that he never meant
to hurt anyone.

573
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:53,964
Is that right.

574
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,131
Then why the hell'd
you do it?!

575
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,864
He wanted
to hurt <i>himself.</i>

576
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,031
Bull, marty.
You hurt yourself
for 2 minutes.

577
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:03,764
You hurt the people
who loved you

578
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:05,731
for the rest of their lives.
Is that what you wanted?

579
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,731
Are you happy <i>now?!</i>

580
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:10,530
[Sighs] look...
i would take it back
if i could.

581
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:13,230
Do you know
how many people
believed in you?

582
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:16,797
Do you know that l...
<i>i</i> loved you?

583
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,497
I loved you like my son.

584
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:23,098
Could you please just...
you... ask her to stop?

585
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,363
I can't take it.

586
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,664
Is he still there?

587
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:27,997
Yes. And he knows
that you're right.

588
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,330
And do you know
what you did to sandra?

589
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,098
You shouldn't be here
crying to me.

590
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:37,597
You need... you need
to let her know
that this was not

591
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:38,664
her fault.

592
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:43,430
You need
to set her free, pal.

593
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:45,597
She has lost a lot...

594
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,164
that she will
never, ever get back.

595
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:54,697
He will.

596
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,530
You tell him
i'm just too angry

597
00:30:58,597 --> 00:31:00,297
to talk to him right now.

598
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,297
[Tearfully]
I miss him.

599
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,864
You tell him...

600
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:14,997
i will never forget him.

601
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:18,864
You just told him.

602
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:22,997
Well...

603
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:28,397
what <i>is</i> that i...
i feel?

604
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:29,797
He's hugging you.

605
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:34,330
[Tearfully]
Oh...

606
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,330
oh... marty...

607
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:44,597
we were family.

608
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:49,098
You don't leave
when you're family.

609
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:00,297
I thank you!
Thank you!

610
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:20,131
Yes?

611
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,297
Sorry to bother you.

612
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,997
Uh, i just wanted to say
that i really enjoyed
your performance.

613
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,897
You're the girl
from the store.

614
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,397
Right.

615
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,997
Melinda gordon.

616
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,297
Come on in.

617
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,330
Don't tell her
i'm here yet. She'll
never believe you.

618
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:40,664
You want something
to drink?

619
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,997
No. Thanks.

620
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:50,131
Uh, i was also a...
a fan of marty golden's,
too.

621
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:53,397
L... i know that you two
were close. [chuckles]

622
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:57,363
"Close."
Very interesting way
of putting it.

623
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,464
I'm sorry. It's
none of my business.

624
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,797
I'm glad <i>somebody</i>
remembers marty.

625
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:05,697
You wanna know a secret?

626
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:07,764
It should've been
marty who made it.

627
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:09,764
He was the real deal.

628
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,897
Compared to him,
i'm just a fraud.

629
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:15,297
If he were still here,
if he were still alive,

630
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:16,864
it'd be him out there...

631
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:17,931
not me.

632
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,297
So you're sure
he's dead. How?

633
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:25,131
Because i feel
dead, too.

634
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,797
Have ever since
that night.

635
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,098
Do you think marty
killed himself

636
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:34,064
because you left
to go on tour?

637
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,664
How do <i>you</i> know
he killed himself?

638
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,230
L... i just assumed.

639
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:42,363
Well, he didn't kill himself
because i went on tour.

640
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
????????

641
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:00,833
I don't understand.
I thought the tour

642
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,634
was supposed to be
your big break.

643
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,134
That's what everyone
kept telling me.

644
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:10,301
Except the one guy
i needed to hear it
from most.

645
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,034
I started
second-guessing myself.

646
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,000
Maybe marty was right.
Maybe we couldn't
survive the separation.

647
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,900
I didn't want
to lose him.

648
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,234
Marty was struggling.
Boo!
Boo!

649
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,367
He needed me
more than ever.

650
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,568
Boo!
Boo!

651
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:27,201
And i'd have other chances,
other breaks.

652
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,234
But would i ever have
someone i love as much?

653
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:35,401
So i decided
not to take the tour.

654
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,867
And when i told him...

655
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:40,334
i thought that he'd be
happy or at least relieved.

656
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:44,267
But instead,
he just seemed...

657
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:47,134
defeated, like he had
taken something from me.

658
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,767
I'll never forget
how tight he held me.

659
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,501
That was the last time
i ever saw him.

660
00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:00,201
Then he jumped
off driscoll bridge.

661
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,668
How did you know that?

662
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,201
What was it
about that bridge?

663
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:08,367
Ok, you're
creeping me out now.

664
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:12,067
Are you, like, one
of these obsessed
conspiracy people?

665
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,267
Oh, i'm sorry.

666
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:14,900
Marty:
I'm remembering
everything now.

667
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,201
I have to talk to her.

668
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,201
Marty saw that you
were gonna be a star.

669
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,201
And... and he felt
like he was
pulling you down,

670
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,067
and then when you said
that you weren't gonna
do the tour,

671
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:23,900
he thought he was
ruining you.

672
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:27,267
Jumping off that bridge
was marty's way
of setting you free.

673
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,067
Ok, who the hell
are you?

674
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:31,134
How do you know this?!
How do you know marty?!

675
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:33,568
He's here with us
right now.
He can hear you.

676
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,833
Get out.

677
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,301
Get out!

678
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,201
So, are you nervous
about tonight?

679
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,334
No! What?! No.
Nervous? Why
would i be nervous?

680
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,568
Ahem. You jumping
like that...

681
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,434
that was you...
not nervous?

682
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,100
Why aren't you
at the club?

683
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,201
Look, i just...

684
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,833
i don't believe
in any of this crap
about ghosts.

685
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,833
I just don't.

686
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,334
You and
a million others.

687
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,234
Andrea:
Ok, i'm, uh...

688
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:14,267
i'm, uh,
i'm gonna go home

689
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:16,000
and hyperventilate
for a while,

690
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,601
and i'll...
i'll see you
at the club.

691
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,967
But if i did...

692
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,733
if i did believe
that marty was here...

693
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,501
i would
tell him how stupid
what he did was.

694
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,301
I've been living
with this for 2 years,

695
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:37,167
feeling responsible,
like i took something
from the world.

696
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:38,501
It is not your fault.

697
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:39,800
You think
i don't know that?

698
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:41,833
But i <i>feel</i> it.

699
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,234
My heart is wrecked, marty!

700
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:46,800
I'm sorry.

701
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:47,934
He's sorry.

702
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,668
Not as sorry as i am.

703
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:51,234
No. I'm sorrier.

704
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,367
Ok. Ask her how
she knew i jumped
off the bridge.

705
00:36:57,434 --> 00:37:00,134
He wants to know
how you knew
about the bridge.

706
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:01,800
Now i know you're lying.

707
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,867
Marty would know the answer
to that question.

708
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,334
What am i doing here?

709
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,234
There's
a lot that marty
doesn't remember.

710
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,334
[Shop door bell
jingles,
door slams]

711
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:12,434
He's just trying to put
the pieces together.

712
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:29,134
Marty pulled me
off that bridge
a long time ago.

713
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:33,434
He saved me
when i was
at rock bottom.

714
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,067
After that, whenever
either one of us

715
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,800
did anything bad
or needed
to be forgiven,

716
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:41,568
we would go
to that bridge
and wait for the other.

717
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,234
That's right.

718
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:46,934
I remember.

719
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,733
I thought that
he would be waiting
for me there that night.

720
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,700
But i was too late.

721
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,967
I found the bottle,
and i knew

722
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,900
that he had done
something bad to himself

723
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,800
and he did it
off that bridge

724
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,700
so that
i would forgive him.
[Laughs]

725
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,167
He's sorry.
He really is.

726
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,267
He just thought that you
would be better off
without him.

727
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,767
Oh, well, you
were wrong, marty!

728
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,201
I loved you!

729
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,501
It wasn't exactly
the healthiest love
in the world,

730
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:18,201
but... we could've
made it work.

731
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,700
He knows that he made
a mistake.

732
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,867
And he doesn't want you
to suffer for it anymore.

733
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,267
Easier said than done.
Suffering is
my bread and butter.

734
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,800
Tell her... that it's
the only way i can
redeem myself

735
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,867
for what i did...

736
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:33,967
to go away

737
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,733
knowing that...
she's gonna be ok.

738
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,134
He wants
to redeem himself.

739
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,134
He wants to know
that you're gonna be ok.

740
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,934
Tell her that i

741
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
love her.

742
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:49,167
I always did...

743
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:50,568
always will.

744
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:52,334
He loves you.

745
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,501
[Tearfully]
Why did you
do it, marty?

746
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,568
I love you, too,
so much. Why
did you leave me?

747
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:02,733
It's ok.

748
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,800
You're gonna be ok.
I promise.

749
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,100
Ohhh...

750
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,434
what if i get happy
and i'm not funny
anymore?

751
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:21,201
He doesn't think that
that's gonna be an issue.

752
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,967
[Whispering]
I'll be watching you
tonight, baby.

753
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,668
L... i live
in grandview,

754
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,668
which, as you guys
know, is the dating

755
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:51,501
capital
of the northeast.

756
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,733
And, um...
it's hard, you know?

757
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,000
'Cause i'm
a single woman.

758
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,334
I'm 6 feet tall.
I'm livin' alone

759
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:59,733
in a small town.
It's kinda scary,
you know?

760
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,568
And i'm watchin' tv
the other night
and i'm home alone,

761
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:04,800
and a... a guy escaped
from a local jail.

762
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,867
And i'm there
in the dark,

763
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:09,568
and all i can think is
"oh, my god...

764
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,401
i hope he's tall."

765
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,501
You guys
have been awesome!

766
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,201
Thank you so much!

767
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,467
Thank you!

768
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,434
Ladies and gentlemen,

769
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,568
the moment you've all
been waiting for...

770
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:27,067
the incomparable,
the peerless

771
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,167
sandra holloway!
Give it up!

772
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,100
Andrea: Give it up!

773
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:03,700
Sandra: So, i was up
late last night,

774
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,201
doing something
that i don't normally do

775
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,301
when i'm alone.

776
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,534
Ooh...
ooh...
whoo!

777
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,534
[Laughter]

778
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,534
I said something

779
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,267
i don't <i>normally</i> do

780
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:15,301
[laughter]
When i'm alone.

781
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:18,900
I was talking
to an old friend of mine
from the past.

782
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,201
He's been dead
for 2 years.

783
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,700
Keeps tryin' to get me
to come visit.
Some friend, right?

784
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,267
And i says to him,
"hey... you're dead.

785
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,167
"So come on,
tell me something

786
00:41:33,234 --> 00:41:35,501
"really deep
and profound.

787
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:38,100
Enlighten me."
Right?

788
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,467
"Give me something
that will help me

789
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:42,900
to better my life
here on earth."

790
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,900
And he looks at me...

791
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,000
takes a deep breath...

792
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,967
and he says...

793
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,067
"honey...

794
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,267
those jeans really do
make you look fat."

795
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:57,867
Good night, grandview.

796
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,568
You've been
a great audience!

797
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:04,000
Thank you!

798
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:55,700
So, can you tell me
what it's like?

799
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:58,700
I don't know.
I'm still alive.

800
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,367
Everybody's
a comedian.

801
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:01,767
No, really.
What do you hear?

802
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:04,568
I don't know.
No one's ever come
back to complain.

803
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:06,267
Let's...
leave it at that.

804
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,267
Thank you.

805
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:14,401
You're welcome.

806
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,467
Thank <i>you.</i>

807
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,967
For the laughs.

808
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,167
Hmm.

809
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,234
What?

810
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,000
Dying is easy.

811
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,900
It's the comedy
that's hard.
