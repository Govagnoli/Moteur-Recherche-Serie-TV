00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,400
Grandview welcomes home town hero
SGT.Matt Murphy

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
look at this.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,700
The whole town wants to welcome him back,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,300
and he comes home in the middle of the night.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Well, maybe he doesn't want all the attention.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,700
Hey, the guy got the silver star.
He should bask in the glory.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,900
Poor guy probably won't get a moment's peace.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,300
I'm just glad my buddy is back safe.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,200
You think he's gonna be different?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
I think two tours in iraq would change anybody,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,200
but if he just takes it slow,
gets used to being home,

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,800
and doesn't come back to the firehouse
until he's absolutely ready,

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,000
he's gonna be fine.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,100
- Matty.
- Hey, hey.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,400
- Welcome home, man.
- How are you, man?

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Let me take that for you.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,800
- We are so glad that you're back.
- Oh, it's great to be back.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,400
I swear, it's like I've never been away.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
Everything is just the same.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, babe.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
What's a few years between friends?

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm back, baby. I'm yours.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,300
Hey, matt murphy, is that you?

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Yo, it's matt murphy.
How you doing, man?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm good, man. I'm good. How are you?

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,100
- Good to see you. Doing great.
- Great to see you, too.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
- Great to see you again.
- All right, guys.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Guys, there'll be time to elect
him pope over the weekend, ok,

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,400
but come to the party, if you can.
Let's get out of here.Let's take him home.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,400
- See you.
- Bye.Take it easy.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Man, I'm sorry to tear you away from your friends.

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,800
Were you worrying them, too?

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,600
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
Hey, let's go and get a beer, ok?

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,600
They want to go home.
They don't want company.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,400
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,500
Well, maybe it was just a car backfiring
or something.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,000
So, your place tomorrow.
What do you want us to bring?

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
- Matt.
- Matt.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,600
Matt, what is this?

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,700
You all right?

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,200
Hey...

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Wow, I--I guess I'm still a little jumpy.

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,600
- It's ok.
- Let's get you home, ok?

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
- Yeah. We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Ok.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
- Yeah.Early, right?
- Right, first thing.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,900
What just happened there?

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,200
Haunting of some kind, a very noisy one,
but no one should have heard that but me.

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Right. What does that mean?

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
I don't know,

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
but I think matt brought the war home with him.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,300
So, do you think matt is
finally gonna ask gina to marry him?

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know,
and please don't ask me to ask him.

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,200
I mean,
she stuck it out with him for a long time now.

60
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,800
They both deserve a happy ending.

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,400
Yeah. Oh, listen to this.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,700
This is from the citation
matt got with his medals.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,500
"With his squad pinned down
by an insurgent ambush,

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,800
"murphy braved enemy fire to retrieve a humvee

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,500
"and fought his way back to his patrol
"before sustaining wounds

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,000
that caused him to crash
just 10 yards short of his troops,

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,100
who were killed moments later by an I.E.D."

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,700
How do you get over something like that?

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,300
I can't imagine what that must be like.

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,400
You know, do you think that's
what I heard last night,is part of the firefight?

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,700
Did you say you thought
that ghost was insurgent?

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,300
Well, I don't really know.
I mean, he was wearing a head scarf,

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
but it was more the feeling I got from him,
like anger and rage.

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,800
- Maybe revenge.
- Maybe...

75
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,600
but that still doesn't explain
why matt heard the same thing I did.

76
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Doesn't make any sense.

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,100
You know, maybe his ptsd is
making this haunting different.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,100
Wait a minute.
Who says he's got posttraumatic stress?

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
He kind of said it himself, didn't he?

80
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,100
No. He said he gets a little jumpy
when he hears loud noises,

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,700
but, I mean, let's not diagnose somebody
just because he saw a ghost.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
- Hey, jim?
- Yeah?

83
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,000
You know what? Never mind.
Let's just get ready for a party.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,700
- Hey, you two.
- Hi.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,500
- Hey, buddy. How's the arm?
- Not bad.

86
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Oh, we've got that food group covered.

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Well, at least we're not wearing the same outfit.

88
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna need it all.

89
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,500
I think matt has invited everyone he's ever met.

90
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,500
- How's it going?
- Good. Good.

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Yeah?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,100
Too beautiful. Made me nervous.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey, we don't have to do this, you know?

94
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,100
We could still take off,
you and me,go to the beach or something.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Any more sausage anywhere?!

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
And let clancy eat us out of house and home?

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,800
- Hey, I heard that.
- No way.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
Ok. Who's hungry?

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,900
Who wants some of the best burgers--

100
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,500
- I'm so, so sorry.
- It's ok, matt.

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
You know how much he loved you.

102
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Everyone,
this is anna sanchez and her little girl sari.

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,700
Anna's husband hector was in my unit.

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,300
I was lucky as hell to serve with him.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,100
He was lucky to serve with you.

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Come on. Come over here.

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,100
So, this is someone I want you to meet.

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,700
- Want to say hi, sari?
- Oh, she's shy.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,300
I learned how to do this
when I was away with your daddy.

110
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,300
- Mi daddy, too.
- Daddy. Yeah. Look. Look.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
It could fly.

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,800
- Can you say thank you to matt, sari?
- Thank you.

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,100
That's ok, sweetheart.

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Want to go play? Yeah?

115
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
Ok, everyone. Listen up.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Sweetheart, come here.

117
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
Ok. Well, first, I want to thank gina

118
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,500
for so many yearsof patience
and patience and more patience.

119
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Can't imagine what you've been through, babe.

120
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, that's about to change.

121
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,200
This came yesterday.
It's my discharge from the guard,

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
so as of now, I'm officially free--

123
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,300
no more tours, no more wars.

124
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Belong to all you people now.

125
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,600
That's great, matt.

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Um, I'm gonna go get that cake out of the fridge.

127
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,000
You know, I don't get it.

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,599
They've been dating each other
half of their adult lives.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,100
He's obviously crazy about her,
and she's nuts about him.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm starting to wonder if it has something
to do with the ghost that's haunting him.

131
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,700
Wait. He's got a ghost?

132
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,800
- Is everybody haunted?
- Could be, on both questions.

133
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,300
So, do you think it has
something to do with the war?

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
I don't know. I think it might be an insurgent,

135
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,200
which I'm trying to find out more about,
but there's so much.

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,800
Can't you just ask the ghost guy,
or is there a language barrier?

137
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
Does that even happen with ghosts?

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,500
Never has been before, but I don't know

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
because I can't even get close enough to this one.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,700
You know what? Never mind. Sorry.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,900
I am trying.
I will listen to whatever you have to say,

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,300
even if I can't, you know,
wrap my mind around it.

143
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

144
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,300
Look who I found in the square
getting treated to free ice cream.

145
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
- Wow, the store looks great, mel.
- Thanks. Yeah.

146
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,800
It's a bunch of new old stuff. Take a look.

147
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,200
I, uh--I guess strawberry
is not the best flavor for me right now.

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,700
Hey, don't everyone freak out.
It's ok to laugh about these things.

149
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Better than being bottled up, right?

150
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah. Hey, I was thinking about
taking matt over to the firehouse,

151
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
showing him the new toys.

152
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,100
Why don't you guys go and talk,
and gina can stay here with me.We'll catch up.

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Come on, man.

154
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,300
I was gonna save this for later,
but the got about 12 new video games.

155
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,300
He's really happy to be back...
at least, most of the time.

156
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
How about you?
How are you doing?

157
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
It's hard.

158
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,300
I thought that when he came back,
that we would--

159
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,800
it's not like I had some big plan or anything.

160
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,300
It's just, I'm so ready to take
this to the next level, you know?

161
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,500
And now is not exactly the time
to have that conversation.

162
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,100
Yeah.

163
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,700
He has these bad dreams
where he talks in his sleep,

164
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,700
and he always says, "let me go."

165
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Does he ever tell you anything specific
about what happened?

166
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,100
No.

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
- You mean, when I lost my guys?
- Uh, yeah.

168
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,900
People keep asking me that.
You know what's strange?

169
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I have no idea.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
You mean, you just blacked it out?

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,700
I mean, I remember stuff up to a point,
but after that, nothing,

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
and part of me is scared to remember.

173
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,600
Hey, I'm sorry I even asked.

174
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,100
I mean, you don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to.

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,700
We were on patrol,
maybe 2 or 3 clicks south of baghdad,

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,700
almost ready to pack it in.

177
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,900
Market square had been car bombed
a few days before,

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so it was deserted, so quiet.

179
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,800
It was weird. Then we started taking fire.

180
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,900
- You ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
I just remembered that I need to
run downstairs and check on something,

182
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,400
so just make yourself at home,
and I'll be right back.

183
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Ok.

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,300
We try to make it back to our humvee,
but we were taking too much fire.

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,500
I called for air support,
but air cav was 20 minutes out.

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,300
We took cover behind that bombed-out car,

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
and that that's when all hell broke loose.

188
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,500
They were firing at us from everywhere.
We were pinned down, an ambush.

189
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,400
It was chaos.
Everyone was screaming and yelling.

190
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
We're taking enemy fire,
and we had to get out of there.

191
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,900
That's all I remember,

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,500
I mean, except for this feeling,
this feeling that I wanted to go.

193
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,300
I wanted them to let me go.

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,600
But, matt, getting in the humvee,
going towards your men--

195
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm not saying I couldn't have done those things.

196
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,600
I just don't remember.

197
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,900
Who are you?

198
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Incoming! Heads up!

199
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
Sarge, get back here.

200
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
Sergeant murphy! Matt!

201
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
- Why can't you see me?
- Where's that crazy bastard going?

202
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,000
- Listen to me. I can help you.
- Kill that son of a bitch.

203
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
All right. Fall in.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Stack on me. Let's go.
Go, go, go.

205
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,200
Give my love to melinda.

206
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Yo, where you been?

207
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,400
To a war,
and I was right there in the middle of it.

208
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,700
You all right?

209
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
It gets worse, and you're not gonna like it.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What?

211
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,200
I think matt is being haunted by his own men.

212
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,500
This guy checks into a hotel.
Every night that he's there, at 2 A.M.,

213
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
- There's a knock on the door.
- Is this a joke?

214
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Well, if you laugh, yeah.

215
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,400
No, but every other guest that stays in this hotel
has the exact same problem,

216
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,400
so, to make a long story short,

217
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,600
the people that run the hotel,
they call in a bunch of,

218
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,100
you know, paranormal experts and stuff,
and what do you think they found?

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,900
A normal, rational, nonsupernatural explanation.

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
I love this role-reversal thing we're doing.
It's great.

221
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,200
No. Of course not.
They find the ghost of a room-service waiter

222
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,500
who's bringing the same tray of food
to the same room at the same time

223
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,400
every single night,
and then the groggy guest,

224
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,800
well, he opens the door,
but the ghost is gone,laughing hysterically.

225
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,000
Fascinating ,but what does a spirit
who plays ding dong ditch have to do

226
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,400
with the ghost of a bunch of american soldiers

227
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
fighting the same battle over and over again?

228
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
Everything.
It's called an imprint haunting.

229
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,100
It's a ghost stuck in sort of a time loop.

230
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
They have to do the same thing
over and over and over again.

231
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,000
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.It depends on the ghost.

232
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,600
In the case of the room-service waiter,

233
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,600
he's probably still waiting
for that tip he never got.

234
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
So, they fight the same battle over and over again,

235
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
just hoping for a different outcome?

236
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Well, yeah, and in the case of your soldiers,

237
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,300
maybe something happened to them over there
that they can't accept,

238
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,500
maybe like getting blown up.
I'm not trying to be funny.

239
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
I mean, I know humor is the first casualty of war.

240
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
The quote is,
"truth is the first casualty of war."

241
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,700
You're right.You're right.
Truth is the first casualty of war.

242
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
It's amazing. It's like two heads, one brain.

243
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
You said the ghosts were angry at their sergeant,

244
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,300
- your friend the hero.
- Yes,very.

245
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Ok. Well, if truth is the first casualty of war,

246
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,900
maybe something happened
with the way that they died

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,800
that made them follow that sergeant home.

248
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,500
- Like the truth about how they died.
- Or why they died.

249
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,100
Anyway, I'm sure whatever information you get

250
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,700
will be a lot more informative than
this investigation they have going.

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,500
- What investigation?
- I'm sorry.I assumed that you knew.

252
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,000
"Why has the family of one
of grandview's slain soldiers

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,500
"petitioned the pentagon for an investigation
into the incident? Stay tuned."

254
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
- This is hector?
- Yes.

255
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,300
He's the one next to matt--rocky.

256
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
And what are all these nicknames?

257
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Money is money
because he never loses a game at poker, like, ever.

258
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,100
Lucky picked up that name because

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,800
he only lost two fingers in a roadside bombing
during his last rotation.

260
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,300
And hector? Why rocky?

261
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Because they used to kid him
that he'd done more tours in iraq

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,900
than there were "rocky" sequels,

263
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,100
which was funny until-- you know.

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,900
I'm sorry if I came at a bad time.

265
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,700
It's all right. I just have class at 4:00.

266
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
It's the only thing keeping me sane right now.

267
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,300
I don't want to keep you,
but I just want to ask you--

268
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,200
do you know where--

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
melinda, this is richard, hector's father.

270
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,700
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Melinda is a friend of matt'S.

272
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Oh.

273
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,300
Do you know where the county
tax stuff for last year is?

274
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,700
Above the file cabinet out back.

275
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
Thank you.

276
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,100
He came down from boston
to stay with me and help out.

277
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,700
He's going through all the finances.

278
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,700
I was doing it, but

279
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
I started finding all these notes
that hector wrote to himself, you know,

280
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
all the plans he had for us.

281
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,600
- This must be so hard for you.
- Not just for me.

282
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,400
I don't want you to think that I'm prying,

283
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,000
but I did hear that one of the families
has asked for an investigation.

284
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Richard asked for it.

285
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
Do you know why?

286
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Like I said, it's not just me
that's having a hard time.

287
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,200
Richard, he's angry. He wants reasons.

288
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Don't you?

289
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,900
Reasons aren't gonna bring my husband back.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,800
Do you think he would mind if I talked to him

291
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,300
about why he's doing this?

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
- Why?
- I don't know...

293
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,900
just in case I can help in some way.

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
He's out back.

295
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,300
You don't really understand
what's going on here, do you?

296
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,300
Do you have something against matt?

297
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Yeah, just the death of my son, that's all.

298
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,700
I don't understand. Did matt somehow--

299
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,400
look. If you know this guy,
you shouldn't be talking to me.

300
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
It's all gonna come out soon enough.

301
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,300
What's gonna come out?

302
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,700
- You think you know murphy?
- Yes, and so does my husband.

303
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,800
Come and take a look at the real sergeant murphy.

304
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
- What is this?
-Terrorist web site, a jihadi recruitment tool.

305
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,700
They post videos of american
soldiers being killed.

306
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,800
Oh, that is awful.

307
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
I was a colonel in the gulf war.

308
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I still have friends in the nsa.

309
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,600
Buddy of mine sent me this link.

310
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,600
Government doesn't want this to get out.

311
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,000
There, the one trying to stop sergeant murphy,
that's my son.

312
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
- What's going on?
- Hard to say.

313
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,200
Sergeant murphy seems to be
in some kind of argument with his men.

314
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
That's my boy who's keeping him from getting up.

315
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,200
- Why?
- Keep watching.

316
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,800
Sarge! Stop him! Stop him!
Where's that crazy bastard going?

317
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,600
He makes it to the humvee,

318
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,100
and he doesn't even wait for his men.

319
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,100
He abandoned his men under fire,
and he left my son to die.

320
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on. Stack on me.
Let's go. Go, go, go.

321
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,400
I sat here and watched my son die a hundred times,

322
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,700
and murphy gets a medal.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
What are you planning to do with this?

324
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,100
People who gave murphy his silver star
don't want to see this.

325
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,200
Tomorrow I'm giving it to the press.

326
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,100
- You will ruin matt's life.
- He has his life!

327
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Couldn't there be an explanation of
what happened on the video?

328
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,900
- Such as?
- Well, I don't know...but, you know,

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
maybe if you gave me some more time,
I could figure out what really happened.

330
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,800
From who--the military,murphy?

331
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
- Who's gonna tell the truth?
- I am begging.

332
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,500
Please give matt some more time.

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Maybe his memory will come back,

334
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,000
and you're gonna lose nothing by waiting.

335
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll hold off another day.

336
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,600
You should use that time
to let murphy know what's coming down.

337
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,500
That'll jog his memory.

338
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
Matt.

339
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,600
Gina?

340
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,600
Hey, man, you home?

341
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,900
Matt. Gina?Anybody home?

342
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,600
Hey, buddy, I thought we'd play some ball.

343
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,500
Since you only got one good arm,
maybe I stand a chance this time, huh?

344
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,200
Matt. Matt, where are you, man?

345
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,800
- Matt...
- close the door. Close the damn door.

346
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,200
Matt, the door is closed.
What a yreou doing?

347
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Matt...

348
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
lock the door. Lock the door.

349
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,300
The doors are closed, ok?
Take easy

350
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Lock the door. Lock the door.

351
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,000
Come on. Tell me what's wrong.

352
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
Matt, put the gun down.Put the gun down.

353
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,600
It's ok. Good.

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm just gonna take it.
I'm gonna take the gun from you, that's all.

355
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Easy.

356
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Get away from my--

357
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,700
buddy, you're having a panic attack.
Take it easy.

358
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
Breathe. Breathe. Try and calm down.

359
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,600
Matt, nobody is gonna hurt you.

360
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,400
- I lied! I lied!
- Lied about what?

361
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,900
When I got off the bus and told you
it was like I was never away.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I feel like I never left iraq.

363
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,300
I can't come home, no matter how hard I try.

364
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,700
You are home now.You have people
who care about you,people who love you.

365
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,900
No one is gonna let anything happen to you.

366
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,300
Come on.You're safe now.

367
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
I was so scared.

368
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,800
I've never been scared, not like this.

369
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
I keep seeing them, jim--my men.

370
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,100
It's like theyree he'R.

371
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,000
They know it should be me
that's d d,eaand not them.

372
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,900
They're coming to get me.

373
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,700
guy is in trouble, mel.
I don't know how much more he can take,

374
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,900
and if this is all because of those ghosts,

375
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,900
you got to make them disappear, I mean, like, now.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
- You know it's not that simple.
- Why not?

377
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
Why does it have to be about
what happened that night?

378
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,200
Because the haunting is just a symptom,
and you know that, too.

379
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,600
There's always something underneath it.
I wish there wasn't, but there is.

380
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,300
I know this guy through and through.
He saved my life on the job.

381
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,500
I mean, the man is a hero.

382
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Ok, so what are you afraid of?

383
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,000
Whatever we find out about matt,
you're still his friend.

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,500
We're his friends, so we'll help him.

385
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
Well, how you gonna help him?

386
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,900
I think matt is feeling the hauntings
because he's so bonded to his men.

387
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
They get to a point
where they can experience each other's feelings,

388
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,400
even death, and every time that he
tries to remember what happened,

389
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,000
the ghosts come,
just not clearly enough for me to reach them.

390
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,700
All right, so he has to remember better
for them to pass through.

391
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,300
He has to remember everything,
even if it triggers another attack.

392
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
I have to reach them in order to cross them over.

393
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,000
Ok. Well, how do you make him remember?

394
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
I have to show him something.

395
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,700
Come on. Stack on me.
Let's go.

396
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,300
Go, go, go.

397
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,600
Do you remember any of it?

398
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,900
At least now I know
why I keep hearing myself saying, "let me go."

399
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,400
No. No.
There has to be some other explanation for this.

400
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,300
My guys are dead.
I mean, you saw what happened.

401
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,700
I ran. I abandoned my men under fire.

402
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,100
I'm alive. What other explanation could there be?

403
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Matt, hector's father is gonna go to
the press with this tomorrow.

404
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,500
You need to remember more.

405
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
It should've been me.

406
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,400
Ow! Kill that son of a bitch.

407
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,600
Hector, I need to talk to you.
I can help you.

408
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Rocky! Rocky!

409
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,100
Your wife told me that's what everyone calls you.

410
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,400
- Anna told me.
- Anna?

411
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Yeah.Matt wants you to know how sorry he is.

412
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
He wishes that he could take back what he did,

413
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,700
but he can't change what happened,
and neither can you.

414
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,700
You don't belong here.
You all need to cross over.

415
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,000
- He said I'd know what to do.
- Who? Who said that?

416
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,400
Gonna kill that son of a bitch.

417
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,900
- What are you looking for?
- He said I'd know what to do.

418
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
- No. Wait.
- All right. Fall in.

419
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,600
Stack on me. All right.Go, go, go.

420
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,300
Moving.

421
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,200
Mommy is almost finished,ok, sweetie?
Then it's me-and-you time.

422
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
Yeah.

423
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,400
- Hector?
- Daddy.

424
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,600
That sounded just like the way your daddy
would bang through the door.

425
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,200
Used to drive me crazy.

426
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Dada.

427
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,300
Oh, baby girl, I know. I miss daddy, too.

428
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,700
When I get done with my homework,

429
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,300
we'll got to the park and do what you want,
ok, sweetie?

430
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,700
Daddy.

431
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,500
- Dada.
- You stay here, sweetie.

432
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Dad, is that you?

433
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,900
Dad?

434
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,600
Hi, anna.I'm so sorry to bother you,
but could I talk to you for a second?

435
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Sure. Come in.

436
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,700
- Everything ok?
- Yeah.

437
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,200
- Daddy.
- Sari? Sari?

438
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,500
Sari.

439
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,700
- Daddy.
- Baby.

440
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,700
Come on, sweetie.

441
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,100
Come here, baby. Come here.

442
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
What are you looking for?
We don't have much time.

443
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
He gave it to me.

444
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,000
- He said I'd know what to do.
- What is it?

445
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
- It's an envelope.
- What's in it?

446
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
I never got to open it.

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Go, go, go.

448
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,300
What the hell is going on?
Who were you talking to?

449
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Ok. Just please trust me
that I will explain everything.

450
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,200
- There's something I have to find.
- What?

451
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,500
I don't know exactly,

452
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,400
but I needoko lo t at anything of hector's
that was sent back from iraq.

453
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,800
- Why?
- Please.

454
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,700
I gave the box to hector's father.
I don't know where he put it.

455
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,400
- Jim?
- Gina called me 5 minutes ago.

456
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,600
She said matt is a mess.
I'm on my way over there right now.

457
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,300
Yeah. I'll meet you.

458
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,100
- Where's matt?
- He left.

459
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I tried to get him to talk to me,
to tell me how he was feeling,

460
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,500
- to tell me anything.
- Gina, where'd he go? Do you know?

461
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I don't know.
He kept talking about that video.

462
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,200
He hated that you guys saw it.

463
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,600
He said that now you would know
that he was a coward, too,

464
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,900
and so would everybody else
as soon as it was made public.

465
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,700
- He's not a coward.
- We know that, gina.

466
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,300
We're gonna find him. He's gonna be ok.

467
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
- I'm afraid that--
- what?

468
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,500
After he left, I went to check for this gun.
It's gone.

469
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,100
I got him.

470
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,900
I need your help.

471
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,900
The video is going out.
I kept my word. Now it's time.

472
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,900
It has nothing to do with the video.

473
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,000
I think your son may have been carrying something
when he died that was given to him by matt.

474
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
- So what?
- I need to find out what it is

475
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,200
because matt's life depends on it.

476
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,500
What the hell are you talking about?

477
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
Show her, dad.
Let her look through my things.

478
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Hector would want it. Please trust me.

479
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,700
Since when do you speak for my son?

480
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,400
Now, everything they sent me of his
is locked up out back in storage room.

481
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,900
Anna is not ready to look through it.

482
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
You know, is anna home?
Because maybe we--

483
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,200
anna took sari to the store.
She was a nervous wreck when I got home.

484
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,300
I want you to stay away from her.

485
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,900
Hey! Hey!

486
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,800
Are you nuts? Do I have to call the cops?

487
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
It's hot.

488
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
How is that possible?

489
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,500
Please trust me when I say this.

490
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,600
I think your son wants you
to find what matt gave to him.

491
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,500
This is all I have left of my son.

492
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,900
I said that anna wasn't ready to look through it.

493
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,800
It's really me who isn'T.

494
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,300
I keep thinking that if I don't open the box,

495
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,000
it's like it's not really final.

496
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,000
I won't see the end of my son.

497
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,400
I am so sorry.

498
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,900
My jacket--

499
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,500
my right vest pocket.

500
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,700
Maybe you should check his jacket--
right vest pocket.

501
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,900
I wasn't afraid, dad.
I know I wasn'T.

502
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Told me how to be tough, and I was.

503
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,100
You should know he wasn't afraid.

504
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,800
He was tough, just like you taught him to be.

505
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,600
I don't understand any of this.

506
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,900
"Until I get home!"

507
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Is this what you're looking for?

508
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,100
What does this all mean?

509
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,000
- Matt. He needs us right now.
- Where?

510
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,000
Where the names are in the village square.

511
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,400
Can I keep this?

512
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,900
yeah

513
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,200
Come on. You remember when you were a rookie.

514
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,300
You were as green as this grass here,

515
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,000
but you plucked me off that fire escape
without a second thought.You saved me,

516
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,600
and that wall came crashing down.
I remember, you didn't even blink.

517
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,900
I don't know who that guy was,
but it wasn't me.

518
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,400
It wasn't the guy who let his patrol die
in some bombed-out square in iraq.

519
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
You saw ityo .U know.

520
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,800
I don't care what I saw
or what I didn't see on that videotape.

521
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
I know who you are.

522
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,800
This whole town knows who you are.

523
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,300
Nice try, pal.

524
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,100
I appreciate it. I really do.

525
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
This isn't about who I am.

526
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,700
It's about what I am.

527
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,400
Matt, what are you doing here?

528
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,300
What do you want?

529
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,700
You know what I want, jim?

530
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,100
I want to know why I left my men behind.

531
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
I want to know why I can't remember what I did

532
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,300
and why I keep doing this.

533
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,400
Most of all,

534
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,700
I want to know why they're dead and I'm not.

535
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,100
Matt, I went to hector's house.
We found this.

536
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,600
You gave it to him
right before you got in the humvee.

537
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,800
What does it mean?

538
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,800
You know,these reeds
grow everywhere in the south of baghdad.

539
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,600
One day, I was just playing with them,
and I made this.

540
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,600
- That's a ring?
- An engagement ring.

541
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,700
It was supposed to be a placeholder
till I could get her a real one.

542
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,500
Why'd you give it to hector?

543
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,800
Because he thought he was
one a one-way trip in the humvee.

544
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,900
You thought you weren't coming home.

545
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,700
That day that you got in the humvee,
you weren't running scared, were you?

546
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,000
You were on a suicide mission for your men.

547
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,400
How'd you know that?

548
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,000
Hector,

549
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,400
your men, they're here with you,
with us right now.

550
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Rocky?

551
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,200
Why?

552
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Because we don't leave a man behind,

553
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,900
especially when he never left us.

554
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,700
They said you never left them.

555
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,300
What happened?

556
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,100
We got separated from our convoy,
pinned down in that square.

557
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,600
He radioed for air cover.
There just wasn't enough time.

558
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,500
get down!get down!

559
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,900
- Where's the fire coming from?
- Storefront across the street, sarge.

560
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,500
We got another one,11 o'clock.

561
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,500
Rocky, the gun nest behind that wall--
2, maybe 3 shooters.

562
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,800
Can't move.
What are we gonna do?

563
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
What are you doing, man?

564
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,600
- You'll know what to do.
- What?

565
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,100
Sarge. Matt,get down, man.

566
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
- Stop it!
- Let me go!

567
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Someone stop him!

568
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Kept trying to pull you back.
You just kept saying,"let me go."

569
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
I remember.

570
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,600
I couldn't take the time to explain it
because if I did--

571
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
we wouldn't have let you go.

572
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,900
- Stop murphy!What's that crazy bastard doing?
- Matt!

573
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,700
I knew they were confused.

574
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,200
All I could do was say a prayer that I'd
make it to the humvee without getting killed.

575
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,700
Sarge!

576
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,200
He drove straight into enemy fire.
He was sacrificing himself to save us.

577
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,200
Two jihadis left. I got the first one.

578
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Then my gun just jammed.

579
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,200
That's why you keep breaking it down
and putting it back together again.

580
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Yousre ju't trying to unjam it.

581
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,400
Fall in. Stack on me.
Let's go. Let's get sarge.Go, go, go.

582
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,100
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was it.

583
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,300
My ticket was about to
be punched by the last gunman.

584
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,700
And then hector took out the last shooter.

585
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
You know, we came to save him.

586
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,500
They were coming to rescue you.

587
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,100
NO!!!

588
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,600
But they never made it.
Couldn't accept it.

589
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,300
It was like a part of my brain just shut down.

590
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,600
Should've left me.

591
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,900
It should've been 4 survivors and 1 casualty
instead of the other way round.

592
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,700
He saved us.

593
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,800
There was no way we were leaving without him.

594
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,200
The rest of it?Nobody had any control over
what happened next.

595
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,100
I would've done anything for them,anything.

596
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,300
I'd trade places with them in a heartbeat.

597
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,300
You tell matt that he's alive for a reason

598
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
and that he shouldn't waste
it feeling guilty about us.

599
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Everything that happened was meant to happen.

600
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,800
Hector wants you to stop blaming yourself.

601
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,200
You did everything you could.
Everything happens for a reason.

602
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,900
Whoa, that's bright.
Is that a chopper?

603
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,800
No. No. That's not a searchlight.

604
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,200
It's beautiful.

605
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,300
What does it mean?

606
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,200
It means you're ready to go.

607
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Tell anna I love her.

608
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,300
Tell her not to let my little girl
forget about her dad.

609
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,200
I will.

610
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,000
Talk to my father.

611
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,100
Ask him if he thinks matt didn't try to save us,

612
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,100
then why are there bullet holes
in the front grill of our humvee?

613
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,900
It's because matt was going towards the bullets,
not away from them.

614
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,400
You tell him that
I want him to watch out for matt now

615
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,200
the way matt watched out for me.

616
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,900
He's the one that's gonna need help now.

617
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
What's happening?

618
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,600
They did what they came here to do.

619
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,000
They said good-bye.

620
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,400
I've been looking everywhere for you.

621
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,500
Sorry.

622
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't ever leave me again.

623
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,800
What part of "I love you" don't you get?

624
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,000
- I'm with you.
- I know.

625
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,700
This is all I can give you right now.

626
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,300
Now, we'll replace it when we--

627
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,000
don't you dare.
