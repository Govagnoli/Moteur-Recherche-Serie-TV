1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,400
Tube socks or crew socks?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,400
What are we in the
mood for tonight?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Why are we using the royal we?

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,200
I wonder if the post office keep
records of people's address changes.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,900
I mean, detectives track
people down. How do they do it?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,600
All right, it's official. I've
been on the night shift too long.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,700
We're talking to ourselves
like the other one's not there.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,400
What'd you say about a detective?

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Somethin' about your dad?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah. I can't track
him down anywhere.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,300
Until I do, I won't know
how he lived all the esyears.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,900
Or how he died.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Well, maybe he'll find you...
like he found you in that dream.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,800
Hmm. I could sure use his help.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
What for?

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,500
Well, you know that ghost
I was telling you about,

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
the one at the city hall archives?

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,500
Yeah, the one who acts like
he's guardin' the place.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,300
Yeah, he made all those
weird threats about,

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,700
you know, there being
angry spirits down there

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,100
and some serious
darkness in grandview.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,100
All right, wait a minute.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,600
You're not really worried
about us, like we're in danger?

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,400
Definitely not with jim clancy
out there in his uniform, so...

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,800
hey. Easy.
- Go to work

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,300
and don't come back until
people are healthy and safe.

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,500
Go to work.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
Sleep well.

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,800
Hey, al, there's a
clear mirror over here.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah. Thanks.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,600
See ya.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,400
No.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,100
No!

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Hey.
- Oh. Hi.

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,900
They told me you'd be up here.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Are you ready for
breakfast? I'm buying?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Thanks, but can i show
you something first?

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,200
Yeah, sure. What is it?

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,700
Look, we brought this girl in with, uh, amino
acid catecholamines flooding her neurals,

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,900
and that result
was acute catatonia.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,900
That would have been really
interesting had it been in english.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,600
But see, it sounds a little
crazy to say in english

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,100
that I think
- I think this girl was almost scared to death.

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
How?

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,800
Washing her face in a bathroom.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,900
All right, according
to one of her friends,

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,900
before she lost consciousness,
the last words out of her mouth

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,400
were, "bloody mary. "

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,700
Bloody mary? Like the drink?

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
No, like bloody mary, the ghost.

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Oh, you mean bloody
mary, the urban myth.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't know. You're
the expert. You tell me.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,700
What really happened?
- Nobody saw.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
They're gonna run tests, but
the tox screens could take days.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,900
I mean, look at her face.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,500
Somethin' scared her.

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,500
Bloody mary. What's
the legend again?

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,100
Well, you'd stand in a front of a mirror,
you call out her name,"bloody mary,"

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
turn around a few times, and
then she comes through the mirror

61
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,200
and scares you to death.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Hey... what do you think?

63
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,200
I don't know what to think.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,300
Tell me everything you
know about bloody mary.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,300
Are you kidding me? You're, like, the 100th
person that's asked me about bloody mary today.

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
All right. Well, news travels fast.

67
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah, all over campus.

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,200
It's like a full-blown mania.

69
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
I have students clamoring
to get into my class,

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
and I have offered a little extra credit
for anyone that does the bloody mary ritual,

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,800
and the first kid that dies,
I'm giving an automatic "A."

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,800
Well, that's a little
ghoulish, don't you think?

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
Nah. I'm just riding the cyberwave.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,800
Cyberwave? What's a cyberwave?

75
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,000
Ok, I know you live in the world of
antiques and dead things and dead people,

76
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,500
but us, normal people that
live in the land of the living,

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
we have this little invention that
we like to call... ready? Ta-da!

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,800
The internet. And bloody
mary is all over it.

79
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,600
Wait. So there are whole sites
devoted to one urban myth?

80
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, yeah. There's bloody
mary sites all over the world.

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,800
Whatever area the
myth takes place in,

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,100
well, you change the
myth to fit local lore.

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,100
So what's the rockland U. Version?

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,100
Well, it starts the usual
way. You look into a mirror.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
You say her name a few times
over and over and over again,

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
and then all of a sudden, bloody
mary appears behind you. Very scary.

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
But then here's where
the rockland U. Students,

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,800
who I normally mock because their
brains are tiny, mushy, and unformed,

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,600
they got very creative on me.
According to rubloodymary. Com,

90
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,300
you go into some sort of suspended
state where you-you can't talk,

91
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,500
you can't move for about
4 days, and day after day,

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
mary appears to you
until you go mad,

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and then on the fouth
day, you die. You're dead.

94
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,400
And this is what they think will happen
to the girl who collapsed yesterday?

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Well, here's a hint.

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,900
Hi. Excuse me.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,600
My name is melinda. I'm so
sorry to hear about allision.

98
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,800
Could I talk to you
guys for a second?

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Uh, who are you?

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
My husband is the paramedic
who brought her in.

101
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,800
Ok. What do you wanna know?

102
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,600
Well, anything that
you can remember.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,300
Did somebody hear her say, "bloody mary,"
right before she lost consciousness?

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,200
Um, well, we weren't there,
so we don't know anything.

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,900
We just came when we heard that
allison, um, that she-she got sick.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm not one of the police,

107
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
and I don't work for
the university, so...

108
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,500
but we don't have anything to say.

109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
We weren't there, so
we don't really know.

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,200
She heard the noise.

111
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,400
What noise?

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Um, I know that this may sound strange,
but if you're scared of, well, anything,

113
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,700
I think that I might
be able to help you,

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,000
but you have to help me. I
need to know more about allison,

115
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,900
like did anyone around her die
recently, like family or close friends?

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,300
What does that have
to do with anything?

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,800
That's hard to explain.
- Ok, I don't mean to be rude,

118
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,100
but unless you're a doctor or a family
member, you need to leave us alone.

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Ok, see, that is the
thing about bloody mary.

120
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,200
There are so many legends that
you can have 2 in one town.

121
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,800
So there's the rockland U. Version, and
now there's a grandview version also?

122
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Yes, but technically the rockland university
version derives from the town version.

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,300
I mean, that
- that's why my students went so crazy.

124
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,800
When they found out they
had their own local ghost,

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean, they-are you sure
you don't wanna light candles?

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
This story is way
better with atmosphere.

127
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Positive.

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
It would go a lot better
with your new decor.

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Get to it.
- It's kind of dark.

130
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,400
Ok, uh, look. Mary lived in
grandview about 150 years ago.

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
She was a teenager,
she got a disease,

132
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,400
and she goes to the doctor
after slipping into a coma.

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,800
The doctor declares her dead.
You know where this is going?

134
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
To the end of the story.

135
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,200
Anyway, mary goes into the ground,

136
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,600
and they tie a string around
her hand, runs up to the surface,

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,100
which is attached to a
bell on top of the ground.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
That way, if she ever wakes up
'cause she's not really dead,

139
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,000
then she- -
a dead ringer.

140
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,600
Mmm. Melinda gordon, you
listen. I like that about you.

141
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,200
Ok. So, mary's parents are so grief-stricken,
they really tie one on that night,

142
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,700
and I don't mean tie one on
like a string around the hand.

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
They get hammered.

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
When they wake up the next
morning, they look at the bell.

145
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,500
They see that the bell is-
as the kids say-off the hook.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Huh? What are they gonna do?
They have to dig her back up.

147
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
They open the coffin lid.
Except now it's way too late.

148
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
She's really, really
dead. And get this.

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
On the inside of the coffin, there's
bloody scratch marks inside the coffin lid.

150
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,900
That's it? You just go
back to your I. M. Ing?

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
You're like my students.

152
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,100
Ok. So then it all makes sense.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,700
All the blogs started out by
saying that a bell would ring

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
and then bloody mary would appear,

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,300
which must be what allison's
friend in the hospital meant

156
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
when she said that
allison heard a noise.

157
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
Ipso ghosto, you seem to be saying.

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,600
Ok, so I do agree that it might
have something to do with a ghost.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I did see something in
allison's hospital room,

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,100
but I definitely don't think it
has anything to do with bloody mary.

161
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Why would a century-old ghost
show up and terrorize coeds?

162
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Maybe she was tired of
getting her bell rung.

163
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Whatever is or isn't
haunting allison is about her,

164
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
but I-I'm not gonna know what
she saw until she wakes up.

165
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
You mean if she wakes up.

166
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
That myth does not prove
that anything is gonna happen.

167
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Jen, you gotta get real.

168
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,800
If people are dumb enough to
believe in ghosts, then guess what.

169
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,300
You know, it's like they deserve
to get scared out of their minds.

170
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It's like they
basically asked for it.

171
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,100
Allison did not ask for that.

172
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
She's not in a coma
'cause she saw bloody mary.

173
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,600
Please, would you
please not say that name?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Jen.

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,700
Come on.

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
No.

177
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,200
Please don't do this.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,300
Please don'T.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Hey, uh, I'm not an expert on this,

180
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,900
but I'm pretty sure that's what I
would look like if I saw a ghost.

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,900
How did you hear about this so fast?
I mean, is it already on the net?

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,200
I came back to my office, and you know
me. I hear an ambulance, I come running.

183
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I'm pretty sure you told me
this wouldn't happen again, no?

184
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,100
Will you just show
me where it happened?

185
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm paid to be a skeptic. I'm just
running out of reasons to doubt the myth.

186
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,700
Well, here's a reason. I see
ghosts. Other people don'T.

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,500
Ok, but you're forgetting about the one element
that runs through all versions of the myth,

188
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
and that's the mirrors.
- I'm not forgetting it.

189
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm ignoring it
- the bell, the rest of it.

190
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,100
It all makes a good story.
It doesn't make it real.

191
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Excuse me. Sir, that car is
being examined by campus security.

192
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,900
It's ok. I'm-I'm rick payne,
anthropology of the occult.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
I'll take it from here.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
Where are we going?

195
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,500
This is it. We're here. This
is where jenna was found.

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
And while we're on the subject
of things you don't know,

197
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,200
let me give you my
condensed lecture on mirrors

198
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,700
and their place throughout
history and the supernatural.

199
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Like the first queen elizabeth,

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,500
she had her own personal magician who
would use a mirror to describe the future.

201
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,700
And the greeks. Don't even
get me started on the greeks.

202
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,300
Uh, this is the condensed version?

203
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,100
Yes, but you just made
it a little bit longer.

204
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,400
The greeks thought that any
reflective surface would do.

205
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,300
They even believe
that unsuspecting, uh,

206
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
souls could be pulled underwater by evil
spirits lurking underneath the water.

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,900
Why?

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
Did you just do a flourish?

209
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
I guess I did. I'll tell u yowhy.

210
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Because cultures throughout space and time
have always believed that mirrors are, uh,

211
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,300
sort of a veil between
our world and others.

212
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,800
Uh, a portal, if you will.

213
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,400
Ok, so let's say that bloody
mary uses mirrors as portals.

214
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,900
One problem.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
Where's the mirror in here?

216
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,400
D saveby the bell.

217
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Wow. Ok, who's
opening whose mind now?

218
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Who you gonna call the next time you
have a ghost pluggin' up your works?

219
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,100
Who I should have called all along.

220
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,300
Ok, we could do this face to
face, but mirrors are your thing.

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Bloody mary.

222
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,800
Bloody mary.

223
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,700
Bloody mary.

224
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,100
Mel, are you down here?

225
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, what do you wanna do with
this greatart nouveau clock?

226
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,500
Are you ok? You look
like you just saw a-

227
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
nothing. Nope. Didn't see a thing.

228
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,900
I thought so.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
You were calling her, weren't
you, that ghost of bloody mary?

230
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,000
How do you know about her?

231
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,800
Are you kidding? Every time
I go to check my e-mail,

232
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,300
my son's got the browser on that
page. All his friends are into it.

233
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
It's all so ridiculous.

234
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,000
Why do these kids wanna do this?
- What, scare themselves?

235
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Just like goin' on a
roller coaster, I guess.

236
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,100
You have to face something
that feels like death,

237
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,400
you come out the other side, and
then suddenly you feel so alive.

238
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Ha! I found you! You were lying.

239
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
What?

240
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,500
Well, it'sme com ant page. They're all
talking about what happened to jenna.

241
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,000
Look at what this person says.

242
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
"Stop it. You guys
are making it worse.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,400
"How many people do you want to get
hurt before you learn? Signed "S. A."

244
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Now if I go to jenna's webpage,
check out her B. F. F. S.

245
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Allison, some girl named claire,

246
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
and sloane alexander, the
friend from the hospital,

247
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,100
who told me she didn't know
anything about bloody mary.

248
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,900
And here's sloane's website.

249
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,800
Whoa. Did you see that?

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,900
See what?
- I gotta get down there.

251
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
Yeah? Who-

252
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,000
it's you.

253
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,600
This is gonna sound strange, but
I know a few things about ghosts.

254
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,700
You're not laughing.

255
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I'm so sorry. I'm not used to that.

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,300
I have 2 friends in the hospital.
I'm probably next. You were saying?

257
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,200
Ok. Well, first of
all, most of the things

258
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,600
that people are saying about
bloody mary are very unlikely.

259
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,900
Ancient spirits don't usually jump
out of mirrors and try to kill people.

260
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Number 2, ghosts can scare you, but they
can't do more than that unless you let them.

261
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,600
We can stop this together,

262
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,000
but you have to help
me figure out who she is

263
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,400
and-and why she would
wanna do this to you.

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,700
For a second there, I
actually believed you.

265
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,300
I actually thought I might be ok.

266
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
You will be ok.

267
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,400
You just have to help
me find the connection.

268
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
Why should I help you?

269
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,100
You don't know what
you're talking about.

270
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,500
You're wrong about everything.

271
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,700
The legend is all
true, every detail.

272
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
You call bloody mary,
you hear the bell,

273
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,900
she comes through the
mirror, and then you die.

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,900
Yeah, but no one has
died. It's just a story.

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're wrong. Rachel died.
I was there when it happened.

276
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,300
Rachel? Who's rachel?

277
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,200
She was one of jenna's suitemates.

278
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,800
Just before semester break, we
were talking about blogs and stuff,

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
what kids were saying
about bloody mary.

280
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,100
She's real.

281
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Allison, though, she
was, like, obsessed,

282
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,900
especially when she heard that the real
bloody mary had actually lived in grandview

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,500
and her parents were
founders of the college.

284
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,500
And allison swore a roommate of her
ex-boyfriend's had actually seen the ghost.

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
And when he looked
up in the mirror,

286
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
bloody mary was, like,
staring right back at him.

287
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,800
Shut up. You are such a liar.

288
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,200
I swear it.
- Prove it.

289
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,000
I dare you.

290
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,400
Go on.

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
You go do it.
- Are you kidding me?

292
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,100
I'll do it.

293
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,900
We were kind of
impressed, actually.

294
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Good luck.

295
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,100
She was the only
one who had the guts.

296
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
The rest of us couldn't get
out of the bathroom fast enough.

297
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,100
Bloody mary.

298
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,800
Bloody mary.

299
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,600
Bloody mary.

300
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Rachel went into a coma,
and 4 days later, she died.

301
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,700
I've never heard any of this.

302
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,900
Well, it was last spring,

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,500
and the university doesn't exactly
advertise unexpldened aiaths on campus.

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
For wha ile, people thought
maybe it was a drug overdose.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,300
But you knew better.

306
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,300
We were so scared.

307
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,000
We made a pact to never
tell anyone how it happened,

308
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,700
but then when we came
back after semester break,

309
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,900
all this weird stuff
started to happen.

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,600
It was like mary
knew we were back...

311
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
like she was watching us.

312
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
There were all these weird noises.

313
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,700
There was stuff we thought
we were seeing in mirrors.

314
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,700
And you think all this happened
because you called out a ghost's name?

315
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, rachel called
her, but it was our idea,

316
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,800
and now mary's coming for everyone
there who helped wake her up.

317
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,400
Look, I understand how you feel-

318
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,600
no, you don'T. You don't
understand anything.

319
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,200
Ok, maybe I don'T.

320
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,400
But will you at
least let me help you?

321
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,800
You don't have to do this alone.

322
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,300
No, it's too late now.

323
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
My best friends are gone,
and I'm probably next,

324
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,000
and anyone I told
would think I was nuts.

325
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,800
Sloane, please don't do this.

326
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm sorry. I need you to go.

327
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,100
Ok, well, if you change your mind-

328
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,500
good morning.
- Hey.

329
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,500
Hey, you know, it turns out everything
sloane told you about rachel checks out.

330
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,800
She was picked up
in kirkfield hall,

331
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,200
unresponsive, transferred to mercy,

332
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,000
declared comatose, and
she died 4 days later.

333
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,400
So what was the cause of death?

334
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,100
Complications from heart failure.

335
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,900
Is it relyal possible
to be scared to death.

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah, sure, if it's bad enough.

337
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,000
You get this flood of chemicals to your heart,
creates a shock some people can't survive.

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,900
Aw, that's just delightful.
- Oh, it gets worse.

339
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Look, also,

340
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,600
my buddy at the hospital told me jenna is
showing exactly the same symptoms as allison,

341
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,800
just a day later.

342
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
We haven't had a
single test positive

343
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
for any medical cause for
their catatonic states.

344
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,200
Well, all the rumors
online are getting crazy.

345
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,200
It's like this thing
has a life of its own.

346
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,700
Oh, babe, I don't ntwa to tell
you your job. I won't do that.

347
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,900
But we got the 2
girls in the hospital.

348
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,900
They're serious. There's
no other explanation.

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,300
Is it possible it could be the myth?
- Yes.

350
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Yes, of course.
Anything is possible,

351
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
and if anything, my job has
taught me that, but I'm sorry.

352
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,700
I don't believe it.

353
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
You don't believe it,
or you don't want to?

354
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,500
What does that mean?

355
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
All it means is if it's true,

356
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,300
there's a whole lot more to this
ghost world than you got a handle on.

357
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,300
You know, if it's
true, maybe your-

358
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,200
your ghost down in the
archives is tellin' the truth.

359
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,700
What, that there's some kind
of darkness in grandview?

360
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,700
Yeah.

361
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,700
Hey. Remember me?

362
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
I need to do some research on a
girl who might have been buried-

363
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,500
don't tell me. Bloody mary.

364
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,100
Well, if that's actually
who she was, then yes.

365
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,900
For the 10,000th time today, there
are no such records I know of,

366
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,500
so kindly look elsewhere.

367
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Um, no.
- No?

368
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,000
No. This is public property.
Those are public records,

369
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,000
and I am the public, so unless
you wanna declare martial law,

370
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm gonna be going this way.

371
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
You're plucky. You're gutsy.

372
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,900
Those are excellent traits in a
person who wants to get badly hurt.

373
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
Yeah, you told me that before.

374
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Now, you hear what i just
said to the archivist.

375
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,400
What do you wanna tell me?

376
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,400
You can't just leave the
dead to rest, can you?

377
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,900
I'll let them rest
when they let me rest.

378
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Do you know something or not?

379
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,400
She's real...

380
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
but not everything
you've heard is true.

381
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,000
Some of the most...
interesting details are missing.

382
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Such as?

383
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, I'm sure you've heard that the
doctor wrglyon pronounced mary dead,

384
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,200
but do you know who the doctor was?

385
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
It was mary's own father.

386
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,100
They lived in the big
house on oak shadow lane.

387
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,500
It's empty now, but it was once
the home of dr. Horace mumford,

388
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,200
his wife, and their
only child, mary.

389
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,300
Poor mary had diptheria,

390
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,700
which was incurable in those days,
not to mention extremely contagious.

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,300
Dr. Mumford felt they had
tobury his daughter right away.

392
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,700
With the chance that
the bell might ring,

393
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,900
mary's mother wodul
not leave the grave.

394
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Well, the good doctor knew that she would
die of exposure if she didn't come inside.

395
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,400
Luckily, he had some morphine.

396
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,000
Well, you know the rest.

397
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,600
By the time they got to mary,

398
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,500
she was dead... by
the doctor's own hand.

399
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,700
You're right. I
shouldn't have asked.

400
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
Wait.

401
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,600
You'll miss the best part.

402
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,100
You see, when they finally got
mary up, her hands were so...

403
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,200
bloody,

404
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,600
they missed it at first.

405
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,300
Mary's nails were gone.

406
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,400
They were stuck in
the lid of the coffin.

407
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,300
Mary. Are you here?

408
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,200
I just wanna talk to you.

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Don't you wanna talk to
someone after all these years?

410
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
Hello.

411
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,300
Are you catatonic yet?
- Ah, practically.

412
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,500
I was wondering if you were ever
gonna call me back. Did you get me in?

413
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,300
Well, as it turns out,

414
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,600
bloody mary's ancestral home is one of
grandview's registered historic buildings,

415
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,000
and the preservation society is run by
the chair of our architecture school,

416
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,900
who is a very bad poker
player, and he owes me $138.

417
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,600
By the way, the combination
to the key box is k-e-Y.

418
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,800
So I guess now I owe you a favor.

419
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,300
Yeah, and $138.

420
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,000
Mary.

421
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,900
Why won't you show yourself?

422
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,800
I know you're here.

423
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,500
I know that we've been
in the same efom broore.

424
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,900
Ok. If these are the rules...

425
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,800
bloody mary.

426
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Bloody mary.

427
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,000
Bloody mary.

428
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,100
Do you know what happened to you?

429
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,800
Do you know why you're here?

430
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,000
Why aren't you looking at me?

431
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't believe it. You
- you actually saw bloody mary,

432
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
the
- the real thing?

433
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,500
Well, I don't know if
I believe it either.

434
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,100
I mean, I was at her family
home. I said her name 3 times.

435
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,400
She appeared. Her
hands were bloody.

436
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,500
But what?

437
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,400
She had all her fingernails.

438
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,600
Maybe the archive ghost
got his facts wrong.

439
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, maybe, but
there's something else.

440
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,000
The bell, it sounded off, you know,

441
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,200
like it didn't sound
like a 100-year-old bell.

442
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,200
Well, honey, I don't think cast-iron
bell technology has changed much.

443
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,600
No, it didn't sound real.

444
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,100
You know, clipped, like-

445
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,700
like it was a recording. I don't
think this is a century-old ghost.

446
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,200
All right, you're back to believing
the ghost is someone who knew the girls,

447
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,100
someone who died, someone
who had unfinished business.

448
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Yes.
- Yep.

449
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
No.
- No.

450
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,600
Not someone who knew the girls.

451
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,100
One of the girls.

452
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,700
Look, 4 girls played bloody
mary that night. 2 are catatonic,

453
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,900
one is convinced that she's
next, but only one girl died,

454
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,500
the first one, rachel.

455
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,500
You're saying that our daughter
rachel died from playing what?

456
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, it's kind of a
ghost story that was spread

457
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,700
and now has taken
on a life of its own.

458
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,900
I
- I'm sorry. Miss, uh...

459
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
melinda.

460
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,500
We sent our daughter to college.

461
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,200
We let her live in the dorm, even
though we were a half-hour drive away

462
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,000
and-which I knew
was a big mistake.

463
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Bill, please.

464
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,500
And the first time we
go to pick her up...

465
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,000
we're sent to a county morgue.

466
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,300
I wouldn't ask you to remember any of this
if it weren't for her friends at the hospital.

467
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,900
They need your help.

468
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What can we do?
- I don't know.

469
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,700
I was hoping to find out more
information about the relationship.

470
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,900
Well, she never mentioned any
of those names. Jenna? Allison?

471
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,300
No. Rachel had a hard
time making friends.

472
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,900
And why was that?

473
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,800
My wife will tell you
that that was my fault.

474
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,500
Well, that's not
- rachel was different from other kids.

475
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
How?
- Her heart.

476
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,900
She had a V. S. D.

477
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,800
It's a septal defect, a
hole between the chambers.

478
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
And she knew about that?

479
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
From the time that she was a child,

480
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,300
which was why we could not
allow her to play sports.

481
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,500
She had to be home-schooled.
We took every precaution.

482
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
I don't mean to pry, but did your daughter
by any chance wear a heart monitor?

483
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,700
Absolutely, 24 hours a day.

484
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,900
And how did it work?

485
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,900
When her heart got too
stressed, it would emit a sound.

486
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
What kind of sound?

487
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,800
You know, like an alarm.

488
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,400
Sloane.

489
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,500
What are you doing here?

490
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
I can help you now.

491
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,700
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving school.

492
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,600
My parents are coming from maine.
They're picking me up tomorrow.

493
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, but you don't
have to do this.

494
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,300
Bloody mary is not after
you. The ghost is rachel.

495
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,300
What?
- I called her.

496
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,000
She came. I heard the bell.
I saw the bloody hands.

497
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,000
I saw what jenna and allison saw, and
I'm still here to talk to you about it.

498
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,800
You're gonna be dead in 4 days.

499
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
No. That's how long rachel
was in a coma before she died,

500
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,500
and there's a reason for that.

501
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
Rachel had a heart condition,

502
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,100
and the excitement or the fear or whatever
it is that happened in that bathroom,

503
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,500
it was too much for
her body to take.

504
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
But I heard the bell.

505
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
No, what you heard
was her heart monitor.

506
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,900
She had a condition, and
the scare is what killed her.

507
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,900
Oh, my god.

508
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,500
That's why she did it.

509
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
That's why she did what?

510
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,700
That's why she came for us. That's
why she's saving me for last.

511
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
When allison said she knew
someone who'd seen bloody mary,

512
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
I thought she was
just lying to scare us,

513
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,700
so why not return the favor? Right?

514
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,900
But I figured allison or jenna
would take the dare, but...

515
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,400
then it was rachel.

516
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
She was so quiet.

517
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,600
You know, I barely even knew her, and then
just out of nowhere, she just steps up.

518
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Ok, I'm bored already.
I'm gonna go to bed.

519
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,700
Whatever.
- Whatever.

520
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,300
Bloody mary.

521
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
Bloody mary.

522
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,900
Bloody mary.

523
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Allison and jenna didn'tve
en know what I'd done.

524
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,200
But I didn't-I didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

525
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah, but rachel didn't know that.

526
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,200
So I did this. I killed her.

527
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,000
It was an accident,

528
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,600
and I know that, but we have to
make sure that rachel knows that.

529
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,000
She needs your help to move on.

530
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,200
You say that like...

531
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
is she here?

532
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,100
No, but I think I know where she
might be. Where did it happen?

533
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,500
In the hall bathroom.

534
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Come on.

535
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,200
Sloane.

536
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,100
I can'T.

537
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,800
Rachel...

538
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,900
I know who you are
and how you died.

539
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,000
Please let me help you.

540
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Rachel, stop it. Stop it!

541
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,400
They killed me.

542
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,900
You took a dare that went
wrong. That's what happened.

543
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Left for dead... by you.

544
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,400
Sloane didn't know that you
were gonna take that dare.

545
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,900
None of them did. You
have to forgive them.

546
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,800
Doesn't matter now.
They called my name.

547
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,200
Your name is rachel.
You're not bloody mary.

548
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,600
She was a different girl
buried alive by her parents.

549
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,500
So was I.

550
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,300
Wait. I don't see her.
Is she gone? Is it over?

551
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Not yet, but I think I
know where I can find her.

552
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,900
I can't find it. Where is it?

553
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,400
Your grave's not here, rachel.
This was never your home.

554
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
You have to remember
who you really are.

555
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,700
You have to remember how this
all started. Look at your hands.

556
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,300
You were holding a glass,
and it broke in your hand.

557
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,500
Your heart stopped
because you were scared.

558
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,100
I couldn't breathe.

559
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,900
Felt like an empty,
cold box in my chest.

560
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
Then I saw her, sloane...

561
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,800
Saw how I scared her,
how I scared them all.

562
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,900
And that fear that they felt,
I knew that feeling so well.

563
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,800
And they look at me now,

564
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,700
and they're the ones
who are frozen in fear.

565
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,800
You mean allison and jenna.

566
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
I'm with them all the time.

567
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,300
I can go anywhere, do anything.

568
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,500
I never have to
rest, and my parents,

569
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,500
they can't stop me anymore.

570
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,300
So that's why you understood mary.

571
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,500
You knew what it was
like to be buried alive.

572
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
But somewhere along the way,
you lost who you really are

573
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,100
and who you were to everybody
who really loved you.

574
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,300
I can help you,

575
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,800
but you have to let mary go.

576
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
I know it's hard to accept.

577
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,200
I don't care if you think that
you can see spirits or-or ufos.

578
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,600
I've heard enough.

579
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Tell him I drove his
snowmobile into a tree.

580
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,300
She wants you to know that she
drove your snowmobile into a tree.

581
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,400
Oh, my god. She was only 13.

582
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,700
Lisa... what's she talking about?

583
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,100
There was a blizzard.

584
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,600
Dad said I couldn't go outside,
but mom could tell I was just dying,

585
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,900
watching all the snow pile up.

586
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,300
She made me promise never to tell.

587
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,200
She let me drive the
snowmobile around the yard.

588
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
That was a bad idea.

589
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,600
There was a snowstorm, and...

590
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,700
I let her drive your snowmobile.

591
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,800
I thought she'd be sitting
and her heart would be safe.

592
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,200
This is gonna sound
really lame, but

593
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,000
I think that was the
best day of my life.

594
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,500
She wants to thank
you for that day.

595
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, yeah. I suppose she's grateful
that we let her live in the dorm, too.

596
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,400
Tell him safety is overrated.

597
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
She said that safety is overrated.

598
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,500
Sometimes it's better to let
things go, no matter what happens.

599
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,400
I let go of rachel,
and look what I got.

600
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,000
Tell him that he gave me the
best gift he could ever give me,

601
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,400
my freedom.

602
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,300
She knows you miss her,

603
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,000
but she wants you to understand
how happy you made her.

604
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
I...

605
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,600
I didn't want her happy.

606
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,500
I wanted her alive.

607
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,200
And I was, thanks to them.

608
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,000
She was alive.

609
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,400
You gave that to her.

610
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,300
She's right. Listen to rachel.

611
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,200
Is she here?

612
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,600
Is it safe now?

613
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Um, this is sloane. She
went to school with rachel.

614
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
She looks just as scared as I was.

615
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,400
Is that how you want her to stay?

616
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,400
She forgives you.

617
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,900
Do you see this?

618
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,900
This light, are you feeling this?

619
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,500
No. It's just for you.

620
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,300
What is she saying?

621
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,700
She's saying she's free now.

622
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,900
She's saying good-bye.

623
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,100
It's ok.

624
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,500
Hey. I hope you're
happy. Are you happy?

625
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,300
Uh, generally yes. Why?

626
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
'Cause those comatose girls
have now woken up because of you,

627
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,200
and rubloodymary. Com gets, like,
5 hits a day, mostly from me.

628
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,100
And the crickets have
returned to my classroom.

629
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm doing my lectures for
nobody, practically, ok,

630
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,000
and the stark, raving terror
that had this town in its grips

631
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
is now just gone,
all because of you.

632
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,100
Well, I'm so sorry. I should've
known how it would affect you.

633
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,900
You know, I was thinking of letting
you skate on that $138 you owe me,

634
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,300
but now I've changed
my mind, so pay up.

635
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Sorry. No cash. But you can
take your payment in kind.

636
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,800
What, something from
here? Some of this junk?

637
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,100
Do I have blue hair?

638
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Do I live at the end of
the block with 15 cats?

639
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,900
Forget it. You owe me $138.

640
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,300
This is me leaving disgruntled.

641
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,500
Hiya, jim.
- Hey.

642
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,700
What time is our reservation?

643
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,100
8:00. We're good.

644
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,200
You know what? I
think maybe we are.
