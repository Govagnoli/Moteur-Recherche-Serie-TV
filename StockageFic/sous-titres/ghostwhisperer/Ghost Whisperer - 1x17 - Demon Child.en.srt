00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:09,238
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,990
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:14,551
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,332
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,184
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:23,926
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

7
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:26,057
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

8
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:28,522
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,171
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

10
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:33,671
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,745
<i>To tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.</i>

12
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,586
Everything is for sale except the buddha and those two paintings.

13
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,526
We don't really have room for all of this in the store,

14
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,713
so we thought that maybe we would take some pictures and sell the larger items online.

15
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,070
That sounds fine. Excuse me.

16
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:08,320
Hello? Oh, hey, Roger. Can you hold on one second?

17
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,770
Can I show you the upstairs?

18
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,513
Hello? No, I can't.

19
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,163
3:00 is the latest.

20
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:16,370
Well, then it'll have to be when I get back.

21
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,712
All right, Roger. Let me know. Thanks.

22
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,720
You know, I hate to even suggest this, but maybe you'd be better off with

23
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:25,080
an established auction house like Sotheby's.

24
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:27,323
Well, I don't have the time for all that.

25
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,253
And actually, I'd rather do it locally.

26
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,580
You know, support main street.

27
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:33,682
Well, we're thrilled. It's just a little more inventory than we're used to.

28
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:34,580
You'll do fine.

29
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,831
You know, this is an amazing house.

30
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,930
Do you mind me asking why you're leaving?

31
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:42,300
I just felt like I needed a fresh start,

32
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,321
and I wanted to be closer to my main office.

33
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:50,382
Did you wanna see the baby?

34
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,631
- Is it ok?
- Oh, sure.

35
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,753
I've given up on Jessie napping anytime in the next decade.

36
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,420
She's so cute.

37
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:01,981
She's a joy. She's been a very easy baby.

38
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,472
Oh! Excuse me.

39
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:07,223
Hey. What's happening?

40
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:14,503
Yeah. What's up?

41
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:16,640
No, I'm still in Grandview.

42
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,062
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

43
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:34,390
I'm Andrea Moreno. I'm cataloguing Christine's antiques so we can sell them.

44
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,701
Do I look like an antique to you?

45
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:38,732
No.

46
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,932
Well, you picked the wrong door.

47
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,470
Right.

48
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:43,673
Well...

49
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:44,700
I'll just be going now.

50
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:47,101
Don't tell Christine you saw the nanny smoking.

51
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,232
Promise I won't.

52
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,313
Melinda.

53
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:19,540
What are you doing?

54
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,492
The door was open.

55
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,440
Nothing in this room is for sale.

56
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,891
Why don't we head over to my office? I have great fifties furniture.

57
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,143
Cool. I love that stuff.

58
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:08,003

59
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:15,311
We are in completely over our heads right now.

60
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,411
I know. But I am loving it.

61
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:21,380
Can you imagine if we sell all this stuff, plus the stuff we have on online?

62
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:23,433
Yeah. Sotheby's will be recommending us.

63
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,363
God. Christine is unbelievable.

64
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,270
I love her taste.

65
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,490
Do you find her a little intimidating?

66
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,493
No, I find her to be surprisingly nice.

67
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,113
Hmm. Maybe it's because I've worn her clothes and

68
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:39,641
read all these magazine articles about her, but I find her a little larger than life.

69
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:40,792
You've read about her?

70
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,842
Do you know if she lost a son?

71
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,441
I don't remember reading anything about that.

72
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,832
'Cause there was a boy's room on the second floor, just

73
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:48,733
no boy.

74
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,982
Well, she's divorced. Maybe he's with the husband.

75
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,343
No, there was a presence

76
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:54,722
there.

77
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,641
No spirit, but his toys came alive.

78
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:00,542
I'm assuming not in a cute Pixar, Toy Story kind of way.

79
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:01,441
Ah, no.

80
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:02,302
It was

81
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,201
menacing.

82
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,073
Wow. What do you think he wants?

83
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,191
I don't know. I'll have to go back and see him later.

84
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,102
Well, my advice:

85
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,913
Stay  away from the nanny, 'cause that chick's a little off.

86
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,041
This is so sad. I'm just trying to catch a glimpse of my husband.

87
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,480
You didn't see him this morning?

88
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:16,781
He left before I woke up.

89
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,970
Why don't you go on over and say hi?

90
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,653
'Cause I don't want to bug him while he's at work. Besides,

91
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:24,362
he promised that he'd get off early and make me a romantic dinner.

92
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,461
Ok, you just completely lost my sympathy.

93
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,981
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi. Can I help you?

94
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:34,572
Hi. Is Christine here?

95
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:36,430
Uh, no. She's out of town. She'll be back tomorrow night.

96
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,651
She was supposed to have left some boxes for me.

97
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,142
Oh, yeah, yeah! Come on in.

98
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,061
I left the baby in the kitchen.

99
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,160
Hi, sweetheart!

100
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,441
Are you having your lunch?

101
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:51,611
Oh! Sweet potatoes.

102
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:52,732
My favorite.

103
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,093
She seems so good-natured.

104
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:56,902
Most of the time, yes.

105
00:05:57,576 --> 00:06:00,470
But she can howl like a banshee when she wants something.

106
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,561
How long have you worked for Christine?

107
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,712
Oh, just a few months.

108
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,202
The last nanny quit with no notice.

109
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,543
Do you know why Christine is leaving town?

110
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,522
She told me that she missed the city.

111
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,741
You were right. So she can be closer to her office.

112
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:19,032
Well, there are a lot of bad memories for her in this house.

113
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,421
Painful memories.

114
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,241
Uh, memories about her son?

115
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:29,761
She told you about Daniel?

116
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:32,113
Well, I...

117
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:35,091
saw the room. She wouldn't let me go in, so I assumed that's something...

118
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,073
I mean, losing a child?

119
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:39,980
I don't know.

120
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,320
I don't know how anybody ever gets over it.

121
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,383
I don't think you do get over it.

122
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:48,543
I think you just do what Christine's doing and try to move on.

123
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,901
Yeah. Well, her husband had no trouble moving on.

124
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:53,762
He took a job in Japan right after their second child was born.

125
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,733
It  was divorce by Fedex, I think.

126
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,633
What happened to the boy?

127
00:06:58,728 --> 00:06:59,620
Shut up!

128
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:04,990
Are you ok?

129
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,030
There are lot of strange things that happen in this house.

130
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,041
Yeah.

131
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,973
I'm getting that impression.

132
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,240
Where are you?

133
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:28,901
Hello?

134
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,332
Let the romance begin.

135
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,063
Hmm? Oh.

136
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:38,271
Hey, gorgeous.

137
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:39,860
Come here.

138
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,400
I was just about to start cooking.

139
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:45,011
- Yeah, you seem really motivated.
- I'll rally.

140
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,773
You know what? This is ridiculous.

141
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,400
Why don't you get somebody else to start taking some of bobby's shifts?

142
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:52,101
Well, the truth is I volunteered.

143
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,501
Why?

144
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,525
I'm just trying to sock away some real money from that.

145
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,196
- For what?
- The future.

146
00:07:58,808 --> 00:07:59,696
All right.

147
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,423
I'm fully awake. I'm completely alert.

148
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:02,781
Hey! Do you want me to make dinner?

149
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,181
I lied. I must be dreaming.

150
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,912
You know what? I'm starting to like cooking.

151
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:10,540
If you weren't always hogging the kitchen, maybe I would get some practice.

152
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,891
What do you want to drink.

153
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,971
Beer is good.

154
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:17,011
Remember  that customer I told you about?

155
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:18,442
The fashion designer?

156
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,662
Her kid died and I saw him today.

157
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:24,161
Jim!

158
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,031
Huh! Oh.

159
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,932
What?

160
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,570
I was just-- I was, um...

161
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,072
trying to memorize, uh,

162
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,670
the placement of all the furniture in the room.

163
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,973
I'm awake.

164
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,373
I'm really very awake.

165
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,311
Let the machine get it.

166
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:43,433
Hello?

167
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,181
Who's watching the baby?

168
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:48,953
Hey. Hey.

169
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,372
You all right? Dinner? No?

170
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:51,542
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,562
- Can I help?
- I don't know. I love you.

172
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:57,510
I love you, too.

173
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:01,550
Dammit!

174
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,512
Yeah.

175
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:10,453
The baby's fine.

176
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:11,851
It's the mother.

177
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,140
God. She treats me like I'm her wife.

178
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:18,930
Yeah. She's got me doing the grocery shopping, picking up her dry cleaning.

179
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:19,890
If she asked me to

180
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:24,472
get her a cuban cigar and a foot massage, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

181
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,933
No. Listen, the baby's fine.

182
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:27,632
The place is beautiful.

183
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,971
She promised me!

184
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:58,752
Hang on. The baby's crying.

185
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:00,801
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

186
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:17,430
Shh, shh, shh.

187
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,742
Shh. It's ok. It's all right.

188
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,251
Hey. Hey. Hey.

189
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,271
There you are. Hey.

190
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,400
It's all right.

191
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:34,551
That was weird, huh?

192
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,590
That was weird, but everything's fine now.

193
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,070
The diaper? No.

194
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:44,642
It's all right.

195
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,492
What's bothering you, kiddo?

196
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:57,760
It's all right.

197
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:02,200
Who's there?

198
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:07,151
Who is it?!

199
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:11,512
Who's there?!

200
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,270
What do you want?

201
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,242
Leave us alone!

202
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:32,740
Get away!

203
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:34,402
What do you want?

204
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:42,000
Leave me alone!

205
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,013
Leave me alone!

206
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,303
Leave me alone!

207
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,070
Georgina!

208
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,080
Georgina?

209
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:21,232
911, what's your emergency?

210
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,900
Yes, this is an emergency. There's been an accident.

211
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:25,081
Georgina!

212
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,373
I don't want to leave her at the hospital alone.

213
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,772
She's a little banged up, but she's stable now.

214
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:44,932
Not  exactly the romantic evening we had in mind.

215
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,302
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

216
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,310
- I'm glad you called me over here.
- The baby's ok?

217
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:51,840
Yeah. She stopped crying.

218
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,282
I gave her a crossword puzzle. It seemed to do something.

219
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:57,731
Just one more woman that finds you irresistible.

220
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,543
So, do you have any contact information on Christine?

221
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,241
Yeah. Her number was in the kitchen.

222
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,591
I left a message on her cell phone and her assistant's.

223
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:05,491
Thank you.

224
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,581
You know what, Jim? I gotta go.

225
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:11,532
Are you sure that nothing weird has happened? No angry spirit or anything?

226
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,403
Hey, hey. Stop worrying, ok? Everything's fine.

227
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:17,880
Uh-oh.

228
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,121
What's wrong?

229
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,402
Nothing.

230
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,660
She woke up. I just got slimed.

231
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,020
You're a saint. I'll call you back.

232
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:28,333
Talk to you then.

233
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:29,331
Hey.

234
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:30,281
Look what you did.

235
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:54,640
Georgina?

236
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:58,393
Georgina?

237
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,902
There's something in that house.

238
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:06,973
What?

239
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,000
It was the boy. He did this to me.

240
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,282
Georgina, you need to rest.

241
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,593
He's a demon child.

242
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:14,053
Watch the baby.

243
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:16,340
She's in danger.

244
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:19,972
I will.

245
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:21,892
Ok?

246
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:38,810
-  Melinda?
- Yes.

247
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,011
Oh, thank god!

248
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,773
What happened? How's the baby?

249
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,351
Oh, don't worry. The baby is--is fine.

250
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,012
Georgina had an accident. She fell down the stairs.

251
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,523
- Where's Jessie?
- She's with my husband.

252
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,283
- Your husband?
- He's a paramedic.

253
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:51,331
She's safe with him.

254
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,300
OK, Melinda, I don't understand. How did you get involved?

255
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,583
Well, I--I went back to your house earlier...

256
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:02,153
to--to get my purse, um...

257
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,343
because I'd left it behind, and, uh...

258
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,600
I saw that Georgina had fallen.

259
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:08,721
Is she ok?

260
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,901
Yeah, she's gonna be fine. It was just a freak accident.

261
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,411
This is such a nightmare. Ok, I'm getting the next flight back.

262
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:20,631
I'm on my way back to your house now, and I will stay there until you get home.

263
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,752
Melinda, are you comfortable watching a baby?

264
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:26,251
Hey, I bought a car off the baby-sitting money I made in high school.

265
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,523
I guess that means yes.

266
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,601
We'll take good care of her, ok?

267
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:32,312
Just get home as soon as you can.

268
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:35,231
Ok. Thank you so much, Melinda. Thank you for everything.

269
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,751
Looking for something?

270
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:18,612
I know you're here.

271
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,342
Where is she?

272
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,263
What did you do with the baby?

273
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,062
You shouldn't have fallen asleep.

274
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:02,532
Jim?

275
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:06,170
Hello? Where are you?

276
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,880
Hey.

277
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,291
Honey, I've been worried.

278
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:14,723
Is everything ok?

279
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:15,591
Yeah.

280
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:16,610
Yeah, everything's good.

281
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,962
I think spirit boy's messing with my head, but

282
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,500
otherwise, things are fine.

283
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:21,983
You're amazing to do this.

284
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:23,681
It's like practice.

285
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,023
Have you been sleeping?

286
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,502
Yeah, she was up just a few minutes ago.

287
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,342
You're wasting your time, Daniel.

288
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,351
He was here. Now he's gone...

289
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:38,983
for now.

290
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,321
You think he's dangerous?

291
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:44,103
If you can't see him, he might be.

292
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:48,562
As long as I can keep an eye on him and not let Jessie out of my sight, we should be ok.

293
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,510
Christina will be on the first flight back in the morning.

294
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:53,722
So, uh,

295
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:54,593
what do we do?

296
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,251
We take turns watching the baby, right?

297
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,310
I'll watch the baby,

298
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:00,602
see if I can talk to Daniel. You get some sleep. You look exhausted.

299
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,502
All right.

300
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,741
Good night.

301
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:05,943
Hi! Hi!

302
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,832
Don't cry. I'll just get you a bottle.

303
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,451
You can trust me, you know.

304
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:20,773
I won't hurt you.

305
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:23,383
Melinda.

306
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:38,701
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout</i>

307
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:43,193
<i>down came the rain and washed the spider out</i>

308
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:47,280
<i>up came the sun and dried up all the rain</i>

309
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:51,710
<i>the itsy-bitsy spider went up the spout again.</i>

310
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,631
That's a beautiful sight.

311
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:55,772
Why aren't you sleeping?

312
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,253
I gotta go to work soon.

313
00:18:58,827 --> 00:18:59,722
Here. Let me try.

314
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,280
How you doing, girl?

315
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,422
I'm impressed.

316
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,432
Ok.

317
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:17,411
There you are.

318
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,203
Snug as a bug in a rug.

319
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:20,572
Wow.

320
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,312
Something my mom taught me.

321
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,483
Makes you think, doesn't it?

322
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:27,472
Sure.

323
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,372
How can it not?

324
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,810
You'd make a great mom, you know that?

325
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:33,533
Whoa.

326
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:34,713
We're not ready.

327
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:38,262
- It's just not time yet.
- I know. I know we said we'd wait.

328
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:39,361
I do. I just...

329
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,441
sometimes I wonder what we're waiting for.

330
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,541
A finished house, for one thing.

331
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,362
We have so much to do.

332
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:49,890
Work, save money.

333
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,842
I'm taking every shift I can.

334
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,141
You're really planning on this.

335
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:58,180
I'm just thinking ahead.

336
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,803
Well, it's...

337
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,600
just not the right time.

338
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,613
When?

339
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,360
You can't put a clock on it.

340
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,721
Your heart tells you when you're ready,

341
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,602
not your bank account.

342
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,550
I'm just not there yet.

343
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:20,471
I better go to work.

344
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:25,100
I'll call you.

345
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:53,451
Please don't hurt her.

346
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:56,520
No, you don't hurt her.

347
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,881
I just wanna help you. Why are you still here?

348
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:02,763
I live here.

349
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:04,461
This is my home.

350
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:07,781
But you don't live here anymore. I mean, don't you get it?

351
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,782
You're mother's leaving because of you.

352
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,933
You've driven her out.

353
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,781
She was hardly ever here anyway.

354
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:18,732
The job always came first for my mom and dad.

355
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,791
Treated me like I was invisible.

356
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,823
She always left me with the nanny.

357
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:38,671
Lots of moms work hard.

358
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,410
You just don't get it!

359
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:43,392
Stop it!

360
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:46,242
- You're scaring your sister.
- Just leave me alone!

361
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,010
Daniel?

362
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:53,363
Shh. Baby.

363
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,221
It's ok.

364
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:18,121
I know that it's hard to walk away from your mother and sister,

365
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:20,191
but there's a better place for you.

366
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:21,463
I'm not going.

367
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:25,893
You're just hurting yourself and everyone around you. Is that what you really want?

368
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,741
I'm not leaving until they find her.

369
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,210
Who?

370
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:32,800
Suzanne.

371
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,353
Who is she?

372
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,252
My nanny before.

373
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,603
Is she special to you?

374
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,000
Special.

375
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:53,982
She watched me die.

376
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,330
Melinda!

377
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:14,130
- Melinda!
- I'm up here.

378
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:19,471
- Oh, my god. I was so worried.
- That's ok. She's fine.

379
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:21,872
She slept almost all the way through the night.

380
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:25,042
How's Georgina?

381
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:26,242
Ok.

382
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:29,440
Nothing's broken. It's a miracle. Just some bruises.

383
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,353
I guess that'll be a lawsuit.

384
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:35,830
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,932
You must think I'm hard or something.

386
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:40,231
No.  I know that you have a lot of stress.

387
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,862
It's just that work is really important to me.

388
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:47,521
I want her to have everything that she needs, especially now that her father's gone.

389
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,511
It's what I wanted for my son, too.

390
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:53,180
Georgina told me that you lost your son. I'm so sorry.

391
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:56,370
My husband and I, we were so...

392
00:23:57,615 --> 00:23:58,513
devastated.

393
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:03,100
Just lost, you know. We couldn't figure out a plan. We didn't know what to do.

394
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:07,821
I thought if we had another child it would give us a second chance.

395
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:09,033
And it didn't.

396
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,580
Ted just couldn't get back on track.

397
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:15,270
I'm so sorry.

398
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,461
Look, is there anything I can-- can I pay you for your time or...?

399
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,113
No. No, I'm just really glad that it all worked out.

400
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,452
There must be something I can do.

401
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,490
Maybe one thing.

402
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,302
You had a nanny before. Suzanne. Do you know

403
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:29,812
how I might reach her?

404
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,340
Who told you about Suzanne?

405
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,542
Georgina... mentioned her.

406
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,901
'Cause I have a friend who's looking for a nanny.

407
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:43,273
Well, tell your friend to keep looking. She doesn't want Suzanne.

408
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:52,541
You think Suzanne might be responsible for Daniel's death?

409
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:54,541
I don't know, but either way, I have to find out.

410
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:56,411
Because Daniel may be looking for revenge.

411
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:59,211
- Man, he sounds like a little terror.
- Yeah, he's very troubled.

412
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:01,800
I wish you'd called me last night. I would have been glad to come and help.

413
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:03,831
Jim was there. Otherwise, I definitely would have.

414
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:07,083
Ah! I get it. You were living out your dirty babysitter fantasy.

415
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,692
Hardly. He saw me with the baby and started talking about having one of our own.

416
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,652
- Oh! That's exciting.
- No, not really.

417
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:17,571
Oh, come on, Melinda. Every time you see a baby, you're practically drooling.

418
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:20,270
That does not mean I want to start a family tomorrow.

419
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:21,213
Fine.

420
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:23,371
Procreate at your own pace. See if I care.

421
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:27,223
I'm sorry. I just hope that he doesn't start putting pressure on me about this.

422
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,832
You know what? I totally get it. It's a huge responsibility.

423
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:31,550
You shouldn't rush into it. He'll understand.

424
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,550
- Oh! I found something!
- What is it?

425
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:35,782
A newspaper report on Daniel's death.

426
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,410
Does it say how he died?

427
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,331
No. The police say it was accidental.

428
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:42,311
But it does give me Suzanne's last name.

429
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:54,232
Mr. Richards?

430
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:55,982
Yeah?

431
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,880
Is Suzanne here?

432
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,201
Who's asking?

433
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:01,583
Sorry. I'm Melinda Gordon. I'm a friend of Christine Greene.

434
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,310
Oh, no.

435
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:06,080
Please don't bring this whole thing up again.

436
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:10,281
Do you have any idea how my wife's life was destroyed by what happened to that boy?

437
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:12,272
I may be able to help her.

438
00:26:13,627 --> 00:26:14,523
How?

439
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,451
Can you just tell me where I could find her?

440
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:32,212
You've seen me.

441
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:33,771
You gotta help me.

442
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:36,541
Come on, lady. The jig is up. You looked me right in the eye.

443
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,461
- Not now, ok?
- Yes. Please.

444
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:41,692
I need to get a message to my wife. She's been living here for years.

445
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:44,380
Do you have any idea how long I've been hanging around this place?

446
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,282
It's depressing.

447
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:48,131
The sheer monotony, not to mention the smell.

448
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:50,701
Bleach and ammonia. I can't take it anymore.

449
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:56,441
Oh, right.

450
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:58,133
The kid gets your attention.

451
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:00,940
- What am I, wood?
- You know what?

452
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,191
I need you to help me find Suzanne Richards.

453
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:04,401
Now you need my help?

454
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,131
She's a caretaker, in her twenties.

455
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,562
Are you gonna help me talk to my wife or not?

456
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:10,761
If you help me find Suzanne, I will owe you one, ok? I promise.

457
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,131
- I can't believe this.
- Please?

458
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,830
She works up on the second floor.

459
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,971
She was just up there changing the beds.

460
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,280
Yes!

461
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:34,633
Hi.

462
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:36,643
- Who are you?
- Melinda Gordon.

463
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:39,632
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I think so.

464
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,210
I just don't know what happened.

465
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,690
I'm--I'm sorry. Who are you?

466
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:46,521
You're Suzanne, right?

467
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:49,100
I'm a friend of the Greene family.

468
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,782
Oh.

469
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:53,181
And I want to talk to you about Daniel.

470
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:57,221
I'm sorry. I don't know what you want, but I don't talk about Daniel.

471
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:58,530
Well, he talks about you.

472
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,243
- Daniel's dead.
- Daniel's here.

473
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:02,850
Who the hell are you?

474
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:05,991
Just a person who's trying to help you.

475
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,033
Look, I know that this is hard to believe, but Daniel's here--

476
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:14,012
his spirit anyway-- and he told me that he won't cross over until he sees you.

477
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,683
- I'm calling security.
- Please don't.

478
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,523
Just give me 5 minutes. You may be in danger.

479
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,051
She's wearing the bracelet I made her.

480
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,132
This is the one she made me.

481
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:36,111
He says that you're wearing the bracelet he made you,

482
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,782
and he's wearing the one that you made him.

483
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,341
I don't understand.

484
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,932
Ask her if she remembers what happened that day.

485
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:50,913
He wants to know if you remember what happened the day he died.

486
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,480
Do I remember? What kind of question is that?

487
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,011
I'll always remember.

488
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:57,761
He wants you to tell me.

489
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:06,101
I only know what happened after.

490
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:07,460
After what?

491
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,980
After he went upstairs to see Christine.

492
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,413
It was saturday, my day off,

493
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:18,721
but Christine had asked me to do some household chores for her.

494
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:20,791
I heard Daniel. He was upset.

495
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:22,923
He was running down the stairs.

496
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:25,833
Daniel?

497
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:34,730
Daniel!

498
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,540
Daniel! Stop! What are you doing?!

499
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:46,831
Daniel!

500
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,870
By the time I got there, it was too late.

501
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,472
I saw him die.

502
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,210
He died right in front of me, looking at me.

503
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:04,742
He said his last words to me.

504
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,001
And then Christine

505
00:30:09,578 --> 00:30:10,922
was right there behind me.

506
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,290
Somebody please help us!

507
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:40,841
It was all over in less than a minute.

508
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:47,361
But I can't get the image of that car out of my head,

509
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,811
of his face, of Christine's face.

510
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,003
Sometimes I wake up thinking

511
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:02,990
I should have stopped him somehow. There must have been a way.

512
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:05,673
Maybe if I would have been quicker.

513
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,142
My mother thought that Suzanne

514
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:14,123
could have done something to stop me,

515
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:16,090
but she's wrong.

516
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,340
She couldn't have done anything.

517
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:29,242
I never meant for her to get blamed.

518
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,710
She's the only person that took care of me,

519
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:35,293
the only person that

520
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:37,100
really cared, you know.

521
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:41,652
She made me laugh.

522
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,921
Sit with me for hours and play with the trains.

523
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,040
What?

524
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,190
- What's happening in here?
- One second.

525
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:55,152
She helped me pick out all the jobs and names for the people in that town.

526
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,922
They all had crazy relationships in that town, Bakersville.

527
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,740
He's talking about Bakersville.

528
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:08,360
He's really here.

529
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:20,381
Bakersville, that was a real "payton place," that town.

530
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,832
Tell her she couldn't have stopped me.

531
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:27,483
It wasn't her job.

532
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:30,370
Not that day.

533
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:35,451
He wants you to know that everything that happened wasn't your fault.

534
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,561
There's nothing you could do.

535
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,211
Daniel, I miss you so much.

536
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:48,680
Tell her I miss her, too.

537
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:50,971
He misses you, too.

538
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:53,363
He's crying.

539
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:55,313
I'm not crying!

540
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,093
Why is she here with all these old people?

541
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,660
He wants to know why you're not working with kids anymore.

542
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:06,061
I haven't really been able to be around kids. It's better this way.

543
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:10,832
What does he want?

544
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,662
I want her to go talk to my mom.

545
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:20,501
He wants you to go and talk to Christine.

546
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:22,852
No.

547
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:24,672
I can't. I...

548
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:28,042
no. I couldn't face her.

549
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:35,383
I need her to tell my mother what I said right before I died.

550
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,923
I didn't know if-- if you'd see me.

551
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:56,152
- Melinda said there was a good reason.
- There is.

552
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:59,292
I just need you to have an open mind and listen.

553
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:02,750
Suzanne has something that she needs to tell you.

554
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:07,443
Christine...

555
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:10,960
the day Daniel died,

556
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:12,602
when I heard

557
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:15,120
the crash, I ran to the car.

558
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:18,081
I got there. Daniel was conscious.

559
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,263
He looked up at me,

560
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:23,442
and he told me something that I was never gonna tell you.

561
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,482
He said...

562
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:28,532
I wish you were my mother.

563
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,420
He said that to you?

564
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,992
That's a terrible thing to tell me even if it's true.

565
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,393
I know. I'm sorry.

566
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:48,771
This is something that I was never gonna tell you.

567
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:51,922
- Well, then why now?
- Because Daniel wanted you to hear it.

568
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:53,870
What are you talking about?

569
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:57,193
Christine, the weird things that happen in this house, the sounds,

570
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:59,443
the accident with Georgina, it's all Daniel.

571
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:01,060
He's still here.

572
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:03,803
Are you completely out of your mind?

573
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:05,242
It's true.

574
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:07,831
I didn't believe it either, but it's true.

575
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,730
Moving out of this house is not gonna solve anything. Daniel will follow you.

576
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:15,811
So you're telling me that my son...

577
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:18,001
is haunting me?

578
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:19,401
Yes...

579
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:21,223
and he's here right now.

580
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:24,130
Oh, my god. This is too much.

581
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:26,741
This is too much.

582
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,231
Ask her if she remembers the promise.

583
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:34,102
He wants to know if you remember the promise you made.

584
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,420
Well, if he's really here, ask him to tell you.

585
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:49,050
Well, it was the day after she got back from a 2-week business trip.

586
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:51,113
Danny, I have to work.

587
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,152
All the time?

588
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,640
It's not all the time. I know it seems that way.

589
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,533
Yes, it is all the time.

590
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,102
Even when you're home,

591
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,050
you're on the phone, the computer, doing something.

592
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:04,402
We live a good life.

593
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:07,200
What do you think pays for that?

594
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,743
That doesn't come for free, sweetie. You know that.

595
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:11,643
Yes...

596
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:13,712
but what good is this good life?

597
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:15,503
What good is it?

598
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:17,161
I never see you.

599
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,072
Ok.

600
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,870
How about on saturday, we got to the baseball game?

601
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:24,152
Just you and me. And then after that,

602
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:28,232
we'll go to Geneo's and we'll get some pizza. How does that sound?

603
00:36:29,027 --> 00:36:29,923
I guess.

604
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,763
Ok. It's a date,

605
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:33,642
all right?

606
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,723
Ok.

607
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,403
She broke that promise like all others.

608
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:41,120
Yes, it is the same clothing. I'm looking at it right now.

609
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,022
I am going.

610
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:44,270
No, you cannot sell the same clothing line on the web site

611
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:47,282
that they're selling at Bloomingdale's. That's a breach of my contract with them.

612
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,201
Honey, this is a really important phone call.

613
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:51,060
Mom, we're missing the first inning.

614
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:52,652
5 minutes. Give me 5 minutes.

615
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:53,713
What? No.

616
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:57,191
You're gonna have to take if off the web site. That's the only solution.

617
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:58,090
I'll go.

618
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:00,693
Mom.

619
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,352
I'm going!

620
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,591
I'm going by myself!

621
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:29,850
He's telling you this?

622
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:31,621
Right now?

623
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:34,932
Why?

624
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:37,650
Because he wants you to know why he was so angry,

625
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:39,681
why he is so angry.

626
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,902
Daniel,

627
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:44,431
I did it all for you.

628
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,352
I grew up with nothing.

629
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:49,523
I wasn't gonna let that happen to you.

630
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,323
I grew up with nothing, too.

631
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,441
I just had a lot of stuff.

632
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,600
I just wanted her.

633
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:01,411
He said that

634
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,061
everything you gave him never mattered.

635
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:08,651
He just wanted to spend time with you. That's all he needed.

636
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,100
He loved you, Christine.

637
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:16,311
He was always talking about you. He was always thinking about what would make you happy,

638
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:18,042
what would make you proud of him.

639
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:19,840
I was proud if him.

640
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:23,533
I just wished she would have shown it to me

641
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:24,801
sometimes.

642
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,272
He just wishes that you would have shown him how you felt.

643
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:29,751
I thought he knew.

644
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:35,440
Tell her she has to be different with Jessie.

645
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:37,473
She can't have it happen again.

646
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,802
He wants you to be different

647
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:42,253
with Jessie. She really needs you.

648
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:48,371
Ok.

649
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:52,922
Tell her that that's why I scared the other nannies away.

650
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,912
That's why he gave the other nannies such a hard time.

651
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:03,020
Tell him I'm sorry.

652
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:06,543
He knows.

653
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,450
Tell her I'm gonna be ok now...

654
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:23,323
that I want her to be happy.

655
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:38,422
- Am I supposed to be over there?
- The light?

656
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:40,572
Yeah.

657
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:46,032
Tell Suzanne she shouldn't be afraid to work with kids again.

658
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,411
Someone does need her.

659
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:54,491
I love you.

660
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:02,493
Thanks.

661
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,200
Good-bye.

662
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:17,543
- I'll go--
- No.

663
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:18,893
I got it.

664
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,181
Hi! I'm home!

665
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:33,593
Where are you?

666
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:37,170
Whoa! Hey!

667
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,953
Hi. Are you home for the night?

668
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:42,450
Bobby is back at work tomorrow. So I do not have to be in until noon.

669
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:44,580
Hallelujah. I get my husband back.

670
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:45,373
No, no!

671
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:46,043
No!

672
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:48,701
I'm cooking for you tonight, and you are not helping me in any way.

673
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:50,343
I'm backing away from grocery bags.

674
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,542
This is supposed to be a surprise, so shoo!

675
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:56,410
- I said shoo.
- All right.

676
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,630
Just getting a beer.

677
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:00,520
Stop it.

678
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,700
You know, we never finished our conversation.

679
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:05,652
What conversation?

680
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:07,902
- The baby conversation.
- Oh.

681
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,910
I thought we finished that conversation, at least for now.

682
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:14,882
What's wrong, Mel?

683
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:16,272
Nothing's wrong.

684
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,951
We always talk about having babies. It always makes you laugh.

685
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:21,011
I know you wanna wait. That's ok. But...

686
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:22,721
there's something else.

687
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:24,302
Seems like you're

688
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:25,581
scared by it.

689
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:27,611
Maybe I am.

690
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:29,693
Why?

691
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,332
Well, because I always

692
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,612
thought the gift skipped a generation.

693
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,372
Now I'm not so sure.

694
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:41,090
You're afraid our baby might be able to...

695
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:44,390
No...

696
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:47,660
yes--I don't know. It's just, um...

697
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:51,410
it's hard to be different.

698
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:54,980
You know, it's a struggle, especially

699
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:56,201
when you're a kid.

700
00:41:56,535 --> 00:41:58,702
The ridicule, humiliation, loneliness.

701
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:02,022
Are you lonely?

702
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,182
Not anymore, but

703
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:07,840
look at what it did to the relationship between me and my mother. I mean,

704
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:08,741
she can hardly

705
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,753
speak to me. Sometimes barely even look at me.

706
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:15,372
What if I'm like that with our kids?

707
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,232
That's never gonna happen.

708
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:24,702
I know you.

709
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:27,080
And our kids,

710
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:29,351
they'll know who they are,

711
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:30,983
and they'll know it's ok.

712
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,691
Whatever they do or can't do,

713
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:34,753
they'll be loved.

714
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,312
How will you feel?
