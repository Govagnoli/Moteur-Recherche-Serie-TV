00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,446
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:13,243
<i>I just got married,</i>

3
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:14,817
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,420
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:21,870
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,771
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:26,221
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

9
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,719
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

10
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:32,370
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

11
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,875
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

12
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:36,406
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

13
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,316
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

14
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:09,520
- So, will you do it?
- No.

15
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,212
Not fair.

16
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:14,223
You know, I have told you a thousand times I'm not telling your boss his dead,

17
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:17,622
disgruntled employee put a hex on him. First of all, there's no such thing.

18
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:18,723
He doesn't know that!

19
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:21,082
You know, there are people waiting for you in the light-- go.

20
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,430
You're not the boss of me.

21
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:23,473
Real mature, Gary.

22
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:29,192
Don't marry him, Elaine.

23
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:31,612
He just wants our money. I know guys like this.

24
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:32,681
Conrad.

25
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,650
Good morning.

26
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,943
- So, did you talk to her?
- Your wife?

27
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:44,492
Yes, my wife at the rest home.

28
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,890
I'm sorry, I've been really busy, but I will try to get out there this weekend.

29
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,661
- I promise.
- Sure, don't worry about me.

30
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,160
I've only been dead for 50 years. I've got all the time in the world!

31
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,350
- Ah, good morning.
- Hey!

32
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,391
- How you doing?
- Oh, you know.

33
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,590
Same old, same old.

34
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:05,983
You know, you seem suspiciously cheerful.

35
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:08,151
Hmm, do I?

36
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:12,380
Oh, well.

37
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,121
I met somebody the other night.

38
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,381
Do tell.

39
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:19,241
Ok, he's a teacher at the high school, but at night he's

40
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,460
this unbelievable spoken word poet. You have to hear his stuff.

41
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:23,642
He's handsome.

42
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:24,930
He's sensitive.

43
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,301
- And he's tall.
- Sold!

44
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:30,612
Actually he's performing tonight at this poetry slam thing in Bay Ridge.

45
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,171
- Do you want to go?
- Absolutely.

46
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:34,260
I want to meet the guy that has you looking like this.

47
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,210
Like what?

48
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:38,170
Like you just grabbed the gold ring on the merry-go-round.

49
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,080
You know, like really.

50
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:50,130
Um, so should we take my car to the reading?

51
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,773
Uh, no, I should probably drive on my own. Otherwise I'll have to double back.

52
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,573
Oh, ok. You have the directions, right?

53
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,522
- Yes.
- Ok.

54
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,231
Evening, ma'am.

55
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,172
There's a chill in the air tonight.

56
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:01,773
That's why I have on my jacket.

57
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,993
I'm not even gonna ask.

58
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,470
Yeah.

59
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,421
- Ok.
- Ok.

60
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,583
- See you there.
- See you there.

61
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:44,820
You.

62
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,550
You're the one who can see us.

63
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:49,602
Do I know you?

64
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,593
It was a cemetery.

65
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:54,963
Melinda.

67
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,720
No one saw what happened? There were no witnesses?

68
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:30,893
I should have made her ride with me.

69
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,902
Hey, come on, 'drea, how could you know?

70
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,132
Where is the doctor?

71
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,930
I need some answers. I can't just sit here.

72
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:39,320
Calm down.

73
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,703
Don't tell me to calm down. I'm her mother.

74
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,293
I know the people at this hospital. She's gonna get the best care. Believe me.

75
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:48,732
- Jim.
- Hey. How is she?

76
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:52,443
There's been some intracranial swelling.

77
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:54,671
Yeah?

78
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:57,993
And she's in a light coma at the moment, but I have every hope--

79
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,941
Doctor, I'm a nurse. He's a paramedic.

80
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,942
You don't have to play the happy game with us.

81
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:04,800
A coma is a coma.

82
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:08,922
All right.

83
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:10,972
What's next? What do we do now?

84
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,243
Well, for now we

85
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,702
monitor  her vital signs carefully and wait.

86
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,570
What was that?

87
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:05,592
Jim?

88
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:08,563
Andrea?

89
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:10,351
Where is everybody?

90
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,230
Mom, I'm scared.

91
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,410
Come on, dear.

92
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,053
We'll go into it together.

93
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,113
No. Hear me.

94
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:37,351
Don't leave me.

95
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:42,941
Don't leave me.

96
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:53,992
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,713
Grandma, I can't.

98
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:58,100
Not yet.

99
00:07:58,618 --> 00:07:59,812
That's all right, dear.

100
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:01,560
All in good time.

101
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,680
Jim.

102
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:28,780
I saw it.

103
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:31,682
I saw the light.

104
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,693
Oh, God.

105
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,043
Guys, this is ridiculous.

106
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:48,261
I rested for a week in the hospital. I'm fine.

107
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,213
Oh, yeah? Really?

108
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,502
What happened the night you fell?

109
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,332
- Do you remember?
- Not exactly.

110
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:54,593
Where's Homer?

111
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,812
Homer? Who's Homer?

112
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,673
Uh, he's our dog.

113
00:08:58,808 --> 00:08:59,751
Sort of.

114
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,312
Actually, he's a ghost dog.

115
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,740
A ghost dog! How cute!

116
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,221
I bet you are hungry after that hospital food. I'm gonna fix you a nice breakfast.

117
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:13,433
- What is with her?
- I don't know.

118
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:16,802
She's so cheerful. What happened to the woman who couldn't bear to hear about ghosts?

119
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,000
She is freaking me out.

120
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:21,052
Well, she did stay up all night in the hospital wondering if she'd ever talk

121
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:23,612
to her daughter again. That would make anybody cheerful. Where are you going?

122
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:24,681
Wait, no, no. Go back.

123
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:25,630
No, come on.

124
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,310
- Well, that's funny.
- What?

125
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,090
-  Gary's not out there.
- Remind me.

126
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,721
- He wants me to tell his boss--
- oh, yeah, there's a hex on him. Right.

127
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:41,080
Yeah, well, he's been out there every morning since he died a few months ago.

128
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,200
Well, maybe he gave up.

129
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,371
No, he's not the giving up type.

130
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:46,193
And you know what's weird is I have not seen one ghost in a whole week.

131
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:47,440
Maybe they're just being considerate.

132
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,150
Ghosts are a lot of things. Considerate is not one of them.

133
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,020
- Coffee or tea, darling?
- Coffee.

134
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,572
Apparently a lot of things are weird. You know, when I go back to work tomorrow--

135
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,513
Whoa, whoa. No, no. No going back to work. You just got out of the hospital.

136
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,460
I'm fine.

137
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:04,412
Besides, that week I was in the hospital was the most boring month of my life.

138
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,582
Boredom is underrated.

139
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,113
Boredom is boring,

140
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,340
ok? And you can't stop me, so don't even try.

141
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,641
- Three days a week.
- No.

142
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,360
Half-days. That's my final offer.

143
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,462
- Or what?
- Or I will withhold

144
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,445
my husbandly attention.

145
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,386
- You don't mean that.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,626
- Give me strength.
- You don't mean that.

147
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,842
All right, fine. Half-days.

148
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,071
Ah, she gave in to my superior will.

149
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,401
Yeah, but my first half-day starts today.

150
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,723
Ah, what are you gonna do? It's a sunday.

151
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,911
Open mail. Smell the lotion.

152
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,842
You really do love this place, don't you.

153
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:38,793
I do!

154
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:42,193
It's  beautiful, look, the rain has washed everything so clean.

155
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,193
- This is definitely weird.
- What?

156
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,710
The regulars are gone.

157
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:51,862
The regulars?

158
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:52,840
Yeah, the cranky guy,

159
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:54,871
the boy pushing the thing.

160
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:56,672
Rancher on a horse.

161
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,532
Oh. Do you really see that many ghosts from other times?

162
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:01,192
Sure. I just block them out.

163
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:05,211
Oh, you know who that is? That's Mr. Keeler. Gary's boss.

164
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:06,732
He's the guy with a hex on him, huh?

165
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,582
He doesn't really have a hex on him.

166
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:12,541
Mr. Keeler!

167
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,653
- You all right?
- No!

168
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:21,551
First these punks deface my property. Now the building's falling apart.

169
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,582
Just one piece of bad luck after another.

170
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,533
What? Honey?

171
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,030
Gary's up there. He has to be.

172
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,422
Gary, you come down here and show yourself right now!

173
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,562
Honey, honey, calm down.

174
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,470
No, this is crazy. Why can't I see him?

175
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:37,023
He was just up there. He made the thing come down.

176
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:41,220
What if it's me?

177
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,953
Think about it. I haven't seen one ghost since the accident,

178
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:48,212
not even in the hospital. What if the ghosts are really here, right in front of me,

179
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:51,961
- and I just can't see them anymore?
- Shh, honey. Come on. It's all right.

180
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:54,040
You're gonna be all right.

181
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,572
You're telling me you don't see a single ghost?

182
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,443
It's so weird. I've seen ghosts all my life. I mean,

183
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:07,231
it's bizarre to know that they're out there and not be able to communicate with them.

184
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,832
How do you think this happened?

185
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,232
The accident, I guess.

186
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,911
Some people lose their sense of smell.

187
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:14,893
I lose my gift.

188
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:18,132
- You think it's gonna come back?
- God, I hope so.

189
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,440
Jim seems relieved though.

190
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,421
Maybe he's happy you're alive, Melinda.

191
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:27,743
Still, I don't think I should tell him how much the whole thing bugs me.

192
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,253
I don't know. I just look around, and everything looks so...

193
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:32,941
empty.

194
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,862
I don't know how people live like this.

195
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,523
I'm doing all right. Thank you very much.

196
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,652
- Oh, yeah. The poet.
- Yes, the poet. Ashton.

197
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,143
Right, I never got to meet him.

198
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,321
You know, actually he has another poetry slam thing coming up right across the square.

199
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,423
Good. I will be there for sure this time.

200
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:51,742
Melinda?

201
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,293
I hope you recognize me.

202
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,882
Of course. Diane, hi!

203
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:58,571
How are you?

204
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:00,823
Question is, how are you?

205
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,162
Oh, everything's...

206
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,713
it's fine.

207
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,603
- You remember Andrea?
- Yes,

208
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,300
good to see you again.

209
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:09,620
Could I, uh...

210
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,503
could I have a minute?

211
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,132
Sure.

212
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:15,652
It's my niece.

213
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:19,830
Her boyfriend died last week. It was very sudden.

214
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,632
Oh,  I'm so sorry.

215
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:24,802
Please sit.

216
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:28,730
- It's hot.
- Thank you.

217
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,773
I'm not exactly sure how to say this.

218
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:38,940
You remember how skeptical I was when you brought me together with my boy Jason?

219
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,461
Sometimes it takes a leap of faith.

220
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,422
Caitlin is acting strange.

221
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,820
She sees things and hears things. She's...

222
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,172
so you think she's being haunted by her boyfriend?

223
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:55,332
Thank you for not making me say it.

224
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:58,640
So you want me to talk to the boy's spirit?

225
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,780
Or let Caitlin speak to him through you.

226
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,770
I think it will give her peace.

227
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,280
Diane, I'm uh...

228
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:14,822
going through something right now that I don't really understand yet.

229
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:22,200
Um, my gift is not very strong at the moment, and I'm not seeing--

230
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:24,523
Melinda.

231
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:27,923
My brother, he doesn't understand what she's going through,

232
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:30,553
and their relationship is strained.

233
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,912
If you could just talk to her,

234
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,421
just let her know that she's...

235
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,203
she's not crazy.

236
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,060
Your aunt said that you've been having a rough time.

237
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,343
She said you talked to my cousin Jason

238
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,350
after he was already dead.

239
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:53,882
Yes, I did.

240
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,783
Are you some sort of psychic or something?

241
00:14:58,517 --> 00:14:59,461
No.

242
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:00,930
It's different.

243
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,402
Is Brian here now?

244
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:07,311
Can you see him?

245
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,612
No.

246
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,092
I  hear his heartbeat

247
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:12,730
all the time,

248
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,173
even when I'm sleeping.

249
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,652
In my dreams I can see him, and he's trying to tell me something.

250
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,612
Can you help me?

251
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,030
I hope so.

252
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:23,932
Is that him?

253
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,301
I think I might have seen him.

254
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:36,340
Really?

255
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:37,672
Where?

256
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,332
Tell me more about him.

257
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:41,581
Brian?

258
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,471
Brian was fantastic.

259
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,910
No one ever thought he would go out with anybody like me,

260
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:50,501
but from the minute Brian and I sat next to each other in chem class,

261
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,173
we just clicked.

262
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,771
At first I thought he just liked me because I helped him understand chemistry.

263
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:02,011
And then I realized he really liked me for me.

264
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:09,002
Homecoming was two weeks away, and he finally admitted he didn't want to go

265
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,782
because he couldn't dance.

266
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:14,253
And I said that was silly. I mean, no one can dance really.

267
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,420
You just kind of move back and forth.

268
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:17,831
So we made a deal.

269
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:22,200
I would go watch him practice football if he would take me to the dance.

270
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,632
And it was the day of homecoming,

271
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,503
and I had just picked up my dress,

272
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,462
and I was so excited.

273
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,060
She was cheerleader pretty.

274
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,423
Just the kind of girl that you would expect him to be with.

275
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,250
I felt like my heart was gonna explode,

276
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,072
like I'd die on the spot.

277
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:49,711
Brian kept calling, and I knew I had to face him.

278
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,732
Caitlin, I need to talk to you.

279
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,030
I guess I was hoping for something to happen

280
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,352
that would make things different.

281
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,513
And then it did.

282
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:29,911
There's a place in the heart,

283
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,451
and if you hit it hard enough

284
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:32,853
at just the right spot,

285
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:34,422
it stops beating.

286
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,081
I knew even before I saw him

287
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,002
he was gone.

288
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:07,321
And I went under the bleachers to cry 'cause I didn't want anyone to see me.

289
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,003
I just couldn't believe that he was gone.

290
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:16,111
I couldn't get that look on his face out of my head.

291
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,943
And then I realized I would never know what he wanted to tell me.

292
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,382
Was he gonna be honest? Was he gonna lie?

293
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,273
Was he breaking up with me?

294
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,812
I thought he loved me.

295
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:31,672
I mean, I thought I was the one.

296
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,663
It's ok.

297
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,071
Caitlin.

298
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,353
What do you want?

299
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,973
I guess I just want to know if he's out there

300
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,332
and if he really loved me,

301
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,903
and if he didn't, I want to know what I did wrong.

302
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:58,323
I dreamt about him.

303
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,722
I saw this tiger come charging towards me.

304
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,583
That was the name of their team: The tigers.

305
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:06,722
And you saw the jersey?

306
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,250
I think I saw Brian too. Right before I had the accident.

307
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:12,432
My heart broke for her.

308
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,782
Losing your first love like that so suddenly.

309
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,502
So this is where it happened?

310
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:18,803
Yeah.

311
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:22,193
I thought if I came back here I might pick up something,

312
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:23,752
like a feeling. Anything.

313
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:25,723
And?

314
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,360
Nothing.

315
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:28,802
At least not--

316
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:33,393
wait.

317
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,323
No.

318
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,512
- No!
- Caitlin!

319
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,483
- What? What is it?
- It's breathing.

320
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:13,680
What's breathing? What?

321
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:17,073
The ball was breathing. It was--it was there!

322
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,813
And the heartbeat, it just kept getting louder and louder.

323
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,493
Oh, my god, I'm going crazy.

324
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:31,383
Aunt Diane, it was Brian, I know it was. It's like he's dying all over again.

325
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:37,890
That was a great night out.

326
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:39,190
Yeah, the food was great.

327
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:40,893
Not just the food.

328
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:42,930
The peace.

329
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,433
What do you mean?

330
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,211
Remember that one restaurant we had to leave because

331
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:49,502
the dead chef kept yelling about how bad the living chef was?

332
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:51,890
I could barely get a bite.

333
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,503
Oh, right.

334
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,600
You're not fooling anybody, you know.

335
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,901
What do you mean?

336
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:05,252
Look, I know how miserable this makes you, losing you gift.

337
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:07,792
Why are you pretending it doesn't?

338
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,691
Because I thought it would make you happy.

339
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,493
You know, to have a normal wife that you don't have to worry about all the time.

340
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,090
I thought it would be a relief.

341
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:24,193
Look.

342
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:26,592
I worry, I admit it.

343
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,423
But I would rather have all the worry in the world than to

344
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,802
see the light go out of your eyes.

345
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:40,200
You can tell me how you really feel.

346
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,293
I can't take it.

347
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,550
How does a person just

348
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:52,551
lose a piece of themselves like this?

349
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,362
You know, making contacts with spirits, it's--

350
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:01,600
it's what I did, it's how I helped people.

351
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:06,930
And now I feel like I just don't know who I am anymore.

352
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:12,781
And I tried to help this poor girl talk to her dead boyfriend, and I

353
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:14,132
just feel like a big fake.

354
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,442
- Hey, shh.
- I do.

355
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,412
Give it time.

356
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:21,883
People change.

357
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:25,131
It's what life is.

358
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:29,361
And that's what we have to make room for.

359
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,912
I'll tell you one thing that'll never change.

360
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,020
That's what gets me through.

361
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:34,903
I know, it was my day off, and I suddenly realized I have never seen your shop before.

362
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,543
Isn't that ridiculous?

363
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,262
I hope you don't mind me popping in like this.

364
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,151
No, mom, of course not. It's just...

365
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:44,692
a surprise.

366
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:46,510
Well, it's a surprise for me too.

367
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:49,183
I've been looking back over these past few years,

368
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:53,362
and I realized I have become completely housebound and I didn't even know it.

369
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:57,670
Oh, this place is absolutely adorable.

370
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,331
You girls do this all by yourself?

371
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:02,363
Mom, are you

372
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,580
- taking something?
- Taking something?

373
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:07,243
Yeah, like a

374
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:08,761
mood stabilizer.

375
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:10,901
No, I'm just--

376
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:15,203
I'm feeling really well lately. Even my migraines are completely gone.

377
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:22,511
Excuse me, I'm looking for something in a pastel to go with my eyes.

378
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,061
Right on time.

379
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:27,783
Come on now. Only a fool would be late for lunch with you.

380
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:28,781
You must be Ashton.

381
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:32,711
Yes. Ashton Beluso this is Melinda Gordon and her mom Beth.

382
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:33,931
Hello.

383
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:37,293
Did she tell you that we're going to your slam poetry thing tomorrow night?

384
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:40,233
Yes, she did, and I'm flattered, but I just

385
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:42,880
hope that I don't fall off the stage.

386
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,490
Oh,  trust me, he owns the stage.

387
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:48,970
Um, we're gonna go to lunch.

388
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:50,221
Really nice to meet you.

389
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,963
Nice to meet you too, Melinda.

390
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,091
Mrs. Gordon.

391
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:54,823
Bye.

392
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:00,632
What a lovely young man.

393
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,272
So nice to see two people so happy together.

394
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:13,650
You know, you have a very interesting definition of half-day.

395
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,250
Well, I had to entertain my mother for an hour.

396
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:19,503
Then I needed an hour to come down from it. And then yet another

397
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:23,520
wistful hour trying to figure out why she couldn't be this happy when I was 13.

398
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:24,720
Well, better late than never.

399
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,032
True. See you tomorrow.

400
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,040
- Half-day.
- Yeah, yeah.

401
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:29,440
Half!

402
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,801
I don't think you want to do this, Caitlin.

403
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:03,800
- Where did you come from?
- I work across the street.

404
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:05,842
Look, will you please just leave me alone?

405
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:06,543
Sure.

406
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:10,593
You just suck that whole bottle down and then drive yourself home. Works for me.

407
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:14,732
Fine. Have the car.

408
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:20,322
- I know you're in pain.
- No, you don't know anything!

409
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,892
- I just want it all to stop.
- Well, that's not the way to erase it.

410
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,093
Well, it's worth a try.

411
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:27,242
You know, you have people that love you.

412
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:29,841
- Your aunt, your father.
- My father doesn't love me.

413
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,043
He hates me because I remind him of my mom.

414
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,970
Your aunt Diane loves you,

415
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:38,160
and she lost her son. Do you really want to go breaking her heart

416
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,410
by hurting yourself too?

417
00:26:40,535 --> 00:26:41,561
I just feel so

418
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:43,203
empty.

419
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:44,803
I know.

420
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,760
I thought Brian was trying to reach me,

421
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:48,663
and now I just think I'm going crazy.

422
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:51,120
Hey, you're not. He's out there. I believe that.

423
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,072
Whe-where is he ?

424
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:54,921
Aunt Diane said you could show me. I need to talk to him.

425
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,303
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

426
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,101
Because something's happened to me.

427
00:26:58,387 --> 00:26:59,530
I stopped seeing them,

428
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:02,042
and I don't know why. But you know, sometimes

429
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:05,392
you just have to go on faith 'cause that's what I'm going on right now.

430
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:08,193
Why don't you just face the fact they're not out there?

431
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:09,530
There's nothing out there

432
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:11,743
but nightmares and bad memories.

433
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:13,523
That's not true.

434
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:17,703
Yes, it is, and you might have fooled my aunt Diane, but you're not gonna fool me.

435
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:18,823
You're a big fake,

436
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:20,213
and I'm on to you.

437
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:23,530
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me alone?

438
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:32,851
Thank you for doing this.

439
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:36,042
Any friend of my sister's... so you're hearing a rattle?

440
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,611
All the time?

441
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:41,523
No, just sometimes. Maybe it's the muffler or something.

442
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,720
I really enjoyed meeting your daughter Caitlin.

443
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:46,671
Oh, yeah?

444
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,852
Well, you didn't have any luck figuring out what was wrong with her, did you.

445
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:52,800
It's not that simple, I guess.

446
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,033
I'm not surprised.

447
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,102
She won't talk to me. She won't talk to Diane.

448
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,871
Still, she does need your support.

449
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:02,070
Caitlin doesn't look to me for support.

450
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,083
She looks right through me, if you want to know the truth.

451
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,423
Mr. Emerson, you may think that this is none of my business,

452
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:11,520
but the one thing that I did find out about Caitlin is that she is very troubled,

453
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:14,631
and she doesn't feel like she can talk to you about it.

454
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:18,232
She thinks that you connect her with her mother and dislike her for it.

455
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:19,963
She told you that?

456
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,611
I can't get two words out of her. She told you all that.

457
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:28,113
She's grieving, Mr. Emerson.

458
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,721
She just lost somebody that she loved.

459
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,123
I know something about loss myself, Ms. Gordon.

460
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:35,601
My wife left me when Caitlin was two.

461
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,563
I had to raise her all by myself.

462
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,711
I provided for her,

463
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:43,191
and I kept her safe.

464
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,000
She's my little girl,

465
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:48,841
and now she looks at me--

466
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:52,321
she looks at me like she hates me. She looks at me

467
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:55,072
like she can't wait to leave me too.

468
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,070
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,272
Nothing wrong with your car, is there.

470
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:10,521
Have a nice day.

471
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:22,210
Adam, a little compassion.

472
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:26,850
Caitlin has had a traumatic experience, and sometimes shock can cause unusual behavior.

473
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,740
We've just got to show her that we're here for her

474
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:31,690
and that we care.

475
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,120
You're a good sister.

476
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:37,783
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here. This is way beyond me.

477
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,802
Melinda Gordon has a very special gift.

478
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,082
She helped me with Jason.

479
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,622
I believe she can help Caitlin, too.

480
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,681
Hope to hell you're right.

481
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:54,461
I'm ok.

482
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:55,731
I'm ok.

483
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:57,542
I'm ok.

484
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:21,451
Brian!

485
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:22,671
Caitlin!

486
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:29,511
Caitlin, what's the matter?

487
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:30,842
What's the matter, honey?

488
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:33,120
Everything is gonna be all right.

489
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:40,703
All right, all right, all right. Ok, now it's time for a poetry lounge favorite.

490
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,820
Writes some powerful stuff that I know y'all are gonna enjoy.

491
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:48,101
So please put your hands together for my dog, Ashton Beluso, y'all!

492
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:49,971
Give it up for Ashton, man.

493
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,321
Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here.

494
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,652
Like to say hello to two of my friends.

495
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:00,493
This poem is called

496
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,093
Agera.

497
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:07,130
The wind is weirdly warm. It pulls and it rips.

498
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:10,280
Departing spirits struggle with the silver coils of fog.

499
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,992
Tormented souls are easy prey

500
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:15,030
still being haunted by what might have been.

501
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,790
The young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.

502
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,050
The peaceful are immune.

503
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:23,913
But who amongst us are in tune with that kind of peace?

504
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:25,361
The man is laughing.

505
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,351
Stand back and watch the hordes of these

506
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:32,522
conflicted souls perform their final unconflicted act.

507
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:37,263
You have no choice.

508
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:50,342
That's what I'm talking about! One more time, man, for Ashton Beluso.

509
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:53,882
Andrea.

510
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:55,660
So what'd you think?

511
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,212
It was crazy good.

512
00:31:57,778 --> 00:31:59,322
- You liked it.
- I loved it.

513
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:02,572
Oh, it was so powerful. Don't you think, Melinda?

514
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,103
I don't understand. Where did you get that?

515
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:07,371
Get what?

516
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,792
The part about the departing ghosts getting pulled away.

517
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,393
The silvery fog and everything.

518
00:32:11,785 --> 00:32:13,983
Oh, this crazy dream I had the other night.

519
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:15,570
There were these

520
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:18,271
two dark figures in some kind of mass exodus.

521
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,450
I don't know. I just write what comes to me, you know?

522
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:26,581
So, look, I got to stay. One of my students is going up, and I promised I'd listen.

523
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:27,733
So I'll see you later?

524
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:28,882
- All right.
- Ok.

525
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,371
I think he's a sensitive.

526
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:37,283
- What?
- A sensitive.

527
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:41,223
My grandma told me about them. I've only met one or two before.

528
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:44,761
They're people that are somehow in tune with the larger picture.

529
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,073
And they get a feeling about something before

530
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,433
it even happens.

531
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,042
Wow, I'm dating a sensitive.

532
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:53,132
You know what? Ashton's dream?

533
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:55,581
- I've seen it in real life.
- No way!

534
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:59,251
The day I got into my accident, there was a ghost family in the road,

535
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:03,500
and I stopped to try and help them, but they got whisked away just like Ashton said.

536
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,590
How can he see them in a dream and I can't find Brian to save my life.

537
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,750
I mean, it's not fair.

538
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:11,620
I just wish that my grandmother was here so I could...

539
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:15,933
What?

540
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,822
I know who I'm gonna have to talk to about this.

541
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,033
Mmm, it's delicious.

542
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,423
I don't know. For some reason,

543
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:28,252
everything is tasting so much better to me lately.

544
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,923
Do you know why that is?

545
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,171
No, I don't, but whatever it is, I'm not gonna question it.

546
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:35,750
I wonder.

547
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:39,662
I know that you don't like it when I bring up the spirit world...

548
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,220
haven't seen a one.

549
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:43,322
Haven't heard a thing.

550
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:45,220
- Nothing?
- No.

551
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:48,120
- Blessed silence.
- Interesting.

552
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:51,321
I haven't either for about a week now.

553
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:52,532
Really?

554
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:55,941
Oh, this is wonderful. You must be so happy.

555
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:58,172
No, mom, I'm not.

556
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:01,823
I know, I know.

557
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:03,830
You embrace your gift.

558
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:08,140
Melinda, you can say this till the cows come home,

559
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:11,131
but aren't you just a little bit relieved?

560
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:12,080
No.

561
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:14,923
Maybe it's like...

562
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:17,561
allergies, you know? You grow out of it.

563
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,201
You always had migraines, right?

564
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:24,173
Because you were trying to suppress the visions, the sounds.

565
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:25,853
But your headaches are gone now.

566
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,041
What if there aren't any

567
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:31,142
visions or sounds to suppress? What if the spirits themselves have just vanished?

568
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:32,792
Couldn't be.

569
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:37,061
They're all around us, always. That is what is so annoying about them.

570
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:38,942
Do you really feel annoyed,

571
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,080
mom? Because to me you've never seemed so lighthearted.

572
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:46,081
Does it really seem likely that we would both lose our gift at the same time?

573
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:47,402
So what are you saying?

574
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,022
They've gone somewhere else?

575
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,031
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.

576
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:54,610
For good?

577
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:57,443
I hope not.

578
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:07,673
Ok, this is all good.

579
00:35:08,128 --> 00:35:11,003
But I don't want you to overdo it just 'cause you feel good.

580
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:13,862
Let's remember you suffered a head trauma, so the slightest symptom

581
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:15,392
and you tell Jim right away.

582
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,610
There isn't anything I don't tell Jim.

583
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:19,982
Ok.

584
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,663
Is that really true

585
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:26,691
that you tell Jim everything?

586
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:28,190
Yeah, why?

587
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:30,133
Mmm, I'm surprised, I guess.

588
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,860
I never told your father about my visions.

589
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,561
I was afraid it would be too disturbing.

590
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,003
Course he ended up leaving me anyway, so

591
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:42,980
- so much for my instincts on that one.
- You never talk about him.

592
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:45,350
Why should I?

593
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,000
He's out of our life.

594
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,053
But I must say in retrospect,

595
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:52,893
maybe if I had told him...

596
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,912
Course it's water under the bridge now, isn't it.

597
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:58,952
Time of death, 14:35.

598
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:10,172
Mom,

599
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:11,530
did you see that?

600
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:13,902
What?

601
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,411
No.

602
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,071
Yes.

603
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,773
Yes, I did.

604
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,351
Andrea, I saw one.

605
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:38,031
You did? Where?

606
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:41,043
At the hospital. I never lost my gift. They've just gone away.

607
00:36:41,046 --> 00:36:42,542
But I don't get it. Where to?

608
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,073
No idea. One thing at a time.

609
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,342
Wow, this probably sounds like an odd conversation.

610
00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:48,632
No, no.

611
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,572
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

612
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,683
She'll explain it to you.

613
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,711
Ashton, you wouldn't happen to have a copy of your poem with you, would you?

614
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,820
My poem? No, it's all in my head.

615
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,491
I'm trying to remember this part about who can resist the wind force.

616
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:04,212
You said the tortured ghosts went immediately, and the young ones--

617
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:07,200
The young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.

618
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:10,901
Right, sometimes for days! Which means that I still have time. Thank you.

619
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:12,660
Wait, wait! Where are you going?

620
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,613
Brian's still out there. I'm sure of it.

621
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:16,703
I just missed him.

622
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:24,473
Ok, this is gonna take some explaining.

623
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,012
Yeah.

624
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,173
Melinda.

625
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,170
I can help Caitlin.

626
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,981
- I wasn't sure before.
- What are you doing here?

627
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:38,172
I'm absolutely sure that Brian is still earthbound.

628
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,882
What part of "leave me alone" is hard for you?

629
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:44,181
The part where I have to abandon somebody that I know I can help.

630
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:45,241
I'm sorry, I won't do it.

631
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,141
Aunt Diane.

632
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,392
Melinda, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

633
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:51,611
I mean, Caitlin has resisted, and you're going through your own loss of abilities.

634
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:54,051
No, I won't lose faith in my gift anymore.

635
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:58,311
I know I can help you find Brian, but you have to come with me right now.

636
00:37:58,315 --> 00:37:59,262
No!

637
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,851
Just stop it, ok? I just need to be left alone.

638
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,642
Caitlin...

639
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:05,951
you listen to her.

640
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,932
Aunt Diane told me what she can do.

641
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:12,152
I don't know if i believe in all that stuff, but

642
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:13,783
I think maybe you should.

643
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,671
Dad, what are you talking about?

644
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:17,171
Honey, I know you're in pain.

645
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,200
I know I haven't been here for you,

646
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,711
but I know this boy means a lot to you.

647
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:25,431
I understand that now.

648
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:28,570
And I don't want this pain

649
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,921
eating you up inside, Caitlin.

650
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:32,472
If you can find peace,

651
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,753
that's what I want for you.

652
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,611
Daddy, it hurts so bad.

653
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,453
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

654
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,353
I know.

655
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:46,023
Oh, you're my little girl.

656
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,223
You're everything to me.

657
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:50,751
Thank you.

658
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:58,540
I came here once before, but I gave up too soon.

659
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,753
Something is pulling the spirits away, Caitlin,

660
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:02,602
but the young and strong can resist.

661
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:05,152
Brian is here. I know it.

662
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:07,552
- I just know he is.
- Ok.

663
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:09,102
Come on.

664
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,312
My ring!

665
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:25,322
It's here.

666
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:27,783
Caitlin, he's here.

667
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:29,952
Brian is?

668
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:31,321
Right now?

669
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:33,811
Your ring, it acted as an anchor.

670
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:36,311
Sometimes ghosts can attach themselves to things

671
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:39,162
that have a deeper meaning to them. It can give them strength.

672
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,082
Something's been trying to pull me away.

673
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,032
Something bad.

674
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:47,203
Let's get out of here. That wind could start up again.

675
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,640
Please tell her. I didn't want to break up with her.

676
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,492
He didn't want to break up, Caitlin.

677
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:02,542
He didn't?

678
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:05,052
Who was that girl?

679
00:40:05,976 --> 00:40:07,870
The one I saw him with in the street.

680
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:11,162
Caitlin, she was my dance teacher.

681
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:13,522
Your dance teacher?

682
00:40:14,396 --> 00:40:15,342
His dance teacher?

683
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:18,790
Oh, my god.

684
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:21,723
He was learning how to dance just for me?

685
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:23,861
I wanted to make you happy.

686
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,602
I wanted to be able to dance with you and not look like an idiot.

687
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:29,252
He was trying to make you happy.

688
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:32,140
- He thought his dancing was--
- horrible.

689
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:35,880
I just saw her, and she looked so pretty.

690
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:41,290
And I was afraid that you woke up and realized that

691
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:43,581
you shouldn't be with someone like me.

692
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:48,502
Caitlin, I woke up every day and realized how lucky I was to be with someone like you.

693
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,252
Didn't you know that?

694
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:52,050
Didn't you know I loved you?

695
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,653
He wants you to know that he woke up every day

696
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:57,260
thinking how lucky he was to have you.

697
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,341
He wants to know if you knew how much he loved you.

698
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,361
I know now.

699
00:41:04,907 --> 00:41:05,852
Brian,

700
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:08,282
I don't know how I'm gonna live without you.

701
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,610
You're the only person that I've ever met that's made me feel special.

702
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:14,862
Like I count.

703
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:19,292
Tell her she'll find that again.

704
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,502
Tell her that I want her to.

705
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:24,851
For me.

706
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:27,023
He believes that you'll find that again,

707
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,971
and he wants you to for him.

708
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:31,453
I will never find anyone like you, Brian.

709
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,610
You learned how to dance

710
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,423
just for me!

711
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:41,320
And now we'll never get that chance.

712
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,330
Caitlin, close your eyes.

713
00:41:50,627 --> 00:41:52,173
- What?
- Just close your eyes.

714
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:54,882
Brian...

715
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:57,882
I want you to take Caitlin in your arms.

716
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,753
For real?

717
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:00,951
For real.

718
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:05,441
It may take her a minute to feel it, but I want you to show her what you learned.

719
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:08,640
And you have to be open to this, Caitlin, ok? Just trust Brian.

720
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:10,482
I do.

721
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:13,423
Ok, Brian.

722
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,492
I feel him.

723
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:25,441
It's called a box step. Pretty simple.

724
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:27,893
It's the box step.

725
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:20,953
And then he crossed over?

726
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:22,122
Then he crossed over.

727
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:24,582
That's beautiful.

728
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,170
Yeah, it was something to see.

729
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:27,541
The power of love.

730
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:29,630
Strong stuff, love.

731
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:32,321
Something

732
00:43:32,325 --> 00:43:33,673
I know a little bit about.

733
00:43:34,747 --> 00:43:37,292
Hey, what about your regulars? They come back yet?

734
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:39,470
- Where is Homer?
- Still missing.

735
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:40,913
All of them.

736
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:44,743
But at least we know I didn't lose my gift. I saw two ghosts today.

737
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,362
Look at how she sparkles when she says that.

738
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:50,012
Yeah, I'll admit it. I enjoy being back in the game.

739
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:55,113
Although that wind,

740
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,523
it was warm and so creepy.

741
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,800
- What do you think it means?
- I wish I knew.
