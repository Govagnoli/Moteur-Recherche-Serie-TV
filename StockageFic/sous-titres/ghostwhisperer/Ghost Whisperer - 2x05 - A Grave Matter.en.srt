00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,030
My name is
melinda gordon.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm married.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,570
I live in
a small town.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,060
And I own
an antique shop.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,120
I might be
just like you.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,950
Except that,
from the time I was a little girl,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,140
I knew that I could talk
to the dead.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,670
It's all right,honey.

10
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:26,161
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,603
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

12
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:31,401
and they come
to me for help.

13
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:38,057
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,620
That looks great on you.
With a top hat and a whip,fabulous.

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,033
If you need help getting out of that,
I'm right over here.

16
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,792
God,I love halloween.

17
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,972
My parents use to make
such a big deal out of it.

18
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:10,572
When I was a kid,they used to decorate
the house up like this big movie set.

19
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:11,641
It was so great.

20
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,870
Were your parents
into halloween?

21
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:15,710
Um,my mother
hated it.

22
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:17,623
I don't know how
my father felt.

23
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:18,672
Oh,why not?

24
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,912
He left
when I was little.

25
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,871
- I'm so sorry.
- No,it's ok.

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,133
You know what? I think this table
would look nicer next to the window.

27
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,693
- Can you help me?
- Oh,sure.

28
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,312
I love worked here.
It's so sweet decorate like this.

29
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,922
Ah, no problem.

30
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:41,050
has anyone in your family
died recently?

31
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,113
What?

32
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,633
Your extended family.
It's pretty much intact?

33
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,372
Yeah. Amazingly
long-lived,my family.

34
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,080
Both of my grandmothers
are still alive,

35
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,881
and I have
a great-great uncle who's 102.

36
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:55,140
Wow. Amazing!
Everyone's still alive.

37
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:59,201
Hey,do you want to see the great undead lipstick
that I got for halloween?

38
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,212
- Sure.
- Let me show you.

39
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,283
Oh,by the way,I am judging
the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight.

40
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:07,450
You want to come?

41
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,702
I would,but I have
plans with a friend.

42
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:11,733
Oh,well,friends are good.
The more,the merrier.

43
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:14,261
She's not in a position
to come,but thanks.

44
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,793
Ok.

45
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,320
I swear
I put it in here.

46
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:29,101
I don't know why I couldn't just tell her
I was coming here.

47
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,822
I mean,delia's
a really nice person.

48
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:34,891
She's got
a good sense of humor.

49
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,723
Maybe it's just
kind of hard to talk about.

50
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,333
I miss you
so much,andrea.

51
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:47,802
You will always be
my best friend.

52
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:55,142
Save a little piece
of that light for me,ok?

53
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:04,250
Ghosts! Ghosts!
Ghosts! Ghosts!

54
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:30,120
- This is wrong.
- What's wrong?

55
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:32,232
This.

56
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,843
- Who are you?
- This is wrong.

57
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,172
- Where am I?
- Look,I know that you're confused.

58
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,593
It's only been
a couple of months.

59
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,422
- Not me.
- Excuse me?

60
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:43,373
I can't be here.
I can't be.

61
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,540
Yes,you are here.
I just saw you come out of that grave.

62
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,641
But it's not mine.

63
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,212
Are you saying--

64
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:53,790
help me. I'm in
the wrong grave.

65
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,121
Can you see us?

66
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:38,800
So,a cemetery.It seems like
a natural place for a ghost.

67
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,402
No,actually,it's not.
Ghosts get their energy from the living.

68
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,080
There's more ghosts in a shopping mall
than at a cemetery.

69
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,703
That explains
all the lousy parking.

70
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,142
Ghosts tend to go
where the problem lies,

71
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:51,653
and this ghost's problem
is the cemetery.

72
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,271
How does someone
get buried in the wrong grave?

73
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,472
Hmm. Makes you wonder
what they're doing at those morturaries.

74
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,262
Oh,you don't want
to know that.

75
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,383
No,I really don'T.

76
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:03,153
So,assuming this guy is right,
does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave?

77
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,352
- Makes sense.
- Then what could I do about it?

78
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,541
Not much,
unless you can find the family.

79
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,690
I mean,they can order
an exhumation.

80
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,783
You're going to need
a lot more evidence than,um,

81
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,112
"I talked to a gst."

82
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,500
Makes you wonder how they didn't know
it was that guy.

83
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,223
The body must have been
pretty messed-up.

84
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:23,793
Yeah. It was pretty bad.

85
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,430
- Cold?
- No. It's just kind of creepy.

86
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:31,281
My work is usually on a higher plane.
I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing.

87
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,151
You want to try getting used to
the live body thing?

88
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,693
Ooh,that sounds nice.

89
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,123
I don't want to do
much talking here.

90
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,710
Go. Go!

91
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,593
Go away!
I'm not him!

92
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,280
Stop it!

93
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,060
Excuse me?

94
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,523
Wow,stop this weather!

95
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:18,992
Something like this happens
every time I come here.

96
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,612
I think it's his way of telling me
he knows I'm here.

97
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,281
That's a really nice way
to think about it.

98
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,333
You look familiar to me.
Have we met?

99
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:29,942
My name
is melinda gordon.

100
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:33,082
I own an antique shop in town,
same as it never was.

101
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,031
Yes,I love that place.

102
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:39,093
I bought a vase there
last year from one of your employees.

103
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,683
Lovely girl.

104
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,300
Yeah.

105
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,343
I'm shelby burris.

106
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,450
And this is
my husband steve.

107
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:47,782
I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,211
They say it gets
better with time,

109
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:52,011
but it doesn't seem to.

110
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,621
No,it doesn'T.

111
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:59,303
He was kind and caring.
He loved to laugh.

112
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:02,023
He sounds like
a wonderful man.

113
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,162
Were you actually there
when they buried him?

114
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:12,240
Did you get to say good-bye
and see him one last time.

115
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,190
Only in spirit.

116
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:18,083
There was so much damage,
it had to be a closed coffin.

117
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:21,073
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

118
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:25,322
It's ok. It's better to talk about it
than keep it bottled up inside.

119
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,123
It was nice
to meet you,melinda.

120
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,130
I didn't ask,do you have
a loved one buried here?

121
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,093
Yes.

122
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,490
The lovely girl
from the store.

123
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,580
Oh,I'm so sorry.

124
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,772
Life is so fleeting,
isn't it?

125
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:46,272
You can be happy,
things are going great,and then...

126
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:49,903
a sudden bolt of lightning
can wipe it all out.

127
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:52,322
Yeah,that's true.

128
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,903
Well,life is for
the living,right?

129
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,022
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:31,360
That woman. She comes every day.
She cries so hard...

131
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:33,403
but not for me.

132
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,500
Is that why you're trying
to get rid of her?

133
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,023
She thinks that
you're her husband.

134
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,781
But I'm not.

135
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,320
- Who are you?
- Godfrey.

136
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,972
Adam godfrey.

137
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,190
Do you know
how you died?

138
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,380
It was a flash--

139
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,623
bright,hot.

140
00:08:57,627 --> 00:09:00,332
I just--I don't--
I don't know.

141
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,787
I know that
this is hard,

142
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:05,821
and you feel really confused right now,
but it's going to get better.

143
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:09,341
Do you have a family?
Anyone who can help us?

144
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:13,433
I was alone.
I was always alone.

145
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:19,231
Find my grave.

146
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,527
Please.

147
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,463
Wow,adam godfrey's
a writer.

148
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,510
What's that?

149
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:51,893
Oh,sorry. Nothing.

150
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:54,763
Adam godfrey?
Great writer.

151
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,751
Haven't you
ever read lost delusions?

152
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:01,253
Honey,I saw you
look right at me yesterday.

153
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,240
Don't pretend
you can't see me now.

154
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:04,983
I cannot talk.

155
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,712
Sorry. I just had to cash her out.
Did you need me?

156
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:11,460
No,no. I'm just
looking for this book,lost delusions.

157
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:14,950
Oh,yeah. Our book club
read that last year. Great book.

158
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,020
But the author was
kind of a one-hit wonder,right?

159
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,730
Well,let's see.

160
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:23,062
We all read it
3 or 4 times.

161
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:26,811
We tried to get the country club
to name a sandwich after the main character.

162
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:31,110
It's about a young man
struggling to find his ace in the world

163
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:35,073
and failing miserably.
Depressing,yet oddly uplifting.

164
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,360
Yep,that's the one.

165
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,310
I still have it at home,
if you want to borrow it.

166
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:43,113
By the way,e you hungry?
Because I am starved.

167
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:46,081
I totally lost track of time.
Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you.

168
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:50,633
Did you and andrea ever just close up for a bit
and go and have lunch together.

169
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,501
You know what?
I-I can't,

170
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:56,640
because I have an errand to run,
so maybe some other time.

171
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,611
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

172
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,532
What are the chances?
Twice in 2 days.

173
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,113
Well,not so strange for me.
I come every day.

174
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,463
Can I ask you
a question?

175
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,070
Does the name adam godfrey mean
anything to you?

176
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,820
No. Should it?

177
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,660
I just thought maybe he was one of
your husband's friends.

178
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,300
Steve had so many friends.
How would I know him?

179
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,823
Um,he was a writer.
He's passed away now.

180
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,681
Adam godfrey.

181
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,591
I'm sorry.
I don't remember him.

182
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,273
If I do,
I'll let you know.

183
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,693
Can I ask you how
your husband died?

184
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:43,063
Yeah. I thought I told you.
A bolt of lightning.

185
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:44,643
What?

186
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,861
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's how he died.

187
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:49,731
He was struck by lightning.

188
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,551
- Lightning?
- That's what she said,

189
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,813
but my ghost said that he died,
and then there was a big flash of light.

190
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:00,981
And so?

191
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,623
So,what if they both
died from some sort of electrical shock?

192
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:07,001
Is it possible that
they're psychically connected in some way,

193
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,141
or that their souls
have swapped bodies?

194
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,520
You know,I never thought
I'd hear myself say this,but that's crazy.

195
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:15,573
Right. It is.I'm listening
to myself say it,and it sounds crazy.

196
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,022
Then again,why not?
It's almost halloween.

197
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:21,971
It's true.My grandmother always saidthat the
veil between the living and the dead got thinner around halloween.

198
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,892
The only way
to prove something like that...

199
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,220
would be if you found
where the other body was,right?

200
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:28,412
Yes,and then I could
talk to the ghost.

201
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:31,580
But I have searched the internet,
and I can't find anything on adam godfrey's death.

202
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:32,940
I even checked
with his publishers.

203
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,281
Oh,yeah?
What did they say?

204
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,011
Clueless.
They didn't even know he was dead.

205
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,140
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell them,did you?

206
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,530
How I can I?
I can't prove it.

207
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:39,623
Tricky.

208
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,071
Now,steve burris,on the other hand,
I did find something on him. His obituary.

209
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:44,430
And he is nothing
like adam at all.

210
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:49,152
Listen to this.A staple on the social circuit
with a taste forluxury,adventure,and the good life.

211
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:54,543
And your guy was a hermit,huh? It's not as
if their paths were to cross very often.

212
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,400
Coming.

213
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,131
Hey,jim. I hope it's
not too late for visitors.

214
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,412
Not at all.

215
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,732
Hey,delia,
come on in.

216
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,970
Oh,I'd love to,but I really just wanted
to drop this book by on my way home.

217
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:07,452
It's a little dark,
but guess I like that kind of thing.

218
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,383
Me,too. Thanks.

219
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,912
You sure you don't want to stay?
We're about to dig into dessert.

220
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,341
Dessert? I'd die
for something chocolate.

221
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:17,180
Oh,dear. It sounds
great,but I really should get home.

222
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:21,232
Ned accidentally agreed
to let me watch a movie that has no murder,

223
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,920
mayhem,or violent
explosions in it,

224
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,642
so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can
before he realizes his mistake.

225
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:28,863
Boring.

226
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,402
Ok,then.
We'll see you tomorrow.

227
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:31,870
Ok.

228
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,010
- Hey!
- Are you ok?

229
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,533
Yeah. Gosh,I'm such
a klutz today. Bye.

230
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,081
Can't I just see
what's for dessert?

231
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:43,032
It's not like I'm worried
about trans fats anymore.

232
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:46,143
Wait a minute.
Was she accompanied?

233
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:48,390
Yep. And her ghost
is a chocoholic.

234
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,323
I really don't know what
I'm going to do about that.

235
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:51,303
I knew it.

236
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,691
Hey,listen
to this dediation--

237
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,931
"to jean,withoutwhose loving support
this book could not have been written."

238
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,323
Sounds like
a wife to me.

239
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:00,283
You know,he told me
that he was alone-- always alone.

240
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,140
Maybe she abandoned him.

241
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:05,432
You're a hopeless
romantic,you know that?

242
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:09,551
Ok. There is a jean godfrey
who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park.

243
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,740
What do you think--
man or a woman?

244
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,133
Only one way to find out.

245
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:16,283
You know what? It's fun to brainstorm
this stuff with you.

246
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,170
You know,
I read somewhere--

247
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:20,661
ghostbusting keeps
a marriage strong.

248
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:41,452
Oh,I can't!
No,I can'T.

249
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:45,090
Honey,
are you all right?

250
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,573
Oh,yeah. I'm sorry.

251
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:51,231
I just promised my husband that I wouldn't
come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh.

252
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,462
Oh,yeah. Well,the reptile section's
right over there,if that's any help.

253
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:58,513
Actually,I am looking
for a human being.

254
00:14:58,517 --> 00:14:59,622
Jean godfrey?

255
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,441
You're looking at her.

256
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:04,430
Oh,oh,hi.
I'm melinda gordon?

257
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,620
Are you related to
the writer adam godfrey?

258
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,992
Well,if being married
to him counts as related--

259
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:13,731
- he's your husband?
- Was,long time ago.

260
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,723
I kept the name,though.
So why do you ask?

261
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:20,550
I'm so sorry.
He's dead.

262
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:24,491
Oh,ok.

263
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,870
Tony,could you take
the counter,please?

264
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:27,992
Sure **********

265
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,030
Let's talk outside.

266
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:34,681
Sorry,but I really
have to do this.

267
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm not going to light it,
I just go through the motions.

268
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:38,902
Quitting's a bitch.

269
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,033
That's what I hear.

270
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,081
So adam's dead.

271
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,641
How'd it happen.

272
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,512
There was an accident.
I don't have all the details.

273
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:47,700
You the girlfriend?

274
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,972
No. I just met
him recently.

275
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,760
He told me that
he'd always been alone.

276
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:56,182
Well,I guess he kind
of was,actually,

277
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,102
even when we
were married.

278
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,390
Yeah. It was really good
at first. It was just--

279
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:05,341
he was kind of
a hard guy to get close to.

280
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:08,351
So I assume you've read
lost delusions.

281
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,193
It was pretty much
the story of his life.

282
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:14,952
Tourtured young guy too smart for
his own good,doesn't really fit in.

283
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,780
I guess I thought that I was going to be the one
to bring him in from the cold.

284
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:22,120
You know what?Don't ever think that you can save
those tortured young artists.

285
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:25,471
I think that they actually like being tortured.
It's what makes them artists.

286
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,371
He was successful
for a while,though,right?

287
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,071
Oh,yeah. When lost delusions came
out,it was a big deal.

288
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,411
And then his second novel
came out.

289
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,372
Critics had
a feeding frenzy.

290
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,183
Adam was devastated

291
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,470
and he said he needed to move to the cabin
to have some isolation to write.

292
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:48,111
At first,he came home every weekend,
then once a month,and then there was the talk.

293
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:52,420
The one where you know
it's all over.

294
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,331
If you want someone reliable,
you get yourself a pet.

295
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,802
Thanks for the advice.

296
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:01,461
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me know about this.

297
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:07,052
Oh,man.

298
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,863
This is going to be really hard
for kate to hear.

299
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:12,002
- Kate?
- His daughter.

300
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,360
Yeah. Death can be hard
to explain to children.

301
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,053
Well,she's hardly a child.
She's a junior at state U.

302
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,903
She hasn't seen or heard from her father
since she was 3.

303
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,562
- 3?
- She'd never admit it,

304
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:25,970
but I think that she always thought
that she'd see him again.

305
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,830
Hell,maybe even get
an explanation.

306
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:32,031
Well,that's not going
to happen now,is it?

307
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,071
Well,thanks. I just--

308
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,242
I wanted
to let you know.

309
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:47,660
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

310
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,692
I feel like I'm near
something that used to be important.

311
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,172
I need to talk to you.

312
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:56,102
Why didn't you tell me
that you had a wife and daughter?

313
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,880
A wife and daughter?

314
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,851
No,I didn't have
a wife and...

315
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,572
oh,my god.

316
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:06,331
Jean and kate.

317
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,341
Yeah,jean and kate,
who you abandoned when she was 3.

318
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,231
- Why would I do that?
- That's what I'd like to know.

319
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:18,793
All I know is I had a lot of demons.
It was hard being around people.

320
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,020
I think I felt that I wasn't good
for either of them.

321
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:21,983
So you ditched them?

322
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:25,363
No,I freed them
to lead happier
lives without me. lives without me.

323
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,221
- What?
- That's classic.

324
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,561
- You don't understand--
- no,you don't understand.

325
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,473
How do you think your daughter felt when she had
to watch you walk out of her life forever?

326
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,271
Free? You're her father.

327
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,100
It was complicated.
I'm not proud of it--

328
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,221
good,'cause
you don't deserve to be happy.

329
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:42,691
You deserve to be exactly where you are--
in the wrong grave,

330
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:45,642
doomed to listen to a woman grieve
a good man,knowing that he isn't you.

331
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:05,860
So anyway,I'm standing in this alley,
and I'm yelling at this ghost.

332
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,313
Why did I let myself
get so emotional?

333
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,720
Not gonna read it,huh?

334
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,750
I don't want anything
to do with this ghost.

335
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:15,073
Why would I help someone who would run out
on his family,abandoning his child?

336
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,030
Whose family are we
talking about now?

337
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,080
Ok,I admit it,I have a personal thing
going on here. So what?

338
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,113
So nothing.
Just know where it's coming from.

339
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:28,400
And then he had the nerve to expect me
to make it right for him.

340
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,482
In his defense,there aren't too
many other people he could go to.

341
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,890
You're defending him?

342
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:35,383
I'm pointing out you're a little
emotional right now.

343
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,832
I don't have to help every ghost
that comes along. It's my call,right?

344
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,741
I mean,you've
heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone.

345
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,291
Only when you thought
you couldn't help them.

346
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,560
You really think
I can help this one?

347
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:48,862
Yeah,I do.
And I think you do,too.

348
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,610
I can't talk about this right now.
I have a headache.

349
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:05,501
Ooh,that's fabulous.

350
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:08,052
Is it for sale?

351
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:10,360
Oh,no,I'm sorry.
It's mine.

352
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,931
Lucy and ethel
would die for that bag.

353
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,601
May I?

354
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,410
Oh,sure.

355
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,712
There you go.

356
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,642
Careful with that clasp,
liberace. You trying to break it?

357
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,342
Ow. There must be
a pin sticking out of it somewhere.

358
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:29,690
I don't see it.

359
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:33,120
Ok. Thank you so much,
and please come back again soon.

360
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,722
I will.
You girls have great taste.

361
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:41,621
That really is a nice bag.
I haven't noticed it before.

362
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:44,922
Yeah. I got it
a couple of days ago at an estate sale.

363
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:46,632
Ah. That explains a lot.

364
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,570
You know,there are some figurines in the back.
Could you go and get them for me?

365
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,241
You might have to dig around a little bit.

366
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:53,451
Sure,no problem.

367
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,232
So it's the bag.

368
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:59,693
Of course it's the bag.
I don't even know that woman.

369
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:03,362
- What's your name?
- Marilyn mandeville.

370
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,611
Why are you the only one
who can see me?

371
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:08,483
It's a long story.
So how did you die,marilyn?

372
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,182
I was at
a charity event,

373
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,722
one of those horrible things
where no one can remember the charity,

374
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,723
but they all sure as hell know where
the photographers are.

375
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,111
Well,I wasn't
in the mood to be in the papers.

376
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:23,021
I knew I looked all red and blotchy
from crying over luca.

377
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:25,022
- Luca?
- My boyfriend.

378
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,240
Hot-headed,
bad-tempered,

379
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,222
just this much
dangerous.

380
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:32,903
All the things
I love in a man.

381
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:37,160
Anyway,a friend told me
that she saw him out with another woman,

382
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,972
so...

383
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:40,692
I kicked him out
of the house.

384
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,803
Aha. React first,
ask questions later.

385
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:46,240
But I loved him.

386
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,160
Anyway,I was just about
to leave the party,

387
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,502
when suddenly I saw him
across the room.

388
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,521
He saw me,too.

389
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:58,230
He wrote something downon a napkin.
He gave it to a waiter to give to me.

390
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:01,822
I tell you,my heart was pounding so hard,
I thought everybody could hear it.

391
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,722
Well,what did it say?

392
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:06,222
I didn't want
to look desperate to read it.

393
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,111
So I tucked it
in my bag.

394
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,463
I finished my drink

395
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:16,061
and then I practically knocked over tables
and chairs to get outside to read it.

396
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:17,833
But then--

397
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,100
you died.

398
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:21,261
Heart attack.

399
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:27,470
I never got
to read the note.

400
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:29,781
Marilyn,I hate
to tell you this,

401
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,632
but the chances
of that note still being in the bag--

402
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,653
please,will you
just check?

403
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:37,713
Melinda?

404
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:41,193
God! The interruptions
in this place.

405
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:42,942
Shelby. Hi.

406
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:46,963
I just had to come by
because the strangest thing happened to me.

407
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,632
You asked me if I knew a man named
adam godfrey,right?

408
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,123
Right.

409
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,993
- Well,he just called me.
- What?

410
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,392
I was just about to have dinner
when the phone rang.

411
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,310
I said hello,but all I heard was
silence and a click.

412
00:22:58,317 --> 00:23:01,980
I looked down at the caller I.D. And
it said adam godfrey.

413
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:05,322
But didn't you say
that adam godfrey died?

414
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,231
Yes,I did.

415
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:09,650
That's what I thought,
so I wrote the number down.

416
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:12,942
Melinda,
you may find this hard to believe,

417
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:16,322
but I think your friend

418
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,661
is trying to reach you from the afterlife.

419
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,550
I didn't think
you'd come back.

420
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,263
I didn't plan to.

421
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,530
Well,I'm glad
you did.

422
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,640
I have one question
and I want you to be really honest.

423
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:46,841
How do you walk away
from your family?

424
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:51,073
You tell yourself
your daughter will never feel the loss.

425
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,671
She won't miss you
because she never knew you.

426
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:58,090
Your wife will
find love somewhere else and be better off.

427
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:03,391
You tell yourself that your work will be the thing
that lives on after you,and that's what's important.

428
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,833
Well,maybe you needed
to learn this,adam.

429
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:10,300
That guy whose grave I'm in...

430
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:12,273
he was really loved.

431
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:14,820
He must have been
a good man.

432
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,693
Shelby thought so.

433
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,751
Shelby?

434
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:22,552
The woman who's been crying at his grave,
the one you called to reach me.

435
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:25,560
- I--I didn't call that woman.
- You didn't?

436
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:28,343
Who knew I could even
use a phone? I'm dead.

437
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,561
Does this number look
familiar to you?

438
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,173
That's my phone number
at the cabin.

439
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:38,182
Do you remember
where this is?

440
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,642
I think so. Why?

441
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,832
Because somebody's in this cabin
and I think we should find out who it is.

442
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,662
Does this road
look familiar to you?

443
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:52,861
No.

444
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:55,722
Wait a minute...
yes.

445
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,993
I was here.

446
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:05,163
It was late at night
and my car had broken down.

447
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:08,272
No,wait a minute,
I was out of gas.

448
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,132
The guy who picked me up,
he seemed upset about something.

449
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:18,962
And I asked him about it,
but he wouldn't talk,not until he heard my name.

450
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:24,132
Turns out that he had read
lost delusions 4 times,

451
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:26,903
and so he wanted
to know all about me.

452
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:30,383
I told him I lived in a cabin
miles away from everything.

453
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:33,170
But I asked him about himself
and he got tense.

454
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:35,832
"You wouldn't want
my life," he said.

455
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:39,441
He didn't really know his way around,
so we stopped at a bar.

456
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:43,483
I remember the bartender said
there was a gas station 3 miles down the road,

457
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:47,113
but my new friend
said that he wanted a drink,and so did I.

458
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:53,112
He said he was a businessman
who--who had the golden touch,

459
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,241
at least until lately,

460
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,801
and now things were
going sour,

461
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,662
he couldn't catch a break.

462
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:05,160
And he got some inside information
about something,like a big merger.

463
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,722
Gambled everything
he had left on it,and it tanked.

464
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:13,421
Now I remember. He said that his wife
didn't know anything about this.

465
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:14,520
I can't tell her...

466
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:18,300
and he said he couldn't stand to see her
have to give up the life that they had.

467
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:21,980
All that he had left
was this insurance policy.

468
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,823
I'm worth more
dead than alive.

469
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:31,540
This guy,he was so in love with his wife,
and I just felt empty.

470
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,732
I never loved anyone
like that.

471
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:35,081
Did he tell you
his name?

472
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,821
Well,if he did,
I don't remember.

473
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,521
Do you think
he killed himself?

474
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,933
Looked like he was
heading that way.

475
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:46,390
It was starting to rain,

476
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,413
so I decided
to cut my losses and walk.

477
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:08,003
Help!

478
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:10,892
Help me! Help!

479
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:35,341
What are you doing?

480
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,611
And that's
how he became you.

481
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:57,992
That man,he was the name
on my tombstone.

482
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:02,992
And I'm guessing
he's in your cabin.

483
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:03,941
But why would he do that?

484
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:08,252
Why would he throw away
everything he had,the woman that he loved?

485
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:11,782
Why not?
It's what you did,wasn't it?

486
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:33,842
- This is it?
- This is it.

487
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,543
- Yes?
- Who are you?

488
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:40,691
- Who are you?
- I'm kate godfrey.

489
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:42,702
Who are you?

490
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:44,020
My daughter.

491
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,883
You're adam's
daughter.

492
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:48,441
Put it this way--
he's half the reason I was born.

493
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:50,021
Second time,who are you?

494
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:54,372
Sorry. Melinda gorden.
I live in grandview,and I know your father.

495
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,193
You're the one that told
my mother he was dead.

496
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:57,221
Yes.

497
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:00,522
Well,that was helpful of you,
considering it's not true.

498
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,673
What does that mean?

499
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,582
Oh,I'm sorry,
can I come in?

500
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:07,161
It's not my place.

501
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:10,043
So...what makes you think
that he's not dead?

502
00:29:10,676 --> 00:29:14,243
No accident report,
no body,no obituary.

503
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,643
Do you want me to go on?

504
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,363
No,I'd look
for them,too.

505
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:20,420
So not finding them
it makes sense you think he's dead.

506
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,850
I know he is.

507
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,252
Look,I know that this is gonna sound
hard to believe--

508
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:26,353
I'm sure it will.

509
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:28,201
I've spoken
to your father's spirit.

510
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,290
Oh,wow,
you're one of those.

511
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,461
Please believe me.
It's true.

512
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:35,803
I know my father attracted
some eccentric fans,

513
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,192
but this takes it
to a whole new level.

514
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,621
Do you know much
about your father?

515
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:42,091
- No. I've never even read his books.
- Why not?

516
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:45,132
It was the great god of literature
that made him leave us.

517
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:47,730
Frankly,I'm not interested.

518
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,711
Kate,your father gave me every detail
about what happened to him the night that he died.

519
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:53,473
I'd be happy to tell you
if you like.

520
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:56,153
Do you know what I'd like? Is for you
to leave me alone.

521
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:58,892
My mother tells me
she hears from you that he's dead.

522
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:03,121
She asks me to come here and gather his effects,
I come out here and what do I find?

523
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:05,560
A full fridge.

524
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:09,352
Cigarettes in the ash tray.
Newly opened mail.

525
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:11,212
Dead,my ass.

526
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,813
I just hope I can
get out of here before he comes back.

527
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:18,531
Kate...the man who's been living here,
his name is steve burris.

528
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:21,311
There was a mix-up the night the night
that your father died and he was mistaken for him,

529
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:24,153
but your father
is here now.

530
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,810
And he really wants to talk to you
if he can just make some peace.

531
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,761
Are you aware that you aren't even
remotely believable?

532
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,593
Adam,please tell me something that kate
will understand. Help me.

533
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:36,830
Just that she was such
a beautiful child.

534
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,583
He thought you were
so beautiful.

535
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:44,223
That's it? Oh,come on. Didn't you
do your research?

536
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:47,973
The name of my fuzzy bunny,
my favorite pet.

537
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:51,602
What about a cute nickname?
Come on. Make me weep.

538
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,993
I--I can'T.

539
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,652
He told me before that
the only reason he left

540
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,792
was to free you
from having him as your father.

541
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,663
He didn't feel like
he could give you what you needed,

542
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,510
and that you would
have a better life without him.

543
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,462
Damn straight I did.

544
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:10,471
Look,I know how you feel.

545
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,441
He did a terrible thing,

546
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:16,363
and you've thought about him every day
of your life with anger and resentment,I know.

547
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:18,302
- You know?
- Yes,I do know,

548
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:22,882
but,kate,for one minute,just--just imagine
that what I'm saying to you is true.

549
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:26,963
That he's here and that he loves you and he feels
really bad about not being in your life.

550
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:29,410
If you could tell him
one more thing,what would it be?

551
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,861
I'd tell him to go to hell.

552
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:52,963
I'm so sorry.

553
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,553
Don't be. She's right.

554
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:56,252
She did the only thing
she could do--

555
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:59,632
she hardened her heart to me,
she got on with her life.

556
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:02,722
There's no reason she should forgive me.
No reason at all.

557
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:20,090
Wow,you should have seen her.
She was so bitter,so hard.

558
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:22,913
Is that what I'm like when
I talk about my father?

559
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:28,022
Listen,everybody's gotta put
the hard shell on,you know?

560
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,390
That means yes.

561
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:32,730
No,that means no.

562
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:38,140
You know,I can
feel the hurt.

563
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:42,322
Look,the good news is,
you overcame the hurt.

564
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,681
Helped somebody else
and maybe,in the process,

565
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,722
you helped yourself.

566
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:51,060
You always know
the right thing to say.

567
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:54,682
I used to always know
the right thing to say.

568
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:57,643
Yesterday you wanted
to bite my head off.

569
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:00,933
Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday,
I just didn't know it.

570
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,423
I can't sleep.

571
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,160
I'm steve burris.

572
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:39,983
Are you gonna make trouble for me?
I need to know.

573
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:41,752
You heard me
talking to kate.

574
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:44,882
I was on my way back
from the mailbox when she drove up.

575
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:48,682
I stayed by the side of the house waiting
for her to leave,and then you came.

576
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:51,030
That stuff you told her,
how'd you know all that?

577
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:53,503
Adam told me.

578
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:58,540
Right. I heard that whole bit
about how you talk to the dead.

579
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:02,940
Come on,tell me the truth.
How'd you really know?

580
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:06,431
I wasn't lying.Adam told me about the night
that he ran out of gas.

581
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,441
How you picked up,
you told him about your money troubles,

582
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:11,583
and you told him that you would be worth
more dead than alive.

583
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:13,361
No one knew that.

584
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,083
He said he was
killed in the storm,

585
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,653
and that you stole his wallet so that you
could fake your death. Now he's in your grave.

586
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:22,843
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:27,130
I didn't know
what else to do.

588
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:30,631
I was on the verge
of suicide,and...

589
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:35,943
when this happened,
it seemed the only answer.

590
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,563
You found him.

591
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,982
He found me.

592
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:42,110
Adam's here now.

593
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:46,730
Please...

594
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:50,590
if he's really here,
make him understand I was desperate.

595
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:53,830
Tell him I know,I've been there,
but this isn't the way to go.

596
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,791
He says he understands,
but this isn't the answer.

597
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:59,841
You can't just leave him
in the wrong grave.

598
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,063
He has to hear
shelby crying everyday.

599
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,660
Shelby cries?

600
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:07,403
For me?

601
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:11,232
Tell him he's lucky.
I threw away the people who love me.

602
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,421
Adam only wishes
he could have had what you have.

603
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,371
But he told me . he needed to be free.
I understood that.

604
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:19,063
That's what
I wanted,too!

605
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,170
No,it's not freedom,
I was wrong.

606
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:23,692
He was wrong. He doesn't
feel free. He feels...

607
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:29,652
very,very,sad.

608
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:34,152
And he wants you tell shelby
that you're alive.

609
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:36,940
I can'T. She'll--
she'll never forgive me.

610
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:41,000
You gotta risk it.
Look at all the other risks you took.

611
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,922
He says you have to risk it.

612
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:46,230
And tell him I forgive him
for the rest.

613
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:50,192
And he forgives you
for the rest of it.

614
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,602
He does?

615
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,913
He does.

616
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:59,071
Steve...
she will,too.

617
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:09,470
You should feel good about
what you said to him.

618
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:12,461
Even if nothing comes of it,
you're a good man.

619
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:16,970
That's nice of you to say,
even if we both know it isn't true.

620
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:20,921
Melinda?
Hi,I got your message.

621
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,961
Um...yes,there's
something that I have to tell you.

622
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,613
Ok,the night that steve died,

623
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,970
you said that he was alone,
and that's not really true.It isn't?

624
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,373
How do you know?

625
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,903
My friend,the one that I was
telling you about,adam godfrey,

626
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,850
he was with him
that night.

627
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:40,082
He was?
But you said he's dead.

628
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:42,612
He is.
He died that night.

629
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,091
But they only found
one body.

630
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,862
I know.
And it wasn't steve'S.

631
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,303
It was adam'S.

632
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,271
Melinda,what are you
trying to tell me?

633
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:58,163
What I'm trying
to tell you is...

634
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:04,942
what I'm trying to tell you is
to look over there.

635
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:11,591
Oh,my god!

636
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:16,221
Oh,my god! Steve!

637
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:17,970
You're alive!

638
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,850
Oh,shelby,
I missed you so much.

639
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,463
How is this possible?
What happened?

640
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:28,261
Oh,my god,I'm seeing your face again!
I love you so much!

641
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,461
Shelby,I have a lot to tell you.
I've done something

642
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:32,382
you're not gonna like,
it's something bad.

643
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,680
There's gonna be lawsuits
and trouble--

644
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,441
I don't care,
I don't care!

645
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:38,140
As long
as you're alive!

646
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:42,971
Thank you.

647
00:37:54,395 --> 00:37:58,900
In my version,he'd probably drop dead of a
heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery.

648
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:01,571
I don't think so,
I read your book.

649
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:02,631
You did?

650
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:05,372
I did. Last night,
it was beautiful.

651
00:38:05,378 --> 00:38:09,653
And I can understand
why the writer would need to live alone.

652
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,682
I'm not sure
I understand.

653
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,353
You need to forgive yourself
a little.

654
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,910
She'll never come,
will she? My daughter.

655
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:24,251
She'll never visit
her father's grave.

656
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,502
- You never know.
- Yes,I do.

657
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,143
This is one story
that won't have a happy ending.

658
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:34,551
Look,adam,
I'm not your daughter...

659
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:38,622
but I guess you've noticed
that I have some issues of my own.

660
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:42,812
But you know what?
If I wasas your daughter,I would...

661
00:38:43,846 --> 00:38:46,883
I would find it in my heart
to forgive you.

662
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,902
Why?

663
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:52,063
Maybe it's because
I read your book.

664
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,873
Or maybe it's because
I realize that everybody has their own story.

665
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,293
And you just don't know it.

666
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,973
So how's your story
going to end?

667
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:03,423
Happy.

668
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:07,412
It's all you can ask for,
right,is a happy ending.

669
00:39:09,357 --> 00:39:11,303
No...

670
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,153
don't tell me it--

671
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,082
really exists.

672
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,640
It does.

673
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,880
Well,I'll be damned.

674
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,062
Actually,
that's not the idea.

675
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,880
But...why do i
get to see it?

676
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:26,290
I mean,I pretty much
failed on every level of my life.

677
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,910
Because you found
some peace.

678
00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:31,790
At least a little bit.
Am I wrong?

679
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:35,040
No. You're not wrong.

680
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:37,390
Thank you.

681
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:40,312
You're very welcome.

682
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,163
Damn!

683
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,321
What happened?

684
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:52,911
I tripped over this bag again
and I twisted my ankle.

685
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,873
Stuff like that has been happening to me
for the past 3 days.

686
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:58,512
Well,maybe it's the curse
of that pirate outfit you're wearing.

687
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:01,353
Look,I am going to a great halloween party.
Do you want to come?

688
00:41:01,356 --> 00:41:03,901
Ugh,no. I'm gonna go home,
take a hot bath,

689
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,953
and think about anything
but ghosts.

690
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:09,411
You know,I don't get you.
Ghosts and spooks are fun.

691
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,183
Yeah.

692
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,180
Will you do me a favor?

693
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:18,542
Sell this bag.
Ever since I got it,I have
had the worst luck.

694
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:20,751
I thought you didn't
believe in anything like that.

695
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:23,041
Yeah,well,I don'T.
Just shows you how desperate I am.

696
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:26,243
I will be happy
to sell it for you.

697
00:41:26,248 --> 00:41:30,610
Hey,delia,tomorrow why don't we close up
and go to lunch together?

698
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:33,050
- Sounds good.
- Happy halloween.

699
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:42,300
About time.I thought I'd never
get rid of that girl.Now,look inside.

700
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:46,111
- I don't see a note.
- Check the lining.

701
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,072
Nothing.

702
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:51,160
There's a little rip in the lining.
You have to feel around.

703
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,022
All right!

704
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:57,293
I found it!

705
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,411
Oh,I'm so sorry,marilyn.

706
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,780
I don't you're gonna like
what this has to say.

707
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:09,020
What? What does it say?

708
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:12,631
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

709
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:19,630
He still loved me.
Luca still loved me!

710
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:23,433
It's what we said to each other after every
break-up when we got back together.

711
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:26,910
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

712
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,592
It meant everything was going
to be ok now.

713
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:32,882
Oh...I get it.

714
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,722
Oh,I really have
to find him now.

715
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:39,192
Oh,let me stop you
right there--you don't want to do that.

716
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:41,911
Do you see a light?

717
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:44,620
Yes.

718
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:49,450
Yeah,well then,
you should go into it and wait for him.

719
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:51,981
That could take
a long time.

720
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,661
It won't seem that long.
Trust me.

721
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:58,270
Go.
Wait for him to rip your heart out.

722
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:54,673
Sorry! I ran out of candy
a couple of hours ago.

723
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:57,783
Bye.

724
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:08,781
5 signs death
will come...
