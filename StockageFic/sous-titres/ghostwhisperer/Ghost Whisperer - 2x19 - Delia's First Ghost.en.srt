1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,300
I'm married,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,600
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,400
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,900
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,100
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:25,000
They're stuck here, because they have
unfinished business with the living,

11
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:28,801
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:35,708
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,609
Come on. Come on.

14
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,401
We can win this.

15
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:56,601
Now. Downcourt.

16
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,700
Bring it. Come on.

17
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:59,302
Come on. Shoot!

18
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,401
Shoot, you idiot!

19
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,300
Oh. Get it!
Get it! Get it!

20
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:09,002
What?

21
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,900
Son of a...

22
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,401
un-friggin'-believable.

23
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:25,200
Someone down here?

24
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:01,802
Did you get a look at his face?

25
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:05,003
Dude, I almost peed myself.

26
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:08,300
What a geek.
He actually thought I was a ghost.

27
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,503
I'm bad.

28
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,803
Teach him to chew us out for a little game of handball.

29
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:16,603
Better grab that firecracker.

30
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,902
Cool. All right. Let's go.

31
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:28,400
- Whoa. What'd you do?
- Nothin'. I didn't do anything.

32
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:31,503
What's happening?

33
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,303
Who's doing that?

34
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:39,601
I don't know.
Let's get out of here!

35
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:46,403
So, what about Tim?
Is he history?

36
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:47,600
No.

37
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,901
In fact, we finally went on
our first real date.

38
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,403
It was really nice.

39
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,003
But I gotta tell you,

40
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:59,003
he burned me once, so a girl's
gotta cover her bases.

41
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,901
That's so weird. I just...

42
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:03,301
had the other shoe in my hand.

43
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:04,703
Oh! Here it is.

44
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:06,602
So who's the guy tonight?

45
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,802
Dale.

46
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:11,300
He's a loan broker, boring, I know,
but he is so nice.

47
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,900
He used to ask me out when I worked
at the real estate office, and...

48
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,803
you know, when I finally decided
that I was ready to date,

49
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:21,602
I called him, and you know...

50
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,503
Oh, great.

51
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,300
These are brand-new.

52
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,503
I can't believe it.

53
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,400
Well, just for the record, I agree
that Tim deserves a little payback.

54
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:33,700
Oh, wow. Fright night.
I forgot.

55
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,603
Correction.
Retro fright night.

56
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:38,200
Psycho, Hell House,
I Know What You Did Last Summer.

57
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,803
Wait. How is that retro?

58
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,503
Which one?

59
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,401
Cool. So I'm gonna go chill a minute.

60
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,202
Ok. Have a good time.

61
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,401
Hey, I don't want you
staying up too late.

62
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:51,700
And, Ned, be sure to listen
to Melinda tonight.

63
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:54,802
Ned, we gotta get started.

64
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,102
Ned.

65
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,503
Who are you?

66
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:09,601
What do you want?

67
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:14,601
Stop it!

68
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,903
Ned.

69
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:22,903
It's come back for me.

70
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:52,801
EPISODE 2x19
Delia's First Ghost

71
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,900
What do you mean it's
come back for you? Who?

72
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,101
I don't know. I...

73
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,602
Me and my buddy Grant,

74
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,903
just for kicks, you know,

75
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,803
we rig things to explode and stuff
to scare people,

76
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,803
mostly our old grumpy super.

77
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,202
Ok, so he's after you?

78
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:11,303
No.

79
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:15,103
Today, there was something with
us down there, something weird.

80
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,001
Scared the crap out of me and Grant.

81
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,302
It was a ghost, right?

82
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:19,901
Did you get a look at it?

83
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:21,602
I don't think it wanted me to,

84
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,502
but it did want me to find these.

85
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,902
Wait. So this ghost is mad, right?

86
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,203
Does anybody ever go like...

87
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:29,802
Because in Claw 2,

88
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,800
- when that guy got that...
- Ned,

89
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

90
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,302
But that thing's dogging me.

91
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,403
Yeah, and you're gonna have to
help me figure out why,

92
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,901
ok, so we can get it to leave.

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,502
Yeah. Ok.

94
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,601
- You gonna tell my mom about those?
- No,

95
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:51,302
but it's gonna be a very different
fright night than we had planned.

96
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,803
So, after we agreed on a rate,

97
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:56,300
I said, "if you can't bring me comps,

98
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,103
you're not gettin' your cap back. "

99
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,402
You really said that?

100
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:01,700
Seriously, I said that.

101
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:06,401
I was willing to blow a million-dollar
deal for a phillies cap.

102
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:09,403
Very bold move.

103
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,201
You have a little something right here.

104
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,402
Oh, that is...

105
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,200
not embarrassing at all.

106
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:19,201
Happens to me all the time.

107
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,400
I doubt that, but thank you.

108
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,200
How am I?

109
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:24,701
You're good.
You're very, very good.

110
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:25,803
Thank you.

111
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,503
Now, I would like to propose a toast...

112
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,003
to you,

113
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:35,300
to thank you for finally saying yes.

114
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,501
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I just...

115
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:46,602
- I just got a little singed.
- That was so strange.

116
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,801
Are you ok?
I'm sorry I spilled...

117
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:52,303
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

118
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:54,400
Come on, clancy.
Man, don't be a buzzkill.

119
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,500
When was the last time
we went out after work?

120
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:58,501
Last thursday.

121
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,000
Hey, is that...

122
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,603
That's Delia.

123
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,200
Is she on a date?

124
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:08,000
Please don't tell me that's a date.

125
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:08,600
It is.

126
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,802
Man, I thought we were good.

127
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:13,001
I apologized.
I went to great lengths.

128
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:16,401
- That coffee stunt was sweet, Flaher.
- Right. She loved it.

129
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:21,300
I took her out to dinner.
We had a great Time, so why is she...

130
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,803
You knew...

131
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:24,801
and you didn't tell me?

132
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:28,003
Is it my job to tell you?
She can go out on a date.

133
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:31,101
- You hurt her feelings, Flaherty.
- What are you, part girl now?

134
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,600
Is that it? Ok.

135
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,103
Ok. Fine. All right.
Game on. Here's the deal.

136
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,800
I need an edge. All right?
You gotta ask Melinda

137
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,600
what kind of stuff Delia likes.

138
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,902
You don't need to jump
through hoops for Delia.

139
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,601
- She likes you.
- Oh? Oh, yeah?

140
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:46,903
Then why is she out with pretty boy?

141
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,500
I nearly had a stroke when you called,

142
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:54,902
but I get that you needed time.

143
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,700
Yeah, lots of it, I guess.

144
00:07:56,904 --> 00:08:01,401
Waiting till you're ready
is a good thing. h

145
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,708
How long we gotta be down here?

146
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,909
Hey, that powder,
do you know what that is?

147
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,601
Yeah. It's laundry soap.

148
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,200
We set firecrackers
to explode the boxes...

149
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,700
And that's when the room
started shaking?

150
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:34,602
So he's after your fireworks.

151
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,703
All right, here's the deal.
You have to apologize,

152
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,500
and once maybe you make things right,

153
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,201
hopefully I can get the spirit
to move on.

154
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,600
Ok. So I'm sorry. I...

155
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,701
Ok, that didn't happen before.

156
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,100
Waste!

157
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,902
All right. Ok, stop it.
He said he was sorry.

158
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:02,403
- What's going on?!
- I don't know.

159
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:06,102
Did I say something wrong?

160
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:11,302
Ok, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

161
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,400
Ned.

162
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,701
Ok, don't go into the basement
until I can figure this out.

163
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,201
Now, he said, "stay away,"

164
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:33,503
so hopefully if you're not
bugging him, he'll back off.

165
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,803
What's up with "hopefully"?

166
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:37,401
Not to doubt you or anything,
but that ghost seemed pretty hardcore.

167
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,403
Whenever they seem angry or evil,

168
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,103
it just mostly means
that they're confused.

169
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,300
So it's clueless? That makes
me feel a whole lot better.

170
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:45,402
All right, listen. This is not
my first barbecue, ok?

171
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,101
I will take care of it.

172
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:50,303
Take a deep breath.

173
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:54,300
Let's go get something to eat.

174
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,500
Are you ok?

175
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,800
My toe.

176
00:09:57,908 --> 00:09:59,400
I stubbed my toe.

177
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,101
Was that the ghost?

178
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:03,100
This one's just as scary.

179
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:06,001
You know, as far as fright nights go,
this one rocks.

180
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:10,900
Yeah. Let's hope your mom's
having as much fun.

181
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,101
Any luck down there?

182
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,500
This is...

183
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:17,301
unbelievable.

184
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:19,602
You know, this is a brand-new car, ok?

185
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,101
These tires never blow out.

186
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,302
I am so sorry.

187
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:29,501
You know, normally, actually,
I can change a tire. Really.

188
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:30,502
I guess I just...

189
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:34,001
call a tow truck, right?

190
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:44,903
Not lookin' good for
that second date, huh?

191
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,201
Dare I even ask?

192
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:58,302
Oh, you know, I just don't remember
dating being this challenging

193
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,502
when I was younger.

194
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,403
Yeah. I wouldn't even
know where to start.

195
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,301
Frankly, I haven't
had a date go well yet.

196
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:08,700
That's all right.

197
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:13,402
You know why?
'Cause I'm gettin' out there.

198
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,702
You know, Charlie and I,
we never even dated.

199
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,201
How did you manage that?

200
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,901
I was friends with his business partner,

201
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:23,002
so we just started hangin' out.

202
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:25,901
Anyway, how was your night? Did you
get the crap scared out of you?

203
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:29,203
Ooh. Sure did.
Scary, scary.

204
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:33,700
Anyway, Jim is on his way home,
so I'm gonna...

205
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:38,202
Tim did see you guys at Lento's,
by the way.

206
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,702
Was he upset about it?

207
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,600
Jim called and said that he had
to let him win at pool all night

208
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,600
just to sort of ease the pain.

209
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,102
Is it awful of me that makes my night?

210
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,900
No. I'd be worried about you
if it didn't.

211
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,403
But I think you care more about Tim
than you'd like to admit,

212
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,902
because I found these...

213
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,501
in one of your magazines.

214
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:02,203
Yes, I like him.

215
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,203
We have a good time together.

216
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:10,702
I'm just not ready to narrow
the playing field quite yet.

217
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,200
I can't believe it.

218
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,200
You know, poor Delia.

219
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:20,803
It's hard enough to date as a single mom,
and then your son brings home a ghost.

220
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,202
I just hope he doesn't
do any more damage.

221
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,002
Well, if it's any consolation,
Tim is more determined than ever,

222
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,903
and he wants me to scope out what
Delia likes so that he can impress her.

223
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:32,202
Well, that's cute, but isn't part
of the fun of dating figuring it out?

224
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:35,103
All right, was it fun when I asked you
to close your eyes for a bite of ho ho

225
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,901
and you broke out in hives?

226
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,201
Look, if you'd known I was allergic,
you wouldn't have gotten to play doctor.

227
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,300
Good point.

228
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,802
I'll tell him no.

229
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,303
You're not really worried
about this ghost, are you?

230
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,800
It's just... I don't know.
He's kinda creepy

231
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,200
and in their apartment.

232
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,703
- Are you gonna be able to talk to him?
- He doesn't seem like he's in a talkin

233
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,900
so now I just have to go
and talk to the super.

234
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:01,402
Please don't do that.

235
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,202
My pants.
I need my pants.

236
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah, and I would really love to
help you, but now is not a good time.

237
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:09,901
Do we have a visitor?

238
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,103
It's gone.

239
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,801
Thank god.

240
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:17,502
You should have seen
the look on your face.

241
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,002
That must have been one freaky ghost.

242
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:22,101
You have no idea.

243
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,103
You know, Flaher,

244
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,600
I never knew you were into bikes.

245
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,501
It's a funny thing.
I didn't, either,

246
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:34,801
but I just woke up with a picture
of this bike in my head like

247
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:38,303
I'd been dreamin' about it.

248
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,103
This isn't just a bike.

249
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,103
This is a full-blown...

250
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:45,100
midlife crisis.

251
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:48,902
You hear that?

252
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,303
Yeah. Sounds like
one dead battery comin' up.

253
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,103
That guy's gonna be bummed.

254
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,402
All right,

255
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:59,503
you keep workin', and I will, too.

256
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:27,401
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

257
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:30,402
I can't believe he even talked to you.

258
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:31,603
Must be because you're a babe.

259
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,803
Oh, that, and I slipped him a 20,
but you know what? It worked. Look.

260
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:37,203
We got to scratch 3 names off the list.

261
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,603
But this guy Roy Smead,
he died 4 years ago,

262
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:41,502
and he was known to have been
a bit of a recluse.

263
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,100
Yeah. I remember something about him.

264
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,201
You knew him?

265
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,802
Nah. That was before we moved in,

266
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:48,902
but Grant said he had all these
newspapers piled up in his apartment.

267
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,701
They could hardly find
the body in the mess.

268
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:53,700
Well, ok, so if he was a loner,
he'd be mad at you for disturbing him.

269
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,901
But I'm not anymore.

270
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,401
No, but it gives me time to get
some information on the family

271
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:03,600
and find out if this ghost is
attached to something in the basement.

272
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:48,700
What's up?

273
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,400
What's up is I was trying to
surprise Delia with some flowers,

274
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:54,302
but having no idea
what kind she liked, I didn't.

275
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,702
- If you'd asked Melinda like I'd
wanted you to... - I asked her.

276
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,002
You did? What'd she say?

277
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:00,501
"Where's the sport in that?"

278
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,201
Or something to that effect.

279
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:04,102
Oh, yeah. I forgot. She hates me.

280
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:07,000
- She doesn't hate you.
- No, she has to.

281
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:12,402
I burned her girlfriend.
It's like a rule or something.

282
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,901
Please. You have got...

283
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:25,901
Clancy, your radio's busted.

284
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,603
Just needed a more manly touch.

285
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:44,200
I wish you could put some clothes on.

286
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,902
Well, it's a really beautiful frame.

287
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,503
You have great taste.

288
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah, when you're picking it out.

289
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:01,102
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

290
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,803
Are you ok?

291
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:04,800
Can I get you some water or something?

292
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,701
Is it your heart?
Are you in pain?

293
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:07,801
Are you all right?

294
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:10,402
Charlie.

295
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,501
Stay away!

296
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,700
I would have seen him
around Delia by now,

297
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,703
but sometimes when people
die of violent deaths,

298
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,903
the longer they stay away,
the more confused they get.

299
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,102
Maybe that explains why he's been
acting so out of character.

300
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,302
It's like he's protective
of Ned and Delia,

301
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:31,103
but in his state,
that can be dangerous.

302
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:35,000
Now, at the risk of certain death,
can I suggest that maybe

303
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,902
this is something you should
tell Delia about?

304
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,102
I can handle it.

305
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:40,001
I have to at least try.

306
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,103
Ok. Fair enough.

307
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,302
Besides, I need Charlie to be
a little more stable

308
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:45,803
before I bring Ned in, you know?

309
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,701
Delia told me that Charlie
had a business partner.

310
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,203
Maybe that's who I need to talk to.

311
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:53,603
I just can't go through Delia to do it.

312
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,502
Oh, thank you.

313
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,603
Charlie was a real force of nature,

314
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,500
fun, warm, always helpin' people out.

315
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,203
But I imagine if you work with Delia,
you already know that.

316
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,503
Did she tell you he and I built
this business up from nothing?

317
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:11,501
No, she didn't.
That's very impressive.

318
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,003
We worked night and day.

319
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,902
But all that changed after the fire.

320
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,002
What fire?

321
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,400
Our office building burned out
6 years ago.

322
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,200
- Charlie was never the same
after that day. - How so?

323
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,301
Not so driven.

324
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,103
We rebuilt the business, but...
he just didn't care some much.

325
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,503
Did it change the way
that he felt about his family?

326
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:32,003
No, Charlie loved his family.

327
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:36,002
He and Ned used to fly
all those planes together.

328
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:39,501
I think I have still have a plan
somewhere in here.

329
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:44,703
He was building it to suprise Ned
for his birthday.

330
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,702
He designed it himself.

331
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,502
Whatever happened to the plane?

332
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,000
Lost in the fire.

333
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,102
Never quite knew what to do with these.

334
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:56,100
Afraid they might bring up
painful memories for Delia, but

335
00:18:56,206 --> 00:19:00,600
might mean somethin'
to his son, though.

336
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,601
That sounds great.
Can you drop it by the store,

337
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,702
or do you need me to pick it up?

338
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,602
Ok. Terrific.

339
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,102
Um, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

340
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:25,702
So what do you think?

341
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,901
It's pretty sweet, huh?

342
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:30,503
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,703
Just had this impulse.
Bought it just like that.

344
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,202
Crazy, huh?

345
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,001
Why are you lookin' at me like that?

346
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,303
Charlie had the exact same bike.

347
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:44,401
- No, he...
- Yeah. 1957 BMW R69,

348
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,001
just like this one.

349
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:50,400
You must have seen a picture of it
when you picked me up the other night.

350
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,501
I would never buy the exact same
bike Charlie had. That'd be...

351
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:56,103
weird.

352
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,101
Yeah.

353
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,900
Sure would.

354
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:29,501
Why are you still here?

355
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,903
I told you. I need my pants.

356
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:33,300
I promise you won't need
your pants in the light,

357
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,401
and if you do,
that they'll be there,

358
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:38,701
so why don't you just
do us both a favor and go?

359
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,900
Don't get testy with me, girlfriend.

360
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm doin' all I can
to hold it together here.

361
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:45,602
You see, that dream where you're
naked and you can't wake up,

362
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,602
welcome to my life.

363
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,201
Afterlife. Whatever.

364
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:50,300
I don't know.

365
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:57,300
Maybe you're right. Maybe I do have your
pants and that's why you're stalking me.

366
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,601
Hey, I'm not stalking you.

367
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,102
Ok, look, we got a shipment
of vintage in last week.

368
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,402
I haven't looked at it yet.

369
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,303
Can we just get this over with?
I have dinner waiting.

370
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,701
Wait. My pants are in there?

371
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:11,502
Let's pray.

372
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,300
All right, do you see anything
that looks familiar?

373
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:16,603
Well, maybe if you slowed down.

374
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:20,801
Wait. That's them.
Those right there.

375
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:24,502
- Are you private Jackson Reynolds?
- Yes. Yes, I am. That's me.

376
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,201
Hallelujah. We have pants.

377
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:29,700
Ok. Do you see a light?

378
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,402
See you, guys. Later.

379
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:44,602
I have something for you.

380
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:48,201
It's plans for a model
that your dad drew.

381
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:52,501
He was building it for your birthday.

382
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,802
This is amazing.

383
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,201
My dad drew this?

384
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,902
It's...

385
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,403
Wait.

386
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:00,602
Why do you have 'em?

387
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,302
Because I saw his partner.

388
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,602
Look, Ned, I know that this
is gonna sound really crazy,

389
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,200
but the ghost that's
been haunting you...

390
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:15,800
it's your dad.

391
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,300
What?

392
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:19,902
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

393
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,100
And I think that he's stuck
in one of those confused states.

394
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,602
It sometimes happens.
He won't talk to me,

395
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,702
but he might talk to you
if you'd be willing.

396
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:28,900
Oh, my god.

397
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:31,303
When?

398
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:37,400
Ned, you know that you're gonna
have to tell him to move on,

399
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,400
to cross over.

400
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,601
What?

401
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,301
- Why would I do that?
- Because...

402
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,503
he's meant to be in the light,

403
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,601
you know, not here.

404
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,303
And it's not good for spirits
to stick around too long.

405
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:53,500
It's hurting your dad.
It's hurting you guys.

406
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,001
- That's not true.
- Ok, look, I know that you really...

407
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,700
want your dad to be here.

408
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:01,603
I wanted my dad, too,

409
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:04,403
but the longer that he's here,
it makes it worse on everyone.

410
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,103
Don't touch me!

411
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,802
Dad wants to be with us.

412
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:11,302
I'll never make him go.

413
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:40,402
So,

414
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:44,001
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do here.

415
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:47,001
I was kinda young when we did these.

416
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:53,300
I'd always mess 'em up, and you'd
fix 'em later when I wasn't looking.

417
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:59,100
But I'll be better now.

418
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,502
The thing is, dad,

419
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:05,302
I miss you.

420
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:09,200
You were just so great, you know.

421
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:12,903
There was nobody like you.

422
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,002
Can you hear me, dad?

423
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,502
Are you there?

424
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,801
Ned.

425
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:29,400
Look, mom,

426
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,003
I can explain everything.

427
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:32,203
Honey,

428
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,400
you don't have to.

429
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:37,301
I understand.

430
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,701
You miss him.

431
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:46,401
I do, too.

432
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:51,102
You know, sometimes you feel ok,
and then...

433
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:54,003
something reminds you of him,

434
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:58,600
and you're right back
to where you were.

435
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,400
It gets better.

436
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,100
I promise.

437
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:08,201
I promise.

438
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,701
So maybe we could move,

439
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:17,700
somewhere that no one would
ever come and visit,

440
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,900
like the Antarctic or Queens.

441
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,702
You're still gonna have to tell Delia.

442
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:24,102
Yeah, I know, but when I do,

443
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,700
who's to say that she's gonna
be able to get Charlie to move on?

444
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:30,602
I mean, he was pretty clear about
the fact that he's not going anywhere.

445
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:34,801
Then I'd be out a friend, a coworker,
and I'd gain a crazy ghost.

446
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,501
- You really think he's crazy?
- I don't know.

447
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,400
It just gives me the creeps,
the way that he's just trying

448
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,402
to fit right back in with the family.

449
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:46,202
One minute, he's with them, and then
the next, he gets shot at an ATM.

450
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:48,403
I could see how that could make you crazy.

451
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:52,401
Look, I probably should
have mentioned this before,

452
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:55,501
but I think Tim's got
a ghost attached to him.

453
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:56,203
What?

454
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm not really sure, but
he's got that look in his eyes.

455
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:03,102
He keeps talking about purple flowers
and some song he keeps hearing.

456
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,101
Oh, god.

457
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:06,801
It's Charlie, right?

458
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:11,003
Yeah, trying to protect Delia.
Now I really have to tell her.

459
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:15,102
I think when you tell Delia your
secret, you will feel relieved.

460
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,700
- You do?
- Yes.

461
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,401
I think this has been harder on you
than you think, keepin' it inside.

462
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:24,500
I think when you let it out,
everything'll be better.

463
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,701
I don't know who gave you
the best husband handbook,

464
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:30,503
but you're really good at it.

465
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,602
This fell out of your pants.

466
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,900
I think it's what's keeping you here.

467
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:54,100
Maria Suarez.

468
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:59,700
She was the most beautiful,
passionate, sexy woman I'd ever met.

469
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:03,302
I was gonna ask her
to marry me that night,

470
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,303
but then we had this stupid argument.

471
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:06,503
So why didn't you?

472
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,703
She brought that dumb, yippy dog
to the restaurant in her purse.

473
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:13,903
Have you ever tried to ask someone
to marry you with a dog yipping?

474
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,603
The worst.

475
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,903
I got steamed, and I left.

476
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,500
I went to a Buddy's,

477
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,103
had a few beers.

478
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:27,700
All right, like ten.

479
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:30,501
Had this crazy idea
to run down to the lake.

480
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,501
Without trunks.

481
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:35,103
It was spur of the moment.

482
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:38,602
I slipped on something.

483
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:43,503
I wanted to marry her.

484
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:47,501
She never even knew.

485
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,400
She will now.

486
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:57,201
Who were you just talkin'...

487
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,201
What is up?

488
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,501
You know, the other day,
you called somebody Charlie,

489
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:05,703
and now you're talkin' to yourself.

490
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:09,001
Actually I'm glad
that you brought that up.

491
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,000
Ok.

492
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:15,102
You know how sometimes when you...

493
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:20,102
You know how you think that I...

494
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:24,600
How do I say this?

495
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,301
Oh, my god.

496
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,801
Are you pregnant?
You're pregnant, aren't you?

497
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:33,401
No. No, I'm not pregnant.

498
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,803
I see ghosts.

499
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:40,301
You're kidding, right?

500
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,103
No.

501
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:46,001
No, I'm not kidding, actually.

502
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,300
That's insane.

503
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:50,902
Why would you tell me this?

504
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:53,602
Because you have a ghost
attached to you.

505
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:57,202
Look, Delia, I know how you feel
about this stuff, and I really...

506
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:59,402
I really didn't wanna
have to tell you, but...

507
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:03,103
the reason that I am is because
the ghost that's attached to you...

508
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,901
is Charlie.

509
00:29:08,908 --> 00:29:11,602
Oh, my god.

510
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:14,302
Oh, my god.

511
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:16,501
You told Ned this, didn't you?

512
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:20,301
Yes, but he already knew, because
he had seen me talking to one once.

513
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:22,602
And I know that i should have
told you first, and I'm so sorry.

514
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:24,700
How dare you mess with
my kid like that?

515
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:26,803
He thinks his dad's ghost is here.

516
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,800
I heard him talking to him,
for god's sake.

517
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:30,502
Well, he was.
Charlie...

518
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:33,700
Just stop. Stop it.

519
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,300
You need help.

520
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:38,502
You need help, Melinda.

521
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,303
And if you ever,

522
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:45,103
ever talk to my son again,
so help me, god...

523
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:52,402
how many times did I walk in here
and see you talking to yourself

524
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:56,900
or acting all jittery?
And I never said a word, never.

525
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,900
I just thought you were quirky...

526
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,800
But it turns out you are nuts.

527
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,903
And by the way,

528
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:12,401
I quit.

529
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:18,802
Things are not better.

530
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:20,903
Now that she knows, they're worse.

531
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,302
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:25,801
I wish it would go away.

533
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:29,903
I wish that I could wake up tomorrow
and it would just be gone.

534
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,103
Don't say that.

535
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,801
You do too much good with your gift.
You help too many people.

536
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:37,203
What good is it if it hurts
the people that I love?

537
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:38,901
Andrea, Delia,

538
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:42,303
it did not help them.

539
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:48,801
I can figure out perfect strangers'
ghosts, but I can't help my friends.

540
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:52,001
That is not a gift.

541
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:03,002
Ned.

542
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:07,602
Were you playing with your dad's cologne?

543
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,102
Ned,

544
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,902
were you in your dad's stuff?

545
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:34,302
Ned, if this is one of your pranks...

546
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:49,900
I want you to tell me
what the hell is going on.

547
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,001
This is crazy.

548
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,103
I smelled his cologne.

549
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,001
- How are you doing this?
- I'm not doing anything.

550
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:02,101
Ok, think about it. What would
I gain by tricking you or anyone?

551
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,800
I am not buying any of this, Melinda.

552
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:07,403
- There's obviously some kind of
explanation for it. - Yeah, there is.

553
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,401
You just don't wanna know about it.

554
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:13,700
So you're saying Charlie is here
because he's trying to protect me.

555
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:14,803
Yes.

556
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:16,301
From what?

557
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:18,102
Other men. I...

558
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,100
I don't know.

559
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,601
I don't know, ok?
It doesn't have to be rational.

560
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,001
Trauma can affect people's
personalities dead or alive.

561
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:24,901
You know, it's like Chad.

562
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,700
- I mean, he said...
- You spoke with Chad?

563
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,802
He said that...

564
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,003
You know, it was hard for Charlie
and that his...

565
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:34,602
he was not the same after the fire.

566
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:38,303
That fire was the best thing
that ever happened to Charlie.

567
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,800
Really?

568
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,303
Charlie was a workaholic.

569
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:48,002
For the first 7 years of Ned's life,
he was just this weekend warrior dad.

570
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:49,602
So then what happened?

571
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:53,403
I don't know why we are
talking about this.

572
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:56,203
Because I...

573
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:59,700
I really wanna know.

574
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:03,803
I don't know what happened,

575
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:05,703
but there was something
about that fire.

576
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:08,003
We never talked about it.

577
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,601
But afterwards, he was much happier.

578
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:16,500
I just remember him saying
all the time, over and over again...

579
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:22,900
"I just don't wanna wake up one day
thinking it was all a waste."

580
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:32,203
Charlie was obsessed about
not wasting his life.

581
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:34,700
Thanks, but what does that
have to do with the fire?

582
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:40,103
He started saying that stuff
after the building burned.

583
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,002
Report is printing.

584
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:46,600
You know, everyone keeps saying that
something changed about Charlie that day.

585
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:50,302
Nobody seems to know what.

586
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:03,603
I know about you, Charlie.
You can stop hiding from me.

587
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,700
You don't know anything.

588
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:10,000
I know that Tim's the guy
that rescued you from the fire.

589
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:14,001
See, I was thinking that it was
like all the other guys you were
driving away from Delia,

590
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:15,302
but that's not true, is it?

591
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,003
I told you to keep out of this.

592
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:18,401
So then I was thinking

593
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,803
the lavender roses,

594
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,503
the song, the bike...

595
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:24,000
all things that Delia likes.

596
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,800
You're not trying to keep them apart.
You want them to be together.

597
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:28,100
Look,

598
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:31,800
you've already put everything
I've worked for at risk.

599
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:33,300
I just need a little more time.

600
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:38,000
And I just need to know
why you're doing this.

601
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:40,700
I was workin' late, again.

602
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:44,800
I was the only one in the office.

603
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:47,400
Hurry up, guys.

604
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:50,603
Come on! Hurry up!

605
00:35:50,808 --> 00:35:55,200
I just saw my life going down in flames.

606
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:56,401
Don't go in there!

607
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,501
I didn't listen.

608
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:07,300
And I realized right at that moment

609
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:09,101
that it wasn't about the files.

610
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:13,601
It was about my life
with Ned and Delia.

611
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:24,201
- Captain, I'm goin' in!
- Careful, Flaherty!

612
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,600
When I came to, I was delirious.

613
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:40,101
I remember, lookin' up into that face,
and just I was so happy to be alive.

614
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,001
I was so happy

615
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,603
to get a second chance.

616
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:45,300
Thank you so much.

617
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,501
I told him I would never forget him,
I would...

618
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:51,302
I would never forget how he risked
his life to save mine,

619
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:54,702
but he told me
he didn't see it that way.

620
00:36:54,805 --> 00:36:58,800
He just tried to do the best he could
with every day that he had.

621
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:02,800
I'll never wake up thinkin' it was
all a waste, you know.

622
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:05,203
He just knew

623
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,600
what took me so long to realize,

624
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:11,402
and thank god I did, because
3 years later, I was gone.

625
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:14,500
So you wanted him to take care
of Ned and Delia.

626
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,900
I just knew he was the one,
you know? I felt it.

627
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:21,600
So she starts dating, and you
make sure that they all go badly.

628
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,500
And it was goin' fine
until you butted in.

629
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:26,502
I'm the one who wanted
them to be together,

630
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:28,501
so why wouldn't you just come to me?

631
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:29,800
'Cause I didn't trust you.

632
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:33,302
So instead you gave hints to Tim
on how to win her over.

633
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:38,103
- Not the greatest plan.
- Oh, I did much more than that.

634
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:41,600
It was a long time ago.

635
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:45,401
I knew she needed the lamps
for her open house.

636
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:47,802
Damn.

637
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:02,101
So I sent her to you.

638
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:05,901
Come on, mom.
I'm gonna be late.

639
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:07,201
Let's go.

640
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,403
And you brought her to Tim.

641
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:12,002
You know, it may not work out, but...

642
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:16,501
I wanted them at least to have a chance.

643
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,702
Tim rescued my dad?

644
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,902
She's never gonna believe you,

645
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:24,102
but at least she likes Tim now,

646
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:26,203
so you can't completely screw things up.

647
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,100
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

648
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,400
Who are you talking to?

649
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:33,601
She's talking to dad, mom.

650
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:36,302
He's here.

651
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,301
Ned, it's time to say good-bye.

652
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:41,603
It's time for him to go,
but before he does,

653
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:44,902
he wants to tell you why he tried
to scare you in the basement.

654
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,601
Don't you?

655
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:50,000
I did a lot of crazy things
when I was a kid,

656
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:52,900
startin' about your age, and, uh...

657
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:55,801
it got me into a whole
bunch of trouble,

658
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:57,902
and I still regret it.

659
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:02,602
And I just wanna keep you from
having to go through all that.

660
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:06,401
Ned, your dad did a lot of messed-up
things when he was your age,

661
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:10,902
and he just wants to keep you
from making those same mistakes.

662
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:13,401
I get it,

663
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:17,503
and I'm glad you came back, dad, but...

664
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,800
you don't have to worry
about us anymore.

665
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,603
I can take care of things.

666
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:25,400
I know you can, son.

667
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:28,102
You grew up so well.

668
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:31,600
I'm proud of you, buddy.

669
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:35,301
All I want is you to be happy now.

670
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:39,801
I want you to find
the love you deserve.

671
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:42,601
What was that?

672
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:45,003
He's saying good-bye,

673
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:49,900
and he says that he wants you
to be happy now.

674
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,603
And to find love.

675
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:57,202
Ok, um...

676
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,002
I'm sorry, but I just... I can't...

677
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,501
Delia.

678
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,700
What if Charlie wasn't dead?

679
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:08,303
What if he was here
and you had no doubt?

680
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,302
What would you say?

681
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:15,301
Mom.

682
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:18,303
Please.

683
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,801
I would...

684
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,600
I would say...

685
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:34,201
that he made me happy, too,

686
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:38,002
more than he could ever know.

687
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:41,601
That he gave me peace,

688
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,503
and I would...

689
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:47,403
I would say, "I love you,"

690
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:50,202
and that, "I will always,

691
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:53,303
always love you. "

692
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:55,602
I love you.

693
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:59,101
I love you both so much.

694
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:03,101
He loves you, too.

695
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,901
Both of you.

696
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:10,103
And thank you.

697
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,100
- I just thought I'd...
- You know what?

698
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:17,302
Before you say anything, can I just...

699
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:20,801
I'm really sorry that I went
behind your back with Ned.

700
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,202
I know you are.

701
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,502
Thank you.

702
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:25,800
Here's the thing.

703
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:30,501
I think the reason
why I got so mad, so hurt

704
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:34,801
is because you're just
so important to me.

705
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:37,603
You have been such an amazing friend,

706
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:40,503
and I know you're a good person.
I know you are.

707
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:42,402
Just nuts.

708
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:45,702
Yeah, slightly nuts.

709
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:48,802
But I don't wanna lose your friendship,

710
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,700
and I just...

711
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:55,902
I just can't go where you go.

712
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,101
Can you understand that?

713
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,302
I understand that.

714
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,000
How did he know lavender roses
were my favorite?

715
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:16,602
Do you really wanna know?

716
00:43:21,705 --> 00:43:24,201
Tomorrow,

717
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:25,700
you want me to open up?

718
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:29,002
That would be great.
