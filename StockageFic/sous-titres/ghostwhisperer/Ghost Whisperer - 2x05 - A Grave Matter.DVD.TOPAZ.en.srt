00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,409
My name is
melinda gordon.

3
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,227
I'm married.

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,961
I live in
a small town.

5
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,458
And I own
an antique shop.

6
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:19,525
I might be
just like you.

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,361
Except that,
from the time I was a little girl,

8
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,557
I knew that I could talk
to the dead.

9
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:25,096
It's all right,honey.

10
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,590
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

11
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,043
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

12
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,850
and they come
to me for help.

13
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:39,523
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

14
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:01,156
That looks great on you.
With a top hat and a whip,fabulous.

15
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:03,580
If you need help getting out of that,
I'm right over here.

16
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,347
God,I love halloween.

17
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,533
My parents use to make
such a big deal out of it.

18
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:12,143
When I was a kid,they used to decorate
the house up like this big movie set.

19
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,224
It was so great.

20
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,456
Were your parents
into halloween?

21
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:17,301
Um,my mother
hated it.

22
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,223
I don't know how
my father felt.

23
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:20,278
Oh,why not?

24
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,521
He left
when I was little.

25
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,488
- I'm so sorry.
- No,it's ok.

26
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:27,756
You know what? I think this table
would look nicer next to the window.

27
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,327
- Can you help me?
- Oh,sure.

28
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:34,957
I love worked here.
It's so sweet decorate like this.

29
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,579
Ah, no problem.

30
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:42,716
has anyone in your family
died recently?

31
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:43,795
What?

32
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,319
Your extended family.
It's pretty much intact?

33
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:49,066
Yeah. Amazingly
long-lived,my family.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,783
Both of my grandmothers
are still alive,

35
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,590
and I have
a great-great uncle who's 102.

36
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:56,858
Wow. Amazing!
Everyone's still alive.

37
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,930
Hey,do you want to see the great undead lipstick
that I got for halloween?

38
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:02,954
- Sure.
- Let me show you.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,038
Oh,by the way,I am judging
the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight.

40
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,215
You want to come?

41
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:11,471
I would,but I have
plans with a friend.

42
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,509
Oh,well,friends are good.
The more,the merrier.

43
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,044
She's not in a position
to come,but thanks.

44
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:17,584
Ok.

45
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:21,118
I swear
I put it in here.

46
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:30,929
I don't know why I couldn't just tell her
I was coming here.

47
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,663
I mean,delia's
a really nice person.

48
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:36,739
She's got
a good sense of humor.

49
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,585
Maybe it's just
kind of hard to talk about.

50
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:45,210
I miss you
so much,andrea.

51
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:49,693
You will always be
my best friend.

52
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:57,053
Save a little piece
of that light for me,ok?

53
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:06,183
Ghosts! Ghosts!
Ghosts! Ghosts!

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,152
- This is wrong.
- What's wrong?

55
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,274
This.

56
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,889
- Who are you?
- This is wrong.

57
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,228
- Where am I?
- Look,I know that you're confused.

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,655
It's only been
a couple of months.

59
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,489
- Not me.
- Excuse me?

60
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:45,446
I can't be here.
I can't be.

61
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,624
Yes,you are here.
I just saw you come out of that grave.

62
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:50,734
But it's not mine.

63
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:52,312
Are you saying--

64
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:55,895
help me. I'm in
the wrong grave.

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,264
Can you see us?

66
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:41,053
So,a cemetery.It seems like
a natural place for a ghost.

67
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,666
No,actually,it's not.
Ghosts get their energy from the living.

68
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:46,352
There's more ghosts in a shopping mall
than at a cemetery.

69
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,984
That explains
all the lousy parking.

70
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,435
Ghosts tend to go
where the problem lies,

71
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,951
and this ghost's problem
is the cemetery.

72
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,577
How does someone
get buried in the wrong grave?

73
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,786
Hmm. Makes you wonder
what they're doing at those morturaries.

74
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,583
Oh,you don't want
to know that.

75
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,710
No,I really don'T.

76
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,484
So,assuming this guy is right,
does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave?

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,695
- Makes sense.
- Then what could I do about it?

78
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,892
Not much,
unless you can find the family.

79
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:12,048
I mean,they can order
an exhumation.

80
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,148
You're going to need
a lot more evidence than,um,

81
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,485
"I talked to a gst."

82
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:20,885
Makes you wonder how they didn't know
it was that guy.

83
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,619
The body must have been
pretty messed-up.

84
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:26,195
Yeah. It was pretty bad.

85
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,845
- Cold?
- No. It's just kind of creepy.

86
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:33,704
My work is usually on a higher plane.
I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing.

87
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,590
You want to try getting used to
the live body thing?

88
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,143
Ooh,that sounds nice.

89
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,582
I don't want to do
much talking here.

90
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:09,255
Go. Go!

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,145
Go away!
I'm not him!

92
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:13,841
Stop it!

93
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:16,629
Excuse me?

94
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,098
Wow,stop this weather!

95
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,575
Something like this happens
every time I come here.

96
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,203
I think it's his way of telling me
he knows I'm here.

97
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,884
That's a really nice way
to think about it.

98
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,947
You look familiar to me.
Have we met?

99
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,564
My name
is melinda gordon.

100
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:35,709
I own an antique shop in town,
same as it never was.

101
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,668
Yes,I love that place.

102
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:41,737
I bought a vase there
last year from one of your employees.

103
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:43,340
Lovely girl.

104
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,962
Yeah.

105
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,011
I'm shelby burris.

106
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,124
And this is
my husband steve.

107
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,463
I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,896
They say it gets
better with time,

109
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,704
but it doesn't seem to.

110
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,320
No,it doesn'T.

111
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:02,013
He was kind and caring.
He loved to laugh.

112
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:04,746
He sounds like
a wonderful man.

113
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,904
Were you actually there
when they buried him?

114
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:14,994
Did you get to say good-bye
and see him one last time.

115
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:16,955
Only in spirit.

116
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:20,855
There was so much damage,
it had to be a closed coffin.

117
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:23,861
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

118
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:28,116
It's ok. It's better to talk about it
than keep it bottled up inside.

119
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,940
It was nice
to meet you,melinda.

120
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,954
I didn't ask,do you have
a loved one buried here?

121
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,924
Yes.

122
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,327
The lovely girl
from the store.

123
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:42,425
Oh,I'm so sorry.

124
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,628
Life is so fleeting,
isn't it?

125
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:49,137
You can be happy,
things are going great,and then...

126
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:52,780
a sudden bolt of lightning
can wipe it all out.

127
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:55,211
Yeah,that's true.

128
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,800
Well,life is for
the living,right?

129
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,031
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,373
That woman. She comes every day.
She cries so hard...

131
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,429
but not for me.

132
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,531
Is that why you're trying
to get rid of her?

133
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:41,061
She thinks that
you're her husband.

134
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:43,831
But I'm not.

135
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:47,375
- Who are you?
- Godfrey.

136
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,044
Adam godfrey.

137
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,271
Do you know
how you died?

138
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,475
It was a flash--

139
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,726
bright,hot.

140
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:03,442
I just--I don't--
I don't know.

141
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,906
I know that
this is hard,

142
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,948
and you feel really confused right now,
but it's going to get better.

143
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,479
Do you have a family?
Anyone who can help us?

144
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:16,583
I was alone.
I was always alone.

145
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,403
Find my grave.

146
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:25,711
Please.

147
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,727
Wow,adam godfrey's
a writer.

148
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,783
What's that?

149
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,175
Oh,sorry. Nothing.

150
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:58,051
Adam godfrey?
Great writer.

151
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:01,048
Haven't you
ever read lost delusions?

152
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:04,560
Honey,I saw you
look right at me yesterday.

153
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:06,558
Don't pretend
you can't see me now.

154
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,308
I cannot talk.

155
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,042
Sorry. I just had to cash her out.
Did you need me?

156
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:14,799
No,no. I'm just
looking for this book,lost delusions.

157
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,302
Oh,yeah. Our book club
read that last year. Great book.

158
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,383
But the author was
kind of a one-hit wonder,right?

159
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,103
Well,let's see.

160
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:26,441
We all read it
3 or 4 times.

161
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:30,200
We tried to get the country club
to name a sandwich after the main character.

162
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:34,512
It's about a young man
struggling to find his ace in the world

163
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:38,489
and failing miserably.
Depressing,yet oddly uplifting.

164
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,789
Yep,that's the one.

165
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:43,746
I still have it at home,
if you want to borrow it.

166
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,559
By the way,e you hungry?
Because I am starved.

167
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,536
I totally lost track of time.
Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you.

168
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:54,098
Did you and andrea ever just close up for a bit
and go and have lunch together.

169
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,984
You know what?
I-I can't,

170
00:10:56,994 --> 00:11:00,129
because I have an errand to run,
so maybe some other time.

171
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:13,221
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

172
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:15,165
What are the chances?
Twice in 2 days.

173
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:17,760
Well,not so strange for me.
I come every day.

174
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,134
Can I ask you
a question?

175
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:23,754
Does the name adam godfrey mean
anything to you?

176
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,531
No. Should it?

177
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,384
I just thought maybe he was one of
your husband's friends.

178
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,045
Steve had so many friends.
How would I know him?

179
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,592
Um,he was a writer.
He's passed away now.

180
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,472
Adam godfrey.

181
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:38,396
I'm sorry.
I don't remember him.

182
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,092
If I do,
I'll let you know.

183
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:43,532
Can I ask you how
your husband died?

184
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah. I thought I told you.
A bolt of lightning.

185
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,529
What?

186
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,755
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's how he died.

187
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,641
He was struck by lightning.

188
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,519
- Lightning?
- That's what she said,

189
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,795
but my ghost said that he died,
and then there was a big flash of light.

190
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,988
And so?

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,638
So,what if they both
died from some sort of electrical shock?

192
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:11,044
Is it possible that
they're psychically connected in some way,

193
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,201
or that their souls
have swapped bodies?

194
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:16,596
You know,I never thought
I'd hear myself say this,but that's crazy.

195
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,674
Right. It is.I'm listening
to myself say it,and it sounds crazy.

196
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,149
Then again,why not?
It's almost halloween.

197
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:26,113
It's true.My grandmother always saidthat the
veil between the living and the dead got thinner around halloween.

198
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:29,069
The only way
to prove something like that...

199
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,418
would be if you found
where the other body was,right?

200
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,623
Yes,and then I could
talk to the ghost.

201
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,800
But I have searched the internet,
and I can't find anything on adam godfrey's death.

202
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,183
I even checked
with his publishers.

203
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:38,534
Oh,yeah?
What did they say?

204
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,274
Clueless.
They didn't even know he was dead.

205
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,416
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell them,did you?

206
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,815
How I can I?
I can't prove it.

207
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,918
Tricky.

208
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:47,374
Now,steve burris,on the other hand,
I did find something on him. His obituary.

209
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:48,759
And he is nothing
like adam at all.

210
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:53,491
Listen to this.A staple on the social circuit
with a taste forluxury,adventure,and the good life.

211
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:58,931
And your guy was a hermit,huh? It's not as
if their paths were to cross very often.

212
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,814
Coming.

213
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:03,559
Hey,jim. I hope it's
not too late for visitors.

214
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:04,861
Not at all.

215
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,190
Hey,delia,
come on in.

216
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,438
Oh,I'd love to,but I really just wanted
to drop this book by on my way home.

217
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,944
It's a little dark,
but guess I like that kind of thing.

218
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:12,894
Me,too. Thanks.

219
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:15,429
You sure you don't want to stay?
We're about to dig into dessert.

220
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:18,877
Dessert? I'd die
for something chocolate.

221
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,742
Oh,dear. It sounds
great,but I really should get home.

222
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:25,815
Ned accidentally agreed
to let me watch a movie that has no murder,

223
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,533
mayhem,or violent
explosions in it,

224
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,275
so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can
before he realizes his mistake.

225
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,524
Boring.

226
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,072
Ok,then.
We'll see you tomorrow.

227
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,552
Ok.

228
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,707
- Hey!
- Are you ok?

229
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:42,241
Yeah. Gosh,I'm such
a klutz today. Bye.

230
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,820
Can't I just see
what's for dessert?

231
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:47,786
It's not like I'm worried
about trans fats anymore.

232
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,919
Wait a minute.
Was she accompanied?

233
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,189
Yep. And her ghost
is a chocoholic.

234
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,139
I really don't know what
I'm going to do about that.

235
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:56,133
I knew it.

236
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:57,528
Hey,listen
to this dediation--

237
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,779
"to jean,withoutwhose loving support
this book could not have been written."

238
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,195
Sounds like
a wife to me.

239
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,165
You know,he told me
that he was alone-- always alone.

240
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,049
Maybe she abandoned him.

241
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,357
You're a hopeless
romantic,you know that?

242
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:14,493
Ok. There is a jean godfrey
who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park.

243
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,713
What do you think--
man or a woman?

244
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,115
Only one way to find out.

245
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,275
You know what? It's fun to brainstorm
this stuff with you.

246
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,193
You know,
I read somewhere--

247
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,698
ghostbusting keeps
a marriage strong.

248
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:46,633
Oh,I can't!
No,I can'T.

249
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,311
Honey,
are you all right?

250
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,811
Oh,yeah. I'm sorry.

251
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:56,480
I just promised my husband that I wouldn't
come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh.

252
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:00,753
Oh,yeah. Well,the reptile section's
right over there,if that's any help.

253
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,830
Actually,I am looking
for a human being.

254
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:04,960
Jean godfrey?

255
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,787
You're looking at her.

256
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,790
Oh,oh,hi.
I'm melinda gordon?

257
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,008
Are you related to
the writer adam godfrey?

258
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:16,398
Well,if being married
to him counts as related--

259
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:19,162
- he's your husband?
- Was,long time ago.

260
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,178
I kept the name,though.
So why do you ask?

261
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:26,028
I'm so sorry.
He's dead.

262
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:29,997
Oh,ok.

263
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,406
Tony,could you take
the counter,please?

264
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:33,541
Sure **********

265
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:35,587
Let's talk outside.

266
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,267
Sorry,but I really
have to do this.

267
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,047
I'm not going to light it,
I just go through the motions.

268
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,530
Quitting's a bitch.

269
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:45,672
That's what I hear.

270
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,728
So adam's dead.

271
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,303
How'd it happen.

272
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,186
There was an accident.
I don't have all the details.

273
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,395
You the girlfriend?

274
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,676
No. I just met
him recently.

275
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,489
He told me that
he'd always been alone.

276
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:01,931
Well,I guess he kind
of was,actually,

277
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,869
even when we
were married.

278
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,183
Yeah. It was really good
at first. It was just--

279
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:11,155
he was kind of
a hard guy to get close to.

280
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:14,187
So I assume you've read
lost delusions.

281
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,051
It was pretty much
the story of his life.

282
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:20,824
Tourtured young guy too smart for
his own good,doesn't really fit in.

283
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,687
I guess I thought that I was going to be the one
to bring him in from the cold.

284
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:28,053
You know what?Don't ever think that you can save
those tortured young artists.

285
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,432
I think that they actually like being tortured.
It's what makes them artists.

286
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,365
He was successful
for a while,though,right?

287
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:38,078
Oh,yeah. When lost delusions came
out,it was a big deal.

288
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,446
And then his second novel
came out.

289
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,424
Critics had
a feeding frenzy.

290
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,250
Adam was devastated

291
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:48,550
and he said he needed to move to the cabin
to have some isolation to write.

292
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:54,228
At first,he came home every weekend,
then once a month,and then there was the talk.

293
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:58,588
The one where you know
it's all over.

294
00:16:58,614 --> 00:17:02,517
If you want someone reliable,
you get yourself a pet.

295
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,022
Thanks for the advice.

296
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,695
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me know about this.

297
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,329
Oh,man.

298
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:16,158
This is going to be really hard
for kate to hear.

299
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,318
- Kate?
- His daughter.

300
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,692
Yeah. Death can be hard
to explain to children.

301
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,405
Well,she's hardly a child.
She's a junior at state U.

302
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:26,273
She hasn't seen or heard from her father
since she was 3.

303
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,962
- 3?
- She'd never admit it,

304
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:32,381
but I think that she always thought
that she'd see him again.

305
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,266
Hell,maybe even get
an explanation.

306
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:38,492
Well,that's not going
to happen now,is it?

307
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,552
Well,thanks. I just--

308
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,739
I wanted
to let you know.

309
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:54,232
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

310
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:57,290
I feel like I'm near
something that used to be important.

311
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,793
I need to talk to you.

312
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,746
Why didn't you tell me
that you had a wife and daughter?

313
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,541
A wife and daughter?

314
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,525
No,I didn't have
a wife and...

315
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,272
oh,my god.

316
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,047
Jean and kate.

317
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:16,078
Yeah,jean and kate,
who you abandoned when she was 3.

318
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:21,011
- Why would I do that?
- That's what I'd like to know.

319
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:25,589
All I know is I had a lot of demons.
It was hard being around people.

320
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,850
I think I felt that I wasn't good
for either of them.

321
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,829
So you ditched them?

322
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,217
No,I freed them
to lead happier
lives without me. lives without me.

323
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:35,110
- What?
- That's classic.

324
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,461
- You don't understand--
- no,you don't understand.

325
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:41,391
How do you think your daughter felt when she had
to watch you walk out of her life forever?

326
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:43,218
Free? You're her father.

327
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,060
It was complicated.
I'm not proud of it--

328
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,195
good,'cause
you don't deserve to be happy.

329
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,680
You deserve to be exactly where you are--
in the wrong grave,

330
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:52,650
doomed to listen to a woman grieve
a good man,knowing that he isn't you.

331
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:13,014
So anyway,I'm standing in this alley,
and I'm yelling at this ghost.

332
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,493
Why did I let myself
get so emotional?

333
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:16,922
Not gonna read it,huh?

334
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,959
I don't want anything
to do with this ghost.

335
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,297
Why would I help someone who would run out
on his family,abandoning his child?

336
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,294
Whose family are we
talking about now?

337
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:29,359
Ok,I admit it,I have a personal thing
going on here. So what?

338
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:32,414
So nothing.
Just know where it's coming from.

339
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,724
And then he had the nerve to expect me
to make it right for him.

340
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,830
In his defense,there aren't too
many other people he could go to.

341
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,261
You're defending him?

342
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,765
I'm pointing out you're a little
emotional right now.

343
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,237
I don't have to help every ghost
that comes along. It's my call,right?

344
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:49,167
I mean,you've
heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone.

345
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,746
Only when you thought
you couldn't help them.

346
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:53,027
You really think
I can help this one?

347
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:56,338
Yeah,I do.
And I think you do,too.

348
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:01,126
I can't talk about this right now.
I have a headache.

349
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,111
Ooh,that's fabulous.

350
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,674
Is it for sale?

351
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,987
Oh,no,I'm sorry.
It's mine.

352
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,566
Lucy and ethel
would die for that bag.

353
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,244
May I?

354
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,059
Oh,sure.

355
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,370
There you go.

356
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,308
Careful with that clasp,
liberace. You trying to break it?

357
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,023
Ow. There must be
a pin sticking out of it somewhere.

358
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,382
I don't see it.

359
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:40,820
Ok. Thank you so much,
and please come back again soon.

360
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,434
I will.
You girls have great taste.

361
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:49,350
That really is a nice bag.
I haven't noticed it before.

362
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,662
Yeah. I got it
a couple of days ago at an estate sale.

363
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,384
Ah. That explains a lot.

364
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,327
You know,there are some figurines in the back.
Could you go and get them for me?

365
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,008
You might have to dig around a little bit.

366
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,224
Sure,no problem.

367
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,018
So it's the bag.

368
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:07,483
Of course it's the bag.
I don't even know that woman.

369
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:11,163
- What's your name?
- Marilyn mandeville.

370
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,425
Why are you the only one
who can see me?

371
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:16,304
It's a long story.
So how did you die,marilyn?

372
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,013
I was at
a charity event,

373
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:21,559
one of those horrible things
where no one can remember the charity,

374
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:24,572
but they all sure as hell know where
the photographers are.

375
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,970
Well,I wasn't
in the mood to be in the papers.

376
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:30,888
I knew I looked all red and blotchy
from crying over luca.

377
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,902
- Luca?
- My boyfriend.

378
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:36,127
Hot-headed,
bad-tempered,

379
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:38,120
just this much
dangerous.

380
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,808
All the things
I love in a man.

381
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,074
Anyway,a friend told me
that she saw him out with another woman,

382
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,900
so...

383
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,626
I kicked him out
of the house.

384
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:51,745
Aha. React first,
ask questions later.

385
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:54,191
But I loved him.

386
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:58,121
Anyway,I was just about
to leave the party,

387
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:00,474
when suddenly I saw him
across the room.

388
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,501
He saw me,too.

389
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:06,217
He wrote something downon a napkin.
He gave it to a waiter to give to me.

390
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,821
I tell you,my heart was pounding so hard,
I thought everybody could hear it.

391
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:11,734
Well,what did it say?

392
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:14,240
I didn't want
to look desperate to read it.

393
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,137
So I tucked it
in my bag.

394
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:19,499
I finished my drink

395
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,105
and then I practically knocked over tables
and chairs to get outside to read it.

396
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,894
But then--

397
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,166
you died.

398
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:29,331
Heart attack.

399
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:35,558
I never got
to read the note.

400
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,882
Marilyn,I hate
to tell you this,

401
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:40,738
but the chances
of that note still being in the bag--

402
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,769
please,will you
just check?

403
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:45,843
Melinda?

404
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:49,326
God! The interruptions
in this place.

405
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:51,087
Shelby. Hi.

406
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:55,114
I just had to come by
because the strangest thing happened to me.

407
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:57,796
You asked me if I knew a man named
adam godfrey,right?

408
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,297
Right.

409
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:01,171
- Well,he just called me.
- What?

410
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:03,577
I was just about to have dinner
when the phone rang.

411
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,503
I said hello,but all I heard was
silence and a click.

412
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,183
I looked down at the caller I.D. And
it said adam godfrey.

413
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,537
But didn't you say
that adam godfrey died?

414
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:15,459
Yes,I did.

415
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,883
That's what I thought,
so I wrote the number down.

416
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,183
Melinda,
you may find this hard to believe,

417
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,574
but I think your friend

418
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:27,925
is trying to reach you from the afterlife.

419
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:45,881
I didn't think
you'd come back.

420
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,598
I didn't plan to.

421
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:48,871
Well,I'm glad
you did.

422
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:51,985
I have one question
and I want you to be really honest.

423
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:55,199
How do you walk away
from your family?

424
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,444
You tell yourself
your daughter will never feel the loss.

425
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:02,052
She won't miss you
because she never knew you.

426
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,480
Your wife will
find love somewhere else and be better off.

427
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:11,796
You tell yourself that your work will be the thing
that lives on after you,and that's what's important.

428
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:16,264
Well,maybe you needed
to learn this,adam.

429
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:18,738
That guy whose grave I'm in...

430
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:20,719
he was really loved.

431
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:23,273
He must have been
a good man.

432
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:25,154
Shelby thought so.

433
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,219
Shelby?

434
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:31,027
The woman who's been crying at his grave,
the one you called to reach me.

435
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:34,050
- I--I didn't call that woman.
- You didn't?

436
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,841
Who knew I could even
use a phone? I'm dead.

437
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,075
Does this number look
familiar to you?

438
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:44,696
That's my phone number
at the cabin.

439
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:46,716
Do you remember
where this is?

440
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,185
I think so. Why?

441
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:52,381
Because somebody's in this cabin
and I think we should find out who it is.

442
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:59,238
Does this road
look familiar to you?

443
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,446
No.

444
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:04,314
Wait a minute...
yes.

445
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:08,600
I was here.

446
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:13,783
It was late at night
and my car had broken down.

447
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:16,904
No,wait a minute,
I was out of gas.

448
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:22,782
The guy who picked me up,
he seemed upset about something.

449
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,624
And I asked him about it,
but he wouldn't talk,not until he heard my name.

450
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:32,810
Turns out that he had read
lost delusions 4 times,

451
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,599
and so he wanted
to know all about me.

452
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:39,088
I told him I lived in a cabin
miles away from everything.

453
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,887
But I asked him about himself
and he got tense.

454
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:44,558
"You wouldn't want
my life," he said.

455
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:48,176
He didn't really know his way around,
so we stopped at a bar.

456
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:52,231
I remember the bartender said
there was a gas station 3 miles down the road,

457
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:55,874
but my new friend
said that he wanted a drink,and so did I.

458
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,893
He said he was a businessman
who--who had the golden touch,

459
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:04,035
at least until lately,

460
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,602
and now things were
going sour,

461
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:08,472
he couldn't catch a break.

462
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,976
And he got some inside information
about something,like a big merger.

463
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:17,557
Gambled everything
he had left on it,and it tanked.

464
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:22,268
Now I remember. He said that his wife
didn't know anything about this.

465
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,383
I can't tell her...

466
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:27,166
and he said he couldn't stand to see her
have to give up the life that they had.

467
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:30,859
All that he had left
was this insurance policy.

468
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:33,714
I'm worth more
dead than alive.

469
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:40,448
This guy,he was so in love with his wife,
and I just felt empty.

470
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:42,656
I never loved anyone
like that.

471
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,012
Did he tell you
his name?

472
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:46,757
Well,if he did,
I don't remember.

473
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,466
Do you think
he killed himself?

474
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,887
Looked like he was
heading that way.

475
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:55,352
It was starting to rain,

476
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:58,387
so I decided
to cut my losses and walk.

477
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,044
Help!

478
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:19,939
Help me! Help!

479
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,475
What are you doing?

480
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,806
And that's
how he became you.

481
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:07,193
That man,he was the name
on my tombstone.

482
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,214
And I'm guessing
he's in your cabin.

483
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,174
But why would he do that?

484
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,488
Why would he throw away
everything he had,the woman that he loved?

485
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,033
Why not?
It's what you did,wasn't it?

486
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:43,171
- This is it?
- This is it.

487
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:47,890
- Yes?
- Who are you?

488
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:50,044
- Who are you?
- I'm kate godfrey.

489
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:52,063
Who are you?

490
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:53,387
My daughter.

491
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,255
You're adam's
daughter.

492
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:57,819
Put it this way--
he's half the reason I was born.

493
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,408
Second time,who are you?

494
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,764
Sorry. Melinda gorden.
I live in grandview,and I know your father.

495
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:05,600
You're the one that told
my mother he was dead.

496
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,634
Yes.

497
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:09,938
Well,that was helpful of you,
considering it's not true.

498
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:13,105
What does that mean?

499
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,020
Oh,I'm sorry,
can I come in?

500
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:16,606
It's not my place.

501
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:19,493
So...what makes you think
that he's not dead?

502
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:23,705
No accident report,
no body,no obituary.

503
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,117
Do you want me to go on?

504
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,842
No,I'd look
for them,too.

505
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,905
So not finding them
it makes sense you think he's dead.

506
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:32,346
I know he is.

507
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:34,755
Look,I know that this is gonna sound
hard to believe--

508
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:35,864
I'm sure it will.

509
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,716
I've spoken
to your father's spirit.

510
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,814
Oh,wow,
you're one of those.

511
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:42,993
Please believe me.
It's true.

512
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:45,342
I know my father attracted
some eccentric fans,

513
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:47,739
but this takes it
to a whole new level.

514
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,176
Do you know much
about your father?

515
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,651
- No. I've never even read his books.
- Why not?

516
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:54,700
It was the great god of literature
that made him leave us.

517
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:57,309
Frankly,I'm not interested.

518
00:29:57,775 --> 00:30:01,300
Kate,your father gave me every detail
about what happened to him the night that he died.

519
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,074
I'd be happy to tell you
if you like.

520
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,760
Do you know what I'd like? Is for you
to leave me alone.

521
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,508
My mother tells me
she hears from you that he's dead.

522
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:12,746
She asks me to come here and gather his effects,
I come out here and what do I find?

523
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,202
A full fridge.

524
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:19,000
Cigarettes in the ash tray.
Newly opened mail.

525
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,872
Dead,my ass.

526
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,480
I just hope I can
get out of here before he comes back.

527
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:28,207
Kate...the man who's been living here,
his name is steve burris.

528
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,002
There was a mix-up the night the night
that your father died and he was mistaken for him,

529
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:33,854
but your father
is here now.

530
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:36,520
And he really wants to talk to you
if he can just make some peace.

531
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,480
Are you aware that you aren't even
remotely believable?

532
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:42,322
Adam,please tell me something that kate
will understand. Help me.

533
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:46,569
Just that she was such
a beautiful child.

534
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,338
He thought you were
so beautiful.

535
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,987
That's it? Oh,come on. Didn't you
do your research?

536
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:57,751
The name of my fuzzy bunny,
my favorite pet.

537
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:01,393
What about a cute nickname?
Come on. Make me weep.

538
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,801
I--I can'T.

539
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,474
He told me before that
the only reason he left

540
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:11,623
was to free you
from having him as your father.

541
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,502
He didn't feel like
he could give you what you needed,

542
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:16,357
and that you would
have a better life without him.

543
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:18,316
Damn straight I did.

544
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:20,333
Look,I know how you feel.

545
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:22,308
He did a terrible thing,

546
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:26,237
and you've thought about him every day
of your life with anger and resentment,I know.

547
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,191
- You know?
- Yes,I do know,

548
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:32,776
but,kate,for one minute,just--just imagine
that what I'm saying to you is true.

549
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:36,872
That he's here and that he loves you and he feels
really bad about not being in your life.

550
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,334
If you could tell him
one more thing,what would it be?

551
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,810
I'd tell him to go to hell.

552
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,968
I'm so sorry.

553
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,564
Don't be. She's right.

554
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,268
She did the only thing
she could do--

555
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:09,654
she hardened her heart to me,
she got on with her life.

556
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:12,757
There's no reason she should forgive me.
No reason at all.

557
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,645
Wow,you should have seen her.
She was so bitter,so hard.

558
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:33,478
Is that what I'm like when
I talk about my father?

559
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:38,599
Listen,everybody's gotta put
the hard shell on,you know?

560
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,976
That means yes.

561
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:43,321
No,that means no.

562
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,742
You know,I can
feel the hurt.

563
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:52,935
Look,the good news is,
you overcame the hurt.

564
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:57,301
Helped somebody else
and maybe,in the process,

565
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,352
you helped yourself.

566
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:01,696
You always know
the right thing to say.

567
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,327
I used to always know
the right thing to say.

568
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:08,293
Yesterday you wanted
to bite my head off.

569
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,590
Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday,
I just didn't know it.

570
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:16,095
I can't sleep.

571
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,896
I'm steve burris.

572
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:50,736
Are you gonna make trouble for me?
I need to know.

573
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:52,513
You heard me
talking to kate.

574
00:33:52,522 --> 00:33:55,647
I was on my way back
from the mailbox when she drove up.

575
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:59,456
I stayed by the side of the house waiting
for her to leave,and then you came.

576
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:01,812
That stuff you told her,
how'd you know all that?

577
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:04,291
Adam told me.

578
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:09,335
Right. I heard that whole bit
about how you talk to the dead.

579
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,752
Come on,tell me the truth.
How'd you really know?

580
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,248
I wasn't lying.Adam told me about the night
that he ran out of gas.

581
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:19,267
How you picked up,
you told him about your money troubles,

582
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:22,413
and you told him that you would be worth
more dead than alive.

583
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,201
No one knew that.

584
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,925
He said he was
killed in the storm,

585
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:29,500
and that you stole his wallet so that you
could fake your death. Now he's in your grave.

586
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:33,703
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,000
I didn't know
what else to do.

588
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:41,509
I was on the verge
of suicide,and...

589
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:46,831
when this happened,
it seemed the only answer.

590
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:48,461
You found him.

591
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,884
He found me.

592
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:53,018
Adam's here now.

593
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:57,647
Please...

594
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:01,514
if he's really here,
make him understand I was desperate.

595
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,764
Tell him I know,I've been there,
but this isn't the way to go.

596
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:07,733
He says he understands,
but this isn't the answer.

597
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:10,790
You can't just leave him
in the wrong grave.

598
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:14,019
He has to hear
shelby crying everyday.

599
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,624
Shelby cries?

600
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,375
For me?

601
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,207
Tell him he's lucky.
I threw away the people who love me.

602
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:25,405
Adam only wishes
he could have had what you have.

603
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:28,363
But he told me . he needed to be free.
I understood that.

604
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,062
That's what
I wanted,too!

605
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:32,173
No,it's not freedom,
I was wrong.

606
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:34,700
He was wrong. He doesn't
feel free. He feels...

607
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,674
very,very,sad.

608
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,186
And he wants you tell shelby
that you're alive.

609
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:47,980
I can'T. She'll--
she'll never forgive me.

610
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:52,047
You gotta risk it.
Look at all the other risks you took.

611
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:54,980
He says you have to risk it.

612
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,294
And tell him I forgive him
for the rest.

613
00:35:57,308 --> 00:36:01,262
And he forgives you
for the rest of it.

614
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,681
He does?

615
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,998
He does.

616
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:10,165
Steve...
she will,too.

617
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:20,590
You should feel good about
what you said to him.

618
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,588
Even if nothing comes of it,
you're a good man.

619
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:28,104
That's nice of you to say,
even if we both know it isn't true.

620
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:32,069
Melinda?
Hi,I got your message.

621
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:36,119
Um...yes,there's
something that I have to tell you.

622
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:37,777
Ok,the night that steve died,

623
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:42,139
you said that he was alone,
and that's not really true.It isn't?

624
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,553
How do you know?

625
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:47,086
My friend,the one that I was
telling you about,adam godfrey,

626
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,043
he was with him
that night.

627
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:51,278
He was?
But you said he's dead.

628
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:53,813
He is.
He died that night.

629
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:55,299
But they only found
one body.

630
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:58,073
I know.
And it wasn't steve'S.

631
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,521
It was adam'S.

632
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:04,499
Melinda,what are you
trying to tell me?

633
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:09,401
What I'm trying
to tell you is...

634
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,197
what I'm trying to tell you is
to look over there.

635
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:22,863
Oh,my god!

636
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:27,503
Oh,my god! Steve!

637
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:29,261
You're alive!

638
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:32,144
Oh,shelby,
I missed you so much.

639
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:35,767
How is this possible?
What happened?

640
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:39,571
Oh,my god,I'm seeing your face again!
I love you so much!

641
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:41,780
Shelby,I have a lot to tell you.
I've done something

642
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,707
you're not gonna like,
it's something bad.

643
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:45,009
There's gonna be lawsuits
and trouble--

644
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,774
I don't care,
I don't care!

645
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:49,477
As long
as you're alive!

646
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,324
Thank you.

647
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:10,283
In my version,he'd probably drop dead of a
heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery.

648
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,965
I don't think so,
I read your book.

649
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:14,032
You did?

650
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,775
I did. Last night,
it was beautiful.

651
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:21,063
And I can understand
why the writer would need to live alone.

652
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,103
I'm not sure
I understand.

653
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,789
You need to forgive yourself
a little.

654
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,352
She'll never come,
will she? My daughter.

655
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,702
She'll never visit
her father's grave.

656
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,958
- You never know.
- Yes,I do.

657
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:41,607
This is one story
that won't have a happy ending.

658
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:46,026
Look,adam,
I'm not your daughter...

659
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,105
but I guess you've noticed
that I have some issues of my own.

660
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,307
But you know what?
If I wasas your daughter,I would...

661
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,387
I would find it in my heart
to forgive you.

662
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,414
Why?

663
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,580
Maybe it's because
I read your book.

664
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:07,397
Or maybe it's because
I realize that everybody has their own story.

665
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,827
And you just don't know it.

666
00:39:09,836 --> 00:39:12,513
So how's your story
going to end?

667
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,969
Happy.

668
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:18,965
It's all you can ask for,
right,is a happy ending.

669
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,870
No...

670
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:24,725
don't tell me it--

671
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,658
really exists.

672
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:28,221
It does.

673
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,465
Well,I'll be damned.

674
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:31,650
Actually,
that's not the idea.

675
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,475
But...why do i
get to see it?

676
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:37,890
I mean,I pretty much
failed on every level of my life.

677
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:40,518
Because you found
some peace.

678
00:39:40,953 --> 00:39:43,406
At least a little bit.
Am I wrong?

679
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:46,662
No. You're not wrong.

680
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:49,021
Thank you.

681
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,949
You're very welcome.

682
00:40:58,974 --> 00:40:59,969
Damn!

683
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,130
What happened?

684
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,722
I tripped over this bag again
and I twisted my ankle.

685
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,693
Stuff like that has been happening to me
for the past 3 days.

686
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,339
Well,maybe it's the curse
of that pirate outfit you're wearing.

687
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:13,187
Look,I am going to a great halloween party.
Do you want to come?

688
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:15,742
Ugh,no. I'm gonna go home,
take a hot bath,

689
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:17,800
and think about anything
but ghosts.

690
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,263
You know,I don't get you.
Ghosts and spooks are fun.

691
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,044
Yeah.

692
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:26,047
Will you do me a favor?

693
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,414
Sell this bag.
Ever since I got it,I have
had the worst luck.

694
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,634
I thought you didn't
believe in anything like that.

695
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:34,929
Yeah,well,I don'T.
Just shows you how desperate I am.

696
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,141
I will be happy
to sell it for you.

697
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,512
Hey,delia,tomorrow why don't we close up
and go to lunch together?

698
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,964
- Sounds good.
- Happy halloween.

699
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,232
About time.I thought I'd never
get rid of that girl.Now,look inside.

700
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,056
- I don't see a note.
- Check the lining.

701
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,025
Nothing.

702
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:03,115
There's a little rip in the lining.
You have to feel around.

703
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,985
All right!

704
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:09,267
I found it!

705
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:15,397
Oh,I'm so sorry,marilyn.

706
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,773
I don't you're gonna like
what this has to say.

707
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:21,018
What? What does it say?

708
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:24,639
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

709
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:31,652
He still loved me.
Luca still loved me!

710
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,465
It's what we said to each other after every
break-up when we got back together.

711
00:42:35,477 --> 00:42:38,952
"Rip my heart out,
why don't you."

712
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:41,642
It meant everything was going
to be ok now.

713
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,943
Oh...I get it.

714
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,787
Oh,I really have
to find him now.

715
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:51,264
Oh,let me stop you
right there--you don't want to do that.

716
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,993
Do you see a light?

717
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,708
Yes.

718
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:01,545
Yeah,well then,
you should go into it and wait for him.

719
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:04,087
That could take
a long time.

720
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:06,773
It won't seem that long.
Trust me.

721
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:10,389
Go.
Wait for him to rip your heart out.

722
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,930
Sorry! I ran out of candy
a couple of hours ago.

723
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:10,050
Bye.

724
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:21,069
5 signs death
will come...

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
