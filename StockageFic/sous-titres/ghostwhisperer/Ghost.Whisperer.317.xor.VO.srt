1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,286
Previously on "Ghost Whisperer"...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,510
had the worst dream.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,380
It's just a dream.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,430
No, this was a memory.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,180
This only way it can stop is if I can
figure out who this mask eyes.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,070
I am pretty sure it has something to do with my father.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,540
What is it that I need to know. Dad?

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,790
The truth about Grandview?
Why you here?

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,300
The dangers you're facing?

10
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,460
There is no records of his death.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,517
Not that I can find. No burial, no cremation.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,360
What are these numbers?

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,980
I don't know, must pull more file folders

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,700
To know my hand writing.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,280
Carl, I just saw you write them down.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,900
I mean, don't get me wrong.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,140
I respect the sure order cut. 

18
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,704
They after all have built and maintained
the temple that you see before you.

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,420
But was that the best use of your father's law degree.

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,960
I think he just took that job because he was on the run

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,070
OK, now you have my attention.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,570
-To run from what?
-I don't know.

23
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,380
But what's interesting isn't inside the file,
it's what on the front.

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,030
At first I thought it was a phone number but, there is too many digits.

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,740
And you're married, and any detective wait and salt
can see that you have an enormous rock on your finger.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,900
You're not getting the point.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,500
The guy did not write this.
A spirit using his body did.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,740
- You saw another possession?
- I think so.

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,030
I searched the numbers on the web.
I tracked them down to some security number...

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,410
What? What is that look?

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,040
1979 is that a year or did you just graphite my numbers?

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,440
1979 is the year, it's a court case. It's a docket
number, five digits followed by the year.

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,800
Anybody knows that.

34
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,980
That is ever been sued or sued or fought speeding
ticket are several have you ever done that?

35
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,770
No.

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,720
If I don't mind, even if I guilty.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,310
I like judges at certain type a day, they
get tired so, they get pity on people

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,340
Ok, if it's a case, would it be online?

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,310
I'm not sure. but, you can check with the courts.

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,450
because once an arrest has been made, it's always public record.

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,060
Thank you.

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,220
What's the rush?

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,230
Do you have any idea how long I've talked
about finding out what happened to my father.

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,360
I mean, how he died? What happened to him before that?

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,460
It's like, someone wants me to find out the truth.
They were just laying on me to ask.

46
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,430
- Hey!
- Hey, stranger!

47
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,270
Yeah, I know, night shifts.

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,620
Last time, it's on my way to see you.

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,380
But then I started reading this, and I just couldn't put it down.

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,320
- Wait, so that number was a case file.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,140
Payne was right. It's a case that my
father prosecuted when he was in ADA.

52
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,710
 So interesting. I was nine, when my dad left and...

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,610
My memories of him sometimes I feel that I made them up.

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,260
But, reading them what he had to say
in court, it's like hearing his voice.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,300
The state verses Paul Eastman.

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,350
Yeah, this is little boy "Michael Wilkins" was strangled in the woods.

57
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,289
Paul Eastman led them to his body. He was convicted as a crime.

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,300
But that was what I really know, about the little boy, this case

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,680
Why I was led to it? It's just not enough.

60
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,780
Hello, can I help you?

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,930
I hope so. My name is Melinda Gordon.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,380
- Are you Ellen Wilkins?
- Yes.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,510
- Ma, who is it?
- Melinda, right?

64
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,810
This is my son, Graham

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,290
Hi, I was looking for some information and
I think you might be able to help me.

66
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,230
OK.

67
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,230
My father was the prosecutor for your son's case.

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,310
His name was Tom Gordon.

69
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,650
No, that was long ago.

70
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,220
Please, I know it's been years.

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,670
My father's been missing almost as long.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,780
And I think that his disappearance's
tied to your son's death in some way

73
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,690
I really don't want to talk about it.

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,020
And I'm so sorry to ask you to.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,220
We don't want you here.

76
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,350
Can I come in for a moment.

77
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,630
- You said your father's missing?
- The truth is, I think he's dead.

78
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,540
Mom see if we can help her.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,250
I was researching the case, and the
truth is I don't have much to go on.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,310
Did you get to know my father at all during the trial?

81
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,340
Don't talk about this! Make her leave!
Why you even listening to her?

82
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,060
Did...did you see that?

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,320
Oh, it must've been the cat.

84
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,190
Mom, you said you're keeping the cat on the sun porch.

85
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,670
Our daughter is allergic.

86
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,990
My wife and I here with the kids for a few
weeks visiting while we work on the house.

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,770
You should check on the cat.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,600
If she got out, she is probably in the pantry.

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,140
- If there is a better time?
- There is not.

90
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,260
I don't know if you can understand this.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,500
 But my youngest Michael. This is still his home and...

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,270
I can't, I won't talk about his death.
Not to you, not to anyone.

93
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,050
Because I'm not dead.

94
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,720
- Don't say that. Never say that.
- Excuse me.

95
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,040
Don't worry honey, she's leaving.

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,800
You should leave now.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,913
Stop, you're hurting me.

98
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,120
No. I'm not hurting you.

99
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,860
Grandma.

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,790
It's my turn.

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,510
No it isn't.

102
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,080
??

103
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,670
- No, it isn't.
- Come on children. Stop fighting

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,230
I told you...

105
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,810
You kept his room.

106
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,450
You made a place for him.

107
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,320
Does everyone know he's here?

108
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,610
Pierce, Daisy go play in the guestroom.

109
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,550
Ok, its alright, I am not mad.

110
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,186
Who are you? and what do you want really?

111
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,800
I can see spirits, ghosts.

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,240
 And I can see your son Michael.

113
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,680
You can see my son?

114
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes.

115
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,030
Guessing that is not a shock to you.

116
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,960
Michael loves his home and his family.

117
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,630
He may live differently but he lives.

118
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,250
And that's not gonna change. Not ever.

119
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:56,927
Ghost Whisperer
Season 03 Episode 17
Stranglehold

120
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,350
So how long have you known that he's been here with you.

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,490
Oh, since the day he didn't come home for dinner,

122
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,710
going on 30 years now.

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,940
At first my husband thought I'd lost my mind in grief,

124
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,510
and then he thought I just lost my mind.

125
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,570
But it was so obvious to me.

126
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,650
Our son couldn't be gone, he just couldn't.

127
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,950
Who else knows about this.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,850
Well, when it first started,

129
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,250
I told Michael to let graham be.

130
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,650
Graham was just 12,and we didn't want to frighten him.

131
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,810
And things just sort of stayed that way.

132
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,200
But your granddaughter...

133
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,000
she seemed to be able to see him.

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,950
Yeah, I find children do when they're still very young.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,530
I told you it was our secret.

136
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,150
Do you mind if I talk to Michael.

137
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,880
As long as your questions don't upset him.

138
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,400
Michael.

139
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm here because a spirit sent me a message.

140
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,590
About your case, and what happened to you.

141
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,780
Was that message from you.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,520
I've been right here this whole time. I've been good.

143
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm sure you have.

144
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,020
But you've been here for so long,

145
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,140
it makes me think that maybe something's holding you here,

146
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,950
something you want your mom to know.

147
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,250
You know that this isn't right,

148
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,340
keeping him here with you.

149
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,220
Spirits belong in the light.

150
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,820
Michael's a child.

151
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,500
He's 10 years old.

152
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,700
He'll be 10 years old forever, and that's too young.

153
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,260
It's too young to be on his own.

154
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,050
Right. You can't keep him here until--

155
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,430
till the day I die, and then we'll go, together.

156
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,090
And you could help us then, ok.

157
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,950
I have never seen anything like it.

158
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,690
He was insisting he was alive, but she knew he was a ghost.

159
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,250
You've dealt with families who thought they were haunted before.

160
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,660
Well, they've sensed a presence, which is a lot different than,

161
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,870
"oh, hey, could you schooch over for dead Mikey.

162
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
Wait a minute, they thought that they could see him.

163
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,200
Well, his mother couldn't. I saw her try to talk to him when he wasn't there.

164
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,810
But his niece and nephew, especially the little one,

165
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,480
she definitely knew he was there.

166
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,330
And I want to help them, but I didn't go there expecting to meet that boy.

167
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,500
What were you looking for.

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,020
I mean, the case has been closed for almost 30 years.

169
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,410
I don't know. I just trust that if a ghost comes to me in any way,

170
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,780
it's because they want me to help them somehow.

171
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,870
You know, or they want me to send a message or find out the truth about how they died.

172
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,240
Or what happened after they died.

173
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Paul Eastman, the man who killed Michael, was convicted by my father.

174
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,020
But there was a fire at the prison, and he used it to escape.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,390
Did they ever find him.

176
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,490
No.

177
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,610
He disappeared.

178
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,150
They never found a body, and he's still wanted by the police.

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,610
Sweet girl.

180
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,910
Dad...

181
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,250
I'm here.

182
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,400
Where am I.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,800
It's ok, honey.

184
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,010
There was a man...

185
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,310
wearing a mask, and it-- I was really scared.

186
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,480
It was only a dream.

187
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,330
Why do I keep having it.

188
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,220
Did I know him.

189
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,670
You're in danger, Melinda.

190
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,190
How.

191
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,060
Please, I want to help you.

192
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,510
I don't know that you can, honey.

193
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,850
Be careful.

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,030
Don't trust anyone.

195
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,560
What are you talking about.

196
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,070
Don't assume anyone is who they seem...

197
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,500
not even me.

198
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,980
You get done with a 12-hour shift, and I welcome you home with this.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,590
I'm so sorry I keep doing this to you.

200
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,710
You're not doing it. It's your father.

201
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,400
He just keeps telling me this was a dream, but it feels so real.

202
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,490
What happened this time.

203
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,120
I was walking, there was blood.

204
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,900
The man was there, then he was gone.

205
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,400
Thought I'd gotten away from him, but it all ties together somehow.

206
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,600
The dream, the dead little boy, my father.

207
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,880
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,610
You said the mask was clear, right.

209
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,370
With kind of a reddish tint. It was hard to tell.

210
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,130
Or the face underneath it was red.

211
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,930
Did you tell me that the man that killed the little boy, he escaped during a prison fire.

212
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,390
Sometimes facial burn victims wear a clear mask during treatment

213
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,100
so you can see the wound, but it's still protected.

214
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,410
So you're saying the man in the mask has been Paul Eastman this whole time.

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
I don't know, is that possible.

216
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,140
Well, the dream I keep having, it feels like a memory...

217
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,440
maybe the memory wasn't my own.

218
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,610
Whose could it be.

219
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,700
Someone else he killed.

220
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,270
Maybe they gave me that vision.

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,680
Wait a minute, the ghost of another victim--

222
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,790
but as hard as he tried, my father couldn't stop Paul Eastman.

223
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,340
The killer's still out there.

224
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,560
Why are you being led to a case your father tried 30 years ago.

225
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,960
Because the killer's still out there. Maybe he's still killing.

226
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,990
But why an old case.

227
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,520
Why not something new, like a missing child report or, I don't know, a fresh corpse.

228
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,410
Look, all I know is this is the case that I was led to.

229
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,640
It might have some information about my father's file,

230
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,070
so stop asking me so many questions and help me.

231
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,030
Why one of those has gobs of sugar.

232
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,470
They both have gobs of sugar, 'cause they're both mine.

233
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,660
What is it with you perky people.

234
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,030
You think just because I answer my phone at dawn, I'm an early riser.

235
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,110
-I need these.
-Whatever.

236
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,490
Just keep the archivist occupied, ok, so I can get the case file.

237
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the archivist, that guy.

238
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,670
Why do I have to talk to that guy.

239
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,190
He's meaner than my uncle Snarly.

240
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,120
Hello.

241
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,520
Ahem, excuse me.

242
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,710
Good morning.

243
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,580
Nice to see you again.

244
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,380
What can I do for you.

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,690
Well, actually, um, I'm looking for files on a court case.

246
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,340
I have the docket number.

247
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,140
Civil or criminal.

248
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,740
Criminal.

249
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,160
Third row on your right.

250
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,540
Red tabs, they go by the year.

251
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,950
Help yourself.

252
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,790
When the town lets me shred, I shred.

253
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,160
No better cure for the clutter.

254
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,160
Coffee.

255
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,430
Thanks.

256
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,240
It's a good thing I was here, I totally won that guy over.

257
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,620
Either that, or he got his meds right.

258
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,130
91,92.

259
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,120
It's missing.

260
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,930
Or he had a personality transplant.

261
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,830
Oh, my god, you're right.

262
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,840
Don't sound so surprised.

263
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,340
He's possessed.

264
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
Who are you.

265
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,920
What are you trying to hide from me.

266
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,270
You don't belong down here, missy.

267
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,290
Neither do you.

268
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's go, Melinda.

269
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,970
No, I want to know who's possessing him.

270
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,630
I want to see daylight again. Let's go now.

271
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,250
Hey, you.

272
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,200
Which one of those is for me.

273
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,930
Neither.

274
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,860
Then why did you buy 2 new coffees.

275
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,140
I need them. These are decaf.

276
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,840
After that incredibly creepy experience we had back there, I need to wind down a little.

277
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,500
Is there anything in there about other abductions,

278
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,760
I mean abductions other than the archivist's body.

279
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,120
No. Nothing.

280
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,780
No similar cases that match Eastman's whereabouts.

281
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,350
He's only a suspect in Michael's death.

282
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,330
That's great. I bought 4 overpriced coffees for nothing.

283
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,370
Well, maybe not for nothing.

284
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,060
Paul Eastman made threats to my father outside the courtroom.

285
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,900
My father told the judge about them; they were a part of the case.

286
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,310
What kind of threats. Like death threats.

287
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,960
I don't know why it never occurred to me.

288
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,600
This guy threatened to kill my father;

289
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,800
my father who didn't just walk out on my mom and me,

290
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,770
he vanished, only reappearing to me as a ghost.

291
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,050
Whoa, that's pretty heavy. You don't think...

292
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,200
we know that Paul Eastman escaped from jail, never to be found.

293
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,360
We know that he wanted my father dead.

294
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,850
Maybe the murder my dad wants me to solve is his own.

295
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,270
I'm so sorry...

296
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,600
about before, coming here and upsetting you

297
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,420
and your son when I didn't know quite what I was looking for.

298
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,970
Now you think that that man who hurt Michael is--

299
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,920
I know that it's painful, but I hope that you can understand now.

300
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,290
But what is it you think he can do to help you.

301
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,080
Ghosts can travel.

302
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,320
My hope is that Michael might have seen something.

303
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,860
This man is a predator, and Michael knows what he looks like.

304
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,900
I don't have to help you.

305
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,420
You don't.

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,530
But I noticed that you like to play superhero.

307
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,650
And my father, he wasn't perfect, but he did like to help people.

308
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,290
He caught the man who hurt you, and he put him in jail.

309
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,810
Kind of like a hero.

310
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,880
And if we could lead the police to him, then you could be a hero, too.

311
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,850
You don't know anything.

312
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,130
Really.

313
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,670
Well, then, why don't you tell me, because you seem to know something.

314
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,820
Please, what is he saying.

315
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,030
I don't like you, and I don't like your questions.

316
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,820
What's he saying.

317
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,070
Tell her. Tell her I'm tired of this, and I want you to go away.

318
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,330
He doesn't want to answer.

319
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,560
That's not what I said.

320
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,090
Tell her what I said.

321
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,460
Michael, please.

322
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,490
What's happening.

323
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,430
Look, I know that this is hard, but I really do believe it's connected somehow.

324
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,440
Pierce...

325
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,580
honey, what--what's wrong.

326
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,150
She wouldn't tell you what I really said.

327
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,400
I was trying to tell you to make her go.

328
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,240
I've been trying to tell you.

329
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,970
Honey, we've talked about this.

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,570
I've told you, leave your nephew alone.

331
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,560
Don't get mad at me, mommy.

332
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,750
She made me do it.

333
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,270
Don't let go of me, mommy.

334
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
Never let go.

335
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,660
Oh, sweetheart.

336
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,860
I'm so sorry.

337
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,740
What's happening to me.

338
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,860
Pierce, is that you.

339
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,660
I'm scared.

340
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,100
What's happening to me.

341
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't know, but you're gonna be ok.

342
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,220
Michael...

343
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,010
it's time.

344
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,760
-Where am I.
-It's ok.

345
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,650
you're ok.

346
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,190
You're ok.

347
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,660
Hey, we've seen a possession before, right.

348
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,870
Where a spirit takes over a body and then releases it again later, right.

349
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,940
Is this a survey.

350
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,740
Cause I'm pretty sure I'm on the do not call list.

351
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,170
Listen, ok. I just saw something different.

352
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,120
I saw a spirit existing apart from his body.

353
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,010
Its living body.

354
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,290
That kid Michael just possessed his nephew.

355
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, that's spectral displacement.

356
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,210
Yeah, ok, break that down for me and quick.

357
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,110
It's an advanced iteration of the possession phenomenon.

358
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,100
The visiting spirit, the possessor, if you will, doesn't control the host body's consciousness.

359
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,520
It gives it the old heave-ho, creating what we call a displaced spirit.

360
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,110
I can't believe you've actually seen one.

361
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,910
Yeah, and I don't think it's my first.

362
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,250
I need to talk to you.

363
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,500
How did you find me.

364
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
You've been keeping tabs.

365
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,720
No, but it comes in handy to have an extremely untrusting husband.

366
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,700
I saw dad again.

367
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,220
I guess even in death, you're daddy's favorite.

368
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,240
Don't lie to me.

369
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,150
The first time that I saw dad, he told me that I had a brother.

370
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,370
Every time I've seen him since, you haven't been far behind.

371
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,750
-So.
-So you've seen him, too.

372
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,510
I knew there was something off.

373
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,540
What are you talking about.

374
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,970
The weakness, the confusion. He doesn't even look like other ghosts.

375
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,790
And he keeps coming in and out of it as if he doesn't have any control, because he doesn't.

376
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,370
You're not making any sense.

377
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,600
Look, a ghost is controlling his body, ok.

378
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,910
This whole time, I thought he was dead because I was looking at his spirit, but--

379
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Melinda.

380
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
You're alive.

381
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,600
My sweet, sweet girl.

382
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,550
Yes, I'm here.

383
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,940
And I'm just so sorry I've been gone for so long.

384
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,670
I just...I can't believe it's you.

385
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,430
Well, don't just stand there.

386
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,590
See if your sister wants something to drink.

387
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,500
I don't have much to offer.

388
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,500
That's ok, I'm all set.

389
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,620
Sweetheart, I just got in on a bus last night, otherwise I would have called right away.

390
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,080
But I had to rest, doctor's orders.

391
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,050
What happened to your leg.

392
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,980
Well, let's just say I had things on my mind when I should have been looking at the road.

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,540
Hence the bus ride, heh.

394
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,550
Hope you don't mind if I sit down.

395
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,350
I'm supposed to stay off my feet.

396
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,310
What's that face. You're looking at me like I was a--

397
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,020
a ghost.

398
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,510
I've-- I've pictured your life like a million different ways,

399
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,850
but the one thing I was always sure about was the end.

400
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,680
You're supposed to be dead.

401
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,840
Look, I can see how I've been like a phantom in your life--

402
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,530
no, it's not about what I felt.

403
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,200
It's about actually seeing your ghost.

404
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,920
-But, Melinda
-yeah, I know.

405
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,240
You're alive, so I didn't see your ghost, but I--I still believed that it was your spirit.

406
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,070
-Your displaced spirit.
-My what.

407
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,400
It happens when a ghost possesses another body.

408
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,270
The displaced spirit wanders on its own.

409
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,780
Possessed. I think I would know it.

410
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,070
No, you wouldn't.

411
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,010
That's the point, dad, you wouldn't remember any of it.

412
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,720
Who could be doing this to you.

413
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,080
Sweetheart, what are we talkin' about.

414
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,850
I haven't seen my daughter in 20 years,

415
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,170
and the first thing you want to discuss is--

416
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,480
it has to do with Paul Eastman.

417
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,620
do you remember him.

418
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,540
You sent him to prison because he killed that 10-year-old boy, Michael Wilkins.

419
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,890
Only he escaped, and I think that he wants to hurt other children, or you.

420
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,310
Melinda, I'm fine.

421
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,040
I've put a lot of people in jail, and none of them have come after me.

422
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,220
What got you on to all of this.

423
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,900
A ghost...sent me the case. At first, I thought it was Michael.

424
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,580
Lots of other ghosts have tried to stop me.

425
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,000
Does this make any sense to you.

426
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,100
Why on earth would it.

427
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,520
Because your's tried to stop me.

428
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,750
Last night.

429
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,930
You mean my-- what'd you call it-- displaced spirit.

430
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,530
Does this mean anything to you.

431
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,070
I have no idea.

432
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,380
Sweetheart, I--I'm sorry.

433
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,650
I wish I knew how to help you.

434
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,310
Look, I'm...

435
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,630
I'm not even gonna ask you why you haven't contacted me before.

436
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,370
That's your business.

437
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,830
But I do want to know why you decided to come back now.

438
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,210
I heard you were looking for me.

439
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,250
I decided it was time to stop hiding from my mistakes

440
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,060
it's time to start being a father again.

441
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,630
Well, I guess I should apologize.

442
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,860
You're back. I guess it's just a shock.

443
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,740
I hope we can have a second chance.

444
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,520
There's so much I want to find out about you.

445
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,280
I'd like to do that.

446
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,810
My father is back in my life again for one hour,

447
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,550
and this is our new relationship.

448
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,690
I steal things from his room for evidence.

449
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,030
Yeah, and with good reason.

450
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,220
It's not even his name on the ticket. He's using an alias.

451
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,830
What if he's in danger.

452
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,120
What if I was right about everything except his death.

453
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,120
What if he's using a fake name because he's hiding from someone,

454
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,620
someone who he sent to prison.

455
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,520
What if he's just lying to protect me.

456
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,680
-You believe that.
-I don't know what to believe.

457
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,930
'Cause none of it makes any sense.

458
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,330
Why would his spirit warn me not to trust anyone, even himself.

459
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,060
And then I see him, and he hugs me, and he says "let's not be strangers,"

460
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:21,310
Are you sure it was him you saw in that hotel and not some ghost possessing him.

461
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,920
I'm as sure as I am about anything, which isn't much.

462
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,410
Do you want to know what I think.

463
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,380
I already do.

464
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,370
You want me to stay away from him.

465
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,710
Right. Because...

466
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,240
I have watched you every day deal with horrible things;

467
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,630
terrible, painful things, and none of those,

468
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,940
all of them put together, have ever hurt you as much as this one man.

469
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,300
But he just got here.

470
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,150
And you want me to pretend like he never existed.

471
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,240
I mean, don't I have a right to know who my father is;

472
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,280
to know where he's been all these years.

473
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,840
Of course you do, yes, but are you ready for the truth.

474
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,660
I don't know, but I've gotta find out anyway.

475
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,540
Mel...

476
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,180
look, I know it's hard to be married to me sometimes.

477
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,810
-I'll never say that.
-Just let me make it easier.

478
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,300
Just help me find out what my dad's been up to.

479
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,590
Use your doctor connections.

480
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,580
Find out about that accident he was in.

481
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,780
Help me figure out if he's been living as Jeff king from Cleveland.

482
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,700
It's at least somewhere to start.

483
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,070
You got it.

484
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,110
How long are you planning to stay.

485
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,380
As long as it takes to clean up this mess.

486
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,690
I don't understand why you're so angry.

487
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,920
I've done everything you asked.

488
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,940
No, you haven't.

489
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,460
Or she wouldn't be asking me these questions about Paul Eastman.

490
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,770
There are ways to fix that if you'd let me.

491
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,340
Where did I go wrong to make you hate your sister so much.

492
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,340
You really need me to answer that.

493
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,050
I have to go.

494
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,800
You're on your own.

495
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,000
Leave me alone, you hear me.

496
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,060
I won't let you do this to me.

497
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,150
I won't.

498
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,210
Leave me alone.

499
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,870
Mercy hospital, Driscoll County.

500
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, Mr. King's complaining of pain in his lower tibia.

501
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,470
He says it's--he says it's from a car accident you guys treated him for.

502
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm going to need all the pathology records from that event, if you could send them to me.

503
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,980
We do have some records on Mr. King, yes.

504
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,160
He's been to this hospital many times.

505
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,810
His G.P.S practice is here

506
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,450
Great. Uh, what can you tell me.

507
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,510
He's been beaten up pretty badly, to be honest.

508
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,720
A couple of falls, some contusions, stitches to the elbows and knees.

509
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,490
Lots of separate visits.

510
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,490
So what can you tell me about the car accident.

511
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,780
We have no record of anything auto-related.

512
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,850
That's odd.

513
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,500
-It is and it isn't.
-How do you mean.

514
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,740
Look, nothing came of it, but we have reporting standards here,

515
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,390
and Mr. King's file got sent to the C.P.D.

516
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,980
The pattern suggested that someone was trying to hurt Mr. King,

517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,360
or he was hurting himself.

518
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,640
Or both.

519
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,620
I beg your pardon.

520
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,420
Uh, nothing. Thanks a lot, thanks for your time.

521
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,880
Don't get me wrong, there's lots of things I wish my father lied to me about.

522
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,800
For example, I did not need to know he worked his way through medical school as a corpse beautician.

523
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,740
I don't think he's lying, but I'm pretty sure he's hiding something.

524
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,200
You don't think he's lying.

525
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,330
Well, Melinda, let's count all the things your father has told you that turned out to be true.

526
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,370
Um, you know what, why don't you go first, 'cause I can't think of any.

527
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,130
Look, I have lots of questions for my dad, too, which I can ask him when he gets here for lunch.

528
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,050
Lunch. That's nice.

529
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,260
What.

530
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,150
My dad used a lot of rogue on those people, but they were still stiffs.

531
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,840
So you don't think I'll be able to tell if he's lying.

532
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,870
You'll be able to tell. The question is, will you want to.

533
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,760
Look, he has to tell me the truth, ok.

534
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,010
He's obviously scared.

535
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,240
He's been running from something for 20 years.

536
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,370
I can help protect him.

537
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,530
Protect him from what, Melinda.

538
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,120
You still don't know who possessed him, you don't know why you were shown that kid's ghost.

539
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,280
No, but I know it has to be connected somehow.

540
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,750
Michael Wilkins, Paul Eastman, my father.

541
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,590
I just have to figure out how.

542
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,610
Hello.

543
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,110
-Dad, yeah, I was just
-I'm not gonna be able to make it.

544
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,700
Really.

545
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,010
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
-Yeah, I got some news.

546
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,050
I hope it turns out to be good news.

547
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,480
He's at the doctor's.

548
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,770
He got held up waiting for an appointment.

549
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,060
Then why does it say Grandview court hotel on the caller ID, Melinda. Come on.

550
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,820
Are they giving free orthopedic exams with their tiny soaps and their pillow mints.

551
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,400
You know, maybe this is hard for you to understand, but not everything's a joke.

552
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,100
That man is my father.

553
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,840
He means something to me.

554
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,490
So go along with the lie or leave.

555
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,210
That's your cue to say, "no, rick, stay. I value your judgment.

556
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,900
Ok.

557
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,190
For the record, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings,

558
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,150
but I don't take back what I said about your father,

559
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,650
because you're my friend and he hurt you, and that's not ok with me.

560
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,490
And, you know, no matter what

561
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
Oh, my god, are you all right.

562
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,470
Can't talk.

563
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,600
Where did this come from.

564
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,900
Need sympathy.

565
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,480
Michael.

566
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:26,200
Where are you. Slow down.

567
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,640
Michael.

568
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,260
What just happened.

569
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,510
I had a vision.

570
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,120
Did you know you could walk at the same time you have a vision.

571
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,310
-No.
-Well, you just did.

572
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,300
You just vision-walked.

573
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,290
I have to go.

574
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,710
Someone just showed me how Michael's body was found. But something's wrong.

575
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,820
I'll tell you what's wrong-- you just vision-walked across my hand.

576
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,170
This is your cape, isn't it.

577
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,390
The one from the picture.

578
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,470
It's not mine, you're wrong.

579
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,590
-It's somebody else's.
-What's going on.

580
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,100
Your son's been hiding something you'll want to know.

581
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,580
Michael, is that true.

582
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,080
Someone led me to the cape, and they used your marbles to do it.

583
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,540
See.

584
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,680
At first I thought it was you, but then you didn't want me to be here.

585
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,400
So it had to be somebody else,

586
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,010
like a ghost or maybe somebody who wanted me to think that they were you.

587
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,740
Leave me alone.

588
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,060
Who do you think would want me to find this cape, Michael.

589
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,020
There's something you're not telling me.

590
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,670
Maybe it's something you don't even know that you know.

591
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,930
I said leave me alone.

592
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,730
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

593
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,990
'Cause people's lives are in danger, including my father and maybe some kids just like you.

594
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,450
Leave me alone, or I'll make you.

595
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,100
I understand if you're scared.

596
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,250
I'm not scared.

597
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,800
But you should be.

598
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,780
Michael.

599
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,640
Where are you.

600
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,150
No, no, this isn't right.

601
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,350
You have to leave.

602
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,260
I told her to leave me alone.

603
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,870
Michael, baby, no.

604
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,500
She's being rude.

605
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,220
She's not listening.

606
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,820
Leave me alone.

607
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,260
Leave me alone.

608
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,930
Leave me alone.

609
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,980
Daddy.

610
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,240
Go away.

611
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,890
Tell your son to let go of his brother.

612
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,110
If Michael says you should leave, you should leave.

613
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,230
I don't want her to leave.

614
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,910
She'll just come back again.

615
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,840
What are you talking about, honey.

616
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,210
I want her to stop asking questions, forever.

617
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,210
I want her to shut up, forever.

618
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,570
Michael, stop it.

619
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,710
All right. Let go of your brother.

620
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,340
Look, you said that he was-- he was too young to be alone.

621
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,090
You were right, he needs a mother now.

622
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,990
Michael.

623
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,090
Let go. Right now, do you hear me.

624
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,850
No more.

625
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,280
What's a matter, mommy.

626
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,540
I want you to let go of your brother.

627
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,750
But I thought you liked being able to see me, and hold me.

628
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,740
You said so.

629
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,540
I know, sweetheart, and I do.

630
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,880
But now is the time to let go.

631
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,770
Mom.

632
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,750
What's going on.

633
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,750
It's ok.

634
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,870
I'll explain everything.

635
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:52,190
He's only been able to-- ahem--go into other people for...

636
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,310
a year or two.

637
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,190
And I really didn't understand it at first, but...

638
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,880
yes, I knew he could do it, and I am so sorry, Graham.

639
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,390
All right.

640
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,340
Yeah, we'll talk more about it later.

641
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,910
I should go see how daisy's doing.

642
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,090
I need to know what happened the day of the accident.

643
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,580
Everything.

644
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,330
I need to know everything.

645
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,070
You said that you were a good boy.

646
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,790
You are a good boy.

647
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,070
You just need to tell us, because somebody else got hurt that day,

648
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,220
and I think you know who it was.

649
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,420
I was playing superhero in the woods.

650
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,800
Mommy always told me I shouldn't climb trees without an adult there,

651
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,700
but I really wanted to fly.

652
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,140
I climbed up pretty high, but then I got kinda scared,

653
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,460
so I started to climb back down again,

654
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,650
and my cape got stuck, and I guess my foot slipped.

655
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,330
And the next thing I remember, I was on the ground.

656
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,910
My cape was gone, but I didn't care about that.

657
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,370
I was just thinking...

658
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,030
"my mom's gonna be so mad at me.

659
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,940
" So it was an accident.

660
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,990
Nobody hurt you.

661
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,850
I don't understand.

662
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,450
Yeah, I'm not sure that I do, either.

663
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,500
Michael, the man who led the police to your body, Paul Eastman.

664
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,080
How did he find you.

665
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,170
Was that an accident, too.

666
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,360
No.

667
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,900
I showed him the way.

668
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,220
How.

669
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,910
Was there a trail, like how I got led to your cape.

670
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,630
No.

671
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,470
I talked to him.

672
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,970
How did-- how did he hear you. I mean--

673
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,910
the same way I'm talkin' to you.

674
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,620
Please...what's he telling you.

675
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,900
No, no, please don't tell her.

676
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,800
She'll be so mad at me.

677
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,380
No, she's not going to be mad at you.

678
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,020
No, because you did the right thing.

679
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,570
You told the truth.

680
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,760
Even though you were really scared.

681
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,720
That's right, sweetheart.

682
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,630
I am--I'm so proud of you, no matter what.

683
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,690
I want my mommy to hold me again.

684
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,230
I want to feel her arms around me again.

685
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,400
Michael, this may be hard for you to understand, but that can't happen anymore.

686
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:53,470
There's another place that you belong, and your mommy, she-- she wants you to go there.

687
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,150
She'll be with you one day.

688
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,650
Is that true, mommy.

689
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,750
Is that true.

690
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,570
You know what, it's hard for her to say so.

691
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,560
Because...

692
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,260
the one thing a parent never wants is to be away from their child.

693
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,140
It's just...sometimes it happens.

694
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,830
Melinda's right, sweetheart.

695
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,650
I've been so selfish keeping you with me.

696
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,970
And there's another place where you belong.

697
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,100
Nana and grandpa will be waiting for you there.

698
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,400
They'll take care of you.

699
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,610
Is that it.

700
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,210
It's so bright, mom.

701
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,710
He sees the light.

702
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,100
But he's scared.

703
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,340
Don't be frightened, sweetheart.

704
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,380
You go on.

705
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,710
You'll be ok.

706
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,920
I--I think I see nana.

707
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,140
He's going.

708
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,660
It's ok.

709
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,970
I'll be with you someday soon.

710
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,850
He's gone.

711
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,360
This is just getting stranger and stranger.

712
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, you're telling me.

713
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,090
So the guy who found the kid's body, he could see ghosts, too.

714
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,020
Yeah, I keep hearing Grandview attracts us. I guess that's true.

715
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,490
And when your father prosecuted him, he hadn't met your mother yet.

716
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,650
My dad would have felt the same as anyone else, that Paul Eastman is crazy.

717
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,170
He seemed crazy but was really innocent.

718
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,920
But it doesn't tell me how this all started.

719
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,860
I mean, who gave me that case number.

720
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,080
Who gave me that vision.

721
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,540
'Cause it couldn't have been anybody living.

722
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,310
Wait a minute.

723
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,050
What happens to someone when they have really bad burns.

724
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,920
Well, the infection can spread real easily.

725
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,620
You need ready access to antibiotics, you need water.

726
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,690
That's how he died.

727
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,510
Paul Eastman is dead.

728
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,040
He gave me that vision, he possessed my dad, all of it.

729
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,990
He's just trying to get his revenge.

730
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,780
But where do you hide when you're running from a ghost.

731
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,360
I have to warn my dad.

732
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,910
You know, he left his heart medicine at my house by accident.

733
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,910
So if he doesn't answer, you might just have to let me in, all right.

734
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,090
I prefer if I got a verbal ok from the hotel guest.

735
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,820
Yeah, well, he may not be able--

736
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,460
Oh, my god.

737
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,290
Dad.

738
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,450
Dad, just open the door, ok.

739
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,310
Dad, just open the door.

740
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,710
Unlock it.

741
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,340
Dad.

742
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,270
Help me. Push it open, help me.

743
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,090
-Dad
-Ma'am...

744
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,120
-dad, open the door.
-Ma'am.

745
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,780
Oh, my god.

746
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh, my god...

747
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,800
No.
