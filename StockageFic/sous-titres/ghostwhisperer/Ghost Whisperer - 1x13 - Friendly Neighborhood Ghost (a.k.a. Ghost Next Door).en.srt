1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,100
My mom says nobody lived here
since old man richmond moved out.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,600
Betcha it's not really haunted.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,700
Go inside and find out.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,300
You go.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,800
You go!

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,300
I'll go.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,500
What's the matter? Chicken?

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
Am not.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,500
Come with me.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,100
Melinda,what are you doing here?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,900
You know,it's late.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
You three should be in bed.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,000
We're looking for ghosts.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
I can't see them anymore.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,400
sometimes that happens.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,500
You grow out of it.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,700
Can you?

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
nope.i don't see any.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
You can't see ghosts.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,500
You hear them or feel them.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Right.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,700
I did not know that.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,500
what's that?

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Is something in there?

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,700
Good boy,homer.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,700
The kids would have been disappointed
without a good scare.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Go get it!

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,200
I don't get it.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,500
Why does a ghost dog need to go for a walk?

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
If i could answer that, i could cross him over.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,100
Poor homer.

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
He's probably just waiting for the ghost kids
from the orphanage

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
to come back and get him.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,300
thanks.

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
As if i don't feel bad enough
that he got left behind.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Here's what i think.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,800
If we take the ball and we throw it far enough,

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
he will keep going until he goes into the light,
right?

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
What was that?

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,300
The kids.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,000
what are you doing?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Hang on a second.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
That is private property,right?

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,100
mine. I just rented the place.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Don't you have keys?

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,600
Lost 'em.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm sorry about the noise.

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,800
I tried every door,but...

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,400
todd darja.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
Jim clancy.

51
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,300
This is my wife melinda.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
Nice to meet you guys.

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,800
So you're moving in now?

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,900
I've been real busy

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,500
and i don't have much stuff,so...

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,500
you need a hand?

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,600
No. no.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,900
No.

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Ok,then.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
If you need anything,

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,400
we're right across the street.

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Welcome to the neighborhood.

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
You lose your keys, you call a locksmith.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,900
And who moves in in the middle of the night?

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Probably somebody who had to move out
of their last place in the mile of the night.

66
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,900
I don't know.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
I think that guy was weird.

68
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,500
Maybe it'll be a short-term rental.

69
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,300
I kind of miss cranky old mr. Richmond.

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,000
Maybe he'll come out of retirement and move back.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
What?

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,600
Homer.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,900
He's growling.

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
He can't bite me, can he?

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,900
Something scared him.

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
a ghost dog catcher?

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,900
Todd's not the only one moving in at night.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Anything?

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
No. Just todd.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,000
maybe he likes to sleep in?

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Very funny.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,900
It's also an angry ghost.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,500
How can you tell?

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,800
I can feel it

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
and see it in the way he moved.

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,400
great.

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,300
For our new neighbors,

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,800
we have the cast of in cold blood.

89
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,300
I should go talk to todd.

90
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Make sure he understands what's going on.

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
You know,i wouldn't.

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
Why not?

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
You never know how people are gonna react

94
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
when you tell them what you do.

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,700
I always seem to handle it.

96
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
because most of the time
you can walk away, right?

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
And so can the people you help.

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,100
But,i mean,this guy lives right across the street.

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,200
What if he's got a big mouth,you know?

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
And starts telling everybody.

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,100
You're gonna have to see him every day.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
You can't avoid him.

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,500
Maybe you're right.

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,600
It's rare,but it happens.

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I am going to have to have a word with
the departed,though.

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,900
Morning,neighbor.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I hope i didn't wake you.

108
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't sleep much.

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,800
What do you want?

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,400
I just wanted to make sure we didn't get off
on the wrong foot last night

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
and thought maybe you'd like a home-cooked
breakfast.

112
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,900
Thanks.

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,300
look, i'd invite you in,but...

114
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,400
that's so nice,

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,500
but i can only stay for a minute.

116
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,700
i have always wanted to see the inside of
this place ever since we moved here.

117
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,800
Not much to see.

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
You travel light?

119
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,300
Move around a lot.

120
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Really?

121
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,900
Where are you from?

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
Look,...

123
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
those are gorgeous fixtures.

124
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,800
Really....

125
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
original?

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,900
Sure,i guess.

127
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
Am i keeping you from work?

128
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,900
I got to buy some things for the house.

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
What do you do for a living?

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Internet.

131
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,200
Website designer.

132
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Listen,

133
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
melinda...

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,900
i appreciate the breakfast.

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,700
I do,but...

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
i like my privacy.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,700
You understand?

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,900
You see me?

139
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Stay away.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,100
Sorry.

142
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,900
Sorry,i was,...

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
great moldings on that door.

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Look...

145
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
i really appreciate the breakfast,but...

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
seriously, i gotta get going.

147
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,800
I understand. Sorry.

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,400
I own an antique store...

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,300
most earthbound spirits are excited to know

150
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,300
there's someone there they can talk to
and that can see them.

151
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Not this guy.

152
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Maybe this one wants to be left alone.

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,900
no.

154
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
This ghost is on a mission.

155
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
He walks with purpose.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
He's evasive,

157
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
like he's up to something.

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,700
there he is.

159
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,800
He who?

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Todd or the ghost?

161
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Both.

162
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,900
Ok,what are you doing?

163
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm gonna follow them.

164
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,000
Melinda,stop.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't get involved in this.

166
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,900
I'm already involved in this.

167
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,600
There's a ghost living across the street.

168
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
You can pretend he's not there.

169
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
I can't.

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,500
Then i'm going with you.

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,400
No,you have work to do, and so do i.

172
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Ok?

173
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm gonna try and get the ghost alone

174
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
and see if i can't help him move on.

175
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,800
Watch out.

176
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,300
Are you all right?

177
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,000
Why are you following me?

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm not.

179
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
I wasn't.

180
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,000
Never met a ghost who's so proactive before.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Melinda,this one hurt you.

182
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,900
It wasn't like that.

183
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
He definitely wants to hurt todd,though.

184
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
Like "dead" hurt.

185
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,800
How is that even possible?

186
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I thought spirits couldn't touch anything real,

187
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
like a living person.

188
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
It's always been that way with earthbounds.

189
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
Usually,they move things.

190
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
It's like they're learning how to interact more,

191
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,900
make a bigger impact on this world.

192
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,100
Speaking of crossing over,

193
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
i have been doing some research into
man's best friend.

194
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
This guy is the best dog trainer in the world,

195
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,700
and he says that all dogs have issues.

196
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,600
What kind of issues could homer have
that would keep him here?

197
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Tons.

198
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders.

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or he's just a dog who doesn't know
he's supposed to walk into the light.

200
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
Maybe he thinks the light is a car coming at him.

201
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,800
there's something in here about that.

202
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,900
you keep me posted on that.

203
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,500
What's he doing?

204
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,800
Getting ready for a hurricane?

205
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Trying to lower property values.

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
I can't decide.

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
What?

208
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,500
We have to get him off that ladder.

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,800
Ok.

210
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
it looks like you need up there.

211
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm fine.

212
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,900
Can i talk to you for a minute?

213
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,000
It's important.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Why don't you people just leave me alone?

215
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,900
I want privacy.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,400
Don't you get that?

217
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,900
we get it.

218
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,300
Stop it.

219
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,900
Todd?

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,100
Todd, can you hear me?

221
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Is he ok?

222
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,900
No. Call 911.

223
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
Let him die.

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,600
Why?

225
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
What is your problem?

226
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
keep breathing, you'll be ok.

227
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
jim,

228
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,390
is melinda ok?

229
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,200
Why?

230
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Wanted to make sure she didn't get hit
in the head,too.

231
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,900
Bob.

232
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
What are you talking about?

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
He killed my granddaughter.

234
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,100
He's going to get what he deserves.

235
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
And if you don't stay out of my way,you will,too.

236
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
You ok?

237
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
This ghost really wants to kill him.

239
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,600
He thinks that todd murdered his granddaughter.

240
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,700
Wait,...

241
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,600
he's a killer?

242
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know for sure.

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Do ghosts lie?

244
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,700
They can make mistakes.

245
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,200
That's it.

246
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,100
You're staying away from this guy.

247
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm calling the cops.

248
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,500
And tell them what?

249
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,800
I don't need your help.

250
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,400
no.I can get them to check up on him.

251
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,900
Clark'll do that for me.

252
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,700
Please let me handle this.ok?

253
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,600
Don't do anything until i can get the whole story.

254
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,200
He's home.

255
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
The son of a bitch lived,

256
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
and he's home again.

257
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
It took everything i had to do that to him.

258
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Now i'm too weak.

259
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
It's a vicious circle.

260
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,800
You thrive on his energy,

261
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,600
but when he's weakened,so are you.

262
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Whose locket?

263
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
My granddaughter's.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
I gave it to her for her tenth birthday.

265
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,500
What's the inscription say?

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,800
"Patience. "

267
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,800
They buried me with it.

268
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,700
They should've buried her with it,

269
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,900
but they never found her body.

270
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,800
What's your name?

271
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,700
What the hell do you care what my name is?

272
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,300
My granddaughter's dead,

273
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
and that bastard killed her,

274
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,200
and he got away with it.

275
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
Why do you think he killed her?

276
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,900
I know.

277
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,300
Should've never sent her away.

278
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
I didn't know what else to do.

279
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,600
Sent her away where?

280
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,300
Boarding school.

281
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,900
She needed the discipline.

282
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,800
And that's where she met him.

283
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,800
Todd.

284
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
He was older.

285
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,700
He had no business befriending her.

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They called me,

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
they told me she was missing.

288
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,100
They had everybody out there looking
for any sign of her.

289
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
That's the first time i ever laid eyes
on todd darja.

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Over here.

291
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,700
Found something.

292
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,400
That's all they ever found of her.

293
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,800
The cops knew he killed her.

294
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Why isn't he in jail?

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,400
In jail?

296
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,700
They never even made an arrest.

297
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,900
No body.

298
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,800
No evidence.

299
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,700
They could never put a case together.

300
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,900
But my heart was broken.

301
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,500
I should've killed him while i was still alive,

302
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
but i promise you,

303
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,500
i promise you,

304
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
i will find the strength to make him pay.

305
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,200
Wait.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
This is just too weird, mel.

307
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,300
I don't want you near this guy.

308
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
This ghost is actively trying to kill him.

309
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,200
I can't turn away.

310
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
You know what it's like to have a ghost attached
to you.

311
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
This isn't an innocent bystander.

312
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
He might be a murderer.

313
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I know what i'm dealing with.

314
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,400
You're overreacting.

315
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,500
And you're underreacting.

316
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
People are getting hurt.

317
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,300
I know,

318
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
and that's not gonna stop unless i do something.

319
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
No,not if it means you're gonna go up close
and personal with todd the ripper.

320
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm sorry,mel,

321
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,000
i can't let you do this.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
Can't let me?

323
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,500
Come on,

324
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,400
you know what i mean.

325
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
I know what you mean.

326
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,500
It's just too dangerous.

327
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,500
Melinda...

328
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,400
i heard ya the first time.

329
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm gonna go to bed now,

330
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,200
if you'll let me,that is.

331
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,100
No,don't go making me the bad guy
because i care about you.

332
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't get all noble.

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,700
There's a difference between caring
and controlling.

334
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,200
Wait,you know i don't do that.

335
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,300
Good night.

336
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,700
All right,fine.

337
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,300
Good night.

338
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,200
that's what i said.

339
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
I love you,too.

340
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,100
Is that her?

341
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,900
Missing for 8 years.

342
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Don't you think you should call the police?

343
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,600
And tell them what,

344
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
that a ghost told me he's guilty?

345
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Melinda,you saw the guy bury plastic bags.

346
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,300
It'd be stupid to bury evidence in your backyard,
wouldn't it?

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
We can test his iq after we call the police.

348
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,600
Let me get rid of this ghost,ok?

349
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,800
Then i'll check in with the police.

350
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,900
You have anything yet on homer the dog?

351
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
you know,i'm getting close,actually.

352
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,800
This book says dogs are into their pack leaders,

353
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
and in this case,

354
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,500
i think you have become homer's pack leader.

355
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,600
And i have to cross over,then he'll follow me?

356
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,100
I said i was close.

357
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,200
I didn't say i had it.

358
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,200
Ok,according to the book,

359
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,900
dogs are very migratory.

360
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
They like to go w places,

361
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
try new things,

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,900
travel,shop.

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Wait,that's me.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,500
-It's him.
-Who? Homer?

365
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
My next-door neighbor.

366
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Keep an eye on him.

367
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
The minute he gets back in his truck,

368
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,300
call me on my cell.

369
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,000
Why?

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,700
Where are you going?

371
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,500
Melinda!

372
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Andrea?

373
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,400
Get out of there.

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
How long ago did he leave?

375
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,100
I don't know.

376
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm swamped,

377
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,000
i was ringing up customers,

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,600
and when i looked,

379
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,500
his truck was gone.

380
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
ok.thanks

381
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,900
You just can't mind your own business,can you?

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
it was my dog homer.

383
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,500
I thought his ball had rolled in here,

384
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
but i don't see it anywhere,so...

385
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
i'll help you look for it.

386
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
What's the matter?

387
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Are you scared?

388
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
Just like everybody else.

389
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,800
L... i should go.

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Please,just let me go.

391
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,600
Do what i say,

392
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
and everything'll be ok.

393
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Why are you doing this?

394
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Because i'm haunted.

395
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,300
There's something in here with us right now.

396
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,000
You hear that?

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
He thinks i'm some thing.

398
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
He doesn't know who i am.

399
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,400
Now that you're here,

400
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,300
you can tell him.

401
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
No.

402
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
You shouldn't have come in here.

403
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,100
I can only protect myself.

404
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,000
I can't protect you.

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,100
Is that what all this is for,protection?

406
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,300
To ward off evil.

407
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
Keep the ghosts away.

408
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,600
Talismans and offerings.

409
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,400
I keep 'em buried in the yard

410
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,100
so the spirits don't seep up from below,

411
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
but if they do, the incense confuses 'em.

412
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,300
none of this will work.

413
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,800
I will work.I've gotta keep trying.

414
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,400
New things, different things.

415
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,300
Combinations.

416
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,200
Something's gonna work.

417
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
Tell him why i'm here.

418
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Stop it.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't...

420
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,900
tell him why he's being haunted.

421
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,800
Tell him why he's being haunted!

422
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,900
Tell him!

423
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,700
You're being haunted because of stacy.

424
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,900
How do you know about stacy?

425
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,700
You tell him you know he killed her.

426
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
I want you out of here.

427
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
Get off my property and leave me alone.

428
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,900
He's a murderer.

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Maybe he'll kill you next.

430
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Get away from me!

431
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,900
He's going to die.

432
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,700
Sooner or later,i'll get the strength,
i'll find a way.

433
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,100
You can't save him.

434
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,000
If he dies,you may never find out
what happened to stacy.

435
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
I know what happened.

436
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,400
He murdered her.

437
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
But you don't know how.

438
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,500
You don't know why.

439
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,200
You don't know where she is,

440
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
You don't where he left her.

441
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Those are the things that are keeping you here.

442
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Those are the things you need to
find out to get closure.

443
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,600
He'll never admit to it.

444
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,900
Let me help you.

445
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,900
Please,tell me your name.

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Lyle.

447
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,900
Lyle chase.

448
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I'm going to get you.

449
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm going to get you!

450
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Going to get you.

451
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,300
that's enough.

452
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
That's enough.

453
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,200
All right?

454
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Somebody lives here.

455
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Go find something else to do.

456
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,400
ok,come on guys

457
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,900
And you...

458
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
Todd,it's melinda again.

459
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,900
If i could just talk to you for,like,
2 minutes.

460
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,600
Look,i...

461
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
i know you're being haunted.

462
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,700
I believe you.

463
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,700
You're not crazy.

464
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,800
I know about these things.

465
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,500
And i know it's been happening to you.

466
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,400
I spoke to the person who's haunting you.

467
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
His name is lyle chase.

468
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,100
He wants to know about stacy
and he thinks that you know.

469
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,400
I can help you.

470
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,700
if you'll let me.

471
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
But he's not gonna leave you alone until
you tell him what happened.

472
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,900
Todd?

473
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,500
Todd?

474
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,400
Hello?

475
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
Do you know the origin of the term graveyard
shift?

476
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,700
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

477
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Back in england in the 1500s,i think,they...

478
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,700
discovered that they'd been burying people
sometimes

479
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,400
that they only thought were dead.

480
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,300
So they started burying them with a little
string tied around their wrist that...

481
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,200
led up through the ground,

482
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
you know,to a bell...

483
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,700
that sat in the grass by their grave.

484
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,900
And then someone from the village had
to stay up all night

485
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,700
waiting for a bell to ring.

486
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,300
Graveyard shift.

487
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,200
Dead ringer.

488
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,500
This is the kind of tidbit you're gonna miss
if you stay mad at me.

489
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,700
You were mad at me.

490
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,100
Still am.

491
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
A little.

492
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,800
Mel,i can't stand it when things aren't right
with us.

493
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,100
I don't like it when you treat me like
i'm a child.

494
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,500
I don't.

495
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
Ok.

496
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
But look,are you gonna honestly tell me

497
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
that i shouldn't feel worried about
what's happening here?

498
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,900
You're gonna tell me that you feel safe?

499
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
I have to do what i have to do.

500
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,500
And sometimes,that's not totally safe.

501
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
I mean, there's your job,

502
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,800
but i don't tell you that i can't let you do it.

503
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,800
I love you.

504
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,700
And when i think about losing you,i can't...

505
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,800
you have to love what i do.

506
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
He's getting ready to go somewhere.

507
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,800
I have to go.

508
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,900
Go where?

509
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,400
Do you trust me?

510
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,300
Yes.

511
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,900
i have to go.

512
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,200
Listen for the bells.

513
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Watch for the dead ringers.

514
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
I need you to back off.

515
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,200
I don't wanna let that bastard out of my sight.

516
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
I can't connect with him with you in his face.

517
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,400
He can't focus.

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
I need to do this alone.

519
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,900
You will have your time to talk to him through me.

520
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,500
But not until i've talked to him first.

521
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,800
She's alive.

522
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
What are you doing here?

523
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,500
Please, can we just talk?

524
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
Todd,who is this?

525
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
She's a nosy neighbor from across the street.

526
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,400
But she knows.

527
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,600
What do you mean,she knows?

528
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,100
Knows what?

529
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,000
She says your grandfather is haunting me.

530
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,700
Lyle's the one who's been doing all of this.

531
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,800
My dead grandfather.

532
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,200
He's still here.

533
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,600
And he's attached to todd.

534
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,100
You don't know what it's been like.

535
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,900
She says that lyle thinks that i killed you.

536
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
And you believe her.

537
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,100
Your grandfather just wants to know
what happened to you.

538
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,700
We have to tell him.

539
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Don't say anything else, todd.

540
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,900
Just chill out!

541
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,100
Stacy,he's not gonna leave me alone.

542
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,400
This man is trying to kill me.

543
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Your grandfather, he loves you...

544
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,000
he loves me.

545
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,300
Did he love me when he sent me to that place?

546
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,600
I can help you talk to him.

547
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,500
He searched for you. He was heartbroken.

548
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,900
You must be talking about some other lyle chase.

549
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Look,i didn't want to talk to him
when he was alive.

550
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
I sure as hell don't wanna talk to him now.

551
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,600
Stacy,please.

552
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm not stacy anymore.

553
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Look,my grandfather is dead.

554
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,800
And so's stacy.

555
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,400
Stace...

556
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,800
come on,stacy!

557
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,700
I met stacy my senior year.

558
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,300
She was one tough little girl.

559
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,700
Of course,every other guy tried to hit on her.

560
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,600
But not you.

561
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,200
I'll tell you the truth.

562
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,800
I always thought she was way outta my league.

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,900
Did she tell you why she decided
to live with lyle?

564
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,600
Her mother was a drug addict

565
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,900
and they were practically living on the streets.

566
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Her grandfather disowned her mother,
you know,years before.

567
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,900
And when her mom oded,

568
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,400
the old man decided he would take stacy in.

569
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
He wasn't ready for her.

570
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,700
That's why he sent her away to boarding school.

571
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,500
Boarding school?

572
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,400
Is that what he called it?

573
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,900
Wasn't it?

574
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,500
It was...

575
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
it was a boot camp for kids.

576
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,900
The shelter harbor school for boys and girls.

577
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,100
It was the kind of place where parents would
send their kids to break their spirit.

578
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,500
They come and get you in the middle of the night.

579
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,800
There was this one teacher who really
loved his job.

580
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Mr. Papaso.

581
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,300
Sadistic bastard,

582
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
and he wanted to break stacy
in the worst way.

583
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
He'd play games with your head and beat you.

584
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,700
Thank you, mr. Papaso,sir!

585
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,400
One more,sir!

586
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,800
On the day she fought back,he...

587
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,300
told her she was going into the observation room.

588
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,400
We all knew that that room was run
by papaso,

589
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,700
and it was just another guaranteed
beating.

590
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,700
She knew she'd never make it through
3 more years there.

591
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,100
So she decided to run away.

592
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,100
I just don't want anybody to come looking
for her.

593
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,700
So you helped her stage her own murder.

594
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
That was the last time i saw her.

595
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,600
That's when you became a suspect?

596
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
The suspect.

597
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
Didn't realize it would be such a
big deal.

598
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
We were just stupid kids.

599
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,800
We didn't even know if faking your own
murder was illegal.

600
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,800
Then they started questioning me and...

601
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,900
people were out searching and....

602
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
It just got way too big.

603
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,100
No goin' back.

604
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,600
Where did she go?

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,700
She's good at taking care of herself.

606
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
It's all she'd ever done since she was a kid.

607
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
You risked going to jail.

608
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,400
You... kept her secret all this time.

609
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
You really love her.

610
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,100
Doesn't matter.

611
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
You know,i really changed for both
of us that night.

612
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,700
She had to become somebody else and me,i...

613
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,100
i haven't had a good night's sleep since.

614
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,800
I feel like i'm cursed.

615
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
My guts are churning all the time and...

616
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,800
the past 8 years,i haven't lived anywhere
longer than 6 months

617
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,500
because of lyle the friendly ghost.

618
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,700
Maybe it's me who should be dead.

619
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,900
I want my life back.

620
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,700
He's lying!

621
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,800
He's not,lyle.

622
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,500
I saw her for myself.

623
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
She's alive and well.

624
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't believe it.

625
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,000
I wanna see her.

626
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,500
He doesn't believe it.

627
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,400
I know what we did was wrong,all right?

628
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,500
We didn't know what else to do.

629
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,900
I mean,there was...

630
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,900
nobody there for her.

631
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,300
You weren't there for her.

632
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,100
Shelter harbor was the only place for her!

633
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,800
She was beaten,lyle.

634
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,700
There was a teacher there that singled her out.

635
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,800
She was abused.

636
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,300
I didn't know that.

637
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,800
He said he didn't know that.

638
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,300
That's bull.

639
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,900
You... you signed the papers,lyle.

640
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,100
You gave them permission.

641
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,300
All necessary measures.

642
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,500
Remember that?

643
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,800
And she tried to tell you, but you didn't care!

644
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,200
You're lying!

645
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,500
You're trying to make this all my fault!

646
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,300
You...

647
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,800
you are the one who killed her!

648
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,400
You...

649
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,900
you were the one who killed her!

650
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,000
Stop it!

651
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,700
Now,you stop it!

652
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Stacy is alive and she chose to disappear
because you wouldn't help her!

653
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,200
That is why you lost your granddaughter,all right?

654
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,100
Not because he took her.

655
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,900
I never wanted to hurt her.

656
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,900
Please...

657
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,900
you have to bring me to her.

658
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,300
I want to see her.

659
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Stacy made it very clear she doesn't want
to talk to you.

660
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
You have to bring me to her.

661
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,500
Please.

662
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Do you know where she is?

663
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,900
She'll kill me.

664
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
You'll finally get your life back.

665
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,200
I don't understand.

666
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Why would she come back here?

667
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,900
It's completely different now.

668
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
See,
she saw this as a chance to help kids like her,

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,800
help make sure they'd feel safe here.

670
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,700
In a sense, she gives back.

671
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,200
Go on,you guys.

672
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,700
I'll meet you on the field.

673
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
She's all grown up.

674
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,500
You shouldn't have done this.

675
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,000
You promised never to come here.

676
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Look,your grandfather is here,all right?

677
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,000
He knows everything that happened,

678
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,600
and he feels terrible.

679
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,900
But he can't...

680
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,500
what's the thing?

681
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,600
Cross over.

682
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,100
He can't cross over until he talks to you.

683
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,700
What are you doing, todd?

684
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,800
Tell her i have her locket.

685
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,000
Your grandfather's telling me that he...

686
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,500
has your locket,

687
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,700
the one that he gave you when you were 10.

688
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,900
You told her about that?

689
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,300
No,i didn't.

690
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,700
What's on the locket?

691
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,600
What?

692
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
What's engraved on the locket?

693
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,800
Patience.

694
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,300
He's here?

695
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,700
He can hear you.

696
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,900
You never gave me a chance... grandpa.

697
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I just wanted to matter.

698
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,700
You tell her she did matter.

699
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I thought i had to be tough with you

700
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,800
so you wouldn't end up like your mother.

701
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
He was afraid that you'd end up like your mom.

702
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,000
I wanted you to save her,grandpa!

703
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,400
sweetheart, i tried to save her.

704
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,100
I couldn't.

705
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
You don't know.

706
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Stacy,people do things and make choices.

707
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,100
Sometimes they have to save themselves...

708
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,100
and sometimes they just can't.

709
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,800
But you did,stace.

710
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,700
You saved yourself.

711
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I would take it all back if i could.

712
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,700
I would do anything.

713
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,800
But look at her.

714
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,300
She grew up strong and she's so beautiful.

715
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,900
She's the picture of her mother.

716
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,800
He wants you to know that he's sorry.

717
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,100
And he would take it all back if he could.

718
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,700
And he's so proud.

719
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,200
He's really proud of who you are

720
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,600
and he thinks you look just like your mother.

721
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,300
I'm so sorry,grandpa.

722
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,700
I should have told you that i was...

723
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,400
ok.

724
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,900
But i just...

725
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,600
i just didn't know what i was doing.

726
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,900
You tell her...

727
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,900
that i love her

728
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,400
and i didn't know how much until she was gone.

729
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
What do you see?

730
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
It's so bright.

731
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,900
I could touch it.

732
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,700
That means you're ready.

733
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,900
You can cross over.

734
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,900
It's my daughter...

735
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,700
waiting for me.

736
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
He sees your mother.

737
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,600
Mom?

738
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,400
She looks so happy.

739
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Thank you.

740
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,500
He's gone.

741
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,700

742
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,800
Time to move on.

743
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,900
Why? Lyle's gone.

744
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,600

750
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,700
What about your secret?

751
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,700
We decided to confront it all and let the chips
fall.

752
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm really sorry about everything.

753
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,900
You were never a dull neighbor.

754
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Good luck.

755
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,300

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,600

757
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,100

Ok.

761
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,000

what you're doing...

762
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,200
like you do it.

763
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,300

764
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,700
i can adapt.

765
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900

766
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,500

767
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,700

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,200
How are we gonna get you to cross over?

771
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,400
No crossing the dog over.

772
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,500
I like the way he makes you smile.

773
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,900
Let's go home.

774
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,500
