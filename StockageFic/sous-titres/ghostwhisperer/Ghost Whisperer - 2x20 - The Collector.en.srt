1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,250
MY NAME
IS MELINDA GORDON.

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,850
I'M MARRIED,
I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN,

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,350
AND I OWN AN ANTIQUE SHOP.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,150
I MIGHT BE JUST LIKE YOU.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,750
EXCEPT THAT FROM THE TIME
I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,250
I KNEW THAT I COULD
TALK TO THE DEAD.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,650
Grandmother:
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,450
EARTHBOUND SPIRITS,
MY GRANDMOTHER CALLED THEM.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,150
THEY'RE STUCK HERE,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE UNFINISHED
BUSINESS WITH THE LIVING

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,450
AND THEY COME TO ME
FOR HELP.

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,050
IN ORDER TO TELL YOU
MY STORY,

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,750
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THEIRS.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,750
Melinda: SO HOW LONG
WERE THEY MARRIED?

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,750
Delia:
JUST A FEW MONTHS.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,450
HE WAS SO CRAZY ABOUT HER.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,550
HOW COME HE
NEVER BROUGHT HER
INTO THE STORE?

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,650
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE
WAS JUST TRYIN' TO BUY HER
THINGS TO SURPRISE HER.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,250
HE IS A GREAT CUSTOMER
AND SO SWEET.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,450
ANYWAY, WE DON'T
HAVE TO STAY THAT LONG.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,050
JAKE.

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,250
HOW ARE YOU?

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,850
YOU REMEMBER
MY FRIEND MELINDA.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,050
OH, HI.

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,450
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,350
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I APPRECIATE IT.

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,750
I'M GONNA GO
PAY MY RESPECTS.

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,350
Delia: IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,050
NO. EVERYTHING'S
BEEN DONE....

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,250
THAT'S HIS WIFE?

30
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,750
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,550
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE?

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,350
I LAND THE RICHEST GUY
IN DRISCOLL COUNTY,

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,250
AND MY HEART GIVES OUT.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,250
OH. WOW. YEAH.

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,850
THIS IS LIKE
POETIC INJUSTICE.

36
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,950
I'M SORRY.

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,350
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN CROSSING OVER?

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,250
YOU MEAN THAT LIGHT?

39
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,150
YEAH. I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD GO
INTO THAT LIGHT,

40
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,150
YOU'LL
FIND PEACE THERE.

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,850
PEACE. I'M THIRTY--
28 YEARS OLD.

42
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,950
WHAT DO I WANT WITH PEACE?

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,350
BESIDES, I--
I REALLY DID LOVE HIM.

44
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,150
EVERYTHING OK?

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,350
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT HIS WIFE
WAS SO YOUTHFUL.

46
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,350
OH, I--
I THOUGHT
YOU KNEW.

47
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,850
NICE JACKET.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
SHE LIKES YOUR JACKET.

49
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,950
OH, THANK--

50
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,050
NO.

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,050
YES.

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,050
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN?

53
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,850
WHAT?

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,950
THE LIGHT, IT'S--
IT'S LIKE...

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,650
IT'S NOT SO BRIGHT ANYMORE,
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
GETTING IN THE WAY.

56
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
OH, THAT'S FREAKY.

57
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,050
WHAT IS?

58
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,950
I'M GONNA GO HANG
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
MELINDA...

59
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,150
THIS IS TOO CREEPY.

60
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,450
WHAT'S GOING ON?

61
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,550
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,350
GONNA GO FIND
THE LADIES' ROOM.

63
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,150
Man: STOP CRYING.
I'M NOT DEAD!

64
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,650
I'M RIGHT HERE!
LOOK AT ME!

65
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,750
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

66
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,750
YOU'RE VERY CONFUSED
RIGHT NOW.

67
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,650
IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME.

68
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
HOW COME YOU CAN SEE ME
AND THEY CAN'T?

69
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,850
THAT'S A LONG STORY.

70
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,450
THE IMPORTANT
THING IS...

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
THERE'S A BETTER
PLACE FOR YOU.

72
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:25,450
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:37,850
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@MAOREN
Sync:knlight</font>

74
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,450
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
SLOW DOWN.

75
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,050
ARE YOU SURE THE GUY YOU SAW
WAS TALKING TO A GHOST,

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,550
NOT JUST TALKING TO HIMSELF,
AND THE GHOST WAS--

77
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,650
I KNOW WHAT I SAW. THEY
WERE INTERACTING, OK--

78
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,550
GHOST TO HUMAN,
HUMAN TO GHOST.

79
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,150
WELL, THAT MEANS THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE--

80
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,750
LIKE ME. I KNOW.

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,350
OK, THERE'S ALWAYS
BEEN MY GRANDMOTHER

82
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,850
AND MY MOM WITH
WHATEVER ABILITIES
SHE HAS,

83
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,850
BUT I HAVE
ALWAYS WONDERED

84
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,950
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
TO HAVE A FRIEND

85
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,550
WHO SAW WHAT I SAW,
WHO FELT WHAT I FELT.

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,050
WELL, I MEAN,
THIS IS WEIRD, MEL.

87
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,250
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
THAT THERE ARE
2 PEOPLE LIKE...

88
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,750
IN GRANDVIEW?

89
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,450
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
I'M ALL QUESTIONS
RIGHT NOW,

90
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,750
AND I HAVE TO TALK
TO THIS GUY.

91
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,650
I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO THAT FUNERAL HOME
TOMORROW

92
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,750
AND SEE IF THEY AT LEAST
HAVE A GUEST BOOK
THAT I CAN LOOK AT.

93
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,750
I'M NEVER GONNA
SLEEP TONIGHT.

94
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,050
WHAT?

95
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,850
WHO ARE YOU?

96
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,050
WAIT. I REMEMBER YOU.

97
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,650
YOU WERE ON THE PLANE.

98
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,650
I MADE A MISTAKE.

99
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,750
I KNOW.
YOU DIDN'T CROSS OVER.

100
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,650
DON'T LET THEM
FIND ME.

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,650
WE CALL IT THE HAROLD
AND MAUDE SYNDROME,

102
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,450
FROM THE MOVIE--

103
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,750
PEOPLE WHO HANG AROUND
WAKES AND FUNERALS.

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,750
SO HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE?

105
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,050
I'VE SEEN HIM
A BUNCH OF TIMES,

106
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,950
AT THE CEMETERY, TOO.

107
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,550
UM, HAS HE EVER
SPOKEN TO YOU?

108
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,550
ONCE OR TWICE.
NICE GUY.

109
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,650
SEEMS HARMLESS.

110
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,650
DAMN.

111
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,650
WOULD YOU MIND?

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,450
SO WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

113
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,750
OH, YOU KNOW,
THE USUAL QUESTIONS.

114
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,950
DID I KNOW I WAS DEAD?

115
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,950
HOW DID I DIE? DO I KNOW
OTHER DEAD PEOPLE?

116
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,850
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

117
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,550
I SAID, "LOOK,
I LIKE IT HERE.

118
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,650
"I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LEAVING.

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
"YOU WANNA BE
A DO-GOODER,

120
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,250
"GO HELP THAT CONFUSED
OLD LADY OVER THERE

121
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,950
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE'S DEAD, POOR THING."

122
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,950
COULD I CHECK
YOUR GUEST BOOK?

123
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,950
SURE.

124
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,350
SO DOES HE EVER KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE BEING WAKED?

125
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,350
I DON'T THINK SO.

126
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,750
AND IT'S USUALLY
YOUNG ONES.

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,350
HE NEVER
PAYS MUCH ATTENTION
TO THE OLD PEOPLE.

128
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,350
I JUST DON'T GET
ALL THIS FASCINATION
WITH THE DEAD.

129
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,950
FOR ME, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE BEING ALIVE,

130
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,050
EXCEPT A LOT
LESS EXPENSIVE,

131
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,550
AND I NEVER GET ASKED
FOR DIRECTIONS.

132
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,650
THAT ALONE WAS ALMOST
WORTH KEELING OVER FOR.

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,350
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

134
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,450
OH. UH, I REALIZED THAT
I FORGOT TO SIGN THE BOOK

135
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,950
YESTERDAY, SO...

136
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,550
LOOK AT THAT. DONE.

137
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, BUSTER.

138
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,650
WHEN I RAN THIS PLACE,
THERE WAS NEVER ONE CROOKED TIE.

139
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,250
I AM SICK OF DOING YOUR JOB,
SICK OF IT.

140
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,550
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH.

141
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,050
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN.

142
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,250
I RECOMMEND IT
FOR YOUR NEXT CLASS.

143
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,150
HOW ARE YOU NOT JUMPING
OUT OF YOUR SKIN
OVER THIS?

144
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,750
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS GUY, OK?

145
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,850
HE COULD BE A FRIEND OR A FOE.
IT COULD BE A HOAX.

146
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,450
HOAX? HOAX? MELINDA,
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

147
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,250
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE
ALL THOSE FRIGHTENED
LITTLE PEOPLE

148
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,450
THAT HAVE DOUBTED YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

149
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,550
UHH. YOU WERE ONE OF
THOSE NOT TOO LONG AGO.

150
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,350
I'M A SCIENTIST.
IT'S MY JOB TO DOUBT YOU

151
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,850
AND BE FRIGHTENED ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S MY JOB.

152
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,050
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
WHEN I DOUBTED YOU,

153
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,250
MY LIFE WAS A LOT SIMPLER.
DOUBT WAS MY FRIEND.

154
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,450
DOUBT WAS YOUR CRUTCH.

155
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,550
ARE WE GONNA FIND
THIS GHOST GUY,

156
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,350
OR ARE WE GONNA WRITE
BUMPER STICKERS?

157
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,850
I'M TRYING TO FIND HIM,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

158
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,950
ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT
HIS NAME IS GABRIEL,

159
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,150
AND HE LIKES TO HANG OUT
AT FUNERAL HOMES
AND CEMETERIES.

160
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,350
OH, GREAT. SO HE DOESN'T
HAVE A LOT OF COLORFUL CLOTHING.

161
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,550
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.
WHAT ELSE?

162
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,850
WHY WOULD A GUY
LIKE THIS POP UP
IN GRANDVIEW?

163
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,650
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I WANNA FIND OUT.

164
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,650
MAYBE YOU GUYS WERE
MEANT TO FIND EACH OTHER
FOR SOME REASON.

165
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,350
FOR WHAT REASON?

166
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,150
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO FIND HIM
CHEERIER HOBBIES.

167
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,450
OK, LOOK, IN CASE
THIS GUY TURNS OUT
TO BE THE REAL DEAL,

168
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,450
WILL YOU JUST LOOK THIS
STUFF UP FOR ME, OK?

169
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,150
SAME ABILITY,
SAME PLACE, SAME TIME.

170
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,550
YES, I WILL,
BUT LISTEN. THE SECOND
YOU FIND THIS GUY,

171
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,550
YOU BRING HIM
RIGHT HERE IMMEDIATELY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

172
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,050
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'LL DO.

173
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,550
WERE YOU BEING SARCASTIC?

174
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,950
WAS THAT SARCA--

175
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,850
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

176
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,350
YOU'RE WELCOME.

177
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,750
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

178
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,050
SORRY I'M LATE.

179
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,950
IS EVERYTHING OK?

180
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,050
YEAH, I WAS JUST
A LITTLE DISTRACTED.
HOW ARE YOU?

181
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,750
GOOD. HEY, YOU KNOW,
WE NEVER REALLY GOT A CHANCE

182
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,550
TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

183
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,750
WEIRD, HUH?

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,650
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THE GHOST OF JAKE'S WIFE
WAS AT THE WAKE,

185
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,350
LIKE LITERALLY IN THE ROOM.

186
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,850
YEAH. GHOSTS USUALLY
GO TO THEIR WAKES
AND FUNERALS.

187
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,950
THEY LIKE TO SEE
WHO CAME, CHECK OUT
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE--

188
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,150
HAIR, CLOTHING,
THE WHOLE DEAL.

189
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,850
REALLY?

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,450
UH-HUH.

191
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,950
AND YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE CONVERSATIONS

192
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,650
LIKE WE'RE HAVING
RIGHT NOW?

193
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,550
DELIA, WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THIS?

194
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,850
YOU KNOW THAT IT
MAKES YOU CRAZY.

195
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,750
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN
I THINK ABOUT GHOSTS AND,
YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THAT,

196
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,750
I IMAGINE THEM
TO BE KIND OF CLOUDY,
TRANSPARENT PEOPLE

197
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,250
DRAGGING CHAINS, YOU KNOW.

198
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,150
I GET SOME OF THOSE,
TOO, BELIEVE ME.

199
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,750
I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

200
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,550
I NEED HELP.
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

201
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,550
WHO ARE YOU? YOU'RE NOT
THE ONE WHO CAN HELP ME.

202
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,050
I CAN HELP YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE TO
LET ME.

203
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,650
THERE'S A BETTER PLACE
FOR YOU.

204
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,450
I CAN HELP YOU
GET THERE,

205
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,750
BUT YOU
HAVE TO WANT IT.

206
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,550
SHE'S THE ONE.

207
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,350
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO CAN HELP ME.

208
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,650
OH, HI.

209
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,150
DIDN'T SEE YOU
STANDING THERE.

210
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,050
YOU MUST THINK
I'M CRAZY.

211
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,950
SOMETIMES
I TALK TO MYSELF.

212
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,950
GOOD WAY TO GET
LOCKED UP, RIGHT?

213
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,150
DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT?

214
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,150
DO YOU SEE IT?

215
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,750
I'M NOT SURE.

216
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,450
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE WAY.

217
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,850
I CAN'T GET CLOSE.

218
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,550
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE
WAITING FOR YOU,

219
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
LIKE FAMILY OR--

220
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,750
NO. THEY'RE NOT.

221
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,850
TELL ME
WHAT YOU CAN SEE.

222
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,950
HEY, YOU CAN'T JUST
WALK OFF LIKE THAT.

223
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,950
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHO ARE YOU?

224
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,850
MY NAME IS MELINDA GORDON.
WHO ARE YOU?

225
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,050
GABRIEL LAWRENCE.
SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.

226
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,650
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU AND ME HAVE SOMETHING

227
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,350
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

228
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,850
????

229
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,850
SO WHERE DID YOU LIVE
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE?

230
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,350
DENVER. YEAH, A SMALL
NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED ROSEMONT.

231
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,950
WHEN MY PARENTS DIED,
MY UNCLE JOHN TOOK ME IN.

232
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,450
WE TRAVELED ALL OVER,
EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD.

233
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,950
DID YOUR UNCLE KNOW?

234
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,650
NO, NO. I REALIZED
PRETTY FAST

235
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,550
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING
I HAD TO KEEP TO MYSELF,

236
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,250
AND SO STOPPED TRYING,
LEARNED TO LIVE WITH IT.

237
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,150
BESIDES, I DIDN'T CARE
IF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD ME.

238
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,350
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY
TRUSTED THE LIVING ANYWAY.

239
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,250
THE DEAD MADE
MUCH BETTER FRIENDS.

240
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,350
SO DID YOU HAVE, UH,
REGULAR DEAD FRIENDS?

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,350
ABSOLUTELY.

242
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,650
WHEN I WAS A KID,

243
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,050
I'D INVITE
MY GHOST FRIENDS
FOR SLEEPOVERS.

244
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,050
AWW.

245
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,150
AWW. YEAH. HEH.

246
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,150
YEAH, I TOOK 'EM
WITH ME TO SCHOOL,

247
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,650
CAMPING, TRIPS.

248
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,150
I'D CRY WHEN THEY WOULD
FINALLY CROSS OVER.

249
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,650
I WISHED THEY WOULD STAY
WITH ME FOREVER.

250
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,950
I WAS AFRAID
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.

251
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,650
I--I MEAN,
NOT THE GHOSTS,

252
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,750
BUT I WAS AFRAID
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD THINK.

253
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,850
ME, TOO.

254
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,350
YOU TELL PEOPLE ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT--

255
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,450
YOU'RE A THIEF, UH,
YOU HAVE A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE,

256
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,850
YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE--
BUT NOTHING QUITE MATCHES

257
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,450
THE LOOK YOU GET WHEN YOU
SAY YOU CAN SEE GHOSTS, RIGHT?

258
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,250
EXACTLY.

259
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,350
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE
ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU'RE
AFTER SOMETHING.

260
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,450
ARE YOU AFTER SOMETHING,
GABRIEL?

261
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,750
I MEAN, COME ON.

262
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,450
THE TWO OF US LIVING
IN THE SAME TOWN.

263
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,450
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT.

264
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,250
MAYBE, BUT I HAVE A DIFFERENT
WEIRD THRESHOLD THAN MOST.

265
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,750
WELL, DON'T YOU?

266
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,550
HAVE YOU NOTICED A SHIFT
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD?

267
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,650
IS THIS A TEST?

268
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,950
MAYBE.

269
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,550
UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVE,

270
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,650
LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING STRONGER.

271
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,850
YOU FELT IT, TOO?

272
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,250
YEAH. THEY CAN DO MORE.

273
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,050
IT'S LIKE THEY
CAN AFFECT US IN WAYS
THEY COULDN'T BEFORE.

274
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,450
LIKE THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

275
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,150
LOOK, WHEN THAT PLANE
CAME DOWN, THERE WAS...

276
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,350
A VERY DARK SPIRIT HERE
WHO WAS TRYING TO GET

277
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,150
AS MANY SOULS
AS POSSIBLE
TO STAY EARTHBOUND.

278
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,350
HE WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE
A LOT OF SOULS,

279
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,650
INCLUDING HER,
THAT THEY BELONGED HERE,

280
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,150
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING
THEY WERE MEANT TO DO.

281
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,150
NOW SHE'S TERRIFIED
OF CROSSING OVER.

282
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,450
I JUST THINK SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WHO TO TRUST.

283
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,950
THERE'S SOMETHING
KEEPING HER
FROM CROSSING.

284
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,150
MAYBE SHE COULD
TALK TO ME AGAIN,

285
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,350
YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I KNOW--

286
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,850
US. MAYBE SHE
COULD TALK TO US.

287
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,750
I'M NOT TRYING TO
TAKE OVER YOUR CORNER.

288
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,750
I DON'T HAVE A CORNER.

289
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,150
I JUST HAVE HISTORY
WITH THIS SPIRIT.

290
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,650
WELL, STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

291
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,050
ARE YOU GONNA GET THAT?

292
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,250
[RING]
RICK.

293
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,850
RICK.

294
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,550
RICK
[RING]
YES.

295
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,550
YES, YES.

296
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,650
YES. HELLO.

297
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,850
I MET HIM.

298
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,850
YEP. HE WAS
AT OUR HOUSE.

299
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,150
SEEMS GREAT...

300
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,050
FUNNY, SMART.

301
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,550
YEAH, YEAH. AND HE'S
A DOUBLE CAPRICORN.

302
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,650
HE LIKES LONG WALKS
ON THE BEACH.

303
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,550
SKIP THE PERSONAL AD.
IS HE THE REAL DEAL
OR NOT?

304
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,450
I THINK SO.

305
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,350
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

306
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,050
JUST COMPARE NOTES,
TALK SHOP?

307
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,050
IN A WAY.

308
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,950
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
TOTALLY TRUST HIM YET.

309
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,350
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A WEIRD
THING ABOUT COINCIDENCES.

310
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,950
YOU'RE SO SUSPICIOUS.

311
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,850
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.

312
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,350
THEN AGAIN, THAT'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT ME, SO...

313
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,350
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED,

314
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,350
PLANE CRASH SITE
TOMORROW NIGHT,

315
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,550
SEE IF WE CAN FIND
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

316
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,250
TOMORROW NIGHT.

317
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,350
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

318
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,350
OF GOING OUT WITH HER
TOMORROW NIGHT, ARE YOU?

319
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,750
I CAN'T GO TOMORROW NIGHT.
I HAVE A LECTURE.

320
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,750
OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

321
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,050
WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT INVITED, EITHER.

322
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,350
HEH HEH. I'LL LET YOU
KNOW HOW IT GOES.
GOOD NIGHT.

323
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,550
GOOD NIGHT.

324
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,650
[SIGHS] IT'S WEIRD
BEING UP HERE AGAIN.

325
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,550
Gabriel:
THINK SHE'LL BE HERE?

326
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,150
I LIKE TO GO BACK
TO THE BEGINNING,

327
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,650
WHERE THEY DIED.

328
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,150
HMM. SORT OF LIKE ME
IN THAT WAY--

329
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,850
GO AFTER THEM,
TRY TO HELP 'EM.

330
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,350
I DON'T EXACTLY
GO AFTER THEM.

331
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,350
THEY USUALLY
COME TO ME.

332
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,050
I LIKE FINDING THEM.
I LIKE CHASING THEM, TOO.

333
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,150
SOMETIMES I COMPETE
WITH MYSELF,

334
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
HOW MANY CAN I SEND OFF
IN ONE NIGHT.

335
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,350
YOUR HUSBAND'S A GOOD MAN.

336
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,950
HE UNDERSTANDS YOU.

337
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,250
YEAH. I'M VERY LUCKY.

338
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,350
HMM. NEVER KNOWN ANYONE
I COULD TRUST THAT WAY.

339
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,850
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

340
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,950
WHERE?

341
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,050
TO THAT PLACE
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

342
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
I THINK IT WAS HELL
OR SOMETHING.

343
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750
ARE THERE SPIRITS
STILL BLOCKING THE LIGHT?

344
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,650
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

345
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,150
OR SOMEONE
WHO YOU NEED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO.

346
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,450
THERE'S NO ONE.

347
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,150
YOU MUST HAVE
SOME FAMILY.

348
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,450
I NEVER WANTED
ANY OF THAT.

349
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,550
HOW ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS?

350
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,950
THEY WANTED ME TO BE
JUST LIKE THEM,

351
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,450
TO NEVER LEAVE,

352
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,650
AND I WOULDN'T,
SO NOW THEY HATE ME.

353
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,050
NO, THEY DON'T.

354
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,150
THEY DO, BECAUSE I LEFT,
AND I DIED.

355
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,450
AMY, I KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE ALONE,

356
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,250
TO HAVE NO ATTACHMENTS,
NO ONE PULLING
ON YOUR HEART.

357
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,450
YOU AND I ARE MORE ALIKE
THAN YOU KNOW.

358
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,050
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING LONELY
AND BEING ALONE,

359
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,850
AM I RIGHT?

360
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,150
YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE

361
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,050
THAT YOU DON'T
WANNA BE ALONE
LIKE THAT ANYMORE,

362
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,850
AND WHATEVER BLOCKS
THE LIGHT NOW WILL MOVE.

363
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,850
AMY, I CAN
SHOW YOU A PLACE

364
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,050
WHERE YOU'LL
BE VERY HAPPY.

365
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,450
WHO'S THAT?

366
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,550
PLEASE DON'T
LET THEM FIND ME.

367
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,950
GABRIEL!

368
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,150
GABRIEL!

369
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,950
! 
STOP IT!
HE'S MY FRIEND!

370
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,850
Rick: LOOK,
I'M SORRY. I...

371
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,750
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
SCARE YOU OFF. I JUST--
I COULDN'T RESIST.

372
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,650
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

373
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,950
IT'S A KIRLIAN CAMERA.

374
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,150
IT MEASURES AURAS.
IT'S NOTHING.

375
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,950
THAT'S PROPERTY
OF THE UNIVERSITY.

376
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,750
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF A JOKE, HUH?!

377
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,350
SOME KIND OF CHEAP TRICK?!

378
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,050
LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
GONNA BE HERE, I SWEAR.

379
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,550
NOW YOU KNOW WHY
I PREFER THE DEAD.

380
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,250
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT I SAW.

381
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FOLLOWED ME.
WHAT ARE YOU, 12?

382
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,150
IT WAS IN THE NAME
OF SCIENCE.

383
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,050
LISTEN, MY LECTURE
LET OUT AT 5:00, SO--

384
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,850
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS MAKES ME LOOK LIKE?

385
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,650
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

386
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,450
I WAS RUNNING
LIKE A GIRL,
HOLDING THIS CAMERA.

387
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,350
I FELL DOWN.
THAT GUY GRABBED ME,
AND HE ALMOST--

388
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,950
THANK GOODNESS HE DIDN'T
BREAK THIS CAMERA,

389
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,350
'CAUSE THIS THING
IS NOT CHEAP, AND I AM.

390
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,050
DID YOU NOTICE HE'S GOT
QUITE A TEMPER ON HIM?

391
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,050
YEAH. YOU ALWAYS SEEM
TO BRING OUT THE BEST
IN PEOPLE.

392
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,350
YEAH, I CONSIDER
MYSELF SORT OF
LIKE A TRUTH SERUM,

393
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,850
EXCEPT WITHOUT
THE NEEDLES OR
THE C.I.A.

394
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,350
ALL RIGHT, LUCKILY,
I ALWAYS KEEP A BACKUP.

395
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,150
YOU REMEMBER OUR FRIEND,
KIRLIAN CAMERA?

396
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,350
YEAH. IT READS AURAS.

397
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,550
ENERGY FIELDS, LIKE
THE KINDS YOUR FRIENDS
THE SPIRITS GIVE OFF.

398
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,150
HERE YOU GO.

399
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,450
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS
WHAT THOSE ARE?

400
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,550
UM, SPIRITS.

401
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,050
YEAH. SPIRITS.
SPIRITS! THIS PLACE
IS LOUSY WITH 'EM!

402
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,850
YEAH. IT'S A HAUNTED FIELD.

403
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,250
THERE ARE LOTS OF SPIRITS
THAT DIDN'T CROSS OVER
IN THE PLANE CRASH.

404
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,650
OH, WELL, HOW COME
KIRLIAN CAN SEE THEM ALL
AND YOU CAN'T?

405
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,550
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THAT SEES ENERGY,

406
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,050
AND SPIRITS
CAN CHOOSE TO MANIFEST.

407
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,450
I CAN'T MAKE THEM
SHOW THEMSELVES.

408
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,250
ALL RIGHT. REALLY?
WELL, UH, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

409
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,950
HERE YOU GO.

410
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,950
LOOK AT THESE ORBS
AROUND HIM.

411
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,350
THEY FOLLOW HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES.

412
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,750
THEY'RE ATTACHED TO HIM.
WHEN--WHEN HE CHASED ME,

413
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,850
THEY CAME WITH HIM.

414
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,650
LOOK AT THAT.
THOSE ARE HIS GHOSTS.

415
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,650
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE
FOR LAST NIGHT.

416
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,650
I SORT OF, UH, LOST IT,

417
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,450
AND, UM, I WANT US
TO START OVER AGAIN.

418
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,050
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO SEE FIRST.

419
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,850
THEY'RE SPIRITS.

420
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,450
ATTACHED TO YOU.

421
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,450
H-HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY'RE NOT ATTACHED TO YOU?

422
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,850
STOP PLAYING WITH ME.

423
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,850
WHY DON'T YOU TRUST ME?
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

424
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,850
BUT YOU DON'T.

425
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,850
WHY DID YOU COME
TO GRANDVIEW?

426
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,450
DID YOU KNOW
THAT I WAS HERE?

427
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,450
I CAME HERE BECAUSE
I FELT I HAD TO BE HERE.

428
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,050
I WAS DRAWN HERE.

429
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,150
MAYBE IT WAS YOU.

430
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,750
OR MAYBE IT WAS THEM.

431
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,650
MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE
I FEEL I CAN HELP HERE.

432
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,450
LOOK, WE HAVE TO WORK
TOGETHER.

433
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,750
ALL RIGHT, WE WERE BOTH
PUT HERE FOR A REASON.

434
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,750
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS.

435
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,750
HOW?

436
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,650
FIND YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANT,

437
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,650
AND WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT SHE SEES ON HER SIDE.

438
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,850
IF YOU WANNA WORK WITH ME,

439
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,750
MEET ME TONIGHT
AT THE FUNERAL HOME AT 9:00.

440
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,750
MAYBE I WAS TOO HARD
ON GABRIEL.

441
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,550
I MEAN, HE DOES TRY
TO HELP SPIRITS.

442
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,050
HE EVEN GOES
AND LOOKS FOR THEM,

443
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,950
UNLIKE ME, WHO TRIES
TO AVOID THEM
WHENEVER I CAN.

444
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,050
THAT'S BECAUSE...

445
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,050
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE.

446
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,350
WHO AM I TO JUDGE HIM...

447
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,550
OR NOT TO TRUST HIM?

448
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,650
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO THIS GUY REALLY IS?

449
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,650
HAVE YOU CHECKED ON HIM?

450
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,950
THERE'S
NO PHONE LISTING.

451
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,250
NOT HERE, BEFORE THAT,
UH, BEFORE GRANDVIEW.

452
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,450
DIDN'T HE, UH--DIDN'T HE
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DENVER?

453
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,950
YEAH. HE SAID HE LIVED
WITH HIS UNCLE.

454
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,350
HE TOLD ME HIS NAME,
BUT...

455
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,750
JOHN.

456
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,050
RIGHT. RIGHT.

457
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,650
HEH.
JOHN.

458
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,450
OK. THERE'S ONLY
ONE JOHN LAWRENCE,

459
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,150
AND HE'S A DOCTOR
AND THE DIRECTOR
AT ROSEMONT HOSPITAL.

460
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,650
ROSEMONT.

461
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,850
THAT'S WHERE GABRIEL
SAID HE LIVED.

462
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,350
I--I REALIZE IT'S JUST ABOUT
QUITTING TIME WHERE YOU ARE,

463
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,750
BUT I REALLY NEED
TO SPEAK TO DR. LAWRENCE.

464
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,050
IT'S URGENT
THAT I SPEAK WITH HIM.

465
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,650
I PROMISE THAT I'LL
BE VERY BRIEF.

466
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,550
I THOUGHT SO.

467
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,650
THANK YOU, YES.
I WILL HOLD.

468
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,050
ISN'T IT A LITTLE LATE?

469
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,850
I'M SORRY.
IT'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

470
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,250
Receptionist: OK, SIR.
I'LL CONNECT YOU NOW.

471
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,550
ISN'T THIS WHAT
YOU HAVE AN OFFICE F--

472
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,450
THANK YOU.
Man: HELLO.

473
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,650
UH, DR. LAWRENCE.
YES. WHO IS THIS?

474
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,250
HI. UH, MY NAME IS
PROFESSOR RICHARD PAYNE,

475
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,750
ROCKLAND UNIVERSITY.
YOUR NEPHEW GABRIEL LAWRENCE

476
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,250
APPLIED FOR A JOB HERE
IN MY BUILDING,

477
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,450
SO I WANTED TO CALL AND
ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS,

478
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,550
JUST SO I COULD FILL IN
SOME OF THE BLANKS
ON HIS APPLICATION.

479
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,250
I DON'T HAVE A NEPHEW.

480
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,550
WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
WHAT MY PAPERS HERE TELL ME.

481
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,850
IT SAYS GABRIEL LAWRENCE
IS YOUR NEPHEW.

482
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,250
HE'S MID-TWENTIES, HE'S DARK,

483
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,950
AND YOU RAISED HIM FROM
THE TIME HE WAS 9 YEARS OLD.

484
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,450
I THINK YOU MIGHT
BE TALKING ABOUT
GABRIEL HASTINGS.

485
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,550
HE'S NOT MY NEPHEW.
HE WAS MY PATIENT.

486
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,050
SORRY, DID YOU SAY,
"PATIENT"?

487
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,150
THIS IS
A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

488
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,050
HE CAME TO US
AS A CHILD.

489
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,550
HE BASICALLY
GREW UP HERE.

490
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,550
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
SAY TOO MUCH.

491
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,550
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DOCTOR, I THINK I HAVE

492
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,650
EVERY RIGHT IN THE WORLD
TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

493
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,450
THE PERSON I'M ABOUT
TO HIRE IS DANGEROUS.

494
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,850
HE WAS SEVERELY
DELUSIONAL AS A CHILD,

495
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,250
CAME A LONG WAY,

496
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,550
AND HE WAS RELEASED
TO HIS OWN CUSTODY

497
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,650
WHEN HE BECAME AN ADULT.

498
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,750
THAT'S REALLY
ALL I CAN SAY.

499
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,050
PLEASE TELL HIM
TO CALL ME.

500
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,850
WILL DO. THANK YOU.
BYE-BYE.

501
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,750
SO MUCH FOR UNCLE JOHN.

502
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,750
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

503
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,250
THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN ME--

504
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,750
SEVERELY DELUSIONAL,
KID THAT SEES GHOSTS.

505
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,650
I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE
THERE ARE LIKE THAT,

506
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,750
YOU KNOW, WHO JUST
GET PUT AWAY BECAUSE OF
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

507
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,050
MELINDA, THIS IS
NOTHING LIKE YOU, OK?

508
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,250
THIS GUY WENT PSYCHO
BECAUSE HE SAW GHOSTS.

509
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,950
I KNOW. I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE.

510
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,650
AND I HAVE TO TALK
TO HIM, 'CAUSE MAYBE
I CAN HELP HIM.

511
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,150
NO. NO, I FORBID IT.

512
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,550
NO, YOU CANNOT. THIS ISN'T
A STRAY DOG, MELINDA.

513
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,850
THIS GUY'S TROUBLE, OK?

514
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,450
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.
I'M THIRSTY.

515
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,350
I'M REALLY THIRSTY.
WHO WANTS A DRINK?

516
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,650
NOT ME.

517
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,350
I WILL.

518
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,750
HE'S VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

519
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,050
I REMEMBER WHEN
HE USED TO BE
THAT CONCERNED ABOUT ME.

520
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,250
MUST'VE LASTED, OH,
AT LEAST THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

521
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,250
MMM, I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT WHAT IT SEEMS.

522
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,750
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

523
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,650
DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER NOW ANYWAY.

524
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,750
SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT STEP?

525
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,850
YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

526
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,050
BUT WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR WIFE WAS DEAD?

527
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,850
BECAUSE I DON'T
DEAL WITH IT VERY WELL.

528
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,350
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO.

529
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,950
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

530
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,750
IT'S NOTHING.
SHE DIED IN HER SLEEP.

531
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,950
THAT IS SO HIM.

532
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,050
I WAS KILLED DRIVING
PAST A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

533
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,250
A CRANE COLLAPSED
ONTO MY CAR.

534
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,250
I WAS TRAPPED
FOR OVER 2 HOURS,

535
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,350
AND I DIED JUST BEFORE
THEY CUT ME FREE, BUT...

536
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,850
IT'S TOO TOUGH FOR HIM
TO THINK ABOUT.

537
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,250
SHE'S HERE.

538
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,050
WHY?

539
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,650
I KEPT A JOURNAL.

540
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,150
THIRD SHELF
BEHIND THE TEXTBOOKS.

541
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,250
HE--HE SHOULD READ IT.

542
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,450
SHE HAS A JOURNAL,
THIRD SHELF.

543
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,150
SHE WANTS YOU
TO READ IT.

544
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,850
I KNEW IT.

545
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,750
[SIGHS] I JUST KNEW IT.

546
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,350
THINGS HAVE BEEN
MOVING AROUND FOR MONTHS,

547
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,450
AND I--I HEAR HER.

548
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,950
I SMELL HER PERFUME
WHEN I COME HOME SOMETIMES.

549
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,750
JUST MAKE SURE
HE READS IT.

550
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,550
THERE ARE THINGS
HE SHOULD KNOW.

551
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,050
SHE'S GONE.

552
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,050
SHE REALLY
WANTS YOU TO READ
THAT JOURNAL, OK?

553
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,250
YOU CALL ME
IF YOU NEED TO.

554
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,350
Help me!

555
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,550
HEY, GLAD YOU MADE IT.

556
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,650
SO MUCH THAT'S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

557
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,750
IT'S A GREAT PARTY, HUH?

558
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,450
MISS, PLEASE.

559
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,650
WHERE YOU BEEN?

560
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,050
YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON
I WISH I WASN'T DEAD.

561
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,150
I'M NOT CROSSING OVER!

562
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,750
PARTY!

563
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,250
SO HOW LONG
YOU BEEN DEAD?

564
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,850
YOU STOOD ME UP.

565
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,750
WHAT IS THIS?

566
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,150
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH ALL THESE SPIRITS?

567
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,350
HAVING FUN.
THEY'RE MY FAMILY.

568
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,250
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

569
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,950
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP THEM
ALL TRAPPED HERE.

570
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,150
TRAPPED? THEY'RE
ANYTHING BUT TRAPPED.

571
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,550
THEY'RE MORE FREE
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

572
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,650
YOU LIED TO ME.

573
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,350
DID I?

574
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,950
YEAH. I SPOKE TO
YOUR UNCLE JOHN,

575
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,050
WHO WAS NEVER YOUR UNCLE.

576
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,950
AH. SO WHAT?

577
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,250
YOU WOULD LIE, TOO,
IN MY PLACE.

578
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,050
NO, I WOULDN'T.

579
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,350
COME ON, MELINDA.

580
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,650
THIS THING WE DO
MAKES US LIARS.

581
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,550
YOU LIE
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

582
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,650
EVERY TIME
YOU MAKE AN EXCUSE

583
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,150
FOR WHY YOU'RE
TALKING TO YOURSELF

584
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,450
OR WHEN YOU
BACKPEDAL TO EXPLAIN

585
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,950
HOW YOU
KNOW SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T

586
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,950
OR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
RIGHT AT SOMEBODY THAT
NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE.

587
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,050
LYING IS
SECOND NATURE TO US.

588
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,550
LYING...

589
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,750
IS SURVIVAL.

590
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,950
HEH.

591
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,850
IS THAT WHAT GOT YOU
OUT OF THE INSTITUTION?

592
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,750
Lying?

593
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,250
YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS.

594
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,450
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

595
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,150
I DIDN'T GROW UP WITH
A FAMILY LIKE YOURS.

596
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,150
I DON'T HAVE A PARTNER
LIKE YOU HAVE.

597
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,550
MY SUPPORT SYSTEM
WAS A TRAY OF MEDS

598
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,650
TO MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY.

599
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,150
LOOK, YOU OWE IT TO THEM
TO CROSS THEM OVER.

600
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,350
AND YOU OWE IT
TO THE FAMILIES--

601
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,450
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I OWE THE LIVING.

602
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,050
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
ONE LIVING PERSON

603
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,650
WHO MADE ME FEEL
I WAS WORTH ANYTHING,

604
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,750
WHO MADE ME FEEL
I WASN'T JUST SOME NUT
TO BE LOCKED AWAY.

605
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,050
I'M HERE FOR THE DEAD,
NOT THE LIVING.

606
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,950
THEY KNOW
THEY CAN TRUST ME,

607
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,350
AND THEY KNOW
I TRUST THEM.

608
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,050
THIS ISN'T JUST
SOME LONELY HEARTS
CLUB, MELINDA.

609
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,550
WE'RE GETTING READY.

610
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,450
FOR WHAT?

611
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,450
FOR WHAT'S COMING.

612
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,650
WE'RE BLOCKING
THE LIGHT,

613
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,050
AND SOON NO ONE'S
GONNA GET THROUGH.

614
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,550
THESE AREN'T
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
GHOSTS ANYMORE.

615
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,050
WE'RE KINDRED SOULS,
YOU AND I,

616
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,450
2 SIDES
OF THE SAME COIN.

617
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,050
JUST IMAGINE
HOW POWERFUL WE'D BE
IF WE LINKED UP.

618
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,350
OR YOU COULD
JUST RISK LOSING
EVERYTHING.

619
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,150
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

620
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,950
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE YOUR LIFE.

621
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,250
WHY DO YOU THINK WE MET?

622
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,250
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

623
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,550
THIS CAN'T BE
AN ACCIDENT.

624
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,550
Amy: PLEASE TAKE ME
OUT OF HERE.

625
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,350
DO YOU SEE A LIGHT?

626
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,350
NO.

627
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,950
WELL, LOOK FOR IT.

628
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,150
YOU HAVE TO WANT IT.

629
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,450
I SEE IT.

630
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,450
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE
IN FRONT OF IT.

631
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,650
I CAN'T GET CLOSE.

632
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,950
I THINK THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SCARED AND CONFUSED.

633
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,050
THEY'RE USING IT
AGAINST YOU.

634
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,450
SO WHAT DO I DO?

635
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,250
CAN YOU
THINK OF ANYBODY,
LIKE A GRANDPARENT

636
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,750
OR FRIEND WHO MIGHT
STILL BE IN THE LIGHT?

637
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,350
I'VE NEVER REALLY
LOST ANYONE.

638
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,150
EVEN MY DOG
IS STILL ALIVE.

639
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,950
WOW.

640
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,650
UH, OK. WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

641
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,150
UM, WHY DON'T YOU
THINK OF YOURSELF
AS A LITTLE GIRL,

642
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,950
8 OR 9, YOU KNOW.
MAYBE--MAYBE IT'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

643
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,050
HEH. WE ALWAYS HAD
A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

644
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,550
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

645
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,450
YEAH, MY AUNTS AND UNCLES.

646
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,550
DO THEY MAKE YOU
FEEL SAFE AND LOVED?

647
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,950
YEAH. I LOOKED FORWARD
TO IT ALL DAY.

648
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,850
THEY'RE ALL
WATCHING ME NOW.

649
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,650
THEY'RE SMILING AT ME.

650
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,350
DO YOU FEEL
LIKE NOTHING BAD COULD
EVER HAPPEN TO YOU?

651
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,950
YEAH, LIKE THEY'RE ALWAYS
GONNA KEEP ME SAFE.

652
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,750
THEY LOVED ME SO MUCH.

653
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,050
THEY CAN'T BLOCK YOU
WHEN YOU FEEL
THOSE THINGS.

654
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,250
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY'RE STARTING TO MOVE.

655
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,450
THE LIGHT'S
GETTING BIGGER.

656
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,850
SO THERE'S NOTHING
STOPPING YOU NOW.

657
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,650
GO INTO IT.

658
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,450
WOW. IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

659
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,950
NOW I CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO SEE.

660
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,650
OK.

661
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,850
CROSSED HER OVER GOING 60, AND
NEVER TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS.

662
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,250
HOW'S THAT FOR YOUR
GRANDMOTHER'S GHOST, GABRIEL?

663
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,050
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME TONIGHT.

664
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,650
 ???

665
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,050
IT WAS RIGHT WHERE
SHE SAID IT WOULD BE.

666
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,050
FEEL FREE TO READ ALOUD.

667
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,550
"ALMOST TOLD HIM
TONIGHT,

668
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,050
"BUT I COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO DO IT.

669
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,450
"SHOULD I JUST LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING

670
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,650
"OR JUST LEAVE A NOTE?

671
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,150
WILL HE EVEN NOTICE?"

672
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,350
"I KEEP WAITING FOR HIM
TO TELL ME THAT HE KNOWS
ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

673
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,650
COULD IT BE
HE ACTUALLY DOESN'T?
IS HE THAT UNCONSCIOUS?"

674
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,450
IT GETS BETTER.

675
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,250
I AM SO SORRY.

676
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,050
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL
OF THIS UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

677
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,050
I THINK I WOULD HAVE
BEEN ALL RIGHT WITHOUT
THAT PIECE OF CLOSURE.

678
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,450
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING HAS
JUST TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

679
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,250
THINK GABRIEL
HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

680
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,950
I WENT TO GABRIEL'S
HOUSE TONIGHT,

681
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,150
AND HE HAD LIKE THIS--
I DON'T KNOW--

682
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,950
ARMY OF SOULS AT SOME
NEVER-ENDING PARTY.

683
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,750
I KNEW THE GHOSTS
THAT WERE THERE,

684
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,650
'CAUSE THEY HADN'T
CROSSED OVER.

685
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,050
WAS KATE THERE?

686
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,050
I DIDN'T SEE HER.

687
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,250
BUT THERE
WERE OTHERS, YOU KNOW,
FROM THE PLANE CRASH,

688
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,650
EVEN BEFORE THAT.

689
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,250
GHOSTS FROM THE PAST?

690
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,350
YES.

691
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,650
"WHEN THE FORGOTTEN RETURN."

692
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,050
"DEATH WILL BE
TWICE CLOSER."

693
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,150
UH, HELLO.
TRANSLATION?

694
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,650
IT'S THE 5 SIGNS--

695
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,450
THE--THE DEAD DOVE
ON THE DOORSTEP...

696
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,150
THE BEE...

697
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,050
WRITING ON JIM'S BACK.

698
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,650
WHAT IS IT, MEL?

699
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,150
AAH!

700
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,150
Melinda:
THE DEAD WILL WALK.

701
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,550
AND NOW THE FORGOTTEN
HAVE RETURNED.

702
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,450
WAIT. SO ALL 5
OF THOSE THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

703
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,550
NO, NOT ALL OF THEM.

704
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,650
NOT THE WRITING
ON YOUR BACK, <i>"MORS DILECTI."</i>

705
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,750
IT WAS LATIN. IT TRANSLATES
TO "DEATH OF A LOVED ONE."

706
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,150
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

707
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,550
WE HAVE TO GO AND
TALK TO GABRIEL.

708
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,750
YOU THINK KATE
WILL BE THERE?

709
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,150
I DON'T KNOW,

710
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,450
BUT HE BETTER TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON.

711
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,150
UPSTAIRS.

712
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,250
IN HERE.

713
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,750
WHOA.

714
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,950
HE'S BEEN WATCHING YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME.

715
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,150
Rick: COUPLE OF PICTURES OF
YOU UP HERE, JIM. FEW OF ME.

716
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,250
I'VE ALWAYS HATED
THAT PICTURE OF ME.

717
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,350
HE'S BEEN PLANNING THIS
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

718
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,450
THIS IS BIGGER
THAN JUST HIM.

719
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,450
I HEAR SOMEONE.

720
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,050
KATE.

721
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,950
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

722
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,350
SHE'S HERE?

723
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,950
HE USED ME.

724
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,350
WHO DID?

725
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,550
GABRIEL,
ALL OF THEM.

726
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,750
WHERE DID THEY GO?

727
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,350
I DON'T KNOW, BUT
THEY LEFT ME HERE.

728
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,850
WHY?

729
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,350
BECAUSE
I FEEL SO BAD
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

730
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,750
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE HURT YOU
LIKE THAT, RICK.

731
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,950
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE DIARY,

732
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,250
BUT THEY
WANTED ME TO.

733
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,050
SHE'S SAYING THAT GABRIEL
WANTED HER TO HURT YOU.

734
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,950
HE WANTS TO HURT
EVERYBODY WHO HELPS YOU.

735
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,150
WHY?

736
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,950
HE WANTS
TO MAKE YOU WEAK.

737
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,450
WHY IS HE
COLLECTING SOULS?

738
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,050
WHY DOES HE WANT THEM
TO STAY EARTHBOUND?

739
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,450
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

740
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,550
IT'S HAPPENING
ALL OVER.

741
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,850
THEY'RE PLANNING
SOMETHING.

742
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,850
WHO IS?

743
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,350
EVERYONE
ON THIS SIDE.

744
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,850
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

745
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,850
THEY WANT TO MAKE
THE DEAD STRONGER
THAN THE LIVING.

746
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,750
THEY WANT
TO TAKE OVER.

747
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,950
Rick: WHAT'S
HAPPENING, MELINDA?
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

748
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,750
WAIT.
SHE'LL TELL YOU.

749
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,050
I NEVER MEANT
FOR IT TO BE
THIS WAY, RICK.

750
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,250
I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU TELL HIM
I'M SORRY?

751
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,250
SHE'S SAYING
THAT SHE'S SORRY.

752
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,750
GABRIEL WANTED HER
TO HURT YOU

753
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,950
BECAUSE YOU'RE
CLOSE TO ME.

754
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,450
SO IT WAS ALL A LIE,
THEN, THE JOURNAL
AND THE AFFAIR.

755
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,450
NO.

756
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,050
NO, THAT'S TRUE,
AND I'M SORRY.

757
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,650
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON
SHE HAUNTED ME?

758
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,450
NO.

759
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,750
NO, NOT AT FIRST.

760
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,750
JUST MOVING THINGS AROUND,
MAKING NOISES,

761
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,150
I JUST FELT
LIKE I WAS GETTING MORE
OF YOUR ATTENTION DEAD

762
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,050
THAN I DID WHEN I WAS ALIVE.
I JUST--

763
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,850
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
HOW LONELY I FELT...

764
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,550
HOW MUCH I LOVED YOU

765
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,050
AND NEEDED YOU
AND HATED LOSING YOU.

766
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,250
AND THEN...

767
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,350
GABRIEL FOUND ME,

768
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,450
TOLD ME THAT I WAS
GONNA BE PUNISHED

769
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,350
FOR WHAT I'D DONE IF I
TRIED TO CROSS OVER.

770
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,750
HE SAID I SHOULD
STAY HERE AND HELP HIM.

771
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,750
HE SAID THEN THE PAIN
WOULD GO AWAY.

772
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,750
WHAT IS SHE SAYING NOW?

773
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,850
SHE WAS HAUNTING YOU
BECAUSE SHE WANTED YOU
TO PAY ATTENTION,

774
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,250
AND SHE KNOWS THAT SHE
MADE A MISTAKE,

775
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,950
AND SHE FEELS TERRIBLE
ABOUT IT,

776
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,850
AND THAT'S WHY GABRIEL
LEFT HER BEHIND.

777
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,650
HOW DID WE LET IT
GET TO THIS, RICK?

778
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,950
I DID LOVE YOU.

779
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,850
I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
I--I KNOW YOU DID.

780
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,350
HOW DID WE LOSE THAT?

781
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,750
WILL YOU...

782
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,650
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

783
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,350
SHE WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU CAN FORGIVE HER.

784
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,750
IT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS
TO FIND PEACE
AND CROSS OVER.

785
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,750
NO.

786
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,950
Melinda: WHAT?

787
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,550
NO.

788
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,350
I COULD SAY IT,
BUT I'D BE LYING.

789
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,150
I COULD SAY THE WORDS
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

790
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,650
YOU'LL NEVER GET
ANOTHER CHANCE LIKE THIS.

791
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,650
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

792
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,650
NO.

793
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,650
SHE SHOULD HAVE
COME TO ME.

794
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,750
WE SHOULD'VE
SPOKEN ABOUT IT.

795
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,650
SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN,
MELINDA. I JUST...

796
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,250
THERE'S TOO MUCH PAIN.

797
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,650
NO.

798
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:16,750
TELL HIM...

799
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,550
YOU TELL HIM
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT PAIN IS.

800
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,050
NONE OF YOU DO.

801
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,450
BUT YOU ALL WILL.

802
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,550
SHE'S GONE NOW,
ISN'T SHE?

803
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,750
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.
