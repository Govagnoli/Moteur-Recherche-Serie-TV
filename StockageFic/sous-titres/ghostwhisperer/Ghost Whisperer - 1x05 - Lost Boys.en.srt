1
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,150
My name
is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:13,550
I just got married.

3
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,650
Just moved to a small town.
Just opened up an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,450
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:21,450
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

6
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,583
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

7
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:26,184
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,450
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

9
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,783
The ones who have not
crossed over yet

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,084
because they have unfinished
business with the living,

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,317
and they come
to me for help.

12
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:38,650
To tell you my story,
i have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,950
It'll be a great chance for us
to break out and meet new people

14
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:47,150
and make new customers.

15
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:49,150
You do not have to be
the one standing up

16
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,284
in front of a jillion strangers.
You are gonna be great.

17
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,450
Besides, i set up
50 auctions in the city.

18
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,483
They're fun.
Where's the light?

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,950
Does all this junk
have to come out?

20
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,317
Yeah. Everything.

21
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,950
Look, i can get a pro
to do the auction,

22
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,783
but it's gonna
cost us so much.

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,950
And you're beautiful, and
everyone's gonna listen to you.

24
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:07,516
Then how come you don't listen
to me when i tell you no?

25
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,351
I'm listening to you. I'm just
not paying you any attention.

26
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,884
You're funny.

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,884
An auctioneer could be a cool
thing to have on my resume.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,783
Thank you.
You're gonna love it.

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,516
Ooh. Cool.

30
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,850
Creepy.

31
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,884
You smell smoke?

32
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,950
It's probably
the old furnace.

33
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,383
What was that?

34
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,884
You feel that?

35
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,450
Oh, god. What is it?

36
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:33,550
Rats.

37
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:36,017
Oh, i hate rats.

38
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:43,917
Ok. Uh, this will be me
calmly going back upstairs.

39
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,251
I know you're there.

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,017
This is our stuff.
Leave it be.

41
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,017
This is our stuff.
Leave it be.

42
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:26,017
Yeah. Who do you
think you are?

43
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:29,450
Now, get out of here before
we do something you don't like.

44
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:15,033
was it rats?

45
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,664
No. Little boys.
Ghost little boys?

46
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:19,888
One or two that
i saw and a dog.

47
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,854
A dog? A ghost pet?

48
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,854
They wanted us
out of there.

49
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,854
Works for me.
No, i'm serious.

50
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,355
It looks like they've
been here for a long time.

51
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,854
My grandma used
to always say

52
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,854
that if a child ghost
gets attached to a place,

53
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,754
it's really hard
to cross 'em over.

54
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,788
What do you do
if they won't leave?

55
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:37,155
Makes my job harder, but i
can't just leave 'em here.

56
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,788
They have to have somebody
waiting for them on the other side.

57
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,455
Good morning, ladies.
How's it going?

58
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,455
We're getting there.
It's a lot of stuff.

59
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,587
I don't believe
we've met.

60
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,788
I'm andrea moreno.
I'm melinda's partner.

61
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,788
Dirk abrams,

62
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,621
the last occupant
of kensington arms.

63
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,221
Mr. Abrams
is also the owner.

64
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:57,321
Former owner,
sorry to say.

65
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:59,621
Where did you
find this?

66
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,954
Oh, down
in the basement.

67
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,321
So was it a hotel
back then as well?

68
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,422
An orphanage.

69
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,621
It was an orphanage?

70
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:10,088
St. Michael's
home for boys.

71
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:13,021
Built in the '20s.

72
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:15,921
Wow. This place
has not changed a bit.

73
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,288
Oh, it has.

74
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,587
There was
a bad fire in 1956.

75
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:23,587
Destroyed
half the place.

76
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,854
Was anyone killed
in the fire?

77
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,321
Uh, several
young boys.

78
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,088
Uh, very sad.

79
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,921
It was a big story
around here

80
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,587
for a long time.

81
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,988
Andrea, why don't you
show mr. Abrams

82
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,321
everything that we brought up
so far, and i'll be right there.

83
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,522
Ok.

84
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:42,654
Uh, so... take a look.

85
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,455
All right.

86
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,888
* he played one *

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,221
* he played knickknack
on my thumb *

88
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,687
* with a knickknack
paddywhack, give a dog a bone *

89
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,788
* this old man
came rolling home *

90
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,788
* this old man
he played one *

91
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:57,721
* he played knickknack... *

92
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,455
oh!

93
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:03,321
Oh!

94
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:06,321
Here you go.

95
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,121
Ok.

96
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,687
Rat wants
to talk to you.

97
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,788
And who's rat?

98
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,088
You'll find out.

99
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,587
Follow me.

100
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,821
You, come here.

101
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,155
Excuse me?

102
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,554
We got ourselves
a problem here, lady.

103
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,854
Let's try names.
I'm melinda.

104
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:49,522
He's rat. I'm marty.

105
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:54,188
And victor's hiding
somewhere. That's what he does.

106
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,121
Who dialed your number?
Sorry, rat.

107
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,388
How come you can see us?

108
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,455
Um, it's a gift i have.
I was born with it.

109
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,921
Some gift.
What makes you think

110
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,455
you can just walk out
of here with our stuff?

111
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,455
It's not really your stuff.

112
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:11,921
It belongs to mr. Abrams, and he
hired us to auction it off for him.

113
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:15,554
Now, do you boys
understand why?

114
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,055
We know we're dead, lady.
We ain't stupid.

115
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,754
We are?

116
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,587
Shut up.

117
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,888
Look, we don't want
no action.

118
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:27,854
Auction.
Whatever.

119
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,422
This is our house. This is where
we live, and that's our furniture.

120
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,921
We want it back.
Now, run along.

121
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:37,388
You know, let me explain
something to you, r...

122
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,621
do i really need
to call him rat?

123
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:55,255
Ok.

124
00:06:57,288 --> 00:07:00,055
Man, i wish
i was there for that.

125
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,954
Now, wait. How is it they
can make things explode again?

126
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,788
They build up so much energy
that they can get really powerful.

127
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:08,587
Then...
they break things.

128
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,188
Great. Another fun fact
from melinda.

129
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:13,654
I'm gonna go back to the shop
with these guys and unload.

130
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,188
See you later.
Meet you down there.

131
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:16,954
Wait for me.

132
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,355
Excuse me, young lady.

133
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:27,355
May i ask
what you're doing?

134
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,587
And you are?

135
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,921
This is my property.
Oh. I'm sorry.

136
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,488
I'm melinda gordon.

137
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,522
We're getting ready
to have an auction.

138
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,155
Tobias northrop.

139
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,721
Oh. Hello.

140
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:39,721
Mr. Abrams has told me
a lot about you.

141
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:43,255
He said that you saw this place on the
internet and bought it over the phone.

142
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,587
I wanted to check
with mr. Abrams

143
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:48,921
and make sure he'll have
everything out by sunday.

144
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:52,088
We're right on schedule.
What are you gonna do with it?

145
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,721
Bed and breakfast?
I'm gonna tear it down.

146
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,121
But why?

147
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:57,988
Good day, miss gordon.

148
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,221
Go.

149
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:02,821
Nice to meet you.

150
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:08,455
Marty said you
told him we were dead.

151
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,388
You didn't know?

152
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,587
Yeah. I knew.

153
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:18,288
I mean, we never
get hungry.

154
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:19,788
We never sleep.

155
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,121
Really?

156
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:24,055
And nobody can see us.

157
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,021
Except you.

158
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,754
It's got to be dead.

159
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,687
Wow.

160
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:34,988
You are very smart.

161
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,321
Yeah.

162
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,721
But i'm afraid
of the dark.

163
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,121
Oh!

164
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,587
Me, too.

165
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,055
Will you spend
the night with us?

166
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,788
What?

167
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,455
Oh... sweetie,
i don't think i can.

168
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:54,455
I have to go home.

169
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,121
Do you ever leave the inn?

170
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,888
No. Rat says our feet
will catch fire.

171
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,021
Why would he say that?

172
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,488
He's real smart
about that kind of stuff.

173
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,088
What did you say
your name was again?

174
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,888
Vic.

175
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,721
I wish i could help you.

176
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,522
Nobody stays no more.

177
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,921
Everyone just leaves.

178
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,687
No. Lew peterson?

179
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:29,321
He's the only friend i have who
actually knows how to put a furnace in.

180
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:32,221
But is he reliable? You
haven't seen him in months.

181
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,788
Yeah, since our wedding.

182
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:37,754
I know lew's not exactly a poster
boy for good manners, but...

183
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:39,388
he's your friend.
Yeah.

184
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,455
And i respect that, and i wouldn't
come between the two of you.

185
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:44,021
But let's face it.
He's rude and he's crude.

186
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,888
He's an eighth-grader
with a car.

187
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,255
He speaks well of you.
He doesn't like me.

188
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,121
He thinks i'm the yoko ono
of your friendship,

189
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,821
that i stole you away from
the bars and the nightlife.

190
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:56,821
All right. I'll ask him to stay
somewhere else while we work on the house.

191
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,821
You asked him to stay here?

192
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,488
Now we're gonna have to host
him tonight and for the rest...

193
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,288
actually, i was kind of hoping
that you would host him tonight.

194
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,355
I got paged for the midnight
to 8 shift, and i really...

195
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,754
well, in that case,
there is something

196
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,021
that i have to do tonight
that i forgot to tell you.

197
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,422
Well, it's
a little extreme.

198
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:17,422
3 little boys
need my help.

199
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:18,788
3 dead boys.

200
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:20,988
You're gonna spend the
night in a haunted house...

201
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,155
the bush.

202
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,221
Your plant.
A haunted house alone?

203
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,221
I feel like i'm
in a john carpenter film.

204
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:29,355
I'll probably sleep better
there than here with party boy.

205
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,888
And if the inn is destroyed with them
in it, they'll be earthbound forever.

206
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:34,554
And i'm not gonna be alone. Mr.
Abrams still has a room there.

207
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,455
Oh. Old mr. Abrams
has a room there.

208
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:40,721
That makes me feel better. The
guy could be a serial killer.

209
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,522
It's safe. I promise.

210
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,355
You promise?
I promise.

211
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,721
Ok. Just keep thinking about
how much money we're saving

212
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:51,721
with lew helping me
put in the furnace.

213
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:55,155
Oh, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

214
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,221
He's changed.
You'll see.

215
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:00,355
Whoo-hoo!

216
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:05,554
Oh! Oh!

217
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:08,388
It's ok.
He just grazed it.

218
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,455
Hey, mel.

219
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:10,854
Hey, lew.

220
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,522
You look great.

221
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,554
Oh, you're too kind.

222
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,654
Don't burn the house down.

223
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,687
She's still
pissed at me.

224
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,488
Well, you did pass out before
the wedding even started.

225
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:25,355
And now you just ran over
her favorite plant.

226
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:26,721
My bad.

227
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,455
Hello!

228
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:33,654
Mr. Abrams?

229
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,587
Uh...

230
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,587
it's melinda gordon.

231
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,155
Hello!

232
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,021
Oh!

233
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,954
Working late?
Hi.

234
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,888
Mr. Abrams, i hope
i didn't scare you.

235
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:51,954
Just thought
i'd spend the night

236
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,888
and get an early
start on tomorrow.

237
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,954
You only live
a mile up the road.

238
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:59,221
Yeah, well, it is
our first auction.

239
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,754
You know... lot to prove.

240
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,921
Whatever.

241
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:13,587
Well, i met
mr. Northrop before.

242
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:17,554
Strange sort of man,
isn't he?

243
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,221
Did you tell him that this
used to be an orphanage?

244
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:21,988
Nope. He never asked.

245
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,055
Did you know that he's
planning to tear it down?

246
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:26,088
He's got the demolition
scheduled for monday.

247
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,554
He does?

248
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,554
I could really use
that extra time.

249
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:31,854
You could?

250
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:35,522
Well, yeah.
The extra time to convince him

251
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,821
to not tear down
this great old place.

252
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,088
Thank you.

253
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,088
Uh...

254
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:45,821
do you believe in ghosts,
ms. Gordon?

255
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,587
Uh...

256
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,088
yes.

257
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,522
I do.

258
00:12:55,587 --> 00:13:00,088
I think they're here... now.

259
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,055
They're all around.

260
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,321
Brrr!

261
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,021
Brr.

262
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,554
Yeah.

263
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,255
I thought you boys
wanted company.

264
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,288
You guys have been practicing this
stuff for a long time now, huh?

265
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:40,155
Ain't much else to do.
What are you doing here?

266
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:44,422
I thought you asked...
i mean...

267
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:47,988
um, i know that you boys
are as tough as nails.

268
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,321
Especially you.

269
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:52,388
And i thought
maybe i could help.

270
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:55,821
You wanna help us?
Then come downstairs.

271
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,687
Ok.

272
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:15,455
<i>Peter pan.
That's our favorite.</i>

273
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,554
Can you read?
No.

274
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,288
None of us can.

275
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:22,288
Ernie could read. He
knew all of the words.

276
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,554
Who's ernie?

277
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,954
He's a pal of ours.

278
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,988
Is he here with you?

279
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:31,554
No. Not for a long time.

280
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,422
So...

281
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:39,522
why don't you
tell me about rat

282
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,621
and why he's so mad
at everybody.

283
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,255
He says you can't
trust anybody.

284
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,455
He trusts you.

285
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:46,388
Yeah, he does.

286
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,422
And he trusted
his brother.

287
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,721
He had a brother?
Mikey.

288
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,721
It was his
little brother.

289
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,721
How come no one
ever adopted them?

290
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:57,321
Somebody
adopted mikey.

291
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:00,221
But they left rat here.

292
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:03,155
There was a lot of crying
when that happened.

293
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,488
So he has
a brother out there.

294
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,488
He got drowned.

295
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,687
Big wave hit him
at the beach.

296
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:12,488
That's when rat said we
can only trust each other.

297
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,721
So tell us the story
about peter pan.

298
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,188
Uh, that would be easier
if there was some light.

299
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,188
You are very talented.

300
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,754
Ok.

301
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,788
"There was only one boy
who never grew up,

302
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:35,821
"and his name
was peter pan.

303
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:40,155
"See him there,
floating over their beds?

304
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,155
"He came in through
the open window

305
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,554
"while wendy, michael, and
john were sound asleep.

306
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:48,155
"He taught them
to think happy thoughts

307
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:51,088
and sprinkle them with
pixie dust so they could... "

308
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:52,121
boys: Fly.

309
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,188
I know what you're
trying to do.

310
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:57,088
You're trying
to get us out of here.

311
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,629
Melinda, you slept
at the inn?

312
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,536
Those kids needed me.

313
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:15,303
They're under the influence
of this older kid, rat.

314
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,398
There's
a ghost named rat?

315
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:19,498
Yeah. If i don't get them to cross over
before that building is torn down...

316
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:22,165
torn down? But that's
such a great old place.

317
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,231
That's why the new owner is gonna hear
from the grandview historical society.

318
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,865
I didn't know there was a
grandview historical society.

319
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,231
There isn't yet.

320
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:32,365
Hey, you should
be vice president.

321
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,732
I got a "no. "
Anybody got a "no"?

322
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,998
I got a "no"
in the back.

323
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,998
I got a big fat "no. "

324
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,698
Sold.

325
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,765
Grandview
historical society.

326
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,265
Never heard of it.

327
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,265
Well, it's
a small group.

328
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:49,098
We wanna present you with some options
so that you can still make a profit.

329
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,964
Ms. Gordon, what's wrong

330
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,732
with providing
luxury housing for hundreds,

331
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,565
as opposed to an old hotel
that nobody stays at anymore?

332
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,598
Can you just
postpone the demolition?

333
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,598
Give us some time to...
to what?

334
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,432
To look for a way to preserve
a crumbling structure

335
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,532
that once housed
hapless orphans.

336
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:09,165
Ms. Gordon, i appreciate the
good work you're trying to do,

337
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,198
but new construction
it will be.

338
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,532
Jim?

339
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,064
Baby?

340
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,098
Sorry, mel.
I didn't hear you.

341
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:40,765
That's ok.

342
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,064
I'm used to it.

343
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,765
This stuff really works.
I can feel my skin tightening.

344
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,031
It, uh, tingles.

345
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,331
Where's jim?

346
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:52,498
Don't know.

347
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,899
I'm exhausted. Can you just get
him out of here for the night?

348
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,899
Take him to the movies
or something.

349
00:17:57,964 --> 00:17:59,799
You don't like him
at all, do you?

350
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,998
No, it's not that.
It's just...

351
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,998
i don't get you two.

352
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,998
I've known the guy
since we were 14.

353
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:09,165
He's the kind of guy you can
always call 3:00 in the morning

354
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,765
if you car wouldn't start
or you were lost or worse.

355
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,231
He's always been there
for me, no questions asked,

356
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:16,331
and that counts
for a lot.

357
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,964
Ok. I get it.

358
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:25,298
I'll find something
for us to do tonight.

359
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,298
But it ain't
gonna be the movies.

360
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:29,698
Why not?

361
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,298
No margaritas.

362
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:20,031
Oops.

363
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,165
Hi, mel.

364
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,498
Did you guys have fun?

365
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,998
I kept him
out of trouble.

366
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:31,998
Honey, you remember
terry and ralph.

367
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:33,931
Uh, hello.

368
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:37,432
Guys, um, get a beer.
Get a beer.

369
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:40,365
I'm real... i'm sorry about
the intrusion. I'm sorry.

370
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:43,598
No, it's fine. I should
get back to the inn anyway.

371
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,031
Wait a minute. What, now?

372
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:48,165
It'll be quieter there. I
need to talk to mr. Abrams.

373
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,665
I won't be long.

374
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,765
I'll keep 'em quiet. I'll
put 'em in the backyard.

375
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:55,465
No, it's ok. You guys have
your fun. I just figured it out.

376
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:57,732
It's not about me
not liking lew.

377
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:02,432
It's about me not liking
who you are around lew.

378
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,598
I'm sorry
that it's so late.

379
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,398
Oh, nonsense.
I'm happy for the company.

380
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:13,165
I've been doing a lot
of reading on the fire,

381
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:15,632
and it said
that 4 boys were killed.

382
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,632
I thought there
were only 3.

383
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:19,732
No. 4.

384
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,131
Rat, uh, vic,

385
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,865
marty, and, uh...

386
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:27,598
ernie. Ernie sutter.

387
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:32,899
He and rat were
the best of friends.

388
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,031
They were inseparable.

389
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,632
When they found
their bodies,

390
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:41,899
you would have expected to find
ernie lying right next to rat.

391
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,964
But that's not
what happened.

392
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:49,131
They never found
ernie's body.

393
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,964
The 2 little ones were...

394
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,331
were holding hands.

395
00:20:57,265 --> 00:21:00,532
The dog was
right there with them.

396
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:01,964
Tell him to shut up.

397
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:05,031
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

398
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,265
Later.

399
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,565
Sorry?

400
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:09,931
Late.

401
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,698
It's getting late.

402
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:12,865
Right you are.

403
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:15,532
He's always shooting
his damn mouth off!

404
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:19,064
Oh!

405
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:20,865
Well...

406
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,799
like i said...

407
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:26,064
it gets spooky around here.

408
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,907
You see how wendy
takes care of peter

409
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:07,373
after he returns home
hurt from his battles?

410
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,074
Like a mom would do.

411
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:12,707
Ah, but she was so much
more than a mom to peter.

412
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:15,741
She was his friend, and they
had lots of adventures together.

413
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:19,208
And that is what made
tinkerbell very jealous.

414
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh.

415
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:26,208
Boys, come back.

416
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,540
Did i scare them off?

417
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:31,707
It is so good to see you.

418
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:32,874
Sorry.

419
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:37,108
When you didn't
come home, i got worried.

421
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:41,540
What's wrong?

422
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,540
It's the boys.

423
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,540
They break my heart.

424
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,607
Maybe we should
stay here tonight.

425
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:49,707
It's a small bed.

426
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:51,474
I think we'll manage.

427
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,874
Ok.

428
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,440
Hey.

429
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,007
What's the matter?

430
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:11,240
It's something.

431
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, i can't believe it.

432
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,240
They're getting ready
for monday.

433
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,240
If northrop tears
this place down,

434
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,841
it's like cutting
the string on a balloon.

435
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:27,340
These kids will have
nothing to hold on to.

436
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,540
Hello.

437
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:37,807
I was just hooking the
power up to the fuse box.

438
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,941
The whole thing just sort of shorted
out on me. Sparks were flying.

439
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,440
It scared
the hell out of me.

440
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,474
There's no... fire.

441
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,074
There's no fire, though.

442
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:49,007
You're just gonna have
to do some rewiring.

443
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,440
I'll be right there.

444
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:52,640
A little, uh, emergency.

445
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,674
Oh, what, the house?
Lew's there.

446
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:58,507
Oh, no. It's, um,
nothing we can't handle, ok?

447
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:02,074
I can do...

448
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,273
you're gonna be all right?

449
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,874
Yeah.
All right.

450
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:08,007
Good-bye.

451
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:13,208
I heard what you
said last night.

452
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:15,507
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

453
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:16,640
Old man abrams.

454
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,540
Tells the fire story
all the time?

455
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,607
He don't know
the most important part.

456
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,208
What's the most
important part?

457
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:31,640
I knew the way, all right.

458
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:32,841
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

459
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,707
I always knew what to do.

460
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,440
Get up, everyone!

461
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,141
Wake up!

462
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,174
Get up, everyone! Get up!

463
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:43,041
That's why they followed me.

464
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,074
No, rat! No!
Up here! Come on!

465
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,174
Except this one time.

466
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,174
Ernie, you're going
the wrong way!

467
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,741
This one night...

468
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,640
the doors were locked.

469
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,007
Who knows why?

470
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,407
New janitor, new rule.

471
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:14,640
<i>Come on.
I never knew.</i>

472
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,707
I looked down at the guys.

473
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:21,307
I could see they were scared.

474
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,907
Don't sit down, you guys.
We got to find our way out.

475
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,407
Come on.

476
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:34,373
It was my fault.

477
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,741
I got them all killed.

478
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,707
It wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was.

479
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,707
You were trying
to help them get out.

480
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,741
How could you know that
those doors would be locked?

481
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,941
They trusted me.
I let them down.

482
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,841
That is not true.

483
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:52,340
They still love you,
don't they?

484
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,240
Most of the time they do.

485
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:57,574
That's because you're a
family, rat. You're peter.

486
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,874
They're the lost boys,
and they need you.

487
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,907
That why
i keep 'em together,

488
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,874
make sure nothing
happens to them.

489
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,307
You can come in, boys.

490
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:13,407
It's time for you
to move on.

491
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,373
You can't
stay here forever.

492
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,741
We don't know
anything but here.

493
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,474
Did you see
the bulldozer out front?

494
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,741
They're gonna
tear this place down.

495
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,640
And you'll just have to trust
me that there's a better place.

496
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:28,674
There's nothing...
nothing to be afraid of.

497
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,240
You think they want us at
the place she's talking about?

498
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:33,974
Nobody wants us.

499
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,240
This is the only place
we know we're safe.

500
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:38,974
That's why
we stay together.

501
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,307
I'll tell you what.

502
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,141
Just come outside
with me for one day.

503
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,474
Let me prove to you
that you can be safe

504
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,741
somewhere
other than here.

505
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,507
Sounds ok.
Don't you think, rat?

506
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:53,108
If you want your feet
to burn, go ahead.

507
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,734
no fire.

508
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,467
He lied.

509
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:13,967
Maybe not.

510
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,600
Maybe he really thinks
they do go on fire.

511
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,467
Come on, boys.

512
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,801
Why can't we just
stay with you?

513
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,500
Well, because...

514
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,667
we both love you
and everything.

515
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,700
You could be
our mother.

516
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:47,767
I would be proud
to have you two as my sons.

517
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,734
Any mother would.

518
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:52,001
Then why can't we?

519
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:54,168
Because you don't
belong here anymore.

520
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,667
There's
somewhere better.

521
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,700
Can you go
swimming there?

522
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,734
Eat ice cream?

523
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:02,634
Uh, i don't know
for sure.

524
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:07,201
But what i do
know is that...

525
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:08,934
you'll be wanted there.

526
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,567
And no one will ever
abandon you again.

527
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:14,201
But you won't
be there, will you?

528
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:15,767
Someday.

529
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,067
Someday i will.

530
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:21,034
And for you, it'll feel
like no time at all.

531
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:24,268
If rat don't go, we don't go.

532
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,534
We're moving on to our next
item, ladies and gentlemen...

533
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,234
lot number 85,

534
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,300
which is a beautiful
late '40s-era cradle.

535
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,367
We're gonna start
the bidding at $20.

536
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,734
150!

537
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,367
200!

538
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,367
2,000!
Wonderful. $20.

539
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,101
Shh.
25. ok, wonderful.

540
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:46,801
Uh, 25.

541
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,034
3 million!

542
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,767
Can i get 30?

543
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,168
A trillion!
Shh!

544
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,400
So that's how it works, huh?

545
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,433
Take our stuff, sell it,
keep the dough.

546
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,234
You see that store
over there? Go.

547
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,634
Now.

548
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,101
Andrea: Whoa! Hey! It's
not me that's on sale.

549
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,901
We're gonna move on
to lot, um, 86.

550
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:14,300
This isn't about old beat-up
furniture, is it, rat?

551
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,700
There's something
i got to ask you.

552
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,300
What is it?

553
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,300
And you can't lie
to me either.

554
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,901
I got to know the truth.
Grown-ups always lie.

555
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:28,067
I promise.

556
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,600
Am i gonna see
my brother mikey again?

557
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,201
Will he be there
once we cross over?

558
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:41,567
Yes, rat.

559
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:45,467
Your brother will be
right there waiting for you.

560
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,534
They said i'd see him again.

561
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,634
A family took him...

562
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,767
and not me.

563
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,034
They lied.

564
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:02,268
It's the truth
this time, i promise.

565
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,801
And marty and vic,
they'll come?

566
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:10,268
They're your family.
You'll all be together.

567
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,067
Thank you.

568
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,300
Well, he can fix it.

569
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,467
I knew it. I didn't
think it was that bad.

570
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,801
Lew, i can't do this,
all right?

571
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,300
Do what?

572
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,667
Play along, make believe that
this does not piss me off.

573
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,967
Take it easy.
No "take it easy. "

574
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,801
You come into my house,
you act like a fool.

575
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:46,534
You disrespect my wife.

576
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,534
I did not...
lew, wake up, ok?

577
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,767
You're my friend,
but we're not 18 anymore.

578
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,734
Look, pack your stuff.
I'll see you later.

579
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,433
Fine.

580
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,433
Andrea: 25. ok. Wonderful.

581
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,767
We're at $25.

582
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,034
This lovely
lamp here for $25.

583
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,934
Do i hear 30? $30.

584
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:11,034
30. anybody with 35?

585
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:13,467
$35, sir.

586
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:14,600
$35.

587
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,268
Is there anybody for 40?

588
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:20,001
Anybody? Ok.

589
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:59,730
I think i might just
bid on this piece.

590
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:04,076
Should've made it part
of the deal with abrams.

591
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,034
You're ernie, aren't you?

592
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:10,634
You're the boy
that got away.

593
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,034
That's how you knew that the
kensington was an orphanage.

594
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,001
You were there.

595
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:18,534
You don't have to pay me.
It belongs to you.

596
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:33,094
You have me confused
with somebody else.

597
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,326
Ernest sutter. That was
your name, wasn't it?

598
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,693
No idea what
you're talking about.

599
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,660
Best of luck with
the rest of the auction.

600
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,493
Don't go, please.

601
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,460
I cannot tell you how
important this is to me

602
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:47,194
and the boys
who died there.

603
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,860
You were there,
weren't you?

604
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,060
I wanna level
that horrible place.

605
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,094
I wanna turn it into a grave.

606
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I've spent 50 years trying
to outrun those memories.

607
00:33:59,226 --> 00:34:02,127
And every child
i pass on the sidewalk,

608
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:05,727
every photo
in a magazine, i see them.

609
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:11,060
They died and i lived. Why?

610
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,226
You were only a child.

611
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:14,993
They were my family.

612
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,626
I can help you.

613
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,993
How?

614
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:30,127
Boy: Come on!

615
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,393
I used to hide
in the basement.

616
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,626
My alone place.

617
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:45,326
No one ever looked
for me down there.

618
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:50,127
Sometimes i'd just
sleep or daydream.

619
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:54,060
Or sometimes i'd read.

620
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:56,993
I kept my little
secrets down there...

621
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,693
matches, candle.

622
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,127
That night, though...

623
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:04,927
that night
i heard homer barking.

624
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:07,127
I thought he
was in trouble.

625
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:11,526
I went to find him.

626
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,259
I meant to come back.

627
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:16,426
I meant to blow out
the candle.

628
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,560
But one thing
led to another.

629
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,293
They called bedtime.

630
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:25,560
I forgot all about it.

631
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Wake up!

632
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,027
I didn't even
remember it until later.

633
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:37,060
When the fire started, i was just
trying to get out like everyone else.

634
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:39,160
No, rat! No!

635
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:41,960
Ernie!

636
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:46,593
<i>Ernie, it's
the wrong way! Come on!</i>

637
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,760
No! Up here!

638
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:49,226
Ernie!
Up here! Come on!

639
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,326
Ernie!

640
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:57,660
And when i saw it burning

641
00:35:57,727 --> 00:36:01,226
and i didn't see
the boys get out...

642
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,027
i ran.

643
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:15,793
I just kept running.

644
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:19,860
Somehow i knew
that no matter what,

645
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,393
i was not coming back here.

646
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:31,460
Next day i saw the front
page of a newspaper.

647
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,693
I saw the pictures
of the fire

648
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,960
and the boys,

649
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,393
and one of them was me.

650
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:44,793
12-year-old orphan,
ernest sutter, was dead.

651
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:50,259
I remember climbing
into a trash bin and crying

652
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,094
till my throat hurt.

653
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:06,860
This was my friend
rat's hideout.

654
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,560
Ronald aikens tracy.

655
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,194
R.a. t.

656
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:13,960
He hated his name.
Loved his nickname.

657
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:16,293
He was one
tough customer.

658
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,194
Nobody messed with you
if you were ok with rat.

659
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:26,293
You got to tell him.

660
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,226
What if i told you
that rat was still here?

661
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:30,727
What?

662
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:33,893
The boys are still here.

663
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,727
I don't understand.
They're not dead?

664
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,593
They are dead.

665
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,194
But their spirits...

666
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,194
well, they were
afraid to move on.

667
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:47,426
That can't be. I don't
believe in that kind of stuff.

668
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:50,027
Yeah. Most people don't.

669
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:51,493
Tell him...

670
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,960
it's still there...

671
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,660
where he hid it.

672
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:59,893
Uh, he says
that it's still there

673
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
where you hid it.

674
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,960
This must be a dream.

675
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,094
Rat, is that you?

676
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,326
Tell him to use his indoor
voice. We ain't deaf.

677
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,960
He says for you to use
your indoor voice.

678
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,359
We ain't deaf.

679
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:52,526
Son of a... it is rat.

680
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:54,293
Tell him homer's here.

681
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,127
You got your teeth fixed.
You're really getting old.

682
00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:58,660
Hey, one at a time.

683
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:02,526
Ok. They want you to know
that homer's here.

684
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,526
Marty thinks you're getting old,
and rat says your teeth are fixed?

685
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,827
No cavities.

686
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,893
They're all false.
Mine fell out.

687
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,760
They're laughing.

688
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:18,727
Where's rat?

689
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,727
Right in front of you.

690
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:23,259
You were
the brave one, rat.

691
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:25,593
You were trying
to save us.

692
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,460
You always knew
the right thing to do.

693
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:31,993
I can't tell you
how many times

694
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,493
when i was
out on the road

695
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,359
and i'd think back on all
the things you taught me.

696
00:39:36,426 --> 00:39:40,359
Not book things. Like how to
survive and laugh at yourself.

697
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:42,793
And i'm still
always thinking,

698
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,760
what would rat do
if he was here?

699
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:51,027
You're so full of it, ernie,
it's coming out of your ears.

700
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,827
He wants to know
if you really think that.

701
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,626
Yes, i do.

702
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,027
Rat.

703
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,693
I would give all the money
i have in the world

704
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,094
to see you one more time.

705
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,593
All of you.

706
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,426
You ain't gonna
make me cry, ernie.

707
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:18,660
He's crying.

708
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:21,660
Don't tell him that.
Tell him...

709
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:26,094
that he could tear down
the inn if he wants.

710
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,893
We're going.

711
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:35,460
Rat says they're leaving.

712
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:37,960
Where are they going?

713
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,094
On a new adventure.

714
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,727
Good-bye, pal.

715
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,393
Do you see it?

716
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:25,693
Yeah.

717
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,626
A light.

718
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,860
Handsome.

719
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,194
I'm telling
everybody...

720
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:41,560
that you're my mom.

721
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,393
I ain't
scared, rat.

722
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,960
Me neither.

723
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,493
Mikey.

724
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,993
I can see my brother.

725
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,893
He's laughing at me.

726
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,359
Wherever i've been,
he wants to know.

727
00:42:17,593 --> 00:42:19,226
Good-bye, wendy.

728
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,060
Good-bye, peter.

729
00:42:38,827 --> 00:42:41,027
Are they gone?

730
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,860
Yes.

731
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,194
I never felt
like this before.

732
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:47,359
Like i'm... i'm...

733
00:42:47,426 --> 00:42:48,660
free.

734
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:52,827
Thank you.

735
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:07,027
I hate to admit it,

736
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:10,727
but now i kind
of feel sorry for him.

737
00:43:10,793 --> 00:43:12,094
Me, too.

738
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,194
He changed, i guess.

739
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,493
I don't know.

740
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,326
I don't think
he changed. You did.

741
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,259
All i know...

742
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,359
is that i'm glad
i have you.

743
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:03,460
Um, do you wanna
explain that?

744
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:06,293
Tomorrow. Let's
just go back to bed.

745
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,127
Yeah.

746
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,226
Stop.
