Ghost.Whisperer
Season 01 Episode 08

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,300
My name is melinda gordon

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
I just got married,just moved to a small town,
just opened up an antique shop

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,300
I might be just like you

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,100
Except from the time that I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,700
It's all right, honey

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,600
the ones who have not crossed over yet
because they have unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,800
and they come to me for help

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,200
To tell you my story,I have to tell you theirs

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,200
Thank god you're home.This is not the kind of movie you wanna watch alone

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Wait. You've seen this before.How is it still scary?

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,500
I don't know.It just is. You ok?

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Hard day.I'm fine now

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,800
Will you hold my hand and watch this with me?

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
-Sure. I'll just jump in the shower first
-Oh, hurry up

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,300
You ever have one of those days where everything just feels weird?

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,300
Don't go in there.I mean, why?Why do you do that?

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Like I'm wearing the wrong pair of glasses or something

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,300
Which is weird, since I don't wear glasses

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Oh! Turn the lights on, bimbo

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,400
jim!

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,200
No, I'm fine.It's just the plumbing job I did yesterday
must have knocked some rust into the pipes

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh, I should've told you.I'm sorry.Watching my face? Gross

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
What's the matter?

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm just gonna lock up.Watch the movie.I'll be right back

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,900
It looks like smoke and his asthma

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,700
-All closed up. Agonal respiration
-Let's get a pediatric mask and start albuterol treatment

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,500
Come on. Give me that mask

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,300
B.P. 140 over 90

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,100
-Do you see any burns?
-Uh-uh

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,600
Blood pressure is dropping

37
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,200
-Jim. Jim!B.P.'S dropping.We're losing her
-We're not losing her

38
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,800
-Come on, man!
-Yeah. Come on. We're not losing her. Breathe

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,600
Ok. Respiration's stabilizing.She's coming back

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,900
-You sure you're ok?
-I'm all right

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
-Did you say something?
-Me? No. Mm-mmm

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,700
-I ran into
-do you tell me--sorry

43
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,200
-Go ahead
-No. You.Do I tell you...

44
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,600
do you always tell me, you know, when you see spirits?

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Or are there so many of them you don't even mention it?

46
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Door number 2

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
-I don't know how you deal with that
-I just factor it in,move on.I guess I'd go crazy if I didn't

48
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,700
Is there someone here now?

49
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
No

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,300
Are you sure?

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,800
Jim, what's going on? You've been acting really weird lately
Is something bothering you?

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,900
Look, ok.I don't know if it's...just being with you,you know

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If it's rubbing off on me or something.
But lately I'm having these feelings

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,100
What kind of feelings?

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Like I'm being watched

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,300
And when it happens,I'm just...

57
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,400
flooded with this...with this sense of anxiety or,
I don't know,with despair or something

58
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It's like I'm in the presence of just...

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
talk about going crazy

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,400
-Why, did something already happen?
-You know it's probably just nerves. I'm fine

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800
-Do you want some more?
-No

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He just seems so different

63
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,800
-Different how?
-Distracted. Moody. Maybe the romance is fading

64
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,700
Are you serious? Jim is nuts over you.
You can feel the chemistry from like pluto

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
Then what's wrong?

66
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,600
-Excuse me, but this...migs?
-Alexis

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,000
-What are you doing here?
-I live here

68
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
Well, this is incredible. Come here, hon. Give me a hug

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,400
-Uh, so, what are you doing here?
-I'm writing a travel article for a magazine

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,200
-I...Hi.Lexi fogerty.
-Hi

71
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,900
Melinda and I were best friends for like ever.Right, migs?

72
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Andrea owns the store with me

73
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,800
Yeah. Uh, it's nice to meet you

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,900
Wow. I...I have so much I wanna say to you, migs

75
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
I know we left things a little bumpy. But...

76
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,200
hey.Can I take you to lunch?

77
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh, I can't, alexis. I'm very busy right now

78
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,500
Tell you what. Um, I'll be here all weekend.
So give me a call,Here's my cell phone number

79
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
Bye

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,700
-Whoa. What was that?
-What?

81
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,700
-You just totally iced that girl.
-No, I did not

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,300
Melinda, I have like freezer burn over here

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,600
-Ok,we used to be best friends,and we're not anymore
-I got that

84
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,000
-What happened?
-We just drifted apart

85
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, hey.What brings you here?

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,000
-Bringing you lunch
-Well, what happened? A check bounce?

87
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,400
No. Just felt like feeding my husband and,
you know,seeing how you're doing

88
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
I'm fine. I think actually I figured it out

89
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,100
-You did?
-Yeah

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,200
My dad died this week 5 years ago.You know about this time
I always start to go into a kind of funk

91
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,200
The only difference is this year I forgot.So maybe it's just been
weighing on me, and I didn't even notice it

92
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,300
-Huh. Ok, so you're feeling better now?
-Yeah, absolutely

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,200
-You sure then?
-Yeah.You worry too much

94
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
I worry just enough. I'm going to work

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,400
-Love you
-Mmm. Love you back

96
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,900
Mandatory training video  will be shown 11:30.
All personnel  are required to attend

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,800
-Young lady, I'm looking for my carriage and driver.Have you seen them?
-No. Sorry

98
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,800
Good lord. The theater's been out for ages.What will I tell my wife?

99
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,400
I only saw him for a second,
but this guy scared the hell out of me

100
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
And I don't scare that easy

101
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,400
Please.We saw the ring together.
You spent the whole movie under your seat

102
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,200
That was fiction. This is real life.
I've seen a lot of ghosts.This guy made my blood run cold

103
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
It was like the evils of the universe were just seeping out of him

104
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,500
Ugh. And you think one of these things has attached itself to jim?

105
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,300
It makes sense.He's moody. He's not eating.He has these waves of despair.Nothing like this has ever happened to him

106
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,500
So assuming you're right, what do you do
to get rid of a malevolent spirit?

107
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,300
I don't know. My grandmother never walked me through this one

108
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,000
-Melinda.Not comforting
-You know what? It's time to open.You finish up.No hurry

109
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Be prepared to provide resuscitation if the patient stops breathing
or experiences sudden cardiac arrest

110
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,500
So when available,bring an automated external defibrillator
to the patient's location

111
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,700
A professional medical care provider should evaluate
anyone suspected of experiencing a heart problem

112
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,300
Jim. Help me, son. Please, jim! Please!

113
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,700
jim!Help me, son.Please.Help

114
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Jim?

115
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,200
-Jim?
-In here

116
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Are you ok? They told me you were sent home

117
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
I saw my dad, mel

118
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
This, uh,stupid training film,It wasn't him at first,
but then it was clearly him

119
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,700
He's yelling for me to help him.What is going on?

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Uh...I think I was wrong

121
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,600
There is a spirit attached to you, and, um...

122
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,200
but you didn't see one

123
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,700
No. Not now. But I saw someone at the firehouse this morning,
and he really scared me

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,000
What did he look like?

125
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,800
Um, shaved-out hair, dark eyes, and completely covered in tattoos

126
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,600
Mel, it's the patient who died when we flipped the rig.
When we blew the tire. Remember?

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,300
The guy who was on his way to kill his wife?

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,700
-What does he want?
-No wonder he attached himself to you

129
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,400
-You're the last person that he saw as he died
-Does he blame me for his death? Does he want revenge?

130
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
-I don't know.
-At least I'm not crazy

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Hey, we're gonna figure this out, all right?

132
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,500
And I'm gonna stick to you like glue
until I see this ghost again

133
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,400
Hey, guys.Everything ok?

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,600
-Yeah. Everything's fine.Why?
-No reason

135
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,700
-You know, I just came to fix the cabinet
-Oh. Wow. Thanks, jim.It's driving us crazy

136
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, god. What happened? You ran out of here so fast

137
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Jim had some kind of an episode.
Thought he saw his dead father

138
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Jim is seeing ghosts?

139
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,900
No. No.I just think the spirit or whatever it is
is messing with his head

140
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Creepy.What are you gonna do?

141
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,900
There's nothing I can do except wait
until I see the ghost.That's why he's here

142
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,700
Nothing

143
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,100
Do you want us to go? Caus I don't wanna freak you out

144
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,000
No. Of course not. What's A...

145
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,800
malevolent spirit or two between friends, right?

146
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,300
-Hey, where did those come from?
-Aren't they pretty?Lexi brought them by

147
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,700
She is really trying to reach out to you.
I don't know why you guys drifted apart,but...

148
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Ok,I lied.We didn't drift.It was more like crash and burn

149
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Oh. You wanna talk about it?

150
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Freshman year of college

151
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,500
Lexi--she started telling people about my abilities

152
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,400
And before I knew it, I had become some kind of laughingstock

153
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,500
I got so uncomfortable,I finally left school

154
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
Oh, melinda

155
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,100
The funny thing is, there's a part of me that wishes
alexis and I were still friends

156
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,000
No. Are you kidding me? You can never speak to her again.Never.Ever

157
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
-Anything?
-No

158
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I thought attached meant "attached."
Why do they come and go?

159
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,000
They feed off our energy,off our emotions.
It's like recharging their batteries

160
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
Then they're free to wander off for a while

161
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,700
-Well, do they ever wander off and never come back?
-Not that I know of

162
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,000
I thought you were gonna say that.You're chilly. I'm sorry

163
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh. I'll turn on the space heater.

164
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
I blew a fuse.

165
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,100
Oh, really?Well, why don't you come back to bed
and we'll fix it tomorrow

166
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,600
-Why, honey? You're afraid?
-No, I'm not scared

167
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,100
-I'm gonna come with you,though
-I just blew a fuse.I overloaded the circuit

168
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I'll be right back

169
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,800
-Candle?
-You keep it

170
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,800
-Are you there now?
-Not yet. I'm on my way down to the basement

171
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,100
-You wanna do me a favor?Can you unplug the space heater?
-Ok

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,700
I can see you.And you don't scare me. You don't

173
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Who are you? And what do you want with my husband?

174
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,700
It's not your husband I want

175
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,600
It's you

176
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Me? What do you want with me?

177
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I need help

178
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,900
You see us.All the lost souls

179
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,600
I-I feel very dark things coming from you

180
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,800
-I can't help you if I don't understand what I'm feeling
-I killed a man

181
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
-What's your name?
-Julian boriqua

182
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't pretend to be a good man

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
-Who did you kill?
-Someone innocent

184
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,000
We just pulled a robbery, and we were trying to get away

185
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,900
Ok. All right. I didn't mean for it to happen

186
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,500
There are a lot of things I never meant to do

187
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,900
My partners were arrested,but I ran

188
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,700
I knew my wife had moved away,but I managed to find her

189
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,100
I saw my child, joseph,the son that I never knew

190
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,300
And I thought maybe the three of us could start over

191
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,300
But I lost rachel's love a long time ago

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,600
She didn't want my son exposed to me

193
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,100
I shouldn't have been surprised
when the police showed up at the house that night

194
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,600
In prison, I started to see the truth

195
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,600
I wasted my life.I hurt innocent people...and people who loved me

196
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,600
And I made a promise that when I got out,
that I would start over clean

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The day I was released, I was asked to do
a job on the outside.I refused

198
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,700
My mind was on only one thing--
to find forgiveness and to begin again

199
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,300
I truly believed that I could do this,
that I could make amends

200
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
I was wrong

201
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,700
Give us a hand.We need help in the back here

202
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,000
I think that you're haunting my husband because
he was the last person you saw before you died

203
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,500
No. It's because of you

204
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,200
Is it your wife and son? Do you wanna see them again?

205
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,300
No. Rachel doesn't even know I'm dead

206
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,900
Then how can I help you?

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,900
The day that I died,I was going to find the family of the man
that I killed,and I was gonna beg for forgiveness

208
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,800
I wanna see that through now... with you

209
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Will you help me?

210
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,400
I don't know if I can trust you

211
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,700
-I've heard that you wanted to hurt your wife
-No!

212
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,300
I never... I never...

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,100
whoever told you that lied.I loved my wife.
I never wanted to harm her

214
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Look...I just need...would you please just believe me?

215
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
You're my only hope

216
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,700
Hey, honey,go ahead and plug in the space heater

217
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,400
I got to rewire some of the circuits...is he here?

218
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Tell me what he wants.No, no.Tell me what you want!

219
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm sorry.This is not a benign spirit, ok?

220
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,500
-Not after the stuff I've been feeling
-So maybe "benign" was a bad word

221
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,400
But the man is obviously deeply unhappy,tortured,
and has had a horrible life

222
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,200
That does not mean that there's not some spark of good in him

223
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,700
Honey,I know you wanna believe that.
But this guys wants us to drive halfway across the state

224
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
-and help him find the parents of the man he killed?
-Yeah, and that's exactly what we're gonna do

225
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,800
How well do you think that is gonna go over,ok?

226
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,500
when you tell them you represent the man who killed their son?

227
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,900
I don't think it's gonna go over very well at all

228
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,000
-But that is not a reason not to help him
-You know what? You are...you are as stubborn as...as A...

229
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,100
me

230
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,200
I just don't want this guy attached to me anymore or in my house

231
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry. You're right

232
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,500
You don't have another choice

233
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,300
Hey.So you're an early-morning jogger, too?

234
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,900
Uh, yeah.I just love this time of day

235
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,400
When migs and i were in high school--
I really prefer to run by myself

236
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,100
-Thanks
-Ok, then

237
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Look, I'm not trying to be a bitch

238
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I guess I'm just one of those people who thinks that
loyalty is a personal asset

239
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,700
Uh, so it's about that costume party

240
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,100
-God, I wish she'd get over that
-I don't know anything about a costume party

241
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,300
It was a joke.Some kids decided to throw this costume party

242
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,600
and everyone was supposed to come as their favorite fantasy

243
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,600
At least that's what they told melinda

244
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
So you humiliated her in front of her friends

245
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,000
I...I kept her secret all through high school.
I was practically her only friend at her grandmother's funeral

246
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:03,400
-I listened to all of her problems all the time.
-Alexis, that's just what friends do

247
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,600
What a shame.Our first chance to get away,look what we're doing

248
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,200
It's not exactly a romantic getaway, huh?

249
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
-Is he here?
-Yes.He seems very preoccupied

250
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,200
Julian. Look, I just wanted to say I was sorry...

251
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,000
for the way things went down on the night of the accident

252
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,400
Tell him I know.I don't blame him

253
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
He says he doesn't blame you

254
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,000
-Thanks, julian.
-The truth is clear to me now

255
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,400
This was all meant to happen because it led me to you

256
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,500
Also to my salvation

257
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,300
He says you're welcome

258
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,000
-Uh, mrs. Farrell?
-Yes?

259
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,500
Hi. My name is melinda gordon.This is my husband jim

260
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,600
You don't know us,but we've recently became acquainted with...

261
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,700
with someone who was familiar with your son

262
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,600
Oh. I-I'm sorry.Who did you say you were?

263
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,800
Melinda gordon. I...uh...I...

264
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,500
My wife has a gift

265
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Uh...and this is going to be kind of hard to explain.But...

266
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
she has the ability to talk to and see people who have died

267
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
-She can help them
-Wait a minute

268
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Are you telling me that...that you've been
in contact with my son?

269
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Actually, no.

270
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,900
I've been in contact with the man who killed him

271
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh, my god

272
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
He never meant to hurt your son

273
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:02,700
-It was an accident.I would never take and he would never--
-doesn't matter

274
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,300
I know I'm guilty.Because I'm the cause for their pain

275
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,900
He was on his way to beg you
for your forgiveness when he was released

276
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,600
-He was let out? Why didn't they tell us?
-I don't know.But he changed his thinking

277
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,600
everything about the way he lived.
He wanted to start his life over

278
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,400
-but it didn't work out that way
-Why not?

279
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
He was killed...

280
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,700
-The night he came to ask you to forgive him
-Don't tell them about my troubles

281
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,700
You tell them that I would give anything...

282
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,500
anything to bring back their son

283
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,100
-You ok?
-Yeah. I'm fine. Go on. Tell them

284
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,600
-He wishes that he could bring back your son
-That's enough

285
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,600
-I have one question.
-Yes

286
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,000
Why do we have to listen to him?
Why can't we talk to our son?

287
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:02,300
Well, most likely,your son passed over easily
without issues to keep him earthbound

288
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,500
Julian,on the other hand,is...
tortured by the memory of what he did

289
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Good

290
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
-I'm sorry?
-I'm glad he was tortured

291
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,900
Does he have any idea how many times we wished we were dead?

292
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Just to stop the pain

293
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,300
He was a good boy,our son.He...

294
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,500
cared.He wanted to help people.He was going to build things.
He was going to make a difference

295
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
And that's who that murderer took out of the world

296
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,100
I believe him when he said that
the shooting was an accident

297
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,300
He had a loaded gun.He pointed it.
It went off and killed our son

298
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,100
What kind of an accident is that?

299
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:56,000
And he wants forgiveness? From us?

300
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
Never

301
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,000
-Are you ok?
-Yeah

302
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,300
-How's your headache?
-Better

303
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,100
-That was horrible.
-I warned you

304
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,800
I just feel so badly for the farrells

305
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,800
-I can't imagine what they went through.
-What did you expect?

306
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
Their only son was killed

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm saying.I don't know who I am

308
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,100
-Is he here?
-No

309
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,100
It's like I'm infected with him or something.
Why is he still doing this to me?

310
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,700
Because his energy's really powerful

311
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,500
But I don't think that julian is an evil man, jim

312
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
At least not anymore

313
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,800
I just wish the farrells could have heard him speak

314
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,600
It wouldn't have made any difference

315
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
I know you see me

316
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Hello, alexis

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
-You don't like me,do you?
-Does it matter?

318
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,300
Look, you were right.
I shouldn't have told anyone about melinda's gift

319
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,900
It was my first year at college.
I was desperately trying to fit in.And...

320
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
you know how it is

321
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Ok, maybe you don't know how it is.
But that's how it was to me

322
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,500
What I'm trying to say is...I wonder
if you could set up a meeting between me and melinda

323
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,700
I know it's not easy to forgive sometimes

324
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe just try to talk to her

325
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
-what can I get you?
-I'll have a tuna sandwich

326
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,600
What do you wanna order?

327
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Jim?

328
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,900
-Jim
-I'm not hungry

329
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Well, you have to eat

330
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,000
I am not hungry

331
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
-Tell me what you're feeling
-It doesn't matter

332
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
It does matter.I can help you

333
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,800
I feel totally,completely alone.It doesn't matter who I'm with

334
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,100
-And I feel like it will always be like this
-Those are not your feelings

335
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,500
-You know that. They're his.
-They're strong

336
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,300
I love you...so much.You know that?

337
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, then just focus on that

338
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,700
Keep julian at a safe distance

339
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,500
He just feels hopeless 'cause the farrells denied him.
And he feels lonely because...

340
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
-we have to find his wife and son
-No. We can't.We can't

341
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,100
-It's beyond hope with them.
-It is not beyond hope with them

342
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,400
Maybe if his wife knows that he's...dead,
she'll have a change of heart

343
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,300
My wife hates me,and I don't blame her

344
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,400
I betrayed her in every way that a husband can betray a wife

345
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,900
-What about your son?
-I think about my son all the time

346
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,500
Do you know...I didn't even try to know him

347
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,400
Isn't it worth a try at forgiveness?

348
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,100
I lost my son.And I don't have the right
to expect anything from him.Ok?

349
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,300
Julian. You have to trust me when I say that there is hope

350
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,200
I've been through it with others I've seen
how the lost of a loved one can affect the survivors

351
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,800
But I don't care what you say.It is not beyond hope

352
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Julian,this is your chance, huh? You got to take it

353
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Ah, julian, come on

354
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Ok

355
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,800
However this goes down,I just
wanted you to know that I respect what you do

356
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,200
-I mean, this calling
-Jim--

357
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,300
-and so if this doesn't go well--
hey. It's gonna go well.You're gonna be ok

358
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,000
There

359
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,700
Rachel

360
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,400
Uh...excuse me.Rachel, hi

361
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,900
My name is melinda gordon.This is my husband jim.
Can we talk to you for a few minutes?

362
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,700
-How do you know my name?
-Through your husband,julian

363
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,100
-What has that son of a bitch done now?
Oh, he hasn't done anything. He...

364
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,200
except die

365
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,300
Well, uh...I knew it would happen sooner or later

366
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,800
-I guess it's sooner
-I told you this was a bad idea

367
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,100
Um, he had some last words to share with you

368
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,200
-You were with him when he died?
-No, but my husband was. It's

369
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,300
It's more complicated than that.
Can we...can we please come in?

370
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Joseph? My son

371
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
All...all grown up

372
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,500
Just for a minute

373
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,900
Ok, ok, back up here.You're telling me you're talking with julian?

374
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,000
-Like his dead ghost or something?
-Yes -Even I feel his presence

375
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,300
Oh, you feel his presence? Bet you've had a few sleepless nights

376
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,500
Look, I left julian behind a long time ago.
I got a life. I got a job. I raise my son

377
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,000
She can feel me.I can tell

378
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,800
-Julian says that you can feel him
-I don't believe in that spirit stuff

379
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,900
You did. When we went to see that fortune-teller on coney island

380
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,900
-The one who told us that we were gonna get married
What about the fortune-teller at coney island?

381
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,000
-Who told you about that?
Julian's telling me about it.Said it's the best day he can remember

382
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:02,800
-You were so beautiful that day.Remember?
-Stop it

383
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,900
-In you sundress and sandals.Did a sandal break?
Did he have to carry you? -Stop it!

384
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,100
How do you know about that? You can't!You can't know that!

385
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,700
-You tell her that I love her.
-He loves you

386
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,000
-Tell her everything.
-And he's sorry for the pain he caused

387
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,100
-Tell her that I deserved to die.
-I can't say that

388
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Say what? Tell me

389
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,200
He said that...he deserved to die for hurting you

390
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,300
and he can't hurt anyone anymore

391
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,200
And tell her that I forgive her for turning me into the police

392
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,100
-Tell her that she did the right thing.
-He says you did the right thing

393
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,000
turning him into the police

394
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,900
I didn't turn him in

395
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,100
Is that what this is about?Are you trying to get me
to admit that I blew the whistle on my husband?

396
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,900
-No. No. Julian thought--
-I don't care what he thought.I'm telling you

397
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
I didn't turn julian in

398
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,100
I did

399
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,400
Joseph, you called the police on your father?

400
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,800
-Why?
-Because I didn't want him making you miserable

401
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,900
I couldn't stand to watch anymore,
but I didn't know he'd die

402
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,700
I just wanted him to go away for a while

403
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
-Joseph--
-don't touch me

404
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,900
It's because of me he's dead

405
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
What's happening?

406
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,000
Uh, julian's laughing

407
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Why?

408
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,800
Because it was my son who turned me in

409
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:14,000
Not you, rachel. My son. Protecting his mother

410
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,900
He's happy that you were protecting your mother.
He's telling you you did the right thing

411
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,900
-That makes me wanna hug him
-You're lying

412
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,500
-No, I'm not
-You see him?  -Yes

413
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Then what's behind his right ear?

414
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,500
-What?
-Behind his right ear!

415
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,900
He put a tattoo there that he said was for me
when I was born. what is it?

416
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,100
It's a white dove. Wings outstretched

417
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,300
What else does he say?

418
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,400
He wants you to become the man he was trying to be--
to learn forgiveness

419
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,300
-He says that being unforgiving...
-is like drinking poison

420
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,200
Is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die

421
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,700
-Ask rachel if she got my letters
-He's asking about some letters

422
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:42,600
I didn't open them.I was mad at him

423
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,100
Do you still have them?

424
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
He wants you both to read them.
He said it'll help you understand

425
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Look at them--my beautiful wife and son

426
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,900
I had it all. You know? And I just threw it away

427
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,200
He's sorry that he threw your love away

428
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,100
He didn't throw it away.Julian!

429
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,500
Even though you tried. God knows when you went to jail, I tried

430
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,500
But, damn it, I always loved you

431
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,400
He needs to cross over now.
But he can't do that until he knows that you forgive him

432
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:42,800
We do.We do forgive him

433
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,600
And tell him...that I love him, too

434
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,000
I wish there was something I could do

435
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,600
Tell him there is something he can do

436
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:10,800
Go to the parents of the man that I killed.
Find a way to befriend them.But don't tell them who you are

437
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,000
Do good things for them.Make their lives easier

438
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,300
Make a difference

439
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,900
I'll tell him

440
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,600
Jim?

441
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,200
Is he gone?

442
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,700
I am so glad andrea talked you into having this lunch with me

443
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,000
Actually, andrea told me not to come

444
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,100
-What?
-But it's been an extraordinary weekend,and, um...

445
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,700
I've just been doing a lot of thinking about forgiveness
and what people do to each other

446
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,000
Wow.That is so cool of you, migs

447
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,400
So then now, I guess,would be a good time
for us to talk about what happened freshman year

448
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Oh.Migs, look...my thing...ah.
My thing is,don't dwell. You know?

449
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,800
-Dwell?
-No matter what happened back then

450
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,100
I totally, totally believe in what you can do.
In fact, it's why I'm here

451
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
-What?
-Do you remember my aunt ruth?

452
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,900
Kind of a pain in the butt, bad breath.She lived outside grand view

453
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,200
She got sick last summer.I put in some long,
hard weekends with that woman toward the end

454
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:23,400
And she totally promised me she was leaving me
this emerald necklace.Like real emerald,melinda

455
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,000
with diamonds all around it and everything

456
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:32,900
Anyway, she died.And guess what.No necklace.
I combed the entire house

457
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,600
So I saw you. I thought...

458
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,000
-what?
-Um, I suddenly feel much better

459
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,300
Oh. Good.Good. You know, me, too

460
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,200
'Cause I realize that what you did to me is nothing
compared to what you do to yourself every day

461
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,900
And, um, it gives me some perspective. You know?

462
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,000
Wow. Time has just...zoomed right by.I got to run

463
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:08,800
Um, this was, uh, fun, lexi.And, um,
as far as the necklace goes.well, I would, uh...

464
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,000
I would keep looking

465
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
