1
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,467
My name is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,901
I just got married,

3
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,368
just moved to
a small town,

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,201
just opened up
an antiques shop

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,268
i might be just like you.

6
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:21,567
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

7
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:23,234
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,767
Grandma:
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,967
Earthbound spirits,
my gramother called them.

10
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,400
The ones who have not
crossed over yet

11
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,700
because they have unfinished
business with the living,

12
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,101
and they come to me
for help.

13
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,301
To tell you my story,

14
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,268
i have to tell you theirs.

15
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,934
Captioning made possible by
touchstone television and cbs

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,667
ok. We're here.

17
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:02,467
Now remember, you are
all to stay together.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,800
Do not leave
the immediate area
of the farmers market

19
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,301
or you will lose
yo outdoor privileges.

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,001
Now, we had our little
problems last time...

21
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,167
are you still there?

22
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,368
You better be.

23
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,101
I don't want
to do this alone.

24
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,901
Ok, everybody,
watch your steps.

25
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,234
Over this way.

26
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,667
Go over to the left.

27
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:26,867
James, come on.

28
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:37,901
What's the big deal?

29
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,134
It's just a casual
dinner some night.

30
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:42,268
And i gave up blind dates
a long time ago.

31
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,867
Jim says he has
a great personality.

32
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,101
Isn't that code
for, like,

33
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,867
"chubby in
a comb over?"

34
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:49,368
Firemen are hot.

35
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,201
That's all you should
be thinking about.

36
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,201
Ok.

37
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:55,301
Wait. No.

38
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,834
Maybe.

39
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,467
Have you always been
this decisive?

40
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,234
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,400
Hey, who's that?

42
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,834
Very smooth change
of subject. Well done.

43
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,368
Is this your grandmother?

44
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,301
Wow. She looks
exactly like you.

45
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,467
In fact, i think i've seen this
bathing suit in your closet.

46
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,467
She was very special.

47
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,734
I miss her.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
Like, "special" special?

49
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,667
Her birthday is sunday.
She would have been 80.

50
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,368
Hello.
May i help you?

51
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:31,667
No. Um... yeah.
Do you guys have a bathroom?

52
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,867
Sure. There's one
in the back.

53
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,201
I'll show you.

54
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,001
Big mistake, sister.

55
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,934
Bathrooms are always
the first place they look.

56
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,533
Whoa.

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,901
You can see me,
can't you?

58
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,368
Yeah.

59
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,600
Wow.

60
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,967
Twins.
Duh.

61
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:00,268
I'm sorry, ladies.

62
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,400
Did a young girl
come in here?

63
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,867
Pale-looking, pretty,

64
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,234
probably seemed
a little nervous.

65
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,800
Don't tell him.

66
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,834
Look, she's a patient
at a psychiatric clinic.

67
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,567
If you're trying to hide her,
it's a mistake.

68
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,734
[Sighs]
She's in the bathroom
in the back.

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,834
This way? Thank you.

70
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,301
My god.
Poor girl.

71
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,433
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,734
He's gonna drag her
straight back to
the cuckoo's nest, you know.

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Let go.
You're hurting me.

74
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,800
You know
i'm not.

75
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,533
Please. Don't take me
back to that place.

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,767
You know what, nat?

77
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:31,700
I really don't want to
go back there, either,

78
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,901
but what are
we gonna do?

79
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,734
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

80
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,634
I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,001
Whatever.

82
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,500
So...

83
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,967
are we with ghost?

84
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,467
What the hell
are you looking at?

85
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,967
Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,334
We are with ghost.

87
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,901
so you're just gonna ignore
this whole situation?

88
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,500
I was
hoping to, yes.

89
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,233
I have lunch plans
with my husband.

90
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,034
Why did you have to
rat out my sister?

91
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,834
I wasn't about to lie.

92
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,200
For all i know,
the clinic is a safe place for
your sister to be right now.

93
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,233
Well, it's not.

94
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,367
Why don't you try
and help

95
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,667
instead of passing
judgment?

96
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,200
I don't pass judgment
on anyone.

97
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,567
And did it ever occur
to you that maybe

98
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,300
you're the reason she's there
in the first place?

99
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,534
I mean, attaching
yourself to her?

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,901
I'm the only reason
my sister

101
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,168
hasn't completely
lost it in there.

102
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,001
We'll agree to disagree.

103
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,634
Look, if you want
to cross over,

104
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,667
i'll be glad to help you.

105
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:07,500
You mean, like,
go to the light?

106
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,701
Not an option.

107
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,834
My sister needs me.

108
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,467
She's barely half
a person without me.

109
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:12,667
I've gotta get her
outta there.

110
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:13,967
What do you
expect me to do?

111
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,701
I cannot interfere
in your sister's treatment.

112
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,300
It is not my place.

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm sorry.
I really am.

114
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,168
By the way,

115
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,300
my sister grabbed some
fancy letter opener
off your counter.

116
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,767
So, if she does
something,

117
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:39,267
say, slit someone's
throat or maybe
even her own,

118
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,068
i hope that doesn't
eat away at your
conscious too much.

119
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,367
Hey. You must be will.

120
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:56,434
Yeah, that's me.

121
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm melinda,
jim's wife.

122
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,233
Right. Jim talks about you
all the time.

123
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:05,034
Didn't i just see you talking
to yourself on the corner?

124
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,801
No... uh, cell phone.

125
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,168
I was talking
in the cell phone.

126
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,467
That's what i thought.

127
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:12,367
Hey.

128
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:15,034
Don't hate me,
but i can't have
lunch today.

129
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,034
What's up?

130
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,101
Something came up.

131
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,267
What?

132
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,367
Girl from green grove
came in the store

133
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:20,467
and stole
a letter opener.

134
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,634
I called them.
I have to pick it up.

135
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,867
No, i'll go pick it up
for you.

136
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,233
No.
No, no, no.

137
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,701
I don't like you
going to a place
like that alone.

138
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,367
It's not a big deal.

139
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,434
Besides, the girl's being
haunted by her dead twin.

140
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,068
Oh, now i'm really
going.

141
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,267
Come on. I'll drive.
Let's go.

142
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,400
I'll come in with you
if you want.

143
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,934
No, i'm fine.

144
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,300
Be right out.

145
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,101
I've seen worse places.

146
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,500
Looks kinda peaceful,
actually.

147
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,434
They're coming!

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,801
They're coming
to get me!

149
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,901
Please!
Please help me!
Help me!

150
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,967
I was afraid you might
file a complaint
with the police.

151
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,600
No, i was just...
worried, actually.

152
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,867
I wonder if
you wouldn't mind.

153
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,934
I'd like to create an
opportunity for natalie

154
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,001
to make amends to you
for what she did.

155
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:15,001
Call it a sort of
therapeutic
intervention.

156
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,967
I want her to learn
to take responsibility
for her actions.

157
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,534
She's not dangerous.

158
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,667
She just wanted
something to pry open
her window with.

159
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:28,667
Um... sure.

160
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,701
Natalie?

161
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,867
I'm sure you remember
ms. Gordon.

162
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,200
She runs
the antique store

163
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,701
that you took
the letter opener from.

164
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,801
Is there something you'd
like to say to her?

165
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,634
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,300
So i see you decided
to grace us

167
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,101
with your presence
after all.

168
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,567
It's ok.

169
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:01,701
You have good taste.

170
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,367
It's art nouveau.
My favorite.

171
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,400
One of the few things
i won't sell.

172
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,901
I guess if you let on
you can see me,

173
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,567
the good doctor might
lock you up, too.

174
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:12,333
Doctor: Anything else,
you'd like to say, natalie?

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,434
Can i... talk to her
for a minute?

176
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,701
Sure. It's ok.

177
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:25,567
You see her, don't you?

178
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:28,168
Yes.

179
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,600
I knew i wasn't crazy.

180
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,767
She's sitting over there
by the bed.

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,534
I feel her with me
all the time,

182
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,233
just like when
she was alive.

183
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,367
I feel her energy,
her moods,

184
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,867
just like
they were my own.

185
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:51,068
Sometimes, i swear, i know
exactly what she's thinking.

186
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,600
She's mad, isn't she?

187
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,434
Because of that night.

188
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,701
My family has a cabin
by lake st. George.

189
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,400
We snuck out there,

190
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,534
me, zoey,
and my boyfriend tom.

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,734
Tom is a total
scuzzball, f. y.i.

192
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,734
I got a bad sunburn
and so i went to sleep early.

193
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,534
I guess zoey
got bored without me.

194
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,134
She stayed up drinking,

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,634
and then she went swimming.

196
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:21,267
I tried to swim out
to the buoys,

197
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,434
like when we were kids.

198
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,667
We used to try
and swim out to the buoys.

199
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:30,300
We were supposed
to tap one of them 3 times.

200
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,667
We could never do it.

201
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,667
Every june,
we'd be determined

202
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,834
that this would be the summer
one of us would make it.

203
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,600
Well, i tried again
that night.

204
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:48,068
I should have known
it would have been bad luck
to do it without you.

205
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,134
What happened?

206
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,500
I just...

207
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:03,667
I just... didn't make it.

208
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,600
I knew she was dead.

209
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,134
It was like
i drowned with her.

210
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,068
You know the best thing
here would be if...

211
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,168
zoey crossed over.

212
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,134
You mean, like,
leave forever?

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,834
She doesn't
belong here anymore.

214
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,701
She can't leave now.
I need her.

215
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,168
As long as she's in
this nuthouse,

216
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:30,967
i'm not crossing my legs,
never mind crossing over.

217
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:33,168
What about
your parents?

218
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,667
They're divorced.

219
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,068
My mother's the one
who put me in here.

220
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,634
I made the mistake
of telling her

221
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,333
that i thought zoey
was still with me.

222
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,500
She thinks i'm psychotic.

223
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,300
Talk about the shoe
on the other foot.

224
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,967
Natalie was always
the golden child,

225
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:50,300
the one who could
do no wrong.

226
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:53,267
What was i supposed to do?

227
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,767
Make believe
she's not here?

228
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,634
Lie about what i feel?

229
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:02,734
No. You shouldn't
have to do that.

230
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,934
Even my boyfriend hasn't
been around in a while.

231
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,534
Oh, please.

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,867
My parents think
the sun rises and sets
on that moron.

233
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:13,767
I need him to tell my parents
that i'm doing better.

234
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:14,934
They'll listen to him.

235
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,967
They think the sun rises
and sets on him.

236
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,200
I hate that they
put you in here.

237
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:38,233
I love it.
Don't have to do
a damn thing.

238
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,734
Some cute guys, too.

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,034
You're too young
to be in a place like this.

240
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,467
An old folks home?

241
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:47,034
Why can't you come
an live with us?

242
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,534
Girl with the biggest
heart in the world.

243
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,400
Melinda, sometimes
you have to look at life
as if it's a big clock.

244
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,034
The clock keeps going
no matter what.

245
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,567
What are you saying?

246
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,434
I'm just saying that
this is all temporary.

247
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,400
I know what time
the big clock
says it is.

248
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,400
Oh, i hate it when
you talk like that.

249
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,400
You better not be
going anywhere.

250
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:13,333
Well, i'm excited
to see what's on
the other side.

251
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,333
Do you have any idea
of how many people
i've helped cross over?

252
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,467
I'm beginning to feel
like a travel agent

253
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,168
who's never
been on a plane.

254
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,333
You're the only person
that understands me.

255
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,200
You're the only person
that doesn't make me feel
like i'm crazy.

256
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:32,267
You have to promise me
something, sweetheart.

257
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,168
Promise me that
you'll be strong
when i'm gone.

258
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,134
I can't have you
wallowing.

259
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,434
It serves no purpose.

260
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,901
Grandma, you just had
a minor stroke.

261
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,467
You're gonna be fine.

262
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,767
Just promise.

263
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:46,500
Ok. Promise.

264
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,101
I'll see you girls
next week?

265
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,068
All right.

266
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,168
Tom warren?

267
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,701
Hey.

268
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,001
You're gonna
have to make
an appointment.

269
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,333
The don't let me
do walk-ins.

270
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,634
I'm a friend of
natalie's.

271
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,534
Are you
a social worker?

272
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,467
Something like that.

273
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:30,200
She's upset because
you haven't been to
visit her lately.

274
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,934
Yeah, well, i started
college in september,

275
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,134
and i'm doing this
coaching thing.

276
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,001
Do you think
she belongs there?

277
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,101
Do you?

278
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,400
I think she feels
cut off from everybody,

279
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,300
especially from you.

280
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,634
Yeah, well, maybe they
can help her there.

281
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,967
Maybe you can
help her.

282
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,534
She needs to feel connected
to her life outside the clinic.

283
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
She needs you.

284
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,434
You look
really good, natalie.

285
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,767
Thanks. I'm feeling better.

286
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,034
Well, i'll let
you guys talk.

287
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,734
What is he
doing here?

288
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,867
So, how's college life?

289
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,901
You know.

290
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,500
I've got a pretty
heavy course load,

291
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,634
plus i'm rushing
a few frats,

292
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:20,001
and i'm doing
the tennis thing, so...

293
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,434
i'm dead, natalie's
stuck in a nuthouse,

294
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,534
and he's
going to keggers,

295
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,068
trying to score with
sorority chicks.

296
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,267
Give him a chance.

297
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,534
How about you?

298
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Um, let's see.

299
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,434
I'm catching up
on my reading...

300
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,600
ha ha ha.

301
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,634
Sandwiched between
about a billion hours

302
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,867
of staring at the wall,

303
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,467
broken up by the occasional
therapy session.

304
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,701
Blah. Blah. Blah.

305
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,134
So why haven't
i seen you lately?

306
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,801
You know,
i've just been
really busy.

307
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,001
Yeah, it's really
time consuming
being a selfish a jerk.

308
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm always thinking
about you, though.

309
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,901
Are you? Really?

310
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,967
Why don't you
just break up with her?

311
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,233
You know you're scoring
with your tennis groupies.

312
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,801
Face it, you're just dying
to cut this nut job loose.

313
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,333
Zoey.

314
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,634
Are you sleeping
with other girls?

315
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,934
What?

316
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:10,068
You know,
i think visiting hours
are almost over.

317
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:11,534
Are you?

318
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,767
Where did that
come from?

319
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,300
I don't hear a denial?

320
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:15,734
You know, she's tired.
You can come back
tomorrow.

321
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,567
Didn't you say
that we'd be together
forever, tom?

322
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,168
Didn't you
tell me that college
wouldn't change that?

323
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,467
Nat, come on.

324
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:22,667
I mean, a lot
has happened
since i said that.

325
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,567
So why did you
even come here?

326
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:28,001
Yeah, tommy boy? Why?

327
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,034
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

328
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,867
Here's how i'm doing.

329
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:34,801
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

330
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,001
You don't care about me!
You don't care about me!

331
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,333
You don't care
about anybody!

332
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,434
oh, dear.

333
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,734
When was this taken?

334
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,834
Junior year
field hockey game.

335
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,567
My grandma
never missed an event,

336
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,033
no matter how small
or how far away.

337
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,133
I could always
feel her eyes on me.

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,467
I think you still do.

339
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,667
Closest thing
to a twin i've ever had.

340
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,567
Hmm.

341
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,567
You know, this
might sound like

342
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,501
a stupid question,
but do you wanna do
something special

343
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,567
on her birthday?

344
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,634
You know,
like visit her grave
or something?

345
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:18,400
It's too far away.

346
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,334
You're sweet though.

347
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,567
And you're
sweet and...

348
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:31,968
Clancy.

349
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,000
It's a dr. Tanaka
from green grove.

350
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:40,934
We're a little confused
about the purpose
of your visits.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,267
It's not that
we don't appreciate
your interest. We do.

352
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,801
When natalie talks
about you, she seems...

353
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,334
but we don't know you,

354
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,100
and, as of last week,
natalie didn't know you.

355
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,767
Melinda has been
very helpful...

356
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:54,834
excuse me, doctor.

357
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,968
I totally understand
your concern.

358
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,167
I'd feel
the same way.

359
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,767
I met your daughter
by accident, really.

360
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:06,200
But we connected
on a level that...

361
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,000
it's just
that we have some
things in common,

362
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,767
and, if you don't
mind me saying,

363
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,334
i don't think
that natalie
belongs here.

364
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,501
And you speak
under what authority?

365
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,567
None.

366
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:20,601
Just experience,
i guess.

367
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,667
I've had to deal
with a lot of
grieving people,

368
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:26,467
and sometimes,
all they need is
closure to move on,

369
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,467
and i think
that natalie,
in some way,

370
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:29,968
is still
very attached
to her sister,

371
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,734
and if she could
get past that...

372
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,501
i'm not sure i understand.

373
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:37,200
You run an antique shop
in granview,
isn't that right?

374
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,767
Yes.

375
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:42,334
And you're
an amateur psychiatrist
in your off hours?

376
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,434
Barbara.

377
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,434
Mrs. Harper,
there is no doubt

378
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:49,200
that natalie has
responded positively
to miss gordon's visits.

379
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,133
Natalie's boyfriend tom
called me last night,

380
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,667
and he described
a very different picture.

381
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,200
He said that natalie
became very agitated

382
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,267
the last time
miss gordon was here.

383
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,367
Well, that's
not quite true.

384
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:06,033
I'm sorry.
We don't want you
here anymore.

385
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,634
Do we understand
each other?

386
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,400
Of course.

387
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,567
That's it?

388
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,767
You have nothing
else to say?

389
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:02,033
So you'll find
another way to get to her.

390
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,200
How?

391
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,934
I'm only good at
the encouragement part.

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,667
You're the how-to-do-it girl.

393
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,467
Can we talk
about something else?

394
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:09,534
Anything else?

395
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,033
Thank you.

396
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,834
Um... well, i talked
to will about andrea.

397
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:16,167
And?

398
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:19,267
Look, he wants to meet her
before the actual date.

399
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,434
Meet? Does he know
that we're talking about

400
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:23,601
a dinner date here,
not a pre-nup
negotiation?

401
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,901
The man's gun-shy.

402
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:26,968
Ugh. This is worse
than junior high school.

403
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,901
Ok, here's
what we're gonna do.

404
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,067
I'll set a dinner date.

405
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,267
You tell will,
i'll tell andrea.

406
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,567
If they don't like
the looks of each other,

407
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:33,934
they can run in
the opposite direction,

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
but at least
you and i will have
some nice pasta.

409
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,300
Damn, you're good.

410
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,033
Love ya.

411
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,434
So you're just
giving up on us?

412
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:44,968
Not even
a little fight?

413
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,634
I can't keep having
conversations with you

414
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,033
in the middle of town.

415
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,934
You do understand
i'm the only one
who can see you?

416
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,601
I'm not gonna
leave you alone
unless you help.

417
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,300
You're the one
who messed up
things with tom, zoey.

418
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,367
He slept with me.

419
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,334
On the night i drowned,

420
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,133
we slept together
while my sister

421
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,334
was sleeping
in the other room.

422
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,634
I felt awful about it,

423
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:12,133
but i was drunk,
and feeling sorry
for myself.

424
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,501
I don't know
what his excuse was.

425
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,501
Do you think
i want my sister

426
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,567
to be with
a guy like that?

427
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,934
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,801
I don't want her
to hate me.

429
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:26,400
Look, i know
you think i'm some
kind of pond scum,

430
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,400
but i love
my sister.

431
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,367
I've always
looked out for her
in my own way.

432
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:34,234
Pond scum, no.

433
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,534
Misguided, yes.

434
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,000
And if you really
care about your sister,

435
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,668
Hey.

436
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,000
Hi.

437
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,800
We're having dinner
saturday night.

438
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,000
Lento's on the square.

439
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,501
You, me, jim,
jim friend's will, 8:00.

440
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:04,401
He's tall.
Feel free to wear heels.
Any questions?

441
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,000
Uh, no.

442
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,301
Good.

443
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,733
Can i make
a statement?
Brief.

444
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,467
There's someone
waiting to see you.

445
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:13,167
Uh, sorry.
Hope you don't mind.

446
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:16,201
Owen at green grove
told me i could
find you here.

447
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,501
Of course not.

448
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,234
You know what? I'm gonna
go shop for some heels.

449
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,100
I will, um,
talk to you later.

450
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,668
I assume you're
not here to talk about
a chippendale dresser?

451
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,833
Uh, no, i suppose not.

452
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,568
Um... listen,
i wanna apologize
for my ex-wife,

453
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:35,800
the way
she spoke to you.

454
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,401
No need.

455
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,334
I went back to see
natalie after we met.

456
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:48,800
She was very upset
that you were asked
not to come.

457
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,501
Well, i hope
you told her it wasn't me.

458
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,167
I did. I did.

459
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:56,800
Yet, she was
really, really down.

460
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:01,134
Withdrawn,
as they call it.

461
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,067
She told me

462
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:06,301
that you can see zoey.

463
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,568
That you're
the only who knows that
she's not delusional.

464
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:11,568
What do you
want me to say?

465
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:14,434
The truth.

466
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,067
I have seen zoey.

467
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,234
She's what i like to call
an earthbound spirit.

468
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,501
I can communicate with her,

469
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:27,334
with spirits
who haven't crossed over.

470
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:30,733
Are you telling me
that natalie...

471
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,700
natalie can't see zoey,
but she can feel her.

472
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,833
She can feel her
just as much as she did
when she was alive.

473
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,733
And natalie knows
that she's here.

474
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,434
Can you see zoey now?

475
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:46,100
He looks so sad.

476
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,767
It's killing me.

477
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,334
Where?

478
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,000
She's beside you.

479
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:54,100
Now she's moving over
to the couch.

480
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,501
Just so he knows,
i was in his car.

481
00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:58,900
I left him a message.

482
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,067
All right,
if you're playing
around with me,

483
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:01,767
this is really
a very cruel joke.

484
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,267
She wants you to know
it was her in your car.

485
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,467
She left you a message.

486
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:09,568
Oh. Oh.

487
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:16,267
I wanna tell him something.

488
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,201
She wants
to tell you something.

489
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:22,201
Tell him i'm sorry
i was such a
disappointment to him.

490
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,733
I really
didn't mean to be.

491
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,867
She's sorry that she was
a disappointment to you.

492
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:30,067
What?!

493
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:32,267
How can you
say that, zoey?
Never. Never.

494
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,401
If i could live it again,
i'd be his favorite.

495
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:37,167
I'd do anything
to get him to smile at me

496
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,334
like he smiled at natalie.

497
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,634
She feels like natalie
was your favorite.

498
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,267
No. No. No. No.
Zoey, please.

499
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:44,733
I love you.

500
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,534
No different
than natalie.

501
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:48,668
I thought you were
disappointed in me.

502
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,833
I could
never talk to you.

503
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,800
I mean, you seem
so angry with me.

504
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:55,900
L... i wanted you
to see me, dad.

505
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,934
Me! Not natalie's twin,

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,867
not the girl
who couldn't spell as well

507
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:03,334
or be nice to company
as well or do anything
as well as she could.

508
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,234
I just wanted you
to know that i was there.

509
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:09,167
Your daughter who loved you,
and hung on every word.

510
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:13,167
Just once i wished
that you would've said
natalie looked like me,

511
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:17,134
instead of me always
looking like natalie.

512
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:18,234
What is
she saying? Please.

513
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:20,134
Don't bother.

514
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:23,900
He can't hear me now any
better than he ever could.

515
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,334
She's gone.

516
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,601
What did she say?

517
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:44,367
I can't promise
that it'll be verbatim,

518
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:45,934
but here it is.

519
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,467
I'm so glad
you could come.

520
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,900
Mr. Harper called,
and gave you full
visiting rights.

521
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,467
And mrs. Harper?

522
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,467
He said to call him
on this cell number

523
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:05,401
if she tries
to interfere.

524
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,833
Go on down.
She's waiting for you.

525
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,934
Your grandma had
a rough night, melinda.

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,967
I thought she was
feeling better.

527
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,601
Yesterday she was
out of her wheelchair.

528
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:31,767
There's good days
and bad. It happens.

529
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,668
She's out like
a light right now.

530
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,867
Well, i told her that
i'd stop by after school,

531
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,334
so i don't want
to disappoint her.

532
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:41,067
We should really
let her sleep.

533
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,733
I'll let her know
you came by.

534
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,267
Do you mind
if i wait a bit?

535
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,634
Would it matter if i did?

536
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,134
Make yourself comfortable.

537
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,634
Thank you.

538
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,067
There you are.

539
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,401
Hey, they told me
you weren't feeling well.

540
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,501
Just needed a nap.

541
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,267
I was afraid we'd
missed our visit.

542
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:17,267
Grandma, you see
those people?

543
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,467
Yes.

544
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:22,934
The one that keeps
looking at me, is he...

545
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,301
a spirit?

546
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,800
No, he probably just
thinks you're cute.

547
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:33,000
The man
talking to joan is
long dead, though.

548
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,167
No smoking, sir.

549
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,601
I don't feel like
i'll ever be able
to tell the difference.

550
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,100
You will, sweetie.
Trust me.

551
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,167
How?

552
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,733
Well, you'll feel it.

553
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,501
You'll look at someone,
and you'll feel
what they feel.

554
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:53,167
Confusion, sorrow,
relief, fear.

555
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:55,534
You might even
feel curiosity.

556
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,467
Maybe sometimes joy.

557
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,367
And it will all happen
in a split second,

558
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,900
and then you'll know.

559
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:07,733
Grandma, i feel
some of that right now.

560
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,634
No. No.

561
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,967
It's all right, sweetie.

562
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,134
[Crying] grandma,
don't leave me.

563
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,900
Nurse!

564
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,867
No.

565
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,700
I don't know
what came over me
the other day.

566
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,401
Zoey came over you.

567
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:51,167
I'm writing tom
a note of apology.

568
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,467
Wanna take a look
at it for me?

569
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,867
What do you think
this is gonna accomplish?

570
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:01,967
I want things
to be ok between us.

571
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:05,501
I want to know
he's gonna be there
for me when i get out.

572
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:09,167
You've been talking
to zoey, haven't you?

573
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,201
What did she tell you?

574
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:13,334
She's worried
about you.

575
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,733
There's something else,
isn't there?

576
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,967
I knew there was something.
She's keeping a secret.

577
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,301
She slept with tom
the night she died.

578
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,967
It's not true.

579
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:34,501
Tom would never
do that to me.

580
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,401
She's lying.

581
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:39,668
I think what she needs
is your forgiveness.

582
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,934
Could you
please leave now?

583
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,034
Is everything ok?

584
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,301
Not really.

585
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,301
I think i should
come back another day.

586
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,733
Her mother's getting
a court order

587
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,267
to transfer her to
the state hospital.

588
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,934
Does her father know?

589
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,634
I'm sure it's gonna
be a fight.

590
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,301
I'll tell you
one thing.

591
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,800
That kid'll
never survive that.

592
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,200
you ready?
If not i can...

593
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,100
I kind of wish we didn't
have to go to dinner tonight.

594
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,067
I can cancel
that reservation
right now.

595
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,868
[Chuckles]
After all the work we did

596
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,968
to get andrea
and fire boy together?

597
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,100
No way.

598
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,968
You still worried
about those twins?

599
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,934
You know what?
It's supposed to be
a fun evening.

600
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,601
No shop talk.

601
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,200
See these rings?

602
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,868
They mean you and i
are bound together.

603
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:05,334
Your problems
are my problems.

604
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,701
So talk to me.

605
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:12,133
I think i may lose
this one.

606
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:17,033
[Whispering]
You can only do
what you can do.

607
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,501
Maybe it was meant
to be

608
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,100
mother: Melinda?

609
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,567
I'm not hungry, mom.

610
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,133
You can't stay
in bed forever.

611
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,501
You're breaking
your promise.

612
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,901
Where have you been?

613
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:44,868
You saw me
at the funeral.

614
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,534
I saw you standing
by the casket,

615
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,634
and then
you were gone.

616
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:49,934
I was very pleased
with the turnout.

617
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,367
Why are you still
in bed?

618
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,934
I don't feel good.

619
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,834
Sweetie,
i know you're sad.

620
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:59,300
Your mom's sad, too,
but she's not in bed
all day.

621
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,267
She knows you have
to go on.

622
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,968
Grandma,
it's just different.

623
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,133
I feel so alone now.

624
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,367
Mom doesn't
understand.

625
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,300
I miss you so much.

626
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,701
I'm gonna miss you,
too, sweetie.

627
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,901
You're a very
special girl.
Remember that.

628
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:19,968
I don't feel special.
I feel weird.

629
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,067
That means you're human.

630
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:24,567
But you have a gift.
You have to know that.

631
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:28,300
I don't know
if i want it.

632
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,734
You do.

633
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:32,067
It may not seem
like it now,
but you do.

634
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:35,367
You have a chance
to help so many people.

635
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:39,667
Your heart won't let you
turn that away.

636
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,567
I don't really know
how to use it.

637
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,601
Just take everything
i've given you

638
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,834
and make it your own.

639
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,100
And remember this...

640
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:50,534
every time you help someone,
you honor me.

641
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,400
Maybe there was, like,
a small brush fire
on the way, and he...

642
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:15,901
no, no.
There he is.

643
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,400
Guys, i'm sorry
i'm late.

644
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:20,133
It's fine. We
just got here.

645
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,067
Honestly, i was trying
to figure out what shirt
to wear.

646
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:25,467
My ex usually made
the final decision.

647
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,033
I have zero
fashion sense.

648
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,167
Well, you made
a great choice.

649
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,968
They are totally
cute together.

650
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,834
I take complete credit
for this match.

651
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:34,167
Unless it all
blows up, then
it's my fault?

652
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:36,234
Exactly.
[Chuckles]

653
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,567
You're getting
really good.

654
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,000
And i'm serious,
even i'm afraid

655
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,801
of your backhand
now.

656
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,634
Well... i'll
call you later.

657
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,634
Drive safe.

658
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,734
Natalie,
what the hell?!

659
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:01,133
Did my sister
ever tell you

660
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,934
she hates
being called "nat"?

661
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,467
Put that down.

662
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,634
How could you
do it, tom?

663
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:09,868
How could you
have sex with me

664
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,667
with natalie
sleeping in
the other room?!

665
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,434
Stop! You're not zoey!
You can't be!

666
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:14,634
Out of the car, tom.

667
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,133
Just hold on.
I'm gonna smash something!

668
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,133
Just hold on.
Just hold on.

669
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,300
Get out!
Oh!

670
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,968
Ok. Ok. Ok!
Hold on.

671
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,634
Will you just stop this?
You're freaking me out.
What do you want?

672
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:28,601
[Revs engine]
Just a little payback.

673
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:40,767
That was insane,
natalie!

674
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:43,300
I didn't know
you had it in you.

675
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,467
Where are you going?

676
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,834
Oh, no.

677
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,901
So it was
the third time
in a month

678
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,033
this woman had
a kitchen fire,

679
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,267
and that's when
it occurred
to me.

680
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,901
Either she was
a really horrible
cook,

681
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:04,467
or she was so hell-bent
on trying to land
a fireman,

682
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:05,968
she was setting
these fires on purpose.

683
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,901
Yes, we dated
for 2 years.

684
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:13,167
Oh, my god.
That's just sad.

685
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,501
Waiter:
Uh, dessert, anyone?

686
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:17,167
I have tiramisu,
chocolate cake,
tortoni...

687
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:20,200
you know,
i am thinking
one of each.

688
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,501
Ok, i am officially
in love with you now.

689
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,534
My ex never ordered dessert,

690
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,834
but if i did,
she'd end up eating
half of mine.

691
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,167
Oh, i hate
when they do that.

692
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,834
Melinda, yo.
I need your help.

693
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:34,300
Not now.

694
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,200
And i will take
the chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake.

695
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah, one tiramisu,
2 spoons.

696
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,367
I'm afraid she's gonna
do something crazy.

697
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:44,467
Your timing sucks.

698
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:48,033
You know, i have
a work emergency

699
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,667
that needs to be
taken care of.

700
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,367
Do you need me to help?

701
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,167
No. No. Yeah.

702
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,267
That's a great idea.
Do you guys mind?

703
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:57,267
No.

704
00:34:58,567 --> 00:34:59,767
See ya.

705
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,767
Sorry.

706
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,200
Bye.

707
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,601
Ok. Have you ever heard of
an antique-related emergency?

708
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,767
Um...

709
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,834
I mean, why would she
go to the lake?

710
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,934
She and her sister
used to go there
when they were kids.

711
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,868
It's where zoey drowned.

712
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,601
Wait, you don't think
she's gonna...

713
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,767
who are you calling?

714
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,234
Her father.

715
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,968
Can't he drive
any faster?

716
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:16,833
where is she?
Melinda: I don't know.

717
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,967
Oh, wait, i think i see her.

718
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,601
I'm going in
after her.
No. Wait.

719
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:26,601
Wait.
What are you
talking about?

720
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:27,900
She's gonna drown.
Just don't!

721
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,000
What?

722
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,267
She's doing it.

723
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:34,301
She's swimming out
to the buoys.

724
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,301
Look, dad,
she's gonna make it.

725
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:50,234
One of us is finally
gonna make it!

726
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,601
Uhh! Yes!

727
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:59,668
Tap 3 times.

728
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,534
[Shouting]
I did it, zoey!

729
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:11,034
I did it
for both of us!

730
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:21,700
So, do you like
living in town?

731
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:25,334
Um, it's...
it's fine for now.

732
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:27,634
Yeah. Me, too.

733
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,467
Uh, this is, uh...
this is me.

734
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:30,668
Ok.

735
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,301
You want to have some
coffee or something?

736
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,367
[Cell phone rings]
Oh. Sorry.

737
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:36,167
It's fine.

738
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:40,134
Uh, it's late.
[Clears throat]

739
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,967
Why would i take
thbasement key with me?

740
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,401
Uh, i don't know.

741
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,733
Check the top drawer
in the kitchen.

742
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,434
I gotta go. Ok? Bye.

743
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:50,234
Let me guess.
Your ex.

744
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,833
I gotta get
a new cell number.

745
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,267
Well, you're not single.

746
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,800
Yes, i am.

747
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,534
We broke up
3 months ago.

748
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:01,134
Yeah, but
you mentioned her

749
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,700
at least a half
a dozen times
during dinner,

750
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,201
and then she calls you
on the phone

751
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:06,367
late on a saturday,

752
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:08,434
and you don't tell her
you're on a date.

753
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:12,401
Yeah. I'm sorry.

754
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,867
It's, um...

755
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:16,900
it's a bit
of a process and...

756
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,900
i understand.
I do.

757
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,134
But it's your
process...

758
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:23,668
not mine.

759
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:28,967
When you, uh...
when you put
the "break"

760
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,767
in the break up,

761
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,334
you call me. Ok?

762
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Smooth, will.

763
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,234
Very, very smooth.

764
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,301
Are you all right?

765
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,100
Yeah, dad.

766
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,134
That's she i've been
trying to tell you.

767
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,267
That was
amazing.

768
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:03,733
Zoey wants you to know
you did great.

769
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,134
Do you see her?
Do you see her?

770
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,900
Yes.

771
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,900
Can... can you hear me,
zoey?

772
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,100
She can hear you.

773
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,501
Zoey, i always
saw you.

774
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:18,767
I always, always
loved you.

775
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,833
And i guess
i just thought
that somehow,

776
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,967
deep inside...

777
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,867
you knew how i felt.

778
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:28,234
I didn't know.

779
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,467
I never, never thought
you looked like natalie.

780
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:36,900
L... i thought you always
looked like you.

781
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,267
Tell him it's ok.

782
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,034
Tell him better late
than never.

783
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,401
She says it's ok.

784
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,700
Better late
than never.

785
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,601
Ask natalie
if she can forgive me

786
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,134
for what i did
with tom.

787
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,800
Ask her if she can
forgive me.

788
00:39:58,867 --> 00:40:00,167
For what?

789
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,767
I'm sorry
for not realizing

790
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:06,367
how lucky i was
to have you.

791
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:08,534
My best friend.

792
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:10,301
You knew
all my secrets.

793
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,833
And you knew
all mine.

794
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,201
I'll never be that close
to anyone ever again.

795
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,668
Tell my dad to get her
out of that place. Ok?

796
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,367
I don't think
i have to.

797
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,568
Is that light out there
for me?

798
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,601
You're the only one
that can see it.

799
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:53,534
Good-bye.

800
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,134
She's saying
good-bye.

801
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,067
I love you, dad.

802
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:03,700
Good-bye, zoey.

803
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:07,634
Just like looking
in the mirror.

804
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:17,234
Tell natalie to have
a great life.

805
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,534
Work at it.

806
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,267
Be that close
to someone again.

807
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,234
Live it for
both of us now.

808
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,733
Good-bye, zoey.

809
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,000
This is pretty intense.

810
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,634
She's gone.

811
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,167
Thank you.
Thank you.

812
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,634
Hey, what time is it?

813
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,833
A little after midnight.

814
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,668
Happy birthday, grandma.
