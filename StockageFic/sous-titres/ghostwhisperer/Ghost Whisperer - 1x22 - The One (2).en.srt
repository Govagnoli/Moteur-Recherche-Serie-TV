00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:02,709
Previously on Ghost Whisperer...

2
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:05,071
What?

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,395
It's just a weird day.

4
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:10,862
Can't shake this feeling of dread, you know? Like something terrible's gonna happen.

5
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,491
- Have you had this before?
- No.

6
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,243
- We're close.
- A uniform?

7
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:16,186
I think he was a pilot.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,310
What's wrong?

9
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,161
My brother is supposed to fly today.

10
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:21,012
Andrea, what are the chances?

11
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:24,445
Melinda, this is Charlie Filbert, the architect that i was telling you about.

12
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:26,706
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.
- So you guys want to expand.

13
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,656
- Yes.
- Maybe.

14
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,442
I'm gonna have to call you back.

15
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:33,263
What are you looking for? Did an airplane crash?

16
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,532
I don't know yet. We're still flying.

17
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:37,191
What?

18
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:39,173
Yes, hello.

19
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:40,701
There is a plane in the air.

20
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:42,583
No one is flying it.

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,072
Get off the square.

22
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:50,080
Melinda...

23
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,213
I was driving, and I saw it.

24
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:54,763
It went down.

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,130
There were cars everywhere. It was terrible.

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,300
You are the one.

27
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,021
You ok?

28
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:48,521
Don't worry about me, Jim. I'm good.

29
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:47,011
Look, you have to listen to me. It's not good for you to stay here.

30
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,213
They don't believe you.

31
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,191
- We can't be dead.
- Will you look around?

32
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,813
You have to understand what happened here.

33
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:57,941
I don't know what anything is anymore.

34
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,110
Do you see a light?

35
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:02,020
What if I do?

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,940
Then you have to get your passengers together and you have to go into that light.

37
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,693
- It's where you belong.
- Not yet.

38
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,103
Not until we figure out what happened.

39
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,042
You ok?

40
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:44,720
I don't know.

41
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,050
I just want to find someone.

42
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,512
Just one person alive.

43
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:52,433
There's still time.

44
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,671
How's the new guy doing?

45
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,280
He's hanging in there.

46
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,240
A little green around the gills.

47
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:04,780
Is it me?

48
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,832
Maybe there's something wrong with me that I can do this without flinching.

49
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,522
Hey, there is nothing wrong with you.

50
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,611
You just know how to keep going.

51
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,850
That's what they need here.

52
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,031
Well, I better do that, huh?

53
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:30,542
Check in with me later.

54
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,230
- I love you.
- Love you.

55
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:36,982
Kristen!

56
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,222
Kristen!

57
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:45,202
Kristen!

58
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,223
Where are we?

59
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,032
Can you help us? Can you see us?

60
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,382
Where are we?

61
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,322
What happened?

62
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,710
Where are you going?

64
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:16,903
Have you seen Kristen?

65
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,820
She's only 10.

66
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,523
I don't know Kristen.

67
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,392
She's my daughter.

68
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,080
We have to be getting home. My husband's waiting.

69
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,543
What's your name?

70
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,291
My name's Lisa.

71
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:34,283
- Have you seen her?
- I'll look.

72
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,860
I promise.

73
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,511
You don't

74
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,873
look like the others.

75
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,981
Do you remember it being very cold?

76
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:46,771
Who are they?

77
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:11,512
The flight, which originated in Johannesburg, South Africa,

78
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,590
stopped reporting its position somewhere over the Atlantic.

79
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:17,522
Several attempts were made to contact this flight

80
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:21,772
which carried 248 passengers and crew. They all failed.

81
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:25,660
As the plane approached the east coast, jet fighters were scrambled.

82
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:29,611
They reported all the cabin windows were frosted over.

83
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,411
The plane then went into a steep descent and went down--

84
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,453
Enough.

85
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:41,791
I  still haven't heard from my brother.

86
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:43,670
He was in Cape Town, but, um...

87
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:47,490
he said he might spend a couple of days in Johannesburg.

88
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,742
When was he coming back?

89
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,401
He was supposed to be back last night.

90
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,860
Yeah, I really don't get the feeling that he was on that flight. I mean,

91
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,820
- what are the chances?
- I can't lose my brother, Melinda.

92
00:07:58,137 --> 00:07:59,381
I can't sleep. I keep...

93
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,140
just sitting on the couch and staring.

94
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,602
Yeah, Andrea, I know that you're worried,

95
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,512
but you might have to face something.

96
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:12,260
Excuse me. Melinda Gordon?

97
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:13,712
That's me.

98
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,593
My name's Matt Mallinson.

99
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:18,971
I'm the investigator in charge with the national transportation safety board.

100
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:19,973
How can I help you?

101
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:24,332
Well, our records show that several calls were placed from this store to the F.A.A.

102
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,990
And local airports yesterday just before the crash.

103
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,802
I--I made some of those calls too.

104
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,220
Did you make some of those calls, miss Gordon?

105
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,682
Warning about a plane in danger?

106
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:38,192
Yes.

107
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:41,642
Well, the thing of it is, those calls were placed nearly a half hour

108
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,890
before the media was notified, and we'd like to know where you got your information.

109
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,122
Well, it was, um,

110
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,481
it was a feeling really.

111
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,481
- Intuition.
- Intuition.

112
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,921
"There's a plane in the air. "The pilot, Ken Nielsen is dead.

113
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,191
Maybe the crew. No one is flying it."

114
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,902
That's pretty specific intuition, don't you think?

115
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,220
Look, I know this is probably bad timing, but

116
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,182
I really need to know if my brother was on that plane, and

117
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:14,523
maybe you have a passenger manifest. His name is Mitchell Moreno.

118
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,072
Yeah, has a passengers list been released yet?

119
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:20,700
No, not publicly. The families are still being notified.

120
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:21,772
We'd like to know

121
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,590
how you knew these things, miss Gordon.

122
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:26,223
Was the pilot dead?

123
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:34,573
Yeah, it's Mallinson.

124
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,761
Yeah, I can be there in about 10.

125
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:41,743
We're  gonna have to schedule a formal interview, and you can--

126
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,893
you can expect a call.

127
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,512
They have transcripts of the calls.

128
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,302
How did he leave it?

129
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,832
I'm supposed to go in for a formal statement, whatever that means.

130
00:09:57,135 --> 00:10:00,311
Honey, this is the government. They're not gonna be open-minded about this.

131
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,910
It's only gonna get worse if I tell them the truth.

132
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,193
Melinda,

133
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:05,332
trust me.

134
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,873
Your truth is not gonna be their truth.

135
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:10,731
Jim, there's a woman

136
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,993
looking for a little girl.

137
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,441
A 10-year-old. I don't know what she looks like.

138
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,323
We haven't found any kids yet.

139
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,422
God, this is overwhelming. I've never seen anything like this.

140
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,422
And just the scale.

141
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,970
I mean, all these lives--

142
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,351
gone.

143
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,711
They all get through it.

144
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,345
We'll get through it.

145
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,266
I should go.

146
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,436
And you know,

147
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:41,902
I get it now.

148
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,082
What?

149
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,172
What you said before

150
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,211
about rushing through life.

151
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,973
About not taking time for each other.

152
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:53,063
When this is over,

153
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:54,461
that stops.

154
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,301
Yes,  it does.

155
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,472
Wait!

156
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,480
They're mine.

157
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,071
Miss Gordon?

158
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

159
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,912
Volunteers are not authorized to go past the tape.

160
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:29,271
It won't happen again. I'm sorry. Can I go now?

161
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,223
No.

162
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,012
Miss Gordon,

163
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:38,720
at what point did you become aware that there was an aircraft in distress?

164
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,290
It was more of a feeling I had.

165
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:42,961
- The valves.
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,321
Find the outflow valves.

167
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:46,782
You have to tell him.

168
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,550
Yeah, all I can say is it has something to do with valves.

169
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,303
-Valves?
- Outflow valves.

170
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:53,922
Yeah, the outflow valves.

171
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:57,310
If you find them, you'll understand more.

172
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,523
And where did you get this information?

173
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,820
- I'd rather not say.
- I can't leave my ship.

174
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,741
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?

175
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:04,713
What you're doing with my wife?

176
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,011
Asking your wife a few questions, Mr. Clancy.

177
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:08,980
That's funny, I don't remember telling you my name.

178
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:09,930
You didn't.

179
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,401
You can't hold her here like this.

180
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:15,341
No, you're right, I can't, but law enforcement can.

181
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,381
But they won't for now.

182
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:21,641
Miss Gordon.

183
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,241
Don't cross that yellow tape again.

184
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,591
I saw them take my body away.

185
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,141
Yes.

186
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:57,611
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:01,330
I'm just not ready. I don't have anyone.

188
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,530
No husband, no kids.

189
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,911
I wanted to stay single so that I could travel, see everything there is to see.

190
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,293
Did you?

191
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:12,911
Not enough.

192
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,550
And now that's it? I don't get another chance?

193
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:17,481
Not here, anyway.

194
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,060
I don't know why I'm dead. I don't know what happened.

195
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,893
You have to cross over into the light.

196
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:28,691
- You have to tell the passengers.
- We're not crossing over.

197
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:32,080
He said we didn't have to. He made promises.

198
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,892
He said we can stay here with the others.

199
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:36,022
Who?

200
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:39,081
The one with the hat. He came out of the woods.

201
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:40,882
What did he say?

202
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:42,882
He said to stay away from the light.

203
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,583
That there were things that we could do here for him.

204
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,133
He said we could stay forever if we wanted.

205
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,652
I'm staying, and so is everyone else.

206
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,321
I just need 15 minutes up there. I won't disturb anything.

207
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,093
I need some answers, miss Gordon.

208
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,913
How did you know about this flight, and who told you about the valves?

209
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,861
The pilot.

210
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:14,842
- The pilot's dead.
- I know.

211
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,922
But last night he was standing in front of you, and he was trying to tell you

212
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,821
to check the valves. Told me instead.

213
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,303
- Are you claiming to be a psychic?
- No. Psychics see the future.

214
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:26,022
-  Well, what do you see?
- The dead.

215
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,571
Are you registered?

216
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,931
- What?
- NSA-CIA.

217
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:36,312
I was registered at pottery barn when I got married. That's about it.

218
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:37,682
Well...

219
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:41,792
do you think you're gonna get any more information?

220
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,411
- Is this a joke?
- When I joke, I smile.

221
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:49,013
Maybe. If you let me back on the crash site.

222
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,932
- You got 15 minutes.
- Thank you.

223
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:15,940
Reggie.

224
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:17,820
I know you.

225
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,903
Hey, come on, lady.

226
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,062
Miss, please.

227
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,431
Why are you here?

228
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,253
To wait for the others from the plane.

229
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:28,681
- For what?
- He wants us all together.

230
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:32,450
Who does?

231
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,030
Him.

232
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,463
They're mine.

233
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:45,982
Reggie.

234
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:49,970
They're going with him.

235
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,832
They're making a mistake.

236
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:57,781
He told them they could be with their families.

237
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:58,732
Talk to them.

238
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,500
He told me I could see my little girl.

239
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:02,450
No, he's lying.

240
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,222
I've looked everywhere for her.

241
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,210
Is she dead?

242
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,141
I don't know.

243
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,223
I haven't seen a spirit of any children.

244
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:20,431
Am I dead?

245
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:23,673
Yes.

246
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,660
But  I didn't--

247
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,681
I didn't feel anything.

248
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:33,702
Is that all it takes? You can just die and not even feel it? Not even know it?

249
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:34,653
Sometimes.

250
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,493
- But there's a reason.
- Well, what?

251
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:40,453
- We can't know that here.
- Well, it's not fair.

252
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,151
I know.

253
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,630
Maybe then it's good that I can't find her. Maybe it means she's all right.

254
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,392
Where were you sitting on the plane?

255
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,500
We weren't on the plane.

256
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:58,180
- What should we do when we get home?
- I don't know. Play games.

257
00:16:58,187 --> 00:16:59,583
- Hang out with dad?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,260
What is that?

259
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:07,593
What is it.

260
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,042
What about my husband?

261
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,682
He can't lose both of us. He needs us.

262
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,960
I keep trying to let him know that I'm looking for her.

263
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:18,982
He can't hear you.

264
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:22,822
But he can hear you.

265
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:25,832
They can all hear you.

266
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:28,621
I know.

267
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:16,893
Where have you been?

268
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,060
I went to Mitch's apartment.

269
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,251
He wasn't there.

270
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,383
No one would talk to me about him.

271
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,221
Do you remember that fortune teller at the carnival? She--

272
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,363
she said something bad was gonna happen around Mitch.

273
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,960
She said that he might get sick or something, but--

274
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,562
what if this is what she meant?

275
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,173
I think it's too early to tell.

276
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:52,041
I've been trying to work up the courage to go in there,

277
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,850
look at the passenger list.

278
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,552
Andrea...

279
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,332
there's something I have to tell you.

280
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,010
You saw Mitch?

281
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:08,223
- Andrea--
- don't! No. No.

282
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,863
- But I'm not sure--
- no way. It's not him.

283
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,322
Good evening.

284
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:28,041
My name is Matthew Mallinson. I'm with the national transportation safety board.

285
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,491
I'll be giving you updates throughout the night.

286
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,371
While the search continues,

287
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:38,933
I have to report that no survivors have been found as of yet.

288
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:46,113
Now, it is still technically a search and rescue operation,

289
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:51,813
but I have to report that sometime in the next few hours

290
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,290
it will become a search and recover operation,

291
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,330
and I'll be giving you another update at that time.

292
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:06,070
And please let any of us know if you need anything.

293
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:09,582
Thank you.

294
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,313
I'm not involved in this.

295
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:29,720
Not in any official way.

296
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,622
I'm just someone who lives here.

297
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:35,442
Works here.

298
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:40,643
I just wanted to tell you all how sorry I am.

299
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:45,051
How sorry we all are here in Grandview.

300
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:49,860
I also wanted to tell you,

301
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,740
to make you understand if I can,

302
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:55,600
that your loved ones,

303
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,242
they feel you.

304
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:01,883
They know that you're here.

305
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:04,880
I've been to the crash site, and

306
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,342
I felt their spirits there.

307
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,113
And I can...

308
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,822
I can feel them right now in this room.

309
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,700
I feel their sadness.

310
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,430
I feel their confusion.

311
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:24,632
But the biggest thing that I feel is their love.

312
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:27,222
For you.

313
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:32,362
And if there is anything that they would want you to know,

314
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:35,132
it's that they know how much you love them.

315
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:41,773
That

316
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,423
is so important for you to know.

317
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,363
It's the only thing that matters.

318
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,621
Sir? Do you need to see the manifest?

319
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,523
My wife's not on the manifest. She wasn't on an airplane.

320
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:18,280
She was coming back from her sister...

321
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,680
They're mine.

322
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:48,922
Well?

323
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:51,851
You can't do this.

324
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,302
You can't trick those souls into staying here.

325
00:22:55,388 --> 00:23:01,061
Since you feel so strongly about it, I will release all your precious souls

326
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,270
and let you send them into the light, and in return...

327
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,372
I'll take you.

328
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,430
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I don't know.

329
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,150
I've been noticing him for the last few months.

330
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:20,232
There's two of them. One who laughs and this one.

331
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:21,042
They're dead?

332
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:22,190
They're spirits, yeah.

333
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:23,582
Why didn't you tell me about this?

334
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:26,702
Tell you what? I don't know who they are. I just know they're bad news.

335
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,292
That's the understatement of the year.

336
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,992
This one guy wants you dead, right?

337
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,942
He wants my soul in return for theirs.

338
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:34,671
Why would my one soul be worth hundreds?

339
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:37,521
It's obvious. He wants to stop you crossing people over.

340
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,471
Why?

341
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,742
And I've been having these dreams

342
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:47,340
and seeing these signs, and they all say the same thing:

343
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:48,802
"You're the one."

344
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:53,163
- What if this is what that means?
- No. No, it doesn't.

345
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,132
Well, what if I'm supposed to save these souls? What if none of this is random

346
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:59,243
and that's why I'm here? Maybe this is what it's all been leading up to.

347
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:01,141
No, this is nuts! Listen to yourself.

348
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,683
It was 250 people, Jim.

349
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:06,713
Do I really have the right to ignore that?

350
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:09,783
How about the thousands of people you can help the rest of your life?

351
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,381
Do you have the right to ignore them?

352
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:15,680
No. That's what this guy is afraid of. That's what he wants to stop. What about that?

353
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:17,641
We lost so much the last few days.

354
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:22,252
I know.

355
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:25,242
Too much. Too many.

356
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:27,853
But I'm not losing you.

357
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:29,730
Not now.

358
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:31,672
Not ever.

359
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:37,921
- Did you tell Andrea?
- I just can't.

360
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,612
It's the government guy.

361
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:58,850
This is the air outflow valve.

362
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:01,371
They found it about two hours ago.

363
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:02,853
Mean my job if anybody

364
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:04,641
knew I brought this to you.

365
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:07,393
Then why did you?

366
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:10,692
Oh, you know why.

367
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:22,000
Ask him to turn it for me.

368
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,300
- He wants you to turn it for him.
- All right.

369
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,003
How's that?

370
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,590
It's closed, it should have been opened.

371
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:39,070
It was my fault.

372
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,830
He thinks it's his fault.

373
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:43,440
How?

374
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:44,801
I must have missed it.

375
00:25:46,165 --> 00:25:49,061
I've done thousands of preflight checks, never a problem.

376
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:53,152
I did a check of the whole oxygen system, and a closed valve should have been obvious.

377
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:56,690
We were over the ocean at 35,000 feet, and then all hell broke loose.

378
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:06,233
We lost cabin pressure. When that happens, you have to get oxygen flowing immediately.

379
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:10,013
But with the valve closed, there was nothing flowing.

380
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,453
By the time I stood up, I started getting disoriented.

381
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:16,102
- The whole crew was getting confused.
- It's cold. Please open the door!

382
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:20,510
I knew I had to check the outflow valve, but with no oxygen,

383
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,193
I just went to sleep.

384
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,601
When I woke up, everyone around me was unconcious.

385
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:44,561
With no air flow, everyone just went to sleep.

386
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:49,153
There  was nothing I could do, except watch them sleep.

387
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:57,470
And wait for them to die, one by one,

388
00:26:58,338 --> 00:27:00,230
wait for it to become a ghost flight.

389
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,402
It was my fault.

390
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:05,262
And that's all he knows.

391
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,602
And he's

392
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,283
telling you that right now?

393
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,733
Does it make any sense?

394
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,580
Yeah, it does. It's called hypoxia.

395
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,710
At that altitude when the cabin loses pressure, you've only got about 20 seconds

396
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:19,620
before your brain starts to shut down. You get confused, and you can't function.

397
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,351
Do you want to ask him anything?

398
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,070
Wha--

399
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,101
uh, no, no.

400
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:30,150
That's all for now. Thank you.

401
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:37,293
I can't believe this. Could I have just one more chance to do it again?

402
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,163
To check those valves by hand.

403
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:40,673
I wish you could.

404
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:43,680
I just can't believe it's all over.

405
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,003
My wife is sick.

406
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,593
I only took this run for the insurance, for the hours.

407
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:51,491
There are so many people

408
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:56,180
- who don't know that I love them.
- They may know more than you think.

409
00:27:58,736 --> 00:28:01,352
Right now you have to tell your passengers what happened.

410
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:02,982
- Oh, I can't.
- Why?

411
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:06,250
It was my mistake. It cost them their lives.

412
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,900
None of that matters right now.

413
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:12,362
We may not all know why we die, but everybody deserves to know how they died.

414
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,852
And you have to tell them so they can cross over.

415
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:28,580
Mommy.

416
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:31,020
Stop!

417
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,072
That's enough, guys.

418
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:39,491
Sorry.

419
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:40,670
Never mind.

420
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:44,363
My mommy is hurt.

421
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,262
Whoa, we got one. We got one!

422
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:48,960
She's in here.

423
00:28:58,347 --> 00:28:59,293
We got somebody.

424
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,453
Come on.

425
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,681
I'm right here, honey. It's all right.

426
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:04,930
Hey, you're gonna be ok.

427
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,293
Please.

428
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:19,883
It's ok, honey.

429
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,613
You got to go around the other side.

430
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,060
- Move the body.
- All right.

431
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:27,380
We're gonna take the girl out this side.

432
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:28,331
Go, go, go, go!

433
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:30,383
- Will, give me a board.
- Yeah, man.

434
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,620
It's a little tight at first. Easy. Easy.

435
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:47,422
Ok. All right.

436
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:52,142
All right.

437
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:53,640
Get her feet.

438
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:56,623
- Will, you got the board?
- Yeah, it's coming.

439
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,233
1, 2, 3.

440
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:26,043
You did all right.

441
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:34,073
Please, you have to tell my husband.

442
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,773
There are things he needs to know.

443
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:41,293
What things?

444
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,230
They said she's stable.

445
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,020
Hardly a mark on her.

446
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:50,203
They found my wife's body covering hers.

447
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:56,443
I saw you at the family center.

448
00:30:58,145 --> 00:30:59,391
It helped what you said.

449
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:00,821
I'm glad, Charlie.

450
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,532
You know things we don't.

451
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,482
I know your wife has a message for you.

452
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,661
- And for Kristen too.
- I don't understand.

453
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:11,760
I've seen her.

454
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:15,191
At the crash site, she was looking for Kristen.

455
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:18,943
She was there when they found her body, and

456
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,211
she's with her right now.

457
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,371
- What are you saying?
- You have to listen to me, Charlie.

458
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:30,611
She has some journals.

459
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:34,740
They're in the bedroom closet on the top shelf way in the back.

460
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:36,942
There's a lot of them.

461
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:40,970
She started writing them when she was Kristen's age.

462
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:44,352
Everything that happened to her, everything she felt.

463
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:47,953
The last entry was the day before she and Kristen left for their trip.

464
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,133
She wants you to give them to Kristen one

465
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:53,873
every year until she grows up.

466
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:57,882
And she wants you both to cry.

467
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,650
To let it out, and not hold anything back from each other.

468
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:05,123
You have to be Kristen's rock now.

469
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:08,182
- What if I can't?
- She knows that you're afraid,

470
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:13,162
but she believes that this is the way it's supposed to be. She's counting on you.

471
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,772
She said good-bye to Kristen.

472
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,343
She's gonna cross over now.

473
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,953
Tell her I can feel her.

474
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,632
She knows.

475
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,140
I better go.

476
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:44,183
Please, I want you to meet my daughter.

477
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:50,680
Hey, sweetie.

478
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:52,361
You feeling better?

479
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,070
Good.

480
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:55,420
This is Melinda Gordon.

481
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:57,283
Her husband found you.

482
00:32:57,596 --> 00:32:58,691
- And mom too?
- Yeah.

483
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:00,632
Your mom too.

484
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:03,023
I know my mom's gonna be all right.

485
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,372
How do you know that?

486
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:08,113
The same way I know you.

487
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,933
- Me?
- I saw you

488
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,853
in my dream.

489
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,363
What was your dream?

490
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:20,642
I saw light.

491
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:22,592
Really bright.

492
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,050
And then

493
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,081
this really nice man came to me.

494
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:28,223
I heard his voice in my head.

495
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,123
He said he was a guardian spirit

496
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,853
and his job was to take care of children like me.

497
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,070
He had to send me back.

498
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,261
He said that it wasn't my time yet

499
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,731
but I had to give a message to someone.

500
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:43,911
Who?

501
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:46,381
He showed me you.

502
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,470
Did he say anything else?

503
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:53,333
He told me to tell you that someone bad was here.

504
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:55,883
He said...

505
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,380
he said that he has to be stopped by you.

506
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,613
He said that...

507
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:06,712
you were the one.

508
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:16,620
It was my fault!

509
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:18,931
Everything I've just told you

510
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:24,151
happened because I forgot something very important in the preflight check.

511
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,390
I can tell you,

512
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:29,611
that you all just went to sleep.

513
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,073
There was no pain, no panic, no fear.

514
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,451
I know that this is really hard for all of you.

515
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:49,940
You need peace now, and the best thing for you to do is just to go into the light.

516
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:50,891
Really?

517
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:54,070
I beg to differ.

518
00:34:57,277 --> 00:35:00,932
- You can all stay right here.
- Yes, you can, but you shouldn't.

519
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,872
- There's nothing here for you anymore.
- That's a lie!

520
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,472
Your families are here.

521
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:13,731
Your friends.

522
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:16,760
Your homes.

523
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:21,131
No one knows what's on the other side. Why take that chance?

524
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:24,182
You are all meant to move on. That's why you died.

525
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:26,240
You died because the plane crashed.

526
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:28,360
The right thing to do is to cross over.

527
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:29,531
The right thing.

528
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:33,182
How many of you have done "the right thing?"

529
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:37,130
You.

530
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,732
Your wife is dying, isn't she.

531
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:45,872
You didn't take this job because you needed the hours. You took this job because

532
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,980
you hated to see her sick, to see her suffer.

533
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:50,290
Because you just needed to get away.

534
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,580
Don't feel so bad. I've done terrible things too.

535
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:58,552
Things you can't even imagine.

536
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:01,991
Just look around you.

537
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,210
All in a days work for me.

538
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,761
What if the only things waiting for you on the other side of that light

539
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,143
are judgment and punishment?

540
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,830
What's waiting there is peace and forgiveness.

541
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,332
Really?

542
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:21,522
Have you been?

543
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,042
No,

544
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:26,801
but I know it's true.

545
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,301
Wait a minute.

546
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:33,733
No.

547
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,003
Wait a minute!

548
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:38,712
I've devoted my life to this.

549
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,463
My grandmother devoted her life to this.

550
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:43,541
I've crossed over hundreds of souls.

551
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:46,091
And, no, maybe,

552
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,412
maybe I don't know what's behind the light, but

553
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:52,643
I have seen the faces of the people that I've crossed over.

554
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:54,313
I've seen their eyes

555
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:55,973
and their smiles.

556
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:57,601
I've seen them

557
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,791
weep for joy. I felt their peace.

558
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,641
You just have to have a little faith.

559
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:04,892
It's that simple.

560
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:07,081
You're not alone.

561
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,840
And all of this was meant to be, and the only thing that I know for sure is that

562
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:13,241
there is love there.

563
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:19,013
Love like you have never known here, and you can't just turn away from that.

564
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:27,963
Do you see it?

565
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:30,461
Why can I see that?

566
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:32,903
I don't know.

567
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,023
Maybe there are so many souls that

568
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:37,720
we're all meant to see it.

569
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:40,673
The people

570
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:43,403
that you love are waiting for you over there,

571
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:46,682
and they won't let anything bad happen to you.

572
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:48,901
Just please

573
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:50,292
look and see it.

574
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:09,103
Ok.

575
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,271
Ok.

576
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,033
Yes.

577
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:22,493
Yes.

578
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:57,992
- Are they all gone?
- No, some of them are staying.

579
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:29,711
You all right?

580
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,230
I'm a little better.

581
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:32,701
I'm just--

582
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:35,553
I'm so relieved that you didn't see Mitch crossing over.

583
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:36,593
You know, maybe,

584
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:38,912
maybe he's just stranded somewhere.

585
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,400
Andrea, there's...

586
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:54,532
something that you have to know.

587
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:58,462
Something that I've been trying to find a way to tell you.

588
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:01,142
You did see Mitch.

589
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:03,710
He's here.

590
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:07,061
Where?

591
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:08,750
Outside.

592
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:15,102
Mitch!

593
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,192
I'm so sorry, Mitch.

594
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:26,080
Mitch?

595
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,432
I was supposed to be on that plane, Melinda.

596
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:32,761
I took a later flight, but we got diverted to Boston.

597
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:35,910
- You got my message?
- Not till this morning.

598
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:37,992
I rented a car

599
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,142
and drove until I got here.

600
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:43,330
How'd it happen?

601
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:47,972
She was driving

602
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:51,003
to your apartment in the city.

603
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:53,933
She tried so hard to reach you.

604
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:59,111
I guess her car got caught in the path of the plane.

605
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:02,950
No.

606
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:04,911
Do you think she suffered?

607
00:42:05,928 --> 00:42:06,872
No.

608
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:11,633
No, I don't think so.

609
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:17,131
The whole drive here I kept reaching for the phone to call her.

610
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:25,781
I can't believe she's not up there.

611
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,813
Tell me this isn't true.

612
00:42:36,236 --> 00:42:37,190
I'm so sorry.

613
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:42,952
I tried to tell you,

614
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:46,471
but I didn't want to let you go.

615
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,943
I kept thinking it was a

616
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:51,411
dream and I was gonna

617
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:52,891
wake up.

618
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,721
This can't be happening.

619
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:02,653
I'm falling in love with a poet.

620
00:43:09,257 --> 00:43:10,901
It's my brother's birthday.

621
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,682
She wanted you to have this

622
00:43:22,655 --> 00:43:23,602
for your birthday.
