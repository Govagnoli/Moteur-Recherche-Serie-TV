1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
Previously on ghost whisperer.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,770
they're what's left over of old roads,alleyways,

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,800
they're what's left over of another town--underground.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,660
Dad!

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,460
You're alive.

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,050
It has to do with paul eastman.

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,180
You sent him to prison,only he escaped.

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,200
I've put a lot of people in jail, and none of them have come after me.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,860
What if he's hiding from someone, someone who he sent to prison?

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,680
What if he's just lying to protect me?

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,050
The man killed a little boy.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,980
He escaped during a prison fire.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,890
Facial burn victims wear a clear mask during treatment.

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,240
Paul eastman is dead.

15
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,330
He possessed my dad.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,810
He's just trying to get his revenge.

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,120
I have to warn my dad.

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,800
Dad?!

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh,my god!

20
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,070
Tom gordon!

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,490
Tom,we're coming in.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a gunshot victim.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,050
What are his vitals?

24
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,510
Tom,can you hear me?

25
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,110
tom?

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,050
I had to.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,600
I had to protect her,I had to.

28
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,150
Try to be quiet.

29
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,230
- It's all right. 
- I had to.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,380
Hey,hi.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,100
Your father's in critical condition, and the next 24 hours are key.

32
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,530
How could he be alive?

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,700
I saw him,I saw his head.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Cold feet.

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,620
He had the gun right against his temple, but he moved his hand just as he fired.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,760
Maybe he changed his mind at the last second.

37
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,750
Now the bullet had lodged under the scalp, but it didn't penetrate the skull.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,720
So he made it through surgery quick and easy.

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,490
Now all we have to do is watch and wait.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,510
Yeah.

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,370
It's all right.

42
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,960
Hey,thanks a lot,doc.

43
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,800
You got it.Just page me if you need me,

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,590
cause you know I never really leave this place.

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,810
- Hey. 
- Why would he do this?

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,940
I mean,he must have been possessed.

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,110
Look,before we brought him in, he said something to me.

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,250
He told me he did this to protect you.

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,460
Protect me?

50
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,750
From what?

51
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,040
Or who.

52
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,000
Paul eastman?

53
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,410
No,he's haunting my father.

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,820
Why would he be a threat to me?

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,440
Maybe that's a question for dear old dad.

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,880
Hey.

57
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,190
I don't really know if you can hear me,

58
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,400
but they told me maybe you could.

59
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,060
Look,dad,I'm--I'm really confused.

60
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,670
I don't know.

61
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,520
I don't know what you're supposed to mean to me.

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,580
I mean,you leave us when I'm 9,.

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,390
and then you just

64
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,230
come back.

65
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,320
No explanation,nothing.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,570
I don't really know what you think about me.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,040
Or what I really think about you.

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,450
So it's a really bad time to die,ok?

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,040
Because there's so much that we need to know about each other.

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,440
About everything.

71
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,590
Sorry.

72
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,900
There was a line out the door.

73
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,930
I have been doing things like this all day!

74
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,300
Hey,hey,don't worry about it.

75
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,870
But just don't try to pick it up.

76
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,330
I'm gonna get a broom.

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,580
Are you ok?

78
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,470
Yeah,yeah,whatever.

79
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,370
Hey,how is your dad?

80
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,630
Uh,resting comfortably or so they say, and if that's true,he's the only one.

81
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,430
What the hell is going on?

82
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,180
It's a long story,but I think my dad's being haunted by this man he sent to prison.

83
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,480
,an innocent man

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,010
Haunted how?

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,930
I think this ghost just figured out a way to possess people for a few minutes,

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,870
or at least long enough to get them to do the things he wants done.

87
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,700
Like your dad killing himself?

88
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,500
Yeah,that's one theory.

89
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,010
This does not taste like green tea.

90
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,410
Yeah,because you took mine.

91
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,700
Oh.Sorry.

92
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,030
What I don't understand is why now?

93
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,660
I mean,why would paul eastman wait 30 years to get vengeance?

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,610
Are you asking me like you actually expect an answer?

95
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,910
Yeah,well,you know what,you work on that for a while,and I'm gonna go get us some new glasses.

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,370
You know what,you need a break.

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,900
We really should go next week and see the tall ships come into the harbor at piermont,ok?

98
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,580
You mean do something fun?

99
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,010
I have no training for that.

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,780
It's settled!

101
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,930
We are going.

105
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,830
Paul?

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Paul eastman?

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,030
You don't really think this stuff scares me,do you?

108
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,070
Well,fear is a relative thing,I've always found.

109
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,900
I know that you've been possessing my father.

110
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,860
I know that you want revenge.

111
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,500
You blame him for sending you to prison.

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
Tip of the iceberg.

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,770
He tried to kill himself just to get rid of you.

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,270
He thinks you're trying to hurt me.

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,790
I know that you're the one that's been haunting me in my dreams.

116
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
Why don't you just leave him alone?

117
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,500
Give me your best shot.

118
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,500
It's touching that you believe your father to be so noble.

119
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,490
No,never said he was noble,

120
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,260
but I do believe that everyone deserves forgiveness.

121
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,110
He didn't set out to hurt you.

122
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,610
Your father didn't try to kill himself to save you;

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,980
he did it because I made him.

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,070
I put that gun to his head myself.

125
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,510
But he's strong,I'll give him that.

126
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,980
He saved himself.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,390
You really do hate him.

128
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,920
There are few who deserve hatred more than that man.

129
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,440
You have no idea.

130
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,010
So tell me.

131
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,530
I don't think I will.

132
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,620
And I don't think you'll believe me.

133
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,840
Try me.

134
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,760
Every journey begins with the first step.

135
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,990
Mom.

136
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,540
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,910
Nice to see you,too.

138
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,770
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

139
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,100
'Cause then I'd have to talk to whoever's calling.

140
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,810
That's clear.

141
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,310
Cold,but clear.

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,150
How's the new shop?

143
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,730
I like working with flowers.

144
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,540
They're beautiful,they smell nice.

145
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,270
And when they die,they don't come back with complaints.

146
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,720
Ok then.

147
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm not discussing your father.

148
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,240
Who says this is about him?

149
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,770
Maybe it's about something else altogether.

150
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,210
- Is it? 
- No,it's about dad.

151
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,370
I am not discussing your father.

152
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,560
Fine,let me talk then.

153
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,350
I found out that he prosecuted a man named paul eastman for murder,

154
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,350
only he was innocent,and his ghost is back trying to get revenge.

155
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,890
This is sounding a lot like a conversation about your father.

156
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,650
Did you know paul eastman?

157
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,600
I mean,did dad ever talk about him?

158
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,890
Why don't you ask him?

159
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,060
Well,he's got his hands full right now.

160
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,640
You know,bullet in the head and all that?

161
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,410
Not that you'd care.

162
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,100
It wasn't life-threatening.

163
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,370
It didn't even get past the scalp.

164
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,010
So you checked on him?

165
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,740
One phone call.

166
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,780
Look,melinda,I don't mean to sound hard-hearted about this,

167
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,290
but your father is not a good person.

168
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,910
He's not misunderstood.

169
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,790
He's just plain bad.

170
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,550
You need to accept that.

171
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,580
He doesn't deserve your good intentions.

172
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,420
He doesn't even.

173
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,700
I left the door unlocked.

174
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,890
I have to get back.

175
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
I cannot help you.

177
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,820
You have to look at the big picture here.

178
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,650
You can't just get caught up in where you are right now,

179
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,120
although that is the trap that we all seem to get caught up in.

180
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,420
You know,it's where am I, where am I going,what's going to happen.

181
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,540
These are--hello?!

182
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,220
You know,you should really be taking notes on this,my little friend.

183
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,110
I know you are not talking to that gerbil.

184
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,880
His name is bob,by the way,and,you know, I don't even know why I bother with this guy.

185
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,810
It's in one little ear,out the other with him.

186
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,810
How's your dad?

187
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,730
Stable,which is more than I can say for me.

188
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,290
Well,stability's overrated.

189
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,900
I wouldn't know.

190
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,990
Anyway,do you remember paul eastman, the guy who was haunting my father?

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,690
No,but if you hum a few bars.

192
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,980
He's not only haunting him,he's possessing him.

193
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,220
You know,like making him do all kinds of things,I don't know,trying to kill himself.

194
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,860
Well,the dead are really getting the hang of this.

195
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,160
That can't be good news for the living.

196
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,010
Yeah,and I've already talked to eastman, and he hates my father with a passion,

197
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
so I don't even know if I'm going to be able to turn this guy around.

198
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,200
And by the way,I found eastman's bones

199
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,480
buried in the basement of a house that his ghost led me to.

200
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,130
That's quite a "by the way" you just laid on me.

201
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,250
Did anything ordinary happen to you in the past few days?

202
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,400
Um,no.

203
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,110
I didn't think so.

204
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,180
Any ideas?

205
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,790
Well,no one's bones are found buried in someone's basement

206
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
if they died a nice,happy,peaceful death.

207
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,410
I think he was murdered and he wants you to solve it.

208
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,360
No,that's too simple.

209
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,370
I mean,he would have laid all that out for me first thing.

210
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,580
Whatever it is,he knows the answer,and he wants me to figure out the mystery for myself.

211
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,180
Why?

212
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,400
Because he said that I wouldn't believe him if he tried to tell me--

213
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,510
If that's for me,I already left.

214
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,170
Hello?

215
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,860
Hey,I found something in the archives.

216
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,330
That house you were in,where you found the bones.

217
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,110
you know that house.

218
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,260
No,I don'T.

219
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,180
Yeah,you do.

220
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,450
They might have changed the name on the street,but you know it.

221
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,180
How?

222
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,800
The name on the original deed is thomas and beth gordon.

223
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,060
It was your parents' first home.

224
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,880
What?£¡

225
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,670
Honey,it's the house you were born in.

226
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,760
bones?

227
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,050
As in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad owned.

228
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,380
That could have been there for a hundred years,for all you know.

229
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,330
Nice try.

230
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,880
Ok,the bones belong to that man that dad sent to prison,paul eastman.

231
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,120
He was the one that led me there,

232
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,980
and you're gonna act like you don't know what I'm talking about?

233
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,220
What difference does it make?

234
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,510
You never believe me anyway.

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,220
Why should I?

236
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,860
You never tell me the truth.

237
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,710
Then don't ask.

238
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,980
Just leave me in peace.

239
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,370
Peace is not an option noright All right?

240
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,180
Sooner or later,the police are going to get involved.

241
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,030
It happened at your house,they're coming to you.

242
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,310
You be may be implicated in a murder!

243
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,510
Melinda,I know you don't have much respect for what I say,

244
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,380
but I am asking you this one time to listen to me--

245
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,870
leave this alone.

246
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,610
There is no good for anybody at the end of this road.

247
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,420
Yeah,that's the difference between you and me.

248
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,360
I can't live with a lie.

249
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,200
You would be surprised at what you can learn to live with.

250
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,280
I didn't recognize anything in the basment.

251
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,430
It's really changed.

252
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,590
Well it's abandoned now.

253
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,240
You want to go inside?

254
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,750
No.

255
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,740
Too many bad memories?

256
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,270
Too many memories,period.

257
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,250
Now I've searched every online news site.

258
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,090
Paul eastman escaped from prison and was never heard from again.

259
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,010
Right.

260
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,600
Until he shows up as a skeleton in the house where you and your parents used to live.

261
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,170
It's crazy.

262
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,880
What is it?

263
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,750
I don't know.

264
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,450
I-I just don't know what I'm supposed to do next.

265
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,540
You know,I.

266
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,350
I just have this really bad feeling.

267
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,780
Like when I was a little girl waiting on my dad to do the right thing.

268
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,170
You know,or trying to figure out how to understand him.

269
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,040
And I just keep getting hurt, and then he walks away.

270
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,250
You know,I hate to say this, but maybe your mother's right.

271
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,480
Maybe it's time for you to cut him out of your life,

272
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,640
the way he cut you out of his.

273
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,930
I wish I could.

274
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,890
But I'm not him.

275
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
I gotta get back to the store,

276
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,460
- I'll see you later. - Ok.

277
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,750
- Yeah? 
- Hey,jim,dr.Farrington,

278
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,950
just giving you a head's up in case the hospital hasn't called.

279
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,580
Tell melinda that her dad is conscious and talking.

280
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,430
Yeah.

281
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll do that.

282
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,250
Sorry,I'm just a little dizzy.

283
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
Hey,boss,do you mind,uh,this is my father-in-law.

284
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,020
Do you mind if we,uh, take a walk to my-- thanks a lot.

285
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,240
Jim clancy.

286
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,180
I heard so much about you.

287
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,370
It's if I knew you.

288
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,470
You don't know me,tom.

289
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,910
You know nothing about me.

290
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,090
Come on.

291
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
You know,unlike melinda, I got nothing invested in you,zero.

292
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,520
You're just the guy who's put my wife through a world of pain.

293
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,620
She'd be much better off if you never took another breath.

294
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,760
I almost obliged,didn't I?

295
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,770
Yeah,but you missed.

296
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,610
And then you tell me you did it to protect her?

297
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
I'm having trouble believing that.

298
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,820
I misspoke.

299
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Do not mess with melinda's head.

300
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,880
I won't have that.

301
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,670
I've always had to stand by,

302
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,930
watch her tossed around and hurt by things I don't understand,

303
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,500
but you. you'll understand.

304
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,990
I don't think you do.

305
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,070
Oh,I think so.

306
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,890
And I think you're gonna start telling me the truth,

307
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,540
or I'm gonna come back here when you are sound asleep in your room,

308
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,460
and I'm gonna cut some very important tubes and watch you die for real,tom.

309
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,030
But jim.

310
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,380
you're sworn to save lives.

311
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,440
Comes out a roaring second compared to saving my wife.

312
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,920
It all goes back to paul eastman.

313
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,240
He spent 9 years in prison,then he escaped.

314
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,900
Came to find me,actually beth and me and melinda.

315
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,020
The thing is,prison didn't agree with him.

316
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,800
He was demented,and he wanted revenge.

317
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,260
He was going to kill my wife and daughter.

318
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,610
And me,too.

319
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,490
Could have done a lot of things.

320
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,750
I could have called the cops.

321
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,080
Could have drove his body to the mountains and dumped it.

322
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,600
I wanted to keep him right there.

323
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,340
I wanted to always know where he was.

324
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,960
Wanted to keep this in the family.

325
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,800
You were the assistant district attorney.

326
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,620
Why didn't you call the police?

327
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,630
It seems like a pretty clear case of self defense.

328
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,440
Maybe.

329
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,340
But it would have been a big media story.

330
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,780
And how would melinda have processed all this?

331
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,300
She was 9.

332
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,640
What if she got harassed about it at school, or had reporters following her?

333
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,940
So you see,just like you,my friend,

334
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,550
burying a body came in a roaring second to protecting my family.

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,580
Oh,yeah.

336
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,080
Is that why you left them right after that?

337
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,530
There's never only one reason for these things.

338
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,120
The important thing both of us have to remember is this--

339
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,050
paul eastman still wants to kill me.

340
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,950
from the grave.

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,590
The problem with that is?

342
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,440
I don't expect anybody to cry any tears over me,but he still wants to kill beth,

343
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,430
and he still wants to kill melinda.

344
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,570
And I don't know how to stop him.

345
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,080
Do you?

346
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,560
My father admitted to you that he's a killer?

347
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,450
I know this seems like an episode of father knows best gone horribly wrong,

348
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,320
and I am the last guy to defend your dad,

349
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,670
but it does look like a case of self defense.

350
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,200
So I guess we know why paul eastman was haunting him.

351
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,260
Hey,correction-- haunting you,mel.

352
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,810
Your dad told me this guy wants to hurt you,your mom,and him,

353
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,200
and by hurt,I don't mean just push and shove,ok?

354
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,170
Yeah,I know.I convinced my dad to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger.

355
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,690
You know,that's what I don't understand.

356
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,620
Paul eastman,he's a powerful ghost,right?

357
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,980
So why hasn't he possessed you?

358
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,810
Why hasn't he really come after you?

359
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,690
For one,he obviously has things he wants me to find out first.

360
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,330
Yeah,like what?

361
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,950
Since I'm still alive,I don't know yet.

362
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,080
Not a big fan of the gallows humor when it concerns your safety.

363
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,210
That would have been pretty impressive if it had been bourbon.

364
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,690
Pinot grigio has a pretty big kick.

365
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,950
What are you going to do?

366
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,600
There's only one way to get him to cross over.

367
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,160
Ok,I think I can make it from here.

368
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,450
Good enough,thanks.

369
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,100
I didn't expect you to get out so soon.

370
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,650
Signed myself out.

371
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,270
There's too many sick people in that hospital.

372
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,850
I need you to let me take you to paul eastman.

373
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,870
-Serves no purpose. 
-Is it true.

374
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,030
Was he really going to kill mom and me.

375
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,930
Just a second.

376
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,590
Melinda,it's a little late.

377
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,710
for me to be a hero in your eyes.

378
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,800
I did what I had to do,that's all.

379
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,420
I saved myself as well.

380
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,040
I heard what you said in there.

381
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,400
When.

382
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,080
When you came to my hospital room.

383
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,990
A moment of weakness.

384
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,970
Understood.

385
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,180
Am I ever going to find out.

386
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,790
Find out what.

387
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,660
Who you are.

388
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,520
If you ever loved me.

389
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,740
If you ever loved mom.

390
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,450
If you love me now.

391
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,630
-Melinda,it's so complicated 
- no,it really isn'T.

392
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,660
Everybody always says that,but.

393
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,150
at the end of the day,it's pretty damn simple.

394
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,960
Either love is there or isn'T.

395
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,440
No excuse,no qualifications,no complications.

396
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,430
Why do you want me to talk to paul eastman.

397
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,870
I want you to apologize to him.

398
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,090
I want you to tell him why you did what you did.

399
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,330
I want you to have closure.

400
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,890
with at least one person.

401
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,480
And maybe he'll leave us alone.

402
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,200
That's the only way any of this is going to end.

403
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,700
All right.I don't think it's going to help,but if you do,I will.

404
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,330
I'll come to your shop tonight,and after it's over,we'll talk.

405
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,790
And I'll tell you everything that you want to know about me,about us.

406
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,280
No more complications.

407
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,340
Dad.

408
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,870
Hey.I was just walking by,I saw the lights on.

409
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,820
-Everything ok. 
-Yeah.

410
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,920
Sorry,I thought you were someone else.

411
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,170
-Who. -No one worth talking about.

412
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,270
Thanks.

413
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,900
He's gonna hurt her,you know.

414
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,020
-What.
-She has to know.

415
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,970
It's the only way you can save her.

416
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,360
And she has to hear it from you.

417
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,120
Don't let her find out from tom.

418
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,080
You know what he's capable of.

419
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,890
She's safer not knowing.

420
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,350
Not anymore.

421
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,280
Oh,I hope you have some bourbon and a straw.

422
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,210
You won't believe the day I had.

423
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,000
I haven't told you the truth.

424
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,370
No kidding.

425
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,800
About what.

426
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,530
About a lot of things.

427
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,300
I lied about not knowing paul eastman.

428
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,630
I was in love with him.

429
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,010
We were engaged.

430
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,850
I was living with him when he was arrested.

431
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,470
Paul and I had been living together for about a year.

432
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,630
I knew he wasn't guilty of that murder.

433
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,480
I knew that a ghost had led him to that boy's body.

434
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,500
But who was going to believe that.

435
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,830
So you went to the prosecutor.

436
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,100
-that's how you met dad. 
-Yes.

437
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,400
After he was convicted.

438
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,830
I never expected him to believe me.

439
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,500
I had to show him the ghost in his own office before he did.

440
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,300
-Where is he. 
-Right there,in the corner.

441
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,750
What's he wearing.

442
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,400
He's wearing a brown suit,uh,probably from the late 1800s.

443
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:38,600
He's got a gray beard,white hair,uh,long,and glasses.

444
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,950
You just described mr.Mclaughlin.

445
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,810
This was his office like a hundred years ago.

446
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,330
Of course,then he did believe me,

447
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,040
and he realized it was possible that paul was innocent.

448
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,000
I told paul that there was hope;

449
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,650
that tom was doing everything he could to find evidence to exonerate him.

450
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,110
Paul was the love of my life.

451
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,530
When he went to prison,it was like.

452
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,850
I died inside.

453
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,160
I didn't want to.

454
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,960
I tried to fight it,but I started having feelings for tom.

455
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,750
I thought he was such a good man.

456
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,800
Paul was going more and more inside himself,and.

457
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
and there was tom gordon.

458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,720
Centered,very sure of himself.

459
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,410
And he cared,or at least he did the best imitation of someone who cared that I'd ever seen.

460
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,330
How did you tell paul.

461
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,190
I didn'T.

462
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,130
How could you not tell him.

463
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,050
I was confused.

464
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,610
I felt guilty.

465
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,920
His letters were getting so angry and bitter.

466
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,340
I was trying to figure out how to tell him.

467
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,820
And then he killed a man in prison.

468
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,350
He was never gonna get out then.

469
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,600
It was over for him.

470
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,530
And you married dad.

471
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,790
I'm not proud of any of this,melinda.

472
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,750
I'm not judging you,mom,really.I'm not.

473
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,540
How did paul find you after he escaped from prison.

474
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,600
He read something in the newspaper about tom's career,

475
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,760
and in the article it mentioned me and.

476
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,040
and that we had a daughter.

477
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,720
He started a fire.

478
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,370
Undedhe ep getting badly burned.

479
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:42,840
And when he was in the hospital ward,he managed to escape.

480
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,750
He found us.

481
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,280
Well,I guess you know the rest.

482
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,270
Do we know the rest.

483
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,790
I mean,do we,beth.

484
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,240
Or are we just going to wait around for you to tell us the next big missing piece in melinda's life.

485
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,420
-Jim,don'T.
-No,you know what,I'm sick of this.

486
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:04,880
I am sick of people like you and like her father who should have been protecting her.

487
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,170
Who should still be watching out for her instead of lying to her.

488
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,200
I mean,playing mind games with her when she's in danger.

489
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,260
Jim,this isn't helping.

490
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,300
Beth,all she ever wanted from you was for you to accept her as she is.

491
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,350
And maybe from her father,maybe an explanation.

492
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,660
You know.How do you walk out on a family.

493
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
And for all that,I mean,look at her.

494
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,220
She still wants to understand.

495
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,820
She still wants to forgive.

496
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,770
But every time she opens her heart to you,you stick a knife in it.

497
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,720
Beth,you ran away from everything you could do in your life.

498
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,700
My wife runs toward it.

499
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,640
And for that,she deserves just the littlest bit of respect.

500
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,810
You know,a little truth.

501
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,090
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,860
-Mom,I -no.He's right.

503
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,980
You're right.

504
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,130
There is another missing piece.

505
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,530
What.

506
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,390
When paul was arrested.

507
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,110
I was pregnant.

508
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,220
Mom,what are you saying.

509
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,900
I was pregnant with you.

510
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,900
Paul eastman is my father.

511
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,390
You're lying.

512
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,840
No.

513
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,100
We didn't tell you.

514
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,770
We didn't tell anyone.

515
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:34,550
Tom wanted you and he wasn't afraid that you might have this thing,this so-called gift.

516
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680
You're lying.

517
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,080
You're lying.

518
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,290
Is it true.

519
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,740
Is what true.

520
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,820
That you're not my father.

521
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,930
If you say it's complicated,I will kill you right here.

522
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,650
Your mother's trying to drive a wedge between us.

523
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,330
You can see that,can't you.

524
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,640
No one will tell me the truth.

525
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,890
Come with me,and I will.

526
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,060
Come with you where.

527
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,010
A place where you'll be safe.

528
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,870
Safe.Right.

529
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,440
Look.I'm sorry.

530
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,440
I really am.

531
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,220
This whole thing is such a mess.

532
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,880
I never meant for you to be involved.

533
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,500
Not like this.

534
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,620
Come with me,and you'll understand everything.

535
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:41,220
I'm curious,what do you remember about that night,the night paul eastman came here.

536
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,350
Not much.

537
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,180
Just his face,with that horrible mask leaning over me.I was scared.

538
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,430
-What else. 
-That's all,why.

539
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,490
Could be important.

540
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,930
What I remember.

541
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,670
Why don't you go upstairs and see if your room jogs anything.

542
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,320
Your bed was right over there.

543
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,800
You never even heard him come in.

544
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,440
Did you see him leave.

545
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,930
No.I just went back to sleep.

546
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,160
-You sure. 
-Yeah.Yeah,I.

547
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,430
that's it.

548
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,190
The breaking glass,it woke me up.

549
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,460
And then.

550
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,310
And then the voices.

551
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,870
You can't just show up here and

552
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,940
What'd you think I'd do,make an appointment.

553
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,000
I can't help you.There's nothing I can do.

554
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,700
You know why I'm here.

555
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,680
I saw all the files.

556
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
All the court records.

557
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,310
You never lifted a finger to help me.

558
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,730
Everything thatd ou tol ybeth that you were doing for me,that was all a lie.

559
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,260
You wanted to keep me in prison.

560
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,450
Keep your voice down.

561
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,110
What do you think beth is going to say when she finds out that you hired that other prisoner to kill me,

562
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,940
that you wanted me dead so that you could have her all to yourself.

563
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,690
She'll never believe you,but you do what you have to do.

564
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,890
I will.

565
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,240
It's funny how memories mecan co rushing back.

566
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,700
What are you doing.

567
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,320
I'm sorry,melinda,but the thing is.

568
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,610
I just can't let you live now.

569
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,920
Wait.You knew paul eastman was innocent,and you kept him in jail.

570
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,150
Innocence is kind of a broad concept at times.

571
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,070
Besides,your mother wanted me and not some needy,haunted guy.

572
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,260
So I just.

573
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,930
made sure he stayed where he belonged.

574
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,360
But your mother,she's nothing if not devoted.

575
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,280
She just wouldn'T.

576
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,410
give up on that guy.

577
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,960
So you tried to have him killed in prison.

578
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,780
When they told me that paul killed that guy instead.

579
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,080
He had more on the ball than I thought he did.

580
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,490
It was a win-win in any case.

581
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,400
He was convicted for that murder,too.

582
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,950
Your mother and I,well,not exactly happily ever after,I guess,but still,it's nice to.

583
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,120
win.

584
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,230
So why did you come back here.

585
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,650
Why wouldn't you just leave me alone.

586
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,980
Because you had to go and find the underground,wake up paul eastman.

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,400
You know what your problem is,melinda.

588
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,340
You're just too good for your own good.

589
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,900
I kept hoping that you would get scared off.

590
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,720
But you don't scare easily,do you.

591
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,130
Dad,please.dad.

592
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,910
Don't call me dad.

593
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,570
I'm not your father.

594
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,140
I wasn't talking to you.

595
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,030
No.No.

596
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,420
-Hey,are you all right. 
-Yeah,I'm all right.

597
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,960
How did you find me.I looked everywhere.

598
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,120
But then I thought,you're looking for eastman's ghost here,with the bones.

599
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,860
He's dead.

600
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,680
You're my father.

601
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,030
Have you always known.

602
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,010
After I died,I forgot almost everything about my life.

603
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:49,110
It was like I'd become paralyzed,stuck down below with all of the other angry,bitter spirits.

604
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,590
But then I saw something.

605
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,810
Something that changed everything.

606
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,430
It woke me up.

607
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,100
-What. 
-You.

608
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,130
I saw you moving through the church,and I knew instantly.

609
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,410
I felt that you were from me.

610
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,140
You were so beautiful.

611
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,910
The more I watched you,the more I saw how you pined for the man that you thought was your father

612
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,680
how you were waiting for him to love you back,

613
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,560
and I knew that I could nerve compete with your idea of him,

614
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,360
so I had to try and make you destroy that myth yourself.

615
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,100
You could have told me this so much sooner.

616
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,610
You would never have believed me.

617
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:47,510
This was a journey you had to take on your own.With my help.

618
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,890
You've spent so much time trying to understand the man who pretended to be your father,

619
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,630
you never saw the one person who was right in front of your eyes.

620
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,610
I've tried.

621
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,590
But she always pushes me away.

622
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,920
And she lies about everything.

623
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,680
She only wanted to protect you.

624
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,890
That's what mothers do.

625
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,300
But you've only.looked at her in the shadow of tom gordon.

626
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,850
But she has always put you first.

627
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,050
It's time.to make things right.

628
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,580
Be too good for your own good.

629
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,890
I don't blame you for hating me.

630
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,160
Mom,I could never hate you.

631
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,120
You're busy fighting your own battles.

632
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:56,950
You always believed in him.I just didn't see how I could take that away from you.

633
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,410
Mom,I'm relieved.

634
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,240
My father didn't abandon me.

635
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,660
At least not by choice.

636
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:14,700
And to know that he would have wanted me if he could have,makes all the difference.

637
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,230
Somewhere,deep down inside,I always felt like I was disposable.

638
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,550
Now I don'T.

639
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,470
Go.

640
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,330
You never were fond of seeing ghosts,were you.

641
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,860
I'll make an exception today.

642
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,930
How can I ever ask you to forgive me.

643
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,180
I was so full of rage.

644
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,030
at you and him.

645
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,010
I just wanted you all to feel as much pain as I did,

646
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,850
but that all went away with just one word.

647
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,990
What.

648
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,950
"Dad.

649
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:19,690
" When my daughter called for me,when she needed me,

650
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,700
all the fury went away,and I just wanted to save her.

651
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,260
-If I could do this all over again 
- I wouldn't change a thing

652
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,780
Look at what we created.

653
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,920
She's the reason we came together.

654
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,270
Nothing else matters.

655
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,140
Nothing.

656
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,990
-The light. 
-Yeah.It's getting brighter.

657
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,740
But there's so much that.

658
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,790
-I need to know. 
-No.There isn'T.

659
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,880
You're loved.

660
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,930
That's all,that's everything.

661
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,900
And so am I.

662
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,950
-Clean slate. 
-Clean slate.

663
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,620
You know,um,we're all going to watch the tall ships come in.

664
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,030
Would you like to come.

665
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,020
Oh,no,you--you go on with your friends.

666
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,790
-It's all right. 
-It's friends and family.

667
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,610
Ok.

668
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,700
Have I ever told you how proud I am to be your mother.

669
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,760
You are my mother,right.

670
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,630
Yes.I am definitely your mother.

671
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,540
- what. 
-That's weird.

672
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,530
There's six of us,but.

673
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,040
there's only five shadows.
