00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,928
<i>previously
on ghost whisperer.</i>

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,767
how come you
can see me and they can't?

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,273
that's a long story.

4
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:09,615
there's
a better place for you.

5
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,044
well, that means
there's someone else
out there...

6
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:19,358
like me?
i know!

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:20,702
it's the 5 signs.

8
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,508
the dead dove
on the doorstep.
the bee.

9
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:24,224
the writing
on jim's back.

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,178
the dead will walk.

11
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,618
and now, the forgotten
have returned.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,630
wait, so, all 5 of
those things have happened.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,901
not the writing
on your back.

14
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:32,107
it was latin.

15
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:33,692
it translates to,
"death of a loved one."

16
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,491
what is this?

17
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,063
what are you doing
with all these spirits?

18
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:43,071
we're getting ready.
for what?

19
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:44,148
for what's coming.

20
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:47,843
he's been planning this
for quite some time.

21
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,968
no, this is
bigger than just him.

22
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:26,170
hey!

23
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,715
you shouldn't be here.

24
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:59,363
why not?

25
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,584
this is your fault.

26
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:20,730
no.

27
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:34,867
yeah?

28
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,672
hey, sorry,
i got lonely.

29
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:38,480
everybody's healthy
in grandview tonight.

30
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:40,335
i got no work.

31
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,739
i can't believe
i have a week of this.

32
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:44,418
what time is it?

33
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:46,659
4:10.

34
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:48,270
delia!
what?

35
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,978
i have to call you back.

36
00:02:58,786 --> 00:02:59,719
hello?

37
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,805
it's melinda,
i'm so sorry.

38
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,912
what time is it?

39
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,022
10 after 4:00.
i'm so sorry,

40
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:09,998
i just--
i need to know
that you're ok.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,314
well, i'm not.

42
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,353
you're not?

43
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,124
no, i'm awake
at 10 after 4:00.

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
why are you
doing this to me?

45
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:16,940
ok, i'm--i'm sorry.

46
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,047
go back to sleep.

47
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,852
ok, wait,
are you ok?

48
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:21,866
i'm fine.

49
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,305
forget i called.

50
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,312
all right,
good night,

51
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,617
good morning,
good bye.

52
00:03:56,037 --> 00:04:06,037
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

53
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:16,086
<font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@
sync:frm@illuminatorl</font>

54
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,748
once again
you have proven to be
my best customer.

55
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,938
this is a birthday gift
that ned will never expect.

56
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,718
you know, do you think
he's going to get it?

57
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,161
i mean,
will he know what it is?

58
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,635
oh, yeah, this is
all making a comeback.

59
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,846
because they discovered

60
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,019
vinyl produces
a better sound than digital.

61
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,530
can you believe that?
do they still make vinyl?

62
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:51,040
well, you know,
it's hard to find,
but it's out there.

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,174
besides, i still have
my whole collection
in a box somewhere.

64
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,317
right, i bet ned
can't wait to listen
to tom jones and neil young.

65
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,414
ok, so, we'll skip
my collection,

66
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,991
but a lot of bands
are releasing on vinyl
these days.

67
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,879
you know what?
i think it's great,
totally original.

68
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,726
hey....

69
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:08,535
did i dream
that phone call last night?

70
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,497
yes, you did.

71
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:13,336
oh, you are such a liar.

72
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,180
what was that?
were you sleep-dialing?

73
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,089
nothing, i just--

74
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:18,271
i just had
a weird dream.

75
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,345
about me?

76
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,195
i don't remember

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,334
what it was about.

78
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,040
but don't worry, ok?

79
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,548
now, when are you going
to give this to ned?

80
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,389
oh, well, tim is
trying to find
some really cool records.

81
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,902
before his birthday,
i hope.

82
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:33,143
so, that's going well?

83
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,594
yeah, i mean,
i don't know,

84
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,597
it just kinda
feels comfortable.

85
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:40,708
you know?

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,881
even if we're
just sitting there,

87
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:45,485
not even talking,
it just feels right.

88
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:47,303
that's great.

89
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,044
yeah, well, baby steps.

90
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,057
hey, do you mind
if i hide this in the back?

91
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,466
uh, if you can find
a place for it

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,473
in the black hole
back there,

93
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:55,478
be my guest.

94
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,406
hey! you know what?

95
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,710
i'm going to go
get some coffee,
do you want something?

96
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,829
yeah, that'd be great.
surprise me.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,474
ok.

98
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:35,444
who are you?

99
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,426
they told me
you would know.

100
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,089
who told you?

101
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,131
they said you would help.

102
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,871
i don't understand.

103
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,172
mary o'connell.

104
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,554
mary o'connell?

105
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,297
that was the beginning.

106
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:51,319
the beginning of what?

107
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,680
you remember what happened,
don't you, lynn?

108
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,525
don't you remember?

109
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,967
that day, the accident?

110
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:24,778
your dad
tells me you've been

111
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,354
making these drawings
ever since.

112
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,704
well, tell me, please,
why have you been
making these drawings?

113
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,323
'cause i have to.

114
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:37,598
but why do you have to?

115
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,180
it's in my head,
isn't it?

116
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,859
every day, i have to.

117
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:21,622
same as it never was.

118
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:22,746
hey, it's me,
i'm looking right at you.

119
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:25,503
i forgot to ask
if you wanted anything
from java?

120
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,343
uh, no, i'm good.
you go ahead.

121
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,583
you know,
i think i'll wait.

122
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,871
i want to try
and get a head start--

123
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,757
whoa!

124
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,410
i am so sorry.

125
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,787
are you ok?

126
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,480
i didn't even see you.

127
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:42,727
no, it really was my fault,

128
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,338
i wasn't even
paying attention.

129
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,885
stay off cell phones.

130
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,065
delia, are you all right?

131
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,707
do you want to just
go sit for a minute?

132
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,720
no, i'm ok, really,
please, i'm fine.

133
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:55,104
it was a close call,
but that's it.

134
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,139
hey, everything's fine.

135
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,323
next show is 2 p.m.

136
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,731
i'm going
to be here all week.

137
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,010
it's fine, please,
i'm gonna just, um...

138
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,436
i'm going to go
sit down in the shop.

139
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,720
ok, i get it.
it's about water.

140
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,842
all right, so this woman
died on a ferry 2 years ago,

141
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,963
or maybe she didn't,
maybe she doesn't
know how she died,

142
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,347
and you have to tell her,
i don't know.

143
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,958
it sounds
simple to me, whatever.

144
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:13,212
yeah, but what about
the visions
of impending death?

145
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:14,881
you think they all
refer to delia?

146
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,074
look, there were
5 signs this past year.

147
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,891
the dead dove, the bee,
the dead will walk,

148
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,440
the return
of the forgotten.

149
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,553
the only thing
that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

150
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,303
don't you think that
it--it could be related?

151
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,517
how do i know? you're
the one that gets
all the neat visions.

152
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,568
you drink the champagne,
i only get the hangover.

153
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,187
sorry,
guess i caught you
at a bad time.

154
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:32,773
oh, no, no, you caught me
at a great time.

155
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,262
you seem to be packing.

156
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,340
yes, i'm packing.

157
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,383
i am going
on a sabbatical.

158
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,000
i have
a fantastic opportunity

159
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,980
to do research
in a peruvian jungle.

160
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,778
just like that,
up and gone?

161
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:44,893
just like that.

162
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:45,795
nothing supernatural,
either.

163
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:47,669
although, i should check
and see if jungle insects
have souls,

164
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,951
i'd hate to be haunted
by an earth-bound cicada.

165
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:55,249
you know we never really...

166
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:59,214
we never got to talk about
everything that happened.

167
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:03,378
talking's not always
the best thing.

168
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,079
i'm in that odd place
where i may speak

169
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:09,268
the unadulterated truth
about everything
i think and feel.

170
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:11,244
can't have that.

171
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,284
no, we can't have that.

172
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,885
anyway, nope,
this is going to be great.

173
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:20,005
really a--just a great time
for me to take a break.

174
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:21,944
i mean you do this
10 times a week.

175
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,945
you know,
you talk to ghosts,
argue with ghosts,

176
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,443
you get your heart
broken by a ghost,

177
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,723
but for us mere mortals,
come on.

178
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,215
hey, hey, hey, come on.

179
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,240
this is a good thing,
be happy for me.

180
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:34,823
i'm going to be doing
what i do and loving it.

181
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,803
i hope you'll
keep in touch.

182
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:37,736
maybe, maybe not.

183
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,848
maybe we'll just
be 2 ships passing
in the night.

184
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,242
don't say ships.

185
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,871
hey, good morning.

186
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:50,881
oh, thank you!

187
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,200
boy, do i need this.

188
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,418
yeah, you don't look like
you got enough sleep.

189
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:57,402
you look great, too.

190
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,962

191
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:02,513
nice backpedal.

192
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,426
listen, i really have
to talk to you.

193
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,091
ok.

194
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,463

look what i found.

195
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:09,949
<i>pink floyd
wish you were here,</i>

196
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,370
<i>led zep 4.</i>

197
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,346
mint condition,
still shrink-wrapped.

198
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,128
those are great.

199
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:16,898
where did you find these?

200
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,808
i'd rather not say.

201
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,667
in case i outlive
my usefulness, someday.

202
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,822
that way you'll
always come back to me

203
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,398
for the vinyl.

204
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:26,710
this is fantastic.

205
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:29,155
now all we need
is some today vinyl.

206
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,774
you know, bands ned
has actually heard of.

207
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,388
i'm all over it.

208
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,337
hey, you said
you needed to talk
to me about something?

209
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,993
oh, no, no,
never mind.

210
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,603
come for lunch?

211
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,313
i've got invoices
to do, but hey,

212
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:41,628
bring me back
something gooey.

213
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,505
all right.

214
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,134
bye.
buh-bye.

215
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:22,828
look, no offence,

216
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:25,204
but we're going
to have to wrap this up,

217
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,024
i don't have
flood insurance.

218
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,955
i know that you
died in a ferry accident
in england.

219
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,288
do you remember
anything about it?

220
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,987
the water
took my breath away.

221
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,762
i was so scared.

222
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:44,377
i'm alone now.

223
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,490
is there
something you need?

224
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,801
someone i can contact?

225
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:47,912
you can't help me.

226
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,253
why not?

227
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,764
i have to help you.

228
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:53,292
how can you help me?

229
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,073
is this a warning?

230
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,659
are you trying to tell me
something about my friend?

231
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,513
all eyes will be on you.

232
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,844
what do you mean?

233
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:04,692
i have to go
to the other place.

234
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:08,648
ok...

235
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,918
next time, bring a mop.

236
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,603
you say she's been
doing this for how long?

237
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,159
since the accident.

238
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:29,737
every day,
every single day.

239
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,011
can you ask her
why she keeps making these?

240
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,777
she says she has to.

241
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:15,860
it is in her head,
and she has to get it out.

242
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,856
it's too girly.

243
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:40,521
shush.

244
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,764
what do you want,
football helmets
on the curtains?

245
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,286
i don't want
curtains at all.

246
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,299
why do you want
to cover the windows?

247
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,631
i don't want to cover them,

248
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,752
i want to enhance them.

249
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,362
this house has had
enough enhancement.

250
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,405
when do we say,
"finished"?

251
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,324
ah, never.

252
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:54,673
why do i have the feeling

253
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,350
that the words "never"
and "home improvement"

254
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,630
go hand-in-hand
together, forever?

255
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:58,341
you know what?

256
00:18:58,348 --> 00:18:59,615
you are very impatient.

257
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,893
ok, it takes a while
to make a house a home.

258
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,932
it took a while to make
this house a house.

259
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:04,936
aren't you late for work?

260
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:06,749
fine.

261
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:08,619
you know
what my theory is?

262
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,662
that window treatments
destroy marriages?

263
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,636
well, yeah, that's
one of my theories.

264
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,582
but...

265
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,032
you're nervous,

266
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,677
and you're
distracted by something,

267
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,991
and that's why
the house is getting
another makeover.

268
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:24,351
hmm, i was hoping
to appear industrious.

269
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,245
well, you hoped wrong.

270
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:30,349
i just keep getting
these weird visions,

271
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,810
and there's
this strange ghost.

272
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,222
strange ghost, huh?

273
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,941
she keeps
showing me things,
and i don't know why.

274
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,598
it's like she's sad
and in mourning.

275
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,471
well, you think she's
trying to warn you
about something?

276
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,269
i don't usually get
stuff about the future.

277
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,031
you did last year.

278
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,708
that turned out
to be right.

279
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,523
i just know that i'm
not going to rest easy

280
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:50,668
until
i can figure this out.

281
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:51,945
and i will.

282
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,388
and until then,
we get curtains?

283
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:54,466
exactly!

284
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,446
what is this place?

285
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,092
part of it.

286
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,272
of what?

287
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,280
of what you have to know.

288
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:50,126
what i have to show you.

289
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,744
who sent you to me?

290
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,170
they won't let me
see my husband.

291
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:58,152
not until
i show you everything.

292
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:13,637
so what do you think?

293
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,730
how many times
do i have to explain

294
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,373
the meaning of the word
"sabbatical" to you?

295
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:17,820
definition--
leave with pay

296
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,031
for teacher or professor

297
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:21,342
for extended period
of study or rest.

298
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:22,694
alternate definition--

299
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:25,538
an excuse for a confused
and troubled man

300
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,261
who wants to forget
about his real life

301
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:30,142
and go and study
cicadas instead.

302
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,265
don't forget
the "with pay" part.

303
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:33,282
you know,
have you ever thought about

304
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,057
new curtains
for this room?

305
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:37,338
i don't think i've thought
about curtains, period.

306
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:39,447
there might be more
to these visions

307
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:40,623
than just
a ferry accident.

308
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,066
well, you know what?

309
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,178
these visions might not
be about just some ghost.

310
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,195
you might have
a prophet ghost.

311
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:47,211
ooh, that's a new one.

312
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:48,686
prophet ghosts
are very common

313
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:49,899
in all mythologies.

314
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:52,208
i mean, ulysses
consulted a prophet ghost

315
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:53,394
<i>for homer's odyssey.</i>

316
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:54,436
native american traditions

317
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:55,745
are rich
with prophet ghosts.

318
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:57,456
let's not forget about
that rockin' trio--

319
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,339
the ghosts of christmas
past, present, and future.

320
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:01,563
so dickens knew about
the prophet ghosts

321
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,526
and i don't?

322
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,356
well, he didn't know
much about curtains,

323
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:05,472
so i guess
it all evens out.

324
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:06,714
can i just say
that this sabbatical

325
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,057
has not improved
your mood?

326
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,304
here's another theory.
how about this?

327
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,551
how about your dreams aren't
really about the accidents.

328
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,737
they're about the symbolism
behind the accidents.

329
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:15,307
such as?

330
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,612
well, you have a ferry
and a water motif,

331
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:18,802
which makes me think
of the river styx.

332
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:21,517
in greek mythology,
it's the river that separates
the living from the dead.

333
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:24,772
souls are ferried
across the river
into the underworld.

334
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:25,966
what about last night?

335
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:27,079
it was like there was

336
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:28,273
some kind of
mining accident.

337
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,347
yeah, but you said
they were all wearing
suits and ties.

338
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:31,416
i would think that
suits and ties in a mine

339
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,903
would be sort of
a fashion don't.

340
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:35,458
a tunnel collapse then?

341
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:36,836
a tunnel.
now you're talking.

342
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,546
that's the classic symbol
for crossing over.

343
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,121
there were souls
following the light.

344
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:42,102
it seems like someone's
trying to get you

345
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,652
to intercede in something.

346
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,067
what?

347
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:48,867
whatever's...coming.

348
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,438
he died, my boy, for three minutes.

349
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:00,580
then he came back.

350
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:02,727
is this why you came to see him?

351
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,909
you said he's been drawing something?

352
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:06,919
everyday

353
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:08,946
since the accident .
everywhere.

354
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:12,207
school, the walls,
even on pillowcases.

355
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,115
nice work stefano.

356
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,726
tell me why  you do this

357
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,375
i do it for her

358
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,989
who?

359
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:38,161
for her

360
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:11,931
it really does
sound better.

361
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:12,982
how come?

362
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:14,428
'cause
it's analog.

363
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,148
means it records
continuously.

364
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:18,481
digital
is cleaner,

365
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,552
but that's
because it has
to break it up

366
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:22,073
and reassemble it.

367
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:25,375
wow! i'm going out
with an audiophile.
who knew?

368
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,847
you're going out with a guy

369
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:28,965
who knows how to look up
stuff fast on the internet.

370
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,040
so this is
how you guys
listened to music

371
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,020
back in
the old days?

372
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,366
yeah. mm-hmm.

373
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,017
when dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

374
00:25:34,106 --> 00:25:36,472
what are all those
crackles and pops?

375
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,003
it's just somehow

376
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:39,755
part of the whole
experience, you know?

377
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:42,644
when i hear it,
i am instantly
a teenager again,

378
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:44,729
lying on my bed,

379
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:46,349
dreaming about
the future.

380
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:48,903
hearing it makes me
feel like i have
a lot of pimples.

381
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,774
ooh! spoken like
a true poet.

382
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,630
oh, hey. party is over.
the boss is here.

383
00:25:52,722 --> 00:25:54,655
hey! the party
is just getting
started.

384
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:55,881
ta-da!

385
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,363
damn! i forgot
the matches.

386
00:25:57,448 --> 00:25:59,416
oh, and the candles.

387
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:01,908
and the song that
i was gonna sing to you.

388
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,374
i'm not very good
at birthdays.

389
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,958
hey, i still know
my part of the song.

390
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,278
i could sing it.
whoa! ha ha. that's ok.

391
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,908
we have a bunch of stuff
in the back.

392
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:10,029
here you go, bud.

393
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:12,555
hey. is that dope 6?

394
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,674
yeah!

395
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:14,688
tight.
nice.

396
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,435
yeah.
how did you know that?

397
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,658
i like music.
so do i.

398
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,686
yeah,
but i like music

399
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,332
even after 1990.

400
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,586
that hurt.
hmm.

401
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,733
hey, do you mind
if i skip out early
this afternoon?

402
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:29,924
sure. what's up?

403
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,277
i think i found a tenant
at long last

404
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:33,427
for the house
on colonial road.

405
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,509
<i>ha ha. you mean
the mansion</i>

406
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:35,824
on colonial road.

407
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:37,707
it's big, it's furnished,
and it's a rental.

408
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,031
it sounds like
what they need,

409
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,082
so i'm just going
to go take some pictures

410
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:42,374
and email them.

411
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:43,390
sure you don't mind?

412
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,536
are you kidding?

413
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:45,551
how many times
have you covered for me?

414
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:47,330
don't worry about it.

415
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,849
are you ok?

416
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,666
me? sure.

417
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:54,045
the last couple of days

418
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:55,663
you seemed
really distracted,

419
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,051
like something was wrong.

420
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,580
it's just stress.

421
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:02,107
the kind that you would
rather not know about.

422
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,005
hey, look, i don't--

423
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,264
you know how i feel
about all of this
supernatural stuff,

424
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,305
but i don't...

425
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,219
want it to put a wedge
between us.

426
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,609
i don't want to be
on the outside of
the rest of your life.

427
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:17,996
delia, this is my life.

428
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,321
ok? it's--
it's who i am.

429
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,705
there's no part of me

430
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:22,955
that's not
affected by it.

431
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:24,051
it's kind of like...

432
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,564
love me, love my ghosts.

433
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:41,114
ned! please don't
turn me into a clich?

434
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:42,084
just turn it down,

435
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:43,200
or i'm going
to take it away.

436
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:47,439
thank you.

437
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,406
you're gonna lose her.

438
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,425
you're gonna lose her.

439
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,799
you're gonna lose her.

440
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:25,052
you're gonna lose her.

441
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:33,997
you're gonna lose her.

442
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:35,632
you're gonna lose her.

443
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,319
you're gonna lose her.

444
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,780
you're gonna lose her.

445
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:45,076
you're gonna lose her.

446
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,573
you're gonna lose her.

447
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,892
you're gonna lose her.
you're gonna--

448
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,923
aah! aah! ahh!

449
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,962
???

450
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,617
ned...

451
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:06,759
i am so sorry.
what happened?

452
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:09,602
it was that turntable.

453
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:13,638
it started saying
weird things.

454
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:15,558
she tried
to turn it off, and...

455
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:17,981
she just froze.

456
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,680
i didn't even know
what was happening.

457
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,180
it's all right.

458
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:24,366
is she dead?

459
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,761
shh.

460
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,977
no, we don't talk
like that, all right?

461
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:31,281
ok.

462
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:32,630
she's gonna be
all right.

463
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:36,811
she's got a burn
on her hand,

464
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,902
she took a pretty
good jolt from
that turntable.

465
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,828
it was a freak short
or something.

466
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,619
yeah, maybe not so freaky.

467
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,075
tell me
all this later.

468
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:45,660
i've got to get back
out there.

469
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,880
flaherty's gonna
come stay with ned
as soon as he can.

470
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:49,109
ok.
all right.

471
00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:50,290
bye.

472
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:08,677
???

473
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:10,365
melinda,
you're looking well.

474
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:11,549
what the hell
are you doing here?

475
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,597
good question.
it seems i'm a little early.

476
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:14,958
early for what?

477
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,666
call me sentimental.

478
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,883
i just can't seem
to get over grandview.

479
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,938
???

480
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:33,826
the guy's a freak.

481
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,772
he plastered a whole room
with your photograph.

482
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,264
he's stalking you.

483
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,116
yeah, i know.
i was there.

484
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,594
what was he doin'
at the hospital?

485
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:43,452
i don't know
exactly,

486
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:45,096
but he said he was
a little early.

487
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:48,504
little early, for what?

488
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:50,776
wait, you don't think
he was going to try
to grab delia's soul--

489
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,904
don't even say it.

490
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,200
you gotta think
gabriel had something
to do with this.

491
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,407
i mean, is this about
death of a loved one?

492
00:30:58,043 --> 00:30:59,578
i don't know.

493
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,233
but i'm...scared.

494
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,057
i feel like
there's this game
being played,

495
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,596
and i'm the only one
who doesn't know
what it is.

496
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,923
you're not the only one.

497
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,620
and you will never be
the only one.

498
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,622
you're not alone.

499
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,562
aah!

500
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:37,544
aahh!

501
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,907
why are you showing me
all of this?
what does it mean?

502
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,246
so you can know
who to save.

503
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,775
why can't you tell me?

504
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:34,562
it's not for me
to know.

505
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:53,976
it was raining cars

506
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:55,962
and you didn't call me?
i did call you.

507
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,341
yeah, after the fun,
as usual.

508
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,249
all right, this is
what we have so far.

509
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,139
we have a prophet ghost

510
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,957
who's showing you
visions of
big disasters,

511
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:06,412
and these disasters
are metaphorical
for death itself.

512
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,310
you have a ferry,
you have a bridge
and a tunnel.

513
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:10,169
these are all
mythological journeys
of the soul.

514
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,707
and weird visions
of someone's death,
i think, delia's.

515
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,646
well, that could
bring to mind

516
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,570
the death of a loved one
warning that we had,

517
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,361
and last night
she almost
got fried, right?

518
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,950
uh, i would put it
a ???

519
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,583
but, yes.
and gabriel was there,

520
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,404
just hanging out
at the hospital
like a vulture.

521
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,007
yeah, the self-proclaimed
collector of souls

522
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:29,727
awaiting his spoils.

523
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:31,582
you gotta admit,
i turn a good phrase
now and then.

524
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:33,372
focus.
please stay focused.

525
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,494
all right, all right,
look, this is what's happening.

526
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:37,422
it's so secret
that in the past year,

527
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,381
the way things
have been going,

528
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:41,050
ghosts being able
to do things they never
could before,

529
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,437
it doesn't take
a genius to see

530
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,089
that the whole order
of things is being
shaken up,

531
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:46,443
that the veil between
the living and the dead
is very weak.

532
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,606
yeah, and all eyes
are on me, so what
do we do?

533
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:49,901
we?
oh, come on!

534
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,650
you can't tell me that
you're gonna leave now.

535
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,039
i mean,
with the thin veil
and everything?

536
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:55,636
oh, no, i should stay here
where cars fall from the sky

537
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:57,623
and wives betray me
from beyond the grave.

538
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:58,919
quitter.

539
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,569
look, melinda...

540
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,881
i'm gonna help you
do this.

541
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,174
you're the bravest person
i've ever met in my life,

542
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,800
and i won't quit on you.

543
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,340
and?

544
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:12,029
i'm waiting
for the joke.

545
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,941
yeah, i can't think of one.

546
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,830
the peruvian job
is gonna have to wait.

547
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:26,468
heh heh, all right, hey,

548
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:29,202
let's go tell delia
to watch her back.

549
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:35,537
so what am i
supposed to do,
just run away?

550
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,983
andrea was killed
last year, you know that.

551
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,148
yeah, because
of a plane crash.

552
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:43,775
because she knew what i knew,
and she acted on it.

553
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,655
look, if i had
never told her
what i could do,

554
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:47,779
then i wouldn't have had
to tell her about the signs
that i was getting,

555
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:49,573
and she never would have
gotten in her car.

556
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,095
so what are you saying?

557
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,881
that there's gonna be
another plane crash?

558
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:54,907
i don't know
what there's gonna be, ok?

559
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,367
but i keep getting signs
and having dreams,

560
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:57,886
and i think that they
involve you.

561
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:02,861
i think that they're trying
to hurt me by hurting
the people that i love.

562
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,954
you could be in danger.

563
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:11,032
jim could be in danger,
and i think that's
what happened last night.

564
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:15,023
last night was
an electrical problem
with an old turntable.

565
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:17,265
yes, it scared
the hell out of me,
but there was no--

566
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:20,928
ned told me about the voices
on the turntable.

567
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,509
the record
was skipping, melinda.

568
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,141
please.

569
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:28,395
ahem. if i could
barge into
this conversation.

570
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:31,196
um, i teach this type
of thing at the university,

571
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,599
i made a lifetime
studying it,

572
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,750
and i'm the world's
biggest skeptic.

573
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:36,144
until i met melinda,

574
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,595
i never believed in anything
i couldn't touch or see.

575
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:40,493
see, i'm a man of science,
miss banks.

576
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,683
although i've also
been taken for a man
of mystery,

577
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,291
man of intrigue--

578
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,244
is there a caboose
to this train
of thought, professor?

579
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,315
yes, there is.

580
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,261
you can fight it,
you can deny it,

581
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:52,992
you can turn
a blind eye to it,

582
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,690
but to quote
william shakespeare,

583
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:57,420
"there is more in heaven
in earth, horatio,"

584
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:01,382
or in this case, delia,
"that can be dreamt of
in your philosophy."

585
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,378
point, please.

586
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,976
the point...

587
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,717
the point is
what do you lose
by believing?

588
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,168
i think there is
something

589
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:21,166
very special
about you,
melinda, i do.

590
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:23,595
i believe
you feel things,

591
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:26,958
maybe even see things
that we can't.

592
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:29,014
are they ghosts,
can they hurt us,

593
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:33,812
can they actually change
the course of our lives
from beyond the grave?

594
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,572
i'm asking you
to believe that they are,

595
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,540
and that they do.

596
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,270
and i need you
to believe it,

597
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:44,634
because i need you
to be safe.

598
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:51,955
ok.

599
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:55,782
i believe you.

600
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,654
this is one of those
female bonding moments,
isn't it?

601
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,035
you've got to see this.

602
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,664
hey, uh, come on in.
don't be shy or anything.

603
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:20,686
it's not like it's 12:30
in the morning.

604
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,982
ok, this is about
the past and the future.

605
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,344
that's a pretty
sweeping statement.

606
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:25,442
you could be talking
about my credit
rating, or--

607
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,341
ok, just listen.

608
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,641
we have been assuming
that these visions

609
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:33,237
have been some sort
of sign or warning
that something's to come.

610
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,860
<i>how's your italian?
bene.</i>

611
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:41,515
well?

612
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,517
<i>no, that's it. bene.
that's the italian i know.</i>

613
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:45,501
i'm gonna kill him.

614
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,465
all right,
look at the date.

615
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,363
uh...

616
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:50,653
may 11, 2003.

617
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:52,154
ok, this bridge
collapsed 4 years ago,

618
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:54,456
killing more than
111 people.

619
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:56,487
then, a ferry
sinks off the coast
of england

620
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:58,051
may 11, 2005.

621
00:39:58,115 --> 00:39:59,282
the tunnel vision?

622
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:02,013
a subway collapse
in moscow

623
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,742
on may 11, 2004.

624
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:04,807
flash forward.

625
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,305
plane crash
outside of grandview

626
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,603
may 11, 2006.

627
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:10,432
a terrible tragedy,
hundreds dead,

628
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,530
same date, same time,
all within the last
4 years.

629
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:16,226
this has been about stuff
that already happened.

630
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:18,290
what are you doing?

631
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:20,301
well, this might still
all be about the future.

632
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:22,299
how? all the visions
are accounted for.

633
00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:24,229
yes, but there were
5 signs, melinda.

634
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:26,693
the, uh, the tunnel.
how many killed?
32, right?

635
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:29,355
3 plus 2 equals 5. next?

636
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:31,951
the ferry sinking,
311 dead.

637
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,381
3 plus one plus one, 5.

638
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,143
and how about
the bridge?

639
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,175
111 people,
2 on the ground.

640
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:41,138
one plus one plus one
plus two, 5.

641
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,966
ok, but wait.
the plane trash killed 238.

642
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:45,296
no, it didn't,

643
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:48,060
'cause the initial
reports were wrong.

644
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:50,023
family members
reporting the missing
were so frantic,

645
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:52,821
they reported them
missing 2, 3 times over.

646
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:53,983
and some of the people
that were pronounced dead

647
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:55,314
weren't even on the flight.

648
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,346
the official number's now
228 passengers,

649
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:01,074
and there were 2 victims
on the ground, that's 230.

650
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,170
look at this.

651
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:08,134
that's 230,
2 plus 3 equals 5.

652
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:10,394
this is all about fives.

653
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:12,790
5 signs, 4 accidents.

654
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,285
now we've come
full circle,

655
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,150
which means
something else
is going to happen

656
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:18,214
at the same time,
same date.

657
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:20,611
may 11, 2007.

658
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:25,336
one week from tonight.

659
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,792
