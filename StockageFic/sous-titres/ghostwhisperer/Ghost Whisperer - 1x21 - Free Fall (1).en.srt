1
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,439
Breakfast?

2
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,390
That's not funny.

3
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:00,187
Poor little guy crashed into the window.

4
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:01,556
Sorry.

5
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:04,322
A 16-hour shift can wreak havoc on your empathy.

6
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,697
Look at how beautiful he is. I feel terrible.

7
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:11,096
Tell you what. I wake up later, we give him a proper burial, hmm?

8
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,240
Sorry.

9
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,292
Hey, you don't see a spirit or anything, do you?

10
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:17,911
- No.
- See?

11
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,495
Crossed over and everything.

12
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:20,446
Happy ending.

13
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:25,226
Bye.

14
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,022
- Somebody slept in late.
- Yeah. Andrea opened today.

15
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:34,591
Hey, you want some eggs?

16
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,472
No. I'll just have some juice. I took the new guy at the breakfast this morning.

17
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:39,571
Oh. How's that going?

18
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,723
Hey, what can I say? He's new, he's green. He wants to...

19
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:43,893
- oh!
- ...See blood.

20
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,561
Great another household appliance choosing a life of crime.

21
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:49,823
How does this happen?

22
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,161
This is how it ends.

23
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:53,372
We'll just leave it.

24
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,732
I'm just gonna go to bed. I have to be back at work at 2:00.

25
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:02,283
I could stick a frozen chunk of bacon in your mouth and let it melt while you're sleeping.

26
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:03,913
Good night.

27
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,293
Morning, good evening, whatever it is.

28
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:36,003

29
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:59,112
When you're out here, that usually means there's something in there.

30
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:01,072
No, no, no. Tiffany Cogan

31
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,210
said she's gonna retire and close the bakery right next door to us.

32
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:06,160
No more apple cobblers? That's a good thing?

33
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,363
It means we can expand.

34
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,953
Think about it. We can knock down the wall in the middle and combine the fronts.

35
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:11,901
Expand?

36
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:14,312
I thought we were just settling into what we have.

37
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,490
Oh, come on. It'll be great. Think of all the extra floor space.

38
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:18,953
We could take much bigger consignments.

39
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:21,452
You really have a lot of free time on your hands.

40
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:22,871
I really do.

41
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:27,891
You know, my sensitive poet is touring the deep south this week.

42
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:30,652
- What?
- Sorry.

43
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,950
It's just hard to put those images together--

44
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:35,651
Ashton, poetry slam, Alabama.

45
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:38,273
I'm ok now.

46
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:42,621
What?

47
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:43,570
Do you see that?

48
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,313
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you. There is something really weird going on with

49
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:50,552
the a/c and it was, like, 25 degrees in there when I came in to open this morning.

50
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:51,752
Wow, we should call them.

51
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:55,452
I already called the repair guy and he promises to be here within a year.

52
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,700
Hey, I made this amazing sketch, so let me come show you.

53
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:01,083
You know, I don't feel like going to work yet.

54
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,392
You ok?

55
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,761
Yeah.

56
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,063
I don't know. It's just--

57
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,300
it's been a weird day so far.

58
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:09,642
Do you want some coffee?

59
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:12,792
Uhh! I don't need to be any more wired, but you should go, ok?

60
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:13,933
Well, come with me.

61
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,433
Just stay out of the store, you know, until they fix the a/c.

62
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,333
I'll be fine. I've got sweaters and a snow suit if I need it. Hurry back, ok?

63
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:08,392
And your biscone.

64
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:09,843
Thank you.

65
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:11,773
I know. The usual.

66
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,150
There you go, pumpkin. Have a good day.

67
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,682
What can I get you, doll?

68
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:37,700
- A latte, please.
- A latte it is.

69
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,193
Your latte?

70
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:16,830
- Keep the change.
- Sure.

71
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,821
Next!

72
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,902
When are these repair guys coming? Christmas?

73
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,242
Yeah, I know. I'd like to break up some furniture and make a fire.

74
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,190
Hey, look at this.

75
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,180
See, what I'm thinking is that we could leave half a wall here and then maybe

76
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,532
leave the edges to look like they're serrated?

77
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,861
You know, you are really amazing.

78
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:38,781
Your brother must have rubbed off on you-- a real estate mogul in the making.

79
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:39,983
Speaking of my brother,

80
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,851
it's his birthday tomorrow. Look what I got him.

81
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,433
- You know how much he loves watches.
- Wow.

82
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,160
- That's incredible.
- Thanks.

83
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:49,651
I'm gonna give it to him on saturday.

84
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:50,601
Why not tomorrow?

85
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:54,801
He's  on some big business trip overseas, some huge timeshare deal or something.

86
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:59,112
I think it's great that you guys are really close. I wish I had a brother or sister.

87
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,732
Well, it wasn't always that way.

88
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,731
We did not get along when we were kids.

89
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,503
We've always been more different than alike.

90
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,333
Do you know we once went for 2 years without speaking?

91
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,281
Really? Why?

92
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:10,703
Ah, it was just...

93
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,833
he was always such a go-getter,

94
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:16,531
you know, so ambitious, and I like to lay back and let things come to me.

95
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,203
We had the most terrible fights.

96
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,940
I once called him a sell-out and worse.

97
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,272
Wow. That doesn't sound like you.

98
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,930
That's the way I was back then.

99
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,850
He thought I was a rebel and a loser.

100
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:32,490
Ok. Note to self-- be grateful that I don't have angry brothers and sisters.

101
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,483
You know what the great thing was, though?

102
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:36,881
He was always there for me,

103
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,053
no matter what kind of trouble I got into.

104
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:42,181
He saw that I had some growing up to do, and he was patient with me.

105
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,731
I didn't see it back then, but

106
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,223
now we're best friends.

107
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,463
Look at the inscription.

108
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:54,670
Do you think it's weird that I wrote that to my brother?

109
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:55,672
No.

110
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,680
No. I think it's just right.

111
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,890
You might want to set it to the right time.

112
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,840
Oh.

113
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,233
I thought I did.

114
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:06,273
That's weird.

115
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,983
What time does it say on the clock in the square?

116
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,743
Melinda?

117
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:25,672
Sorry. Yeah.

118
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,081
It says 25 after 2:00.

119
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:29,772
Wow.

120
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,382
Must not have wound it enough.

121
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,823
So, want to talk about architects?

122
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,260
I tried so hard to work in the city, man, but the waiting list, forget it.

123
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,210
Why the city?

124
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:46,812
Are you kidding me?

125
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:50,282
'Cause  I don't want less than, you know, like, 10 calls a night.

126
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,800
- You used to work in the city, right?
- Yep.

127
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:55,600
- You must have seen some stuff, huh?
- What do you want from this job, Joe?

128
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:56,792
To do good.

129
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:59,663
Help people, save lives. And to drive that bad boy real fast.

130
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,461
Right. That's why the keys are gonna stay in my pocket.

131
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,240
What's your background?

132
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,501
2 years of med school at Columbia.

133
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,820
Columbia. Nice. How about the real world?

134
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,501
Oh, I did some time in the E.R. Loved it.

135
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,921
Life and death, ticking clock, the whole thing. So I wanted more of that

136
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,610
and less classroom lectures and chemistry, so I trained for this.

137
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,683
I think this is gonna be more immediate.

138
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:25,263
Well, right now, immediately, we need to check the tire pressure and the oil.

139
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,063
- Your heart racing yet?
- That's what I mean.

140
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,733
I can't believe they sent me to a place like this. I'm on the job 2 days.

141
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,450
So far I've gone on one call to help a lady who couldn't find her way home.

142
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,250
Feel like you're wasting your time?

143
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,353
That's not what I'm saying. It's just--

144
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,275
Whoa. I'd like to help her find her way home.

145
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,636
Stand down, Sparky.

146
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,656
- Hi.
- Hey.

147
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,190
John, this is my wife Melinda.

148
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:48,462
Melinda, this keg of adrenaline right here is John Gregory, probationary paramedic.

149
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,411
- Hi.
- Welcome.

150
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:53,301
- Hey. You brought me soup.
- Yeah. I thought you could use it.

151
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,391
We're gonna take a little break.

152
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,632
Keep an eye on things.

153
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:58,230
Sure.

154
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:00,690
That's  the new guy?

155
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,952
Yeah. He wants things to be immediate.

156
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:06,203
- That's why he moved to Grandview?
- His point, exactly.

157
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,351
Hey, how was your day?

158
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,163
Weird.

159
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,371
What? Like, ghost weird? Are they back?

160
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,240
No. I mean, there was something this morning while you were sleeping...

161
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,200
a voice.

162
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:18,062
What?

163
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,233
Oh, it's just, I can't shake this feeling of dread, you know?

164
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,112
I think something terrible is gonna happen.

165
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,161
Have you had this before?

166
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,843
No, not really. There's just a heaviness in the air.

167
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:30,003
Sure it's not the kitchen vent at Lento's on the square?

168
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,651
You know, I am trying to be serious here.

169
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,602
Too serious.

170
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,523
I don't wanna go home without you.

171
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,963
My shift's almost over. I'll be home by 10:00.

172
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,200
- Promise?
- Promise.

173
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,410
Unless of course, the heaviness in the air slows me down.

174
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:44,862
You're going down, Clancy.

175
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:50,091
My chief owes me 2 days off. After my shift tomorrow, we can play a little hooky,

176
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,371
maybe go catch an afternoon movie. What do you think of that?

177
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,510
Sounds good.

178
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,160
- I better go check on the rookie.
- Yeah.

179
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,222
Well,

180
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,902
at least the ghosts are back.

181
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,000
Something's back. I'm just not sure what.

182
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:08,533
Oh, oh, oh. We have to keep this pizza.

183
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,861
- It has freezer burn.
- What's wrong with freezer burn?

184
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:13,113
- It makes it taste gross.
- We can burn it off in the oven.

185
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:13,852
No, we won't.

186
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,842
Melinda, you've got to give a pizza a fighting chance.

187
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,843
Ok, fine. We will save the pizza frisbees.

188
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:21,742
Uhh! So...

189
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,943
what do they want. These ghosts?

190
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:27,851
The ghosts want you to throw out that damn pizza.

191
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:28,802
Besides that.

192
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,040
I don't think they know what they want.

193
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:32,990
Well,

194
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,092
at least you're seeing them now.

195
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:38,293
I mean, last week at this time, you thought you lost your gift.

196
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,450
Yeah. You thought I had, too.

197
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,201
I was hoping. I'm kidding.

198
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:43,661
You're a liar.

199
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,453
It's just still so quiet out there.

200
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:51,601
I don't know where they've all gone. It's like a huge vacuum.

201
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:52,900
You mean, like, Grandview

202
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:54,103
is a ghost town?

203
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:56,741
You know what? I'm gonna spank you and hard.

204
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:57,931
Stop it.

205
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:00,041
You know,

206
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,421
I wish I could help you more.

207
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,663
I really do.

208
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,203
You do.

209
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:07,621
You listen.

210
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,523
Yeah, and what I'm hearing right now is that you're scared.

211
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,011
Yeah.

212
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:16,142
I'm just not sure of what.

213
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:02,523
You're the one.

214
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,212
Who  are you?

215
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,163
We're so

216
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:20,220
cold.

217
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:24,480
Who?

218
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:45,112
See, this is what I'm talking about. If we had that space next door,

219
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:48,312
we could build some really cool displays with trunks like this.

220
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,592
I've got a flyer for this architect over at Billy's shop

221
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,092
and he's gonna come by later and take a look, ok?

222
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,800
And then I hope he rips off my clothes and has his way with me.

223
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,310
What?

224
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:03,450
Welcome back.

225
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,271
- Sorry.
- Where were you?

226
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:09,383
I was thinking about this little visit I had last night.

227
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,161
Oh! So the ghosts haven't totally abandoned you!

228
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,002
No. I saw the one last night and heard one yesterday morning.

229
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,501
I just can't figure out why they are here and the rest are just gone.

230
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,393
- Well, can't you just ask them?
- It's weird.

231
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:25,160
It's like they're half in this place and half in another place.

232
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,890
Oh. Like so many men I know.

233
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,402
Sometimes they're talking in the present tense,

234
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:31,122
sometimes they're talking in the past tense.

235
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,611
Now, wait a second. Are these ghosts that died, like, suddenly or violently?

236
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:36,760
- Is that why they're so confused?
- Maybe.

237
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:41,390
You know, usually I can solve a haunting pretty quickly. I mean, the spirits have

238
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,660
something they want to say to me or a problem that they need solved,

239
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,112
but not these two. They're not making any sense. It's like a riddle.

240
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,751
Maybe you're not meant to solve it yet.

241
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,620
I just can't shake the feeling that it's more important than ever

242
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,170
for me to figure this one out.

243
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,322
Do you hear that?

244
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,392
Hear what?

245
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,903
What?

246
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,733
-  What? What? What is it?
- Hell if I know.

247
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,421
I'll be right back.

248
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:22,172
Melinda, this is Charlie Filbert, the architect that i was telling you about.

249
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,222
Oh, he's the one you were hoping would--

250
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,110
come by before his lunch.

251
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,630
I love your place. I walk past it all the time.

252
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:31,582
Well, it's better for us when people come in, not just by.

253
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,793
My loss. So, you guys want to expand?

254
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,053
- Yes.
- Maybe.

255
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,463
Well, it's really very simple.

256
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,313
I mean, you've got 1, 2, 3, 4 support columns including the brick,

257
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:44,263
and you could punch a hole between any and/or all of them.

258
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:49,303
Your biggest headache's gonna be getting permits from the town.

259
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,983
The planning board's not exactly business friendly.

260
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,971
How long would something like this take?

261
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,901
Charlie, I mean, do you think that we'd still be able to stay open?

262
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,090
We could do a lot of prep work on days you're closed,

263
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,840
but you'd probably have to shut down for a week or so.

264
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:05,880
Or...

265
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,110
or, you could knock the wall down while we're closed,

266
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,862
and then we could put up some curtains or something and you just

267
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,912
keep doing your thing on the other side.

268
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,893
Curtains. You mean, like plastic sheeting and tarps?

269
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:18,282
Yeah, that.

270
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:20,941
Is it always so cold in here?

271
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm sorry. You know, we've been waiting for the workmen forever, and in fact,

272
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,580
they were supposed to be here by now.

273
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:29,761
Damn!

274
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,192
It stopped again!

275
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,612
You saw me set it.

276
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,042
What time did it stop?

277
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:39,460
10:30. I'm gonna take you back to the jeweler.

278
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,712
We could replicate this fascade,

279
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,463
you know, if you like it. We could just put it up...

280
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,553
- It's cold.
- I can hear you.

281
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:17,401
It's cold in the cabin. We're all cold.

282
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,740
Where are you?

283
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:20,802
In the woods?

284
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,490
Are you trapped there?

285
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:25,390
Something's wrong. I have to find the door.

286
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:26,802
No.

287
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,903
- Wait. Tell me who you are.
- I have to find the door.

288
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:37,330
Uh... I was just listening...

289
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,093
for termites.

290
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,933
Mmm! I can't believe you did this.

291
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:08,561
Yeah, well, you were asleep when I left, and I didn't want you to eat alone.

292
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,930
Breakfast of champions.

293
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,950
You know, they're closing soon, so enjoy it while you can.

294
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:13,900
Ah, the tragedy.

295
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,782
- Sit down.
- No. I have to get back.

296
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:21,673
You're really in a bad place, aren't you?

297
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:24,331
- It is obvious?
- That's that smile.

298
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:27,090
Same "trying to make it seem like everything's great when I'm really dying inside--

299
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,790
- help" smile.
- It's disgusting how well you know me.

300
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,331
Better than you think. I added the "help."

301
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,122
I just have never really felt like this.

302
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:37,412
Like what?

303
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,771
It's a million different feelings, really.

304
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:43,362
Not just dread, but i feel like I have to

305
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,662
rush, you know? Like maybe there's not enough time.

306
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:50,133
- Time to what?
- To live.

307
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,940
- What are you saying?
- Don't be worried.

308
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:55,593
I'm just telling you how I feel.

309
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:01,113
I look at this room, and it is so beautiful.

310
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:04,732
The color, the light.

311
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,792
You.

312
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:12,101
And I feel like we don't spend enough time in this room.

313
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:14,113
We don't spend enough time together.

314
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,783
Like maybe we're working too hard.

315
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:20,201
Just rushing through our lives instead of living our lives.

316
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,882
- Maybe it's too late to even matter.
- No.

317
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:30,162
Everything we do,

318
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,530
we're doing for a reason,

319
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:36,013
- doing it for the future.
- Yeah, that's the point, I think.

320
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:38,592
What are we doing for the now?

321
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,502
Well, I'm holding you now.

322
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,950
I love you right now. What else matters?

323
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,570
Just forget about it. I am talking crazy.

324
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,022
What did I say?

325
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,370
Don't even worry about it.

326
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,753
I don't really get it, either.

327
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:55,462
I have to get back to work. I'll talk to you soon.

328
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,333
Where is your sense of adventure?

329
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:08,182
Underneath my sense of biting off more than we can chew.

330
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,051
I just don't know if this is the right time.

331
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:13,202
Why not? We'll get great tax breaks for property improvements.

332
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:16,433
Yeah, but how can we stay in business with them knocking down our walls?

333
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,100
- I mean, the dust alone.
- Well, I mean, it'll be a challenge,

334
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:22,811
yeah. It'll be an adjustment, but we'll do it and it will be so worth it.

335
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,181
- I don't know.
- Hey,

336
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:27,570
you gotta spend money to make money. That's the first rule of business.

337
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:31,031
Look, somehow I just feel like deep down, we might be tempting fate.

338
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,103
You know, to make a big move like this,

339
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:37,340
commit to so much money when we don't know if we can absorb it. What if it backfires?

340
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:39,570
Ok, you know that's classic scarcity mentality.

341
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,541
Yeah. Guilty.

342
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:44,010
Let me just get Charlie over here, ok, and he can show you his plans

343
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,801
and walk you through how we would do things.

344
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:48,202
And then, if it's still too scary, we can wait.

345
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,540
Whoa, I am not scared.

346
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,481
- I'm cautious.
- Whatever you say.

347
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,693
And can we please not let Charlie see you listen to the walls this time?

348
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:55,641
Good point.

349
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,963
Uhh! I don't know how much more of this cold I can take.

350
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,660
I can call the repair guys again.

351
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:30,770
What do you want?

352
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,581
The captain goes down with the ship.

353
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,072
I don't understand.

354
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:41,293
We are all asleep.

355
00:25:42,088 --> 00:25:43,030
We?

356
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:45,053
Who's with you?

357
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,621
No one yet.

358
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,520
They're all still sleeping.

359
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:51,203
Where are you?

360
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,401
We're close.

361
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:11,993
A uniform?

362
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm not sure what kind, but not military.

363
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:17,553
He said, "a captain goes down with the ship."

364
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:20,353
- Are we talking about a boat?
- I think he was a pilot.

365
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:23,072
It's the only thing that makes sense with the noises that I'm hearing.

366
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,173
If there was a plane crash, wouldn't we have heard about it?

367
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:26,892
Unless it happened a long time ago.

368
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,510
Or it happened a little while ago, and it's not on the news yet.

369
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:30,612
He said he was close.

370
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:34,333
What about these ghosts that keep rattling your doors?

371
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:36,530
I don't know. Someone else from the flight?

372
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:40,062
If it is a plane, something went seriously wrong.

373
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:43,900
Hey, what's wrong?

374
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,472
My brother is supposed to fly today.

375
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:49,381
- From where?
- South Africa.

376
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:53,390
When I spoke to him last, he was gonna get a transport for a couple of days

377
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:55,760
for some kind of real estate conference.

378
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,131
He wants to be back by tonight.

379
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,402
Andrea, what are the chances?

380
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:03,500
What the hell is going on?

381
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:05,402
It went ahead again.

382
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,342
What happened at 10:30?

383
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:13,662
And where?

384
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:21,401
So, I'm gonna take this back to the jeweler.

385
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:22,802
Take your time.

386
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,502
John,  my bag.

387
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:57,600
Stop. Check him out!

388
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,120
Have a seat over here.

389
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,212
My name's Jim. Are you all right?

390
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,711
- I've been better.
- I bet. Can you move?

391
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:10,983
My hand.

392
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:12,350
What about your hand? Can you move it?

393
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,300
It's gone.

394
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:15,670
- What?
- It came off.

395
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:18,831
John! John!

396
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,153
- Yeah, what's up?
- Get over here.

397
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:25,303
The driver's hand's been severed, ok? We need to find it,

398
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,953
get him to the hospital, see if they can reattach it. He's also in shock.

399
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:29,621
I'm gonna treat him. You find the hand.

400
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:32,371
He said it's over there. It could be anywhere. Go. Go!

401
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,183
Look at me. You're gonna be all right.

402
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,532
You're gonna be all right.

403
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:03,452
John.

404
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:04,403
John!

405
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:06,500
Come here! Officer, come here!

406
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,112
Keep it on his hand. Go.

407
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,700
Hey, hey, hey! You all right?

408
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:11,992
What's the matter?

409
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:15,870
I got up too fast.

410
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:19,272
Where's the hand? Where's the hand?

411
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,221
You take it.

412
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:21,492
You take it.

413
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,211
Take him on the passenger side door.

414
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:15,001
Hey, I was told to come over here and convince you.

415
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,312
Is this a good time?

416
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,323
Not an easy task, but sure, come on in.

417
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,282
When I walk out of here, you're gonna be ready to take over the block.

418
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,483
It's just, we're still such a new business.

419
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:26,932
I get it. So am I.

420
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,540
Have you been in Grandview long?

421
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:30,891
Not really.

422
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,942
I was with a big firm in Chicago. But my wife's from here.

423
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,353
She was dying to move back. I took one look, said, "I'm in."

424
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:39,311
I want my daughter to grow up here.

425
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,450
Would you like a hot cup of tea, Charlie?

426
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:44,811
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Ok.

427
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:48,900
- You know, how old is your daughter?
- 10.

428
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:01,332
Do you have kids?

429
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:02,940
No.

430
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,690
No. Not yet, anyway.

431
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,063
But my husband, he is

432
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,291
chomping at the bit.

433
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,352
Exactly the opposite with us. I didn't think I'd ever be ready. Thank you.

434
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:14,500
My wife couldn't wait.

435
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,703
So how is it, being a parent?

436
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:21,873
It's great, although I have to admit, my wife does most of the heavy lifting.

437
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,872
I've always been a bit of a workaholic.

438
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,473
Ah! Hence your visit here today to convince a skeptic.

439
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:29,570
I'll do anything to snag a new client.

440
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:33,382
My family's traveling this week, so I figured, keep extra busy.

441
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:36,282
They're not flying, are they?

442
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:38,453
No. They're driving from upstate. Why?

443
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,190
I was just curious.

444
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:43,280
I hate planes, you know? All the hassles.

445
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:47,641
Me, too. I figure it's dangerous enough out there without leaving the ground. Ok.

446
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:50,643
This is your new storage room, right? It's your front door.

447
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:54,000
Hi. Catch you at a bad time?

448
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:56,551
No, no. I'm good now. I just had a little rookie trouble.

449
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:57,573
Oh, Mr. Adrenaline?

450
00:31:58,767 --> 00:31:59,811
I'll tell you later.

451
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:03,623
Look, is there any back channel way of you finding out if there's been anything

452
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,973
- with a plane today?
- You mean, like a crash?

453
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,260
Yeah, I think so. Do you know anybody at the airports or--

454
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,873
where?

455
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,952
I don't really know. I'm thinking the east coast.

456
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:17,892
I checked the news on the web, but there doesn't seem to be anything coming up

457
00:32:17,897 --> 00:32:20,241
- for a recent crash.
- What about farther back?

458
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:21,193
I don't know.

459
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,862
The more I think about it, this ghost is so confused,

460
00:32:23,865 --> 00:32:25,963
it really feels like somebody newly dead.

461
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:28,073
You know, they both said something about being really cold.

462
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:31,932
Maybe they crashed in some far away, remote place, and nobody's heard about it yet.

463
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:34,523
It's possible, but how would they know to come to me?

464
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:38,022
Well, that is the $64,000 question how they ever know to come to you.

465
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,700
- Can you just make some calls?
- Yeah. I will.

466
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,923
- I just think, if nothing's--
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

467
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:49,652
Andrea, I have to go across the street.

468
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:52,941
Ok.

469
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:05,753
What are you looking for?

470
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,603
Don't you know?

471
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:12,271
I thought you knew.

472
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:13,702
Is it an airplane?

473
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:15,961
Did an airplane crash?

474
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,243
I don't know yet.

475
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,151
What was the last thing that you saw?

476
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,071
The sky.

477
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:26,640
Do you remember anything?

478
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:29,131
Anything about where you went down?

479
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,593
There's been no crash.

480
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:33,811
No crash? I don't understand.

481
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,590
We're still flying.

482
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:38,303
We're still up there.

483
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:41,351
What?

484
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:43,663
The captain goes down with the ship.

485
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:03,061
Ooh! Sorry!

486
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,323
Excuse me!

487
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:09,062
Excuse me!

488
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:13,023
Sorry!

489
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,882
Charlie, I am so sorry to be rude, but would you excuse us?

490
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,622
- Ok. I need my pencils.
- Yeah. We're gonna send them over later.

491
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:28,793
Andrea, there's a plane.

492
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,311
It's still in the air. The pilot is dead. Maybe the crew.

493
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:32,760
What?! How do you know this?

494
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:34,220
The pilot just told me.

495
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:36,360
What airline? What flight?

496
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:38,840
Hey, he was gone before I could ask.

497
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:39,892
Ok. What do we do?

498
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:43,801
Calls. The FAA for starters. Maybe you should try some of the airports.

499
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:46,511
And say what? We're gonna sound like lunatics.

500
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,011
I don't know, ok? Don't even try to explain it. Just keep telling them

501
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,963
- until somebody listens.
- Ok, ok.

502
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,153
Yes, hello. I need the federal aviation administration.

503
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:56,441
Thank you.

504
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,663
Hello. There is a plane in the air.

505
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,853
No one is flying it.

506
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:07,521
The pilot is dead and maybe the crew.

507
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:12,331
Mitch, hi. It's Andrea. Look, I know you're on a plane right now, but

508
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:15,033
can you please just call me when you land?

509
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:19,192
There's some really crazy stuff going on today. I just--

510
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:21,290
I just really need to know you're safe.

511
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:23,640
We can talk about how crazy this sounds later.

512
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,502
I'm just telling you what I know.

513
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:28,640
Please. Is there somebody else that I--

514
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,171
Hello?

515
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,131
Hi. I need to speak to somebody about a plane.

516
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:48,970
Where am I?

517
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,161
You have to tell me.

518
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:54,481
- Are you on a plane?
- I was.

519
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:56,061
I think I am.

520
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:58,182
What is the flight? What is the airline?

521
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:00,572
There's no pressure.

522
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:01,910
We lost pressure.

523
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:04,560
It was a long flight.

524
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:08,460
Lots of head winds. We were more than an hour behind.

525
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:14,942
It was like the air just got sucked out of the plane. We couldn't breathe.

526
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:27,920
Open up.

527
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,530
It's real cold out here.

528
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:35,352
What's going on in there? It's too cold out here!

529
00:36:37,415 --> 00:36:38,390
We lost pressure.

530
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,150
What is the flight number? What is the airline?

531
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,330
Trans-eastern air 395.

532
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,430
Where did you take off from?

533
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,903
Johannesburg.

534
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,071
The captain needs me.

535
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,873
Well, is there someone else I can--

536
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:03,470
look, I'm serious. This plane may crash any minute.

537
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,002
Damn it! Uhh!

538
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:09,190
These government people! I've been hung up on 3 times already, and

539
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:13,441
one of them actually asked me if I could get my mommy or daddy to come to the phone.

540
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:15,702
What?

541
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:17,622
Andrea, the

542
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,472
plane...

543
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:22,342
the flight, it took off in Johannesburg.

544
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:27,461
No.

545
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,090
No. It's too weird.

546
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:32,061
Where are you going?

547
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:37,593
I'm gonna go to my brother's apartment in the city and the doorman let me in.

548
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,811
I'm sure there's something about his flights on his computer.

549
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:42,251
I have to know if he flew today.

550
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:45,102
- Andrea, we should stay on the phones.
- I'll come back!

551
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,833
What the hell happened back there.

552
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:57,701
Like I said, I must have gotten up too fast.

553
00:37:57,707 --> 00:37:59,751
Come on, don't treat me like I'm stupid.

554
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,853
All right, look. It's just a problem I have sometimes.

555
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,473
Things like that, they get to me.

556
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,223
How'd you handle it in med school?

557
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,272
You didn't handle it in med school.

558
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:14,170
I kept passing out in gross anatomy any time I saw blood.

559
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:18,151
- I was invited to leave.
- What the hell are you doing this for?

560
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:22,233
Because I gotta get over it. I can't let it stop me. I don't want to be weak.

561
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:25,281
Look, this job isn't for everyone, ok? There's no shame in that.

562
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:27,753
If you can't hold it together out there, you're no good to me

563
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:29,281
and you're no good to the patients.

564
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:31,033
I have to be able to count on you.

565
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:34,022
I just gotta learn to get hard about it and how not to care.

566
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:36,722
No. We're all gonna see things we don't want to see--

567
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:40,023
blood, gore, a severed hand sometimes.

568
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:44,243
What you have to learn is to be able to look past it.

569
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:46,592
You know, you get that tunnel vision where the only thing you see is

570
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:50,143
the person suffering, the person who needs to be saved. Focus on that.

571
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:51,161
Did you hear that?

572
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:54,812
A commercial jetliner is heading in from the atlantic towards the east coast,

573
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:58,513
95% probability it will come down in Driscoll county,

574
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:01,271
the plane has not responded to controllers.

575
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:05,191
Jim.

576
00:39:05,316 --> 00:39:07,772
It's all over the news. They said a plane's heading right toward us.

577
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:10,123
- Did they say when?
- I don't think they know.

578
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:12,602
The pilot said, "we're close."

579
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,892
Go out on the square. Warn people. Tell them to get inside.

580
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:18,002
- We're heading back.
- Hurry.

581
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,242
- Get out of here.
- What are you talking about?

582
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:29,471
Check and see if people are all right!

583
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:31,263
- The plane went down.
- Are you ok?

584
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,531
- I'm fine.
- Get inside.

585
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:35,981
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,823
Come on. Let's get inside.

587
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,291
Jim, that flight came in from Johannesburg. Andrea's brother might have been on it.

588
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:41,973
Where is she?

589
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,310
She drove into the city to check his apartment.

590
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:46,482
She'll be right back. There's gonna close all the bridges and tunnels

591
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,232
in a couple of minutes. Come on. You gotta get inside.

592
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:50,413
Be careful.

593
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,160
Dispatch, dispatch. Grandview medic-56.

594
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:02,280
I have a visual on an aircraft down

595
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:05,732
about a mile, a mile and a half from the main street, due south.

596
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:08,893
Let's start a first-alarm assignment to that location and show us responding.

597
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:09,851
Roger 56.

598
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:11,641
Come on.

599
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:15,023
Hey, look, you're on this one now, ok?

600
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,432
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:19,012
You're not gonna prove anything to yourself, understand?

602
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:21,460
-I'll be all right, I swear.
- Let's go. Come on.

603
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,592
Melinda...

604
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:06,891
I was driving, and I saw it.

605
00:42:08,017 --> 00:42:10,812
It went down right over me. There were cars everywhere.

606
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:16,943
Melinda, if my brother was on that plane, there is no way he survived.

607
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:20,563
Andrea.

608
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:23,741
We should call-- we should call someone.

609
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:25,502
The phones are out.

610
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:27,682
There's no signal.

611
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:30,682
I'll try mine.

612
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,712
We'll use my cell phone.

613
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,543
I know you see us.
