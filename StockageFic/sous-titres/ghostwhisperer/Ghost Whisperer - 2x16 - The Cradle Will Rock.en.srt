1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,400
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm married...

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
I live in a small town...

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
and I own antique shop.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
I might be just like you...

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,800
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,400
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:29,400
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:33,202
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:40,102
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:51,705
Here it is. I think you're gonna be
very pleased, Delia.

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,103
Oh, Randy, you did a wonderful job.
It looks brand-new.

15
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,100
Yeah, it took a month,
but I tracked down the perfect match

16
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,500
for that emerald you lost.

17
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:02,901
- You can't even tell which one is new.
- It is a gorgeous ring.

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,203
Charlie had such great taste,
and he knew I loved antiques, so...

19
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:09,101
Do you want to wear it now?

20
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:12,000
- You know what? Why don't you
just wrap it up for me? - Sure.

21
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,901
- Hey, how's your baby?
- She's perfect.

22
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,203
She sleeps a lot, and the best of all,
she looks like Lynn.

23
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,800
- How old?
- She's 6 months.

24
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,802
Tick, tick, tick.

25
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:23,500
You know, why are you
always doing that?

26
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:26,600
I mean, I'm not even 30.
I still have time, right?

27
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:29,202
I kid because I love.

28
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,200
Everybody on the floor! Now!

29
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,603
Put your hands behind your head,
and no talking!

30
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:37,601
Eyes to the floor!
Do it!

31
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:40,501
You! Get down!

32
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,302
Nobody move and nobody will get hurt!

33
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:55,202
Nobody move!

34
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,501
What are you doing?!

35
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:04,303
My inhaler!

36
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,902
Anybody else want to be a hero?!

37
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,603
Yeah, I didn't think so.

38
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,202
Get up!

39
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,903
Back room!

40
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:40,303
Anybody even twitches, I'll shoot him.

41
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:46,501
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. You?

42
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,300
Did I hear you say something?

43
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,200
I told you not to look at me.

44
00:02:56,308 --> 00:03:00,600
Now, you all have a wonderful day now.

45
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:35,102
Episode 2x16
"The Cradle Will Rock"

46
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,502
And what else do you remember?

47
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:41,802
He was tall, intimidating.

48
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:43,900
I feel much better. Thanks.

49
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,302
Is there anybody
who can drive you home?

50
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,001
Oh, yeah. My wife, Lynn.

51
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:51,603
If you find that bag of jewelry,
can you look for this art deco ring?

52
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:56,001
It had emeralds in it.
It was, um... my engagement ring.

53
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:56,900
I will.

54
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,101
Hey, Barrett.

55
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,801
Excuse me.

56
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,701
How are we all doing?

57
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:12,402
- We're fine.
- I'm just a little shaken up.

58
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,701
I'm really glad you're here.

59
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,600
This is crazy.

60
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,200
Hey, you want me to take over
for a little bit before I go?

61
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,201
No, I'm good.
It's actually kind of therapeutic.

62
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,800
Remind me, we moved to Grandview
because it was quiet and safe?

63
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:38,600
It's been a long time since anything
living scared me like that.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,803
I hate that you had to
go through that.

65
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:42,200
Is Randy going to be ok?

66
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,602
Yeah, he'll be fine. He's just got to
spend a little time on his own,

67
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,400
take some rest, he'll be ok.

68
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:55,600
- You sure you're going to be ok?
- Yeah, I'm just glad to be home.

69
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,702
Look...

70
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,501
- I'm just going to call in sick.
- What? Why would you do that?

71
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,700
You know, I'm sick of this
split schedule and...

72
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,202
- I just don't think you should be
alone right now. - Are you... I am...

73
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,901
I am fine, and a lot tougher
than you think I am.

74
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:13,803
- Right. I know. I just...
- Look, you are going to work, ok?

75
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:15,800
And I...

76
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm cooking.

77
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,203
All right.

78
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:28,100
I  am having a perfect evening.

79
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:32,601
I just took off an exfoliating mask,
and I am watching movies

80
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,800
that you normally make me
put back at the video store.

81
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:41,001
Yes, "The Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants" is one of them.

82
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,001
Come on. It's sweet.

83
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,700
When are you going to come home?

84
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:50,501
No. Wake me up.
I don't mind.

85
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,101
I've been having nightmares, too.

86
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:19,503
I guess it affected me more
than I'd like to admit.

87
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:21,902
Well, I've been on edge all morning.

88
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,101
I tossed and turned
all night last night.

89
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,302
I keep... obsessing about the ring.

90
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,202
I am just so pissed that
I didn't just put it on my finger.

91
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,102
And then I feel guilty because
I'm obsessing about an object

92
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:37,402
when all that really matters
is that nobody got hurt.

93
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:43,101
Hey, Charlie gave you that ring.
It's ok to obsess about it.

94
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:49,203
It's just that it reminded me of
this very innocent time with him.

95
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,802
Got a lot of memories attached to it.

96
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,002
I'm sure there are.

97
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:02,703
Hi. Just... just let us know
if you need any help.

98
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,600
You know, it says that the robber
got away with 35 grand in jewelry

99
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,403
and over 75 grand in cash.

100
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah, I know. I heard that
on the news last night.

101
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:12,803
What were they doing with
so much cash in their store?

102
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:16,301
Can you believe how fast that guy was?
I mean, it was like two minutes.

103
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:20,301
Felt like about two years to me.

104
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,802
You know what?
I'm feeling a little skittish.

105
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:28,100
- Do you mind if I just get some air?
- No. Go ahead.

106
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,501
You want anything?

107
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:35,902
You know what? If you go by Village
Java, an herbal tea would be great.

108
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,503
I can help you.

109
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,501
I just spoke to mr. Kaehler.
It's about Randy.

110
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:20,002
He's dead.

111
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:25,801
His wife found him this morning.
They think it was his asthma.

112
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:35,401
Now, Randy's sister Sally
would like to say a few words.

113
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:46,002
Three days ago, my sister-in-law
lost her husband,

114
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,601
a little girl lost her father...

115
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:53,001
And I lost my brother.

116
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:59,402
This town lost a good man.

117
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:03,700
He was just trying to make a living
and do the right thing...

118
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,703
No  one else sees me?

119
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:07,703
Just you?

120
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:12,301
He was just a simple man,
who loved people.

121
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,503
He was just a gentle soul.

122
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:19,502
We're going to miss you, Randy. 

123
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:31,003
Oh, Lynn, I just...
want to tell you how sorry I am.

124
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:35,301
- He was a really good man.
- I still can't believe he's gone.

125
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,003
I keep waiting for him
to just walk up to me,

126
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:43,602
take the baby,
and ask me how my day was.

127
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:47,102
I wanted to introduce you
to my friend Melinda.

128
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,601
We were both in the store
when it happened.

129
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:53,300
Your husband acted very bravely.
I'm really grateful to him.

130
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,902
Thank you for telling me that.
It means a lot.

131
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:59,401
She's so beautiful.

132
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:02,401
I  feel like he's watching over her.

133
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,401
I'm sure he is.

134
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,303
- Melinda?
- Are you all right?

135
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:15,503
Can I get you some water or something?

136
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,402
I think it's just allergies.

137
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,001
Find it!

138
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:30,602
I still think we should just
close the store for the day.

139
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,103
I don't know if I can concentrate
with everything that's just happened.

140
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:36,401
Which is exactly why we should
work today, just stay focused.

141
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,400
Yeah, but don't you think
we need a minute?

142
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:43,201
I mean, just to, I don't know,
let it sink in?

143
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, but I do that by staying busy.

144
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:50,702
I do it by sitting on the couch,
staring out the window with my mouth open.

145
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:55,702
Well, we all have our own way
of dealing with it.

146
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:04,105
What?

147
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,702
Are you all right?

148
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:21,400
Yeah. Yeah.
I just thought I saw something.

149
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,601
I think he was building a cradle
when he died.

150
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,400
- In the basement?
- Exactly.

151
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,602
- As a surprise for his family?
- Keep going.

152
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:31,100
And he wants you to tell
his wife where it's hidden.

153
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:34,302
See? We could practically go
into business together on this.

154
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:35,701
- Wait a minute. Aren't we already?
- Good point.

155
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:38,502
Ok, that wasn't even a challenge.
Give me a hard one.

156
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,502
Be careful what you wish for there,
wise guy.

157
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:43,700
All right, what are you going to do?
You're going to go bang on his wife's
door and tell her,

158
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,000
"there's a surprise in your basement?"

159
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,700
No, I'm going to tell her
Randy's here.

160
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,603
Do you think
she's going to believe you?

161
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,701
It's the time when
people are most likely to.

162
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:54,803
After a loss, you know,
they really want to believe.

163
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,603
- It's amazing.
- What?

164
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,900
Just that you can do this, you know?
That you can make the difference.

165
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:01,903
Look at the impact you have
on people's lives.

166
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:06,500
Is it worth the impact
it has on our lives?

167
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:11,103
Yeah, even though
I don't always think so.

168
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:16,302
All right. Enough philosophy.
Time for food.

169
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,400
You bought me roses.

170
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:25,000
Dr. Phil encourages the occasional
romantic gesture.

171
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,600
It's a signal from Randy.

172
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,000
Thought it was a signal from me,
saying, "I love my crazy wife."

173
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,103
I just wonder what it means.

174
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:36,603
I think it means
Randy owes me 50 bucks.

175
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,803
- Can I help you?
- Hi. Is Lynn here?

176
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:54,803
- No. She went back to work.
- Oh. I'm Melinda.

177
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,601
- We met at Randy's funeral.
- Yeah, I remember.

178
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,401
Do you know when she'll
be back from work?

179
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,003
What is this... what is this about?

180
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:07,803
I'm sorry. I just have to talk to her.
I have a message from Randy.

181
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:11,202
- What?
- About Randy.

182
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,100
Why don't you come in for a minute?

183
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,802
- Well, that's ok. I can come back
if it's a bad time. - Just come in.

184
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,302
I actually have to change Rose.

185
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:21,403
Her name is Rose?

186
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:33,201
Nap time, finally.

187
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:44,502
Oh, sorry the room's such a mess.
I was...

188
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:48,600
trying to find her favorite teddy,
and of course, it was at the bottom
of the trunk.

189
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:51,701
Want some coffee?

190
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:54,402
So, what's the message about Randy?

191
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:57,701
Oh, it's just something I needed
to talk to Lynn about.

192
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,902
Randy was my brother.
You can tell me.

193
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,300
I know. It's just personal.

194
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:04,600
You know, I can come back tonight
if that works better.

195
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,902
Lynn works just 5 minutes away.
I can call her.

196
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,903
Well, where does she work?
Because I could go there.

197
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:13,202
Oh, no, no, no.
Just let me call her.

198
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,900
She's on her way.

199
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,801
You know what?
I have to get going.

200
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,102
- Um, my husband's expecting me...
- She'll just be here in a few minutes.

201
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:45,601
No, I really have to go.

202
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:51,303
I'm sorry. I'm really
going to have to insist.

203
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,703
Is that her?

204
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:15,001
Get out.

205
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:21,603
How's it going?

206
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,403
I don't know what's happening,
but I need to leave.

207
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,001
- I'm expected...
- Take it easy. All right?

208
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:30,503
It's no big deal.
You want to go, you can go.

209
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,600
Just tell me what the message is.

210
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:37,601
It's just something
that I wanted to say to Lynn.

211
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,602
You had a little thing
with Randy, did you?

212
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:42,701
No. I'm married.

213
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:49,303
Well, let me tell you something.

214
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:54,903
There's a lot of married people
who like some candy on the side.

215
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,800
Well, I don't, and my husband's going
to be wondering where I am, so...

216
00:15:57,905 --> 00:16:01,601
Don't be stupid, ok, Melinda?

217
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:07,401
Just tell me what Randy
wanted Lynn to know.

218
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:12,601
We're having fun now,
though, aren't we?

219
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,801
But I'm going to get
serious in a minute.

220
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:20,403
There's a cradle in the basement
Randy was working on before he died.

221
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:27,103
He wanted Lynn to know that it was down
there. That's it. That's the message.

222
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,201
Good girl.

223
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,600
When did he tell you about the cradle?

224
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,100
- Not that long ago.
- And why? Why'd he tell you?

225
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,801
Because  I was the only one
listening at the time.

226
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,701
Yeah, I'll bet.

227
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:47,301
- Well, where is it, huh?
- I don't know.

228
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:54,501
- Where is it?
- Why in the hell are you asking me?

229
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:09,703
- This where the money is?
- What money?

230
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:20,103
This where it is?
Huh, Randy?

231
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:30,802
Well, where is it?

232
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:33,700
Where is it?!

233
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,601
What the hell are you doing?

234
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,801
Why are you doing this?
Just tell me where the money is.

235
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:46,303
Who are you talking to?!

236
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:52,900
Randy is here, his spirit.
That's how I knew about the cradle.

237
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,800
Ok.

238
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,200
Right.

239
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,201
Maybe Randy is here.

240
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:04,603
This is where he died.

241
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:11,202
Locked down in the basement,

242
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:14,200
all by himself.

243
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:18,903
Now, when you remember
where that money is...

244
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,400
you give me a shout, ok?

245
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:39,300
Excuse me.
Can you tell me how much this is?

246
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,200
Oh, there's no price on it?

247
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:47,300
Oh! Heavy. Hang on a second.
I'll find out for you.

248
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,402
What are you doing?
I already checked in here.

249
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,201
Yeah? You got a better idea?

250
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:01,001
No answer.

251
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,103
Are you all right?

252
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,800
No. Are you kidding?

253
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,903
Get me out of here.

254
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:19,001
Yeah, I will, I will.
Wyatt's going to leave in a minute.

255
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,500
He wants me to watch you.

256
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,601
Where the hell is it? Damn it!

257
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,902
He's crazy, but I'll get you out of
here as soon as we hear his car leave.

258
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:31,301
- Wyatt robbed the jewelry store,
didn't he? - Yeah.

259
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:33,901
Where's the baby?

260
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:34,603
Upstairs.

261
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:39,102
- You left her up there with him?
- It's ok. He'd never hurt her.

262
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,600
Wyatt said that you
act like Randy's here,

263
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:46,003
like you see his ghost or something.

264
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:49,301
Can you? Can you see my brother?

265
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,502
He did this to me.

266
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:52,902
He did!

267
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,902
Yeah. I can see him.
He's right behind you.

268
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:02,602
If that kind of thing was true,
could he hear me and see me?

269
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:10,900
Because if that kind of thing is true,
I want to tell him that I'm sorry that,

270
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:14,603
that things got messed up and
they weren't supposed to.

271
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:18,400
Ok, look. Sally?
If you leave me down here like this,

272
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,401
you're only going to be
in the same trouble as Wyatt,

273
00:20:20,508 --> 00:20:26,200
so why don't you do the right 
thing, ok? Just do it for Randy.

274
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:30,301
Don't talk to me like
I haven't done for Randy.

275
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:33,201
He was the kind of kid
that needed protecting.

276
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:37,001
- He was a sickly kid growing up.
- Tell her.

277
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:38,902
He's saying that your husband
did this to him.

278
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:43,201
I know, I know.
He did it to both of us.

279
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:45,701
And now we're in so deep.

280
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:48,601
He killed me.

281
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,202
What? What is it?

282
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:01,301
Wyatt  killed him.

283
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:05,202
No, that can't be.

284
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:10,403
Wyatt knows how much Randy
means to me... uh, meant.

285
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:18,003
Ok, he's gone. Let's go.
I'll take you out of here.

286
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,701
You know what?

287
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,402
If you know where the money is,

288
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:28,503
then if you told me, then we could
split it and I could get away from Wyatt.

289
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:29,803
He'd never have to know.

290
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:31,600
Don't you think if I knew
where the money was,

291
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:34,602
I would have told him an hour ago?

292
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:39,803
I don't care about the money.
I just want to go home.

293
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,300
Wyatt!

294
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:50,903
If she knows where the money is,
she's not telling.

295
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,700
Please!

296
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,203
She's lying.

297
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,603
I don't think so.

298
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,202
She's not going to play games.
She's scared to death.

299
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:11,703
Yeah? She tell you she sees Randy?

300
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:12,801
Yeah.

301
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,400
She said he was right there with us.

302
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:16,903
Gave me chills.

303
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:20,302
So what? What, is she nuts?

304
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:25,803
Why would she be here if it wasn't
to tell Lynn where the money is?

305
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:29,701
She says that Randy told her
that you killed him.

306
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:33,500
So you tell me. Is she nuts?

307
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:36,200
Maybe you're both nuts.

308
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:38,403
All right, take Rose to the apartment.
I am going to tear this place

309
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:43,802
upside down until I find what I am
looking for, and I will find it.

310
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:46,403
Now, go.

311
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,103
Why the hell won't you tell me
what he wants to know?

312
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,002
I am. I will.

313
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:56,803
Yeah, right.

314
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:59,203
Is it true?

315
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:04,702
Did you die in this basement?
Did he do something to you?

316
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:09,200
- You were in on it.
- I had to.

317
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:14,103
- Nobody has to do something like that.
- I did it for my daughter, for Rose.

318
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,802
What's wrong with Rose?

319
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:20,700
She was born too soon.
It was a miracle she lived.

320
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:22,703
The day we got her home...

321
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,503
to her house, her room...

322
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,900
I never had another day like that.

323
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,202
No insurance, hospital bills,
thousands and thousands...

324
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:36,500
- Still doesn't mean you should steal.
- I was... so desperate.

325
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:40,102
Wyatt came to me with this plan.

326
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:42,501
He told me I would look innocent.

327
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:47,900
Nothing would happen to me, and I'd
have enough money to take care of Rose.

328
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:52,101
There was nothing I wouldn't do
to protect her.

329
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,301
What did your wife
think about all this?

330
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:57,001
Lynn doesn't know.

331
00:23:57,106 --> 00:24:00,103
She was so glad
I wasn't hurt in the robbery.

332
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,503
What happened after the robbery?

333
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,700
I didn't really think
I could trust Wyatt or Sally.

334
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,803
She's my sister,
but she'll do anything Wyatt wanted.

335
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:14,702
I was afraid they'd leave town,
double-cross me,

336
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:20,600
so I managed to get my hands on the
money and I let Wyatt take the jewels.

337
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:24,200
He, uh, came here when
Lynn was out with Rose.

338
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,003
Wyatt! Wyatt!

339
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,802
He locked me down here.

340
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:34,702
He wouldn't let me come up till
I told him where the money was.

341
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:39,402
Just tell me what it is that
he wants so he can let me go.

342
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't know if he will let you go.

343
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,602
- Ok, you have to help me get out
of here. - You have to help me, too.

344
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,101
- How?
- The key.

345
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:50,303
Give Lynn the key.

346
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,103
You help me...

347
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:15,401
and then I help you.

348
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:19,002
I'll get you out of here.

349
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,601
I have an idea.

350
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:53,203
What is it, honey?

351
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:11,601
Hey, lady, move it.

352
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,901
Go!

353
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,900
Now.

354
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:54,701
Randy, what are you doing?
Let me out.

355
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:59,302
I'm really sorry.
I just can't let you go.

356
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,300
Randy, open the door.

357
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:10,001
We have to wait for Lynn.
You give her the key, then you go.

358
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:13,300
What? There is a man with
a gun in that basement.

359
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:15,101
Do you want your wife
to come home to that?

360
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,403
If I let you go now,
you'll go straight to the police.

361
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:22,302
I can't let that happen
until Lynn gets the key.

362
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,302
I'm really sorry.

363
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:29,300
Please understand.
I just can't take any chances.

364
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:09,601
Look, you and me, we got better
things to do than this.

365
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:15,302
Just tell me where the money is,
and I'll let you walk away.

366
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll be damned.

367
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,200
Randy. 

368
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:50,702
Is that you?

369
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:00,900
Hey, Delia.
You know where Melinda is?

370
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,201
Yeah, I think she went over to
Lynn's to bring her some cookies.

371
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,302
- Yeah, but she should be back by now.
- Yeah, I thought she went home.

372
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:09,402
- You know where Lynn's house is?
- Um, I think so.

373
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:14,802
We shipped something over to Randy
a while ago, so let me see.

374
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:16,700
Thanks.

375
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,502
Right  here.

376
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:23,000
I know the street.
Call me if she shows up.

377
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:26,803
Maybe we could talk about...

378
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,702
Hey, you think he's some
innocent victim in all this?

379
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,401
No, he's playing you, girlfriend,
just like he played me.

380
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,901
Don't listen to him.
He'll say anything.

381
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:44,400
Hey, I didn't even know there'd be
all that cash in the store.

382
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:46,802
I was just looking for
a little jewelry.

383
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:48,600
Well, Randy, he double-crossed me.

384
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,302
What is he talking about?

385
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:53,501
Didn't you, Randy?!

386
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:03,403
I feel... so lightheaded.
Why do I feel so tired?

387
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:08,202
It's because you're using up
all your energy.

388
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,401
Wait a minute.

389
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:16,201
You all have a wonderful day now.

390
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:20,802
He didn't know about
the 75 grand, did he?

391
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:33,600
Come on, Mel.

392
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,802
I knew it didn't make any sense.

393
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:40,301
He didn't have time to go to that safe,
and he left with one bag of jewelry.

394
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,100
You took the money, didn't you?

395
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,600
You took it before the
robbery even happened,

396
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:47,402
to make sure that it got
blamed on the thief.

397
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:52,902
- Where'd you put it?
- In my car, but I moved it later.

398
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:54,702
And you set him up.

399
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:55,802
Yeah.

400
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:59,803
Ha ha. Poor Wyatt.
He thought I was so stupid.

401
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,901
Treated me like such an idiot.

402
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:05,102
Do you think I was going to take a chance
like that for a few thousand in jewels?

403
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,403
And then they reported
the robbery on the news

404
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:09,002
and how much had been stolen.

405
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:15,103
You should have seen the look on
Wyatt's face. It was... priceless.

406
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:25,203
I still thought I had enough time
to get Lynn and Rose and get away.

407
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:28,403
- That's when he trapped you here?
- Yeah.

408
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:31,203
And you know the rest.

409
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,600
Do I?

410
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:18,503
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm looking for Lynn Cooper.

411
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,901
Lynn.

412
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:25,303
- Welcome home.
- That's Lynn.

413
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:28,202
She and Randy moved months ago.

414
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,100
- Did they leave any kind
of forwarding address? - No.

415
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,601
I think they just needed
something a bit larger.

416
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,103
Right.

417
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,403
Sorry to bother you.

418
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:42,302
Where's Rose?

419
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:45,801
Get inside.
Get in here.

420
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:52,403
What's wrong with you?

421
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,302
- Get in the kitchen!
- Why?

422
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:06,601
You want Rose to be an orphan?
Do it!

423
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:20,203
You remember Lynn.

424
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:30,502
- Move it! Get over! You, too! Move!
- What the hell is this, Wyatt?

425
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,003
Tell him not to hurt her.
I'll tell him where the money is.

426
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:35,903
Randy is asking you not to hurt her.
He'll tell you what you want to know.

427
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,602
- What is she talking about?
- I'm not going to hurt you.

428
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:40,002
I just want to know where my money is.

429
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,801
- What money?
- The money from the robbery.

430
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:44,901
Your husband and Wyatt
were in on it together.

431
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,301
Oh, well, that's crazy because
Randy would never do that.

432
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:50,701
Oh, that's the easiest part
of the story to believe, trust me.

433
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:53,403
- Give her the key.
- Look, Randy has something for you.

434
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:58,103
He says that you'll know
what to do with it.

435
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:02,801
Well, whatever this key opens
is where he hid the 75 grand.

436
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,401
It belongs to me.

437
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:07,502
I don't understand. Why would
Randy send this message to you?

438
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:10,000
It's complicated.

439
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:11,102
What does this open, huh?

440
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:14,902
- It's to my locker at the gym.
- It's to Randy's locker at the gym.

441
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:16,801
- What?
- What gym? What gym?

442
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:20,303
Um, the main street gym.

443
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,101
What's happening?
Why haven't you called me?

444
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:25,703
Don't worry about it!

445
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:28,203
Just meet me at the gym on main street.

446
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:32,200
- Where's Melinda? Where's Lynn?
- They're both here with me.

447
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:36,001
- What are you going to do?
- Just get to the gym!

448
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:37,700
You park in the lot
and you wait for me.

449
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:43,502
And when Lynn gives me what I want,
you give the baby to her.

450
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,502
All right, right here. This is it.
Pull in right here.

451
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,300
Now, we are just going to walk
inside and go to the locker.

452
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:03,800
Just a few more minutes
and this will all be over, girls.

453
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:09,802
All right, good.
Get out. Get out.

454
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:12,701
Let's go. Move it.

455
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,103
Which one?

456
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:16,002
Tell him it's locker 39.

457
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:18,001
39.

458
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:20,602
Open it.

459
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:27,802
- It doesn't work.
- What are you doing?

460
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:31,901
- It doesn't fit!
- Give me that.

461
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:36,602
Son of a bitch!

462
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:54,702
You got to be kidding.

463
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:58,202
What the hell are you doing?

464
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,003
Where's my money?!

465
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:05,102
Freeze! Don't move! Hands up!
Let me see them now!

466
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,802
How did you know to call the police?

467
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:17,200
Well, honey, I didn't. They called me.

468
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:24,301
Lynn, I'm sorry.

469
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:31,803
For the record, this is Wyatt Hawkins?

470
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,900
Yes, that's him.

471
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:40,703
He was my brother, Wyatt,
and you killed him.

472
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,900
Would you tell him that I'm sorry?

473
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:51,801
Tell him... tell him that I should
have watched over him better.

474
00:36:52,308 --> 00:36:54,200
Come on.

475
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,803
Tell her it's ok.
Tell her I'm fine.

476
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:59,803
He said it's ok.
It's fine now.

477
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:05,601
I'm really sorry I let this happen.
Will you watch out for me?

478
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:19,003
Hey, Melinda.

479
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:20,903
- Hi. Good morning.
- Morning.

480
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:22,802
Please tell me you don't need
another statement.

481
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,602
Oh, no, no.
We've got plenty of those.

482
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,301
We just sent Wyatt
for a psych evaluation.

483
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:32,503
Really? He didn't seem like
he was nut-house crazy.

484
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:38,200
Well, he said you'd been speaking
with Randy Cooper's ghost.

485
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:43,403
Does sound kind of nutty, doesn't it?

486
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:46,402
Yeah, well, he's probably just
angling for an insanity defense.

487
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:47,203
Right.

488
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,600
Listen. We were able to find all
the jewelry in Wyatt's house,

489
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:54,003
and I got the ok to give
Delia her ring back...

490
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,803
But I thought you might like to.

491
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:00,603
I'd love to.

492
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,302
You don't know what this means to me.

493
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,503
I never thought I'd see it again.

494
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:10,103
Thank you so much.

495
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,502
I can't believe everything
you have just been through.

496
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,201
You know what? I was just at
the wrong place at the wrong time.

497
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,103
It seems to happen to you a lot.

498
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:20,701
In fact, I was meaning to ask you,
the day I found out that Randy had died,

499
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:25,303
I saw you in the square
and I was about to tell you, but...

500
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:27,501
you told me first.

501
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,402
How did you know that?

502
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:33,202
She doesn't know?
Wow. How did you pull that off?

503
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:36,601
I... could just see it on your face.

504
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,300
But how?

505
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:41,100
How did you make the leap
that he had died?

506
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:44,800
I really don't know how to explain it.
I just... have very good instincts

507
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,402
about these things.

508
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,002
Ok.

509
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:49,702
You skated on that one.

510
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,903
It's my turn to buy you coffee, right?

511
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:58,002
No way. No, no, no, no, no.
Coffee is on me, so I'll be right back.

512
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:01,800
You put my life in danger
and your wife's.

513
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:04,801
- It--it was a calculated risk.
- You used me.

514
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:07,401
Look, all I wanted was for Lynn
be taken care of.

515
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:10,202
Yeah, but nothing came from
any of it, Randy. You're dead,

516
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,502
and your sister and your brother-in-law
are going to prison, and no one but you

517
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:17,100
knows where the money is, so what
do you want your wife to do now?

518
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:22,801
I--I tried everything I could.
And now it's time to move on.

519
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:28,502
Do you see the light?

520
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,803
Yep.

521
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:33,301
Wait--wait a minute.
Where are you going?

522
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:37,700
You know, I can't help wondering
what's going to happen to a guy like me

523
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:40,703
- on the other side of that light.
- You can't stay here.

524
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,801
You're meant to cross over.

525
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:44,300
Yeah.

526
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:47,301
Let's just say I got a better offer.

527
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,200
Randy, don't do it.

528
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,403
I know what you're talking about,
who you're talking about.

529
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:52,602
Don't go to him.

530
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:56,901
I've already made my deal,
and they want me to give you a message.

531
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:58,801
What message?

532
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:02,001
- The dead will walk.
- What does that mean?

533
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:05,000
You think you know so much.
You don't know anything.

534
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:09,802
They've shown me things,
so much that's about to happen.

535
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,601
There's no way I'm going to miss it.

536
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:16,102
Randy?

537
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,702
Melinda?

538
00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:21,703
I didn't know you were there.

539
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:24,203
Were you just talking to yourself?

540
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:25,303
Randy.

541
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:29,503
You know, I was just... thinking
about the money from the robbery

542
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,902
and how frustrated I am
that they didn't find it.

543
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,800
Oh. Well, here.

544
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:40,002
Didn't you say that Lynn got a key
from Randy? Maybe she knows something.

545
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:43,502
- Front door is open.
- Car's not here.

546
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,702
Hello?

547
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,500
Hey, Lynn?

548
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:50,202
Are you here?

549
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:54,300
Well, she cleared out everything.

550
00:40:56,806 --> 00:41:00,100
Lynn?
Are you up here?

551
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:06,003
She sure got out of here in a hurry.

552
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:07,503
You think she knew where the money was?

553
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:10,202
I don't know, but even if she did,
the police have the key,

554
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:14,003
so unless she has a duplicate, there's
no way of her really getting to it.

555
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:18,600
Wow. She left a lot of
great stuff behind.

556
00:41:21,306 --> 00:41:25,403
Would it be immoral/illegal
of us to sell it?

557
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:27,201
Probably.

558
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,601
What?

559
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,603
Look at this.

560
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,601
- That money was here the whole time.
- I thought the police had the key.

561
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,503
No, it doesn't matter.
It was never locked.

562
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:50,103
Randy knew that she would
recognize the design on the key.

563
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:59,903
That's the only signal she needed.
The money was right here.

564
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:13,903
Which is why she was so confused when
he said that the key was for a locker.

565
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:24,600
Do you think Lynn has the money?

566
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:28,900
