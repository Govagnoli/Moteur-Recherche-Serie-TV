1
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:16,226
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

3
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,318
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

4
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,404
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

5
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:26,374
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,277
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

7
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,801
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

8
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:40,037
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

9
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,416
H- help me.

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,761
Can you get me out of here?
Can anybody hear me?

11
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,813
I can hear you.

12
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,181
And I know
your secret.

13
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,317
What secret?

14
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,392
That you are seriously in touch
with your inner child.

15
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,303
What can I say?
Easily amused.

16
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,173
No, I love that
about you.

17
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:12,440
You know, large shoes,
big, red nose, and I'm all set.

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,591
- Where did ned go?
- Hey, houdini.

19
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:16,483
How about making
an appearance?

20
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:18,321
You said I wouldn't
have to stay.

21
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:19,970
Yeah. I also said...

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,801
that you would
have to explain why.

23
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:25,103
I have a really important
math project due tomorrow.

24
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:28,801
I was actually counting on another
pair of hands today.

25
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,923
Will these do?
I'll stay.

26
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,813
I hope you're
not upset.

27
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:35,490
As long as you're
ok with it.

28
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,621
Cool. Thanks, mom.
Thanks, melinda.

29
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:41,001
If he even cracks a "c"
on this project,

30
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:44,131
I can live with getting
a "c" on my parenting.

31
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,271
So, what do you
need me to do?

32
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:49,591
Close up.
We're going shopping.

33
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,372
...This place for the last 20 years
I never thought I'd have to leave.

34
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:06,893
Business is that slow?

35
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:09,551
Ever since eba
dead as a doornail.

36
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:12,771
Well, you could sell
your stuff online, too, or...

37
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,861
get somebody else to do it
and sell your stuff

38
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:17,491
from the comfort
of your own home.

39
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:21,070
Aw, nah. I'm too much of a people
person. I'd miss talking to folks.

40
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,233
Melinda, you have
to look at these.

41
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,730
See what I mean?

42
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:29,560
Oh. I didn't know
that I had put those out.

43
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,861
Are these not for sale?

44
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:33,913
Uh, n-no. No, they're for sale.
Everything must go.

45
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,690
I can understand why you
wouldn't want to part with them.

46
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,800
They're gorgeous.

47
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,650
Wow. Hand-painted
on the front.

48
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:40,852
Are they
christmas ornaments?

49
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,401
Oh, well, could be,
or whatever you like.

50
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,872
If you don't get these, I'm gonna
get them for the store myself.

51
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:46,293
Ok, I'll take them.

52
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,813
You have a good eye, delia. You can go
shopping with me anytime you want.

53
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,230
Oh, you're gonna be
sorry you said that.

54
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,890
So where do you
want me to put these?

55
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,740
Oh, we don't
have to do that now.

56
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,131
Are you kidding?

57
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,510
I haven't been this jazzed
since I sold my first house.

58
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:03,990
Seems like
a thousand years ago.

59
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,472
And please don't tell ned.

60
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:16,680
I want him to think that covering his
hours was a huge sacrifice for me.

61
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:33,102
you know what?
I think this shelf isn't level.

62
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:35,500
You wanna put a piece of
wood right underneath this leg.

63
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,900
You know, maybe we could just keep
the ornament in the box for now.

64
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,753
P.O.P.- "Point of purchase. "

65
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:46,881
You always wanna put some out front
where everyone can see them.

66
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,720
- I'll think about that.
- That's the point.

67
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,833
You don't wanna think.
You just wanna buy.

68
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,041
Can you just
put them back, please?

69
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,561
S- sure.

70
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,161
I didn't mean to-

71
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:00,311
it's just sometimes
when I have new things,

72
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:03,790
I like to hold off on putting them out
until I'm really sure where they're going.

73
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,320
I understand.

74
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,590
Melinda, I am so sorry.
I just...

75
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,561
get carried away
sometimes.

76
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,582
Me, too. I guess I'm
just a little on edge.

77
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,023
I know it's not easy
being your own boss.

78
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:35,751
I used to think that I was
gonna open up my own place,

79
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,680
have a little store
like this one.

80
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:43,461
I was either gonna call it delia's
decorations or the curbside curator.

81
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,521
And why didn't you?

82
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:49,602
I got married, I had ned,
and then the concept

83
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:52,903
of someday just becomes
a little more abstract.

84
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,821
Uh, how did you
get into real estate?

85
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:59,420
When my husband died.

86
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,442
I had to think of
a plan "b" in a hurry.

87
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,950
There's no time to grow
a small business.

88
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,320
I had to get out there
and make some money, so...

89
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,681
got my real estate license.

90
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:13,171
Could you grab some newspapers
and maybe check for estate sales?

91
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,812
Sure. No problem.

92
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,021
As soon as you can,
before they run out.

93
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,552
On my way.
Want anything else?

94
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,950
- No. Thanks.
- Ok.

95
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,470
Who are you?

96
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:49,843
What's going on?

97
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:54,133
What's happening?
Talk to me. I can help.

98
00:06:56,718 --> 00:07:00,042
Stop it.
Don't do that.

99
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,923
Just please stop it.

100
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:13,802
Please. Stop it!
Aah! Stop! Please.

101
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,163
Can you see me?

102
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,140
So you can see and hear this ghost,
but he can't see or hear you?

103
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,591
Yeah. How's that for
a cruel twist of fate?

104
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,131
Maybe this ghost
is deaf and blind.

105
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,461
It's like
he's trapped here,

106
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,631
being tormented by these
christmas ornaments.

107
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,382
Not everybody likes
the holidays.

108
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:12,860
He's definitely trying to get rid of
them. It's like they're alive, breathing.

109
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,733
I've never seen
anything like it.

110
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,841
Where are they now?

111
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,733
Well, I was hoping
the answer was hidden,

112
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:24,370
you know, deeply away
somewhere in the store.

113
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:29,541
- Well, they're pretty.
- I wish you could see this.

114
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:37,800
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

115
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,373
<i>- Can't I touch you?
- No!</i>

116
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,441
<i>Don't do that.
No. Stop it!</i>

117
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,971
<i>Leave me alone!
No. Stop it!</i>

118
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:50,250
Come on.
Keep breathing.

119
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:53,212
- Stand up. You're all right.
- What happened?

120
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,981
You tell me. You just
blacked out there for a while.

121
00:08:55,988 --> 00:09:01,352
I- I felt scared and really angry.
It was overwhelming.

122
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:03,351
- Maybe you should sit down.
- No, I don't think I can.

123
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,191
I should walk it off.

124
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:10,933
- Did you see anything?
- Yeah, I did. 2 people hitting each other

125
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:12,702
and some kind
of fight.

126
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,451
Ok, I want this ghost
out of here.

127
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,883
If the ghost wants
to destroy these ornaments,

128
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,791
he can't do it himself,
fire is the best way

129
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,880
that I know to destroy
something made of wood.

130
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,033
If I do it for him,
he can cross over.

131
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:07,912
- Is he gone?
- Yes.

132
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:10,870
Come on.

133
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,961
Oh, I am so hungry.

134
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:24,262
Ey're back.

135
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:41,002
So is he.

136
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:59,782
Professor payne?

137
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:05,751
- Professor payne.
- Go away!

138
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:08,650
I changed my mind!
No student office hours today!

139
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,761
I'm not a student. It's melinda
gordon. You helped me before.

140
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,810
Ow! Note to self-

141
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,023
stop helping people.

142
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,381
What are you looking for?

143
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,482
Well, before I hit my head, I was
looking for my lunch.

144
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,863
It's in a paper bag.

145
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:23,801
Oh. Brown-bagging lunch.
That doesn't sound like you.

146
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:27,465
Ms. Gordon. All right.
What do you have for me, huh?

147
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,083
Bunch of ambiguous
questions that you probably

148
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,482
- already know the answers to?
- You give me too much credit.

149
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,641
Maybe not enough credit. Hmm?

150
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:35,410
In your studies,
have you ever come across

151
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:38,600
a situation where a spirit can
make an object appear in our world?

152
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,930
- Materialization?
- I guess.

153
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,410
What I'm talking about is an
object that the spirit can see

154
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,342
and touch and that we
can see and touch, too.

155
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:47,523
Let's hope it's jewelry
and cash then, huh?

156
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:48,971
Yes or no?

157
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:52,201
Look, I've heard of it,
but I don't believe it.

158
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:55,172
- And why not?
- Because I don't believe in ghosts!

159
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,411
How can you study this stuff
and not believe in it?

160
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,222
I don't study the stuff,
ms. Gordon.

161
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:02,613
I- I study people's need
to believe in the stuff,

162
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:05,342
people like you standing
in front of me, looking...

163
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:09,910
Looking beautiful. And smelling delicious
is what- that perfume, is that french?

164
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,281
Let me smell it.

165
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:16,262
Ok, let's just assume for a minute that
spirits exist and they can move objects.

166
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,450
Yeah. They called apports.

167
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,821
It's from the french word
apporter. It means "to bring. "

168
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,801
Bring what?

169
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:25,593
More of that perfume you're wearing,
'cause seriously, it's making me bananas.

170
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,801
I'm kidding.
Unless I'm not.

171
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:33,461
Ok, I'm kidding.
Um, it brings clarity,

172
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,370
deeper understanding,
aside from the literal,

173
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,341
you know, interpretation
that an apport

174
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,460
is sent from beyond
to the living,

175
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,813
maybe it's a manifestation
of something that's so important,

176
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:44,591
you know, something
really symbolic.

177
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:47,162
So if a ghost couldn't talk,

178
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,553
they would maybe make an object
appear as a way of communicating.

179
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:54,103
- And can these apports move on their own?
- Yeah, and cats can water-ski.

180
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,372
- Is that why they glow?
- Cats don't glow!

181
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:58,381
- Apports.
- I know you're talking about apports!

182
00:12:58,388 --> 00:12:59,780
- Why are you yelling?!
- I'm not yelling.

183
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,230
I'm yelling, right?!
I make that mistake.

184
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm sorry.
I tend to disassociate.

185
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:07,403
- That's an understatement.
- Wh-what do you want?

186
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,870
Why are you here?
Do you have an apport at home,

187
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:12,550
and it's just glowing
with ghostly energy? Whoo!

188
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,753
Well, if that's true, why don't you
bring it in so we can test it?

189
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:19,900
Why would I have
an apport?

190
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,562
I mean, there's no such thing.
It's make-believe, right?

191
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:35,210
Ah. You... you baffle me!
You little minx.

192
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,470
Aw, I had a feeling
you'd be back.

193
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:48,293
- Really?
- I know a repeat customer when I see one.

194
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:51,233
- Still got a few things left.
- Any more ornaments?

195
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,601
No, don't worry.
You've got the only ones.

196
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,880
I was hoping you could tell me
where you got them.

197
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:58,433
- Why?
- In case they have any more.

198
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,650
Well, I doubt
that there are.

199
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,671
Yeah. Pretty unique.

200
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:04,502
Well, I don't know
where they came from.

201
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:08,233
If I did, I'd let you know. Now, if you
excuse me, I gotta get back to my packing.

202
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,653
Maybe the ornaments just
appeared out of nowhere.

203
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,401
How do you mean
"just appeared"?

204
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:21,033
Last night, a set of ornaments
just like the ones

205
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:25,002
that you sold me just appeared
on my kitchen table.

206
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,032
- I thought I was going crazy.
- You're not.

207
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,882
I racked my brain
trying to remember

208
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:34,641
if I picked 'em up
from someone yesterday

209
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:37,130
or if I saw someone
drop 'em here at the stall.

210
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,652
What about a man
in his mid-thirties,

211
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:43,353
um, short, brown hair,
stubble, pale skin,

212
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:46,242
a little disheveled,
doesn't like to look you in the eye?

213
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:50,162
Shifty I tend to remember,
but no, no, he's not ringing a bell.

214
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:52,652
If I see anybody like that,
I'll let you know.

215
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,152
Please.

216
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:00,772
Melinda...
Wait.

217
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,383
I just found this.

218
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,700
- I'll buy it from you.
- Uh, no, no, no.

219
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,670
Y- you take it.
I- I think you should have it.

220
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,101
Ok.

221
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,833
I need your real-estate
expertise to find this house.

222
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,702
It sounds like
an amazing house,

223
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,180
but you don't remember
where it is?

224
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:54,542
Uh, I've never been.
A client of mine told me about it.

225
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,491
He can't remember
the address?

226
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:59,522
He's not from around here.
Is he looking to buy?

227
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:00,886
Do I have a shot?

228
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,800
Uh, I'm not so sure
he could swing a mortgage,

229
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,213
but he's got me curious.
I'd love to see it.

230
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:08,302
This is the website
that tracks

231
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,643
all of the residential
properties in the area.

232
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,680
You can go ahead and
use my account number

233
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,362
and just put in as many
details as you can

234
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,922
and then search the database
and see if you find the house.

235
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:20,032
If you convince him to buy,
will you steer him my way?

236
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,533
Thank you.

237
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,683
Well, at least now the ghost
is, uh, communicating with you.

238
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,310
Oh, yeah.
We're like this.

239
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:35,670
He won't talk to me, look at me,
or even acknowledge my presence.

240
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:38,872
Well, you did say it takes some
longer than others to adjust to death.

241
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:41,113
Yeah. Everybody deals
with death differently.

242
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:43,871
I think delia's having
a hard time with it.

243
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:45,820
Oh, yeah?
Did you talk to her?

244
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:49,713
I've been meaning to, but I
haven't really had the chance. Oh.

245
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:53,982
That's it.
That's the house.

246
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:44,003
Hello?
Is anybody home?

247
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,592
Hello.

248
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,481
Hello.

249
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:11,863
Miss.

250
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:44,873
Give me a minute.

251
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:48,261
- She ok?
- Physically, she's fine.

252
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,921
She's just completely withdrawn.
She won't talk.

253
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,822
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

254
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,343
The woman's
christine nelson.

255
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,630
Found her picture I.D. Inside.
And he's, um-

256
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,920
well, he was dennis hightower.
I don't know if that does you any good.

257
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,900
Something terrible must have
happened in this house.

258
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,693
I mean, do you remember
the first vision I had?

259
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:08,462
- 2 people fighting.
- I have to get him to talk to me.

260
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:09,810
Look, you found his body.

261
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,571
Maybe that's all he needed to
resolve before he could cross over.

262
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,522
But he's still here.

263
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:17,341
Yeah, well, the police
will be, too, so...

264
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,623
Dennis Hightower.

265
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,900
Are you surprised that
I found out your name?

266
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,780
- Your name?
- Melinda.

267
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:43,102
It's really nice
to meet you.

268
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:45,802
Everything's
gonna be ok now.

269
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:48,183
We found your body.
You can cross over.

270
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:51,062
All you have to do
is go into the light.

271
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:56,661
Dennis, can you
see the light?

272
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:01,991
- You see the light?
- No. I can'T. Only you can.

273
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,490
Is there something else
that you need?

274
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:11,682
Something that
I can help you with?

275
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:13,771
Tell me
what happened to you.

276
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,832
What happened to you.

277
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:18,970
You know that
you're dead, right?

278
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,072
- Right.
- Who did this to you?

279
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:25,450
- You. You.
- Why don't you understand me?

280
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,223
Understand me.

281
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,872
Coroner's report says it looks
like dennis was poisoned.

282
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,031
Why didn't he
tell me about that?

283
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,041
Maybe I'd be better off if I
talked to christine.

284
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,192
Let the police do that.

285
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,102
I mean, he obviously
led me to her for a reason.

286
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,911
She might be
an important part of his life.

287
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,922
She might be an
important part of his death.

288
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:45,863
No. You think?

289
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,141
Dennis and christine
might be the 2 people you saw

290
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:50,542
fighting in your vision.

291
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:53,211
Why would she poison dennis
and then stay with the body?

292
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,593
Guilty don't always
run and hide.

293
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,333
Maybe dennis led
you to the house

294
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:59,063
not to help christine, but
to help you find his killer.

295
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,221
Why didn't he
cross over?

296
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,680
You're right. You should
try and talk to christine.

297
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:11,062
Do you have
an appointment?

298
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:14,980
No. I'm, uh, looking for a patient,
christine nelson.

299
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:17,980
The emergency room at mercy hospital
told me that she was taken here.

300
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,111
- This morning.
- And why was she moved?

301
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:21,882
Too many heads,
not enough beds.

302
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:24,640
If your condition isn't serious,
life-threatening, or fatal,

303
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,660
you get turfed out.
Follow me.

304
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:30,762
Christine,
you have a visitor.

305
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,132
We met yesterday
at your house.

306
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,183
I'm melinda gordon.

307
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,590
I should get back
to my desk.

308
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,202
I know that the police were here
and you wouldn't talk to them.

309
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:51,422
I'm not the police,
and I need you to talk to me.

310
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:53,800
I knew dennis.

311
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:58,430
I think I know how he died,
but it would help to know why.

312
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,653
Christine,
can you hear me?

313
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,643
It's gonna take some time
before christine's

314
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,483
communicatmmn skills
are back to where they were.

315
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:12,012
Ms. Gordon,
dr. Hillary sloan.

316
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:15,183
I thought that she didn't suffer
any physical damage.

317
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:16,302
She didn'T.

318
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:20,222
But this kind of change is a lot
for a person with autism to process.

319
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:25,310
Wait. Did you just
say that christine is autistic?

320
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,462
Do you have a minute?

321
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:50,690
As you can see,
they like puzzles and games.

322
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:55,343
Pacing, hand flapping,
rocking back and forth-

323
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:59,260
they are all coping mechanisms
for people with autism.

324
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,370
You know, there are
high-functioning

325
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:05,730
people with autism who've learned to
behave in a more socially acceptable way.

326
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,733
A lot of them are loners.

327
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,761
They relate better to objects
than they do to people.

328
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,693
They don't like to talk.

329
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:14,833
Or look you in the eye.

330
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,371
They don't follow
a lot of our social rules.

331
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,210
Dennis is autistic.

332
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:23,462
Christine and dennis had lived
together since their twenties.

333
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:24,592
They were a couple.

334
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,881
Yes. They had a home-care worker
who came over once a week.

335
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:31,302
Other than that,
dennis took care of her.

336
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:46,352
- Where did she get this?
- Oh. Um, that's mine.

337
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:50,400
I sell those in my store. She must
have taken it from my purse.

338
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:52,541
It's beautiful.

339
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,193
- It was the oven.
- I'm sorry?

340
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,100
I know how dennis died.

341
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,782
Wait, if it was
carbon monoxide poisoning,

342
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,403
how come christine
wasn't affected?

343
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:33,102
Because it's her ritual every time she
comes home to open up all the windows.

344
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:36,481
- I saw it in a vision.
- She's not a murderer.

345
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,550
- Murderess.
- Touche.

346
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,170
Question is why is
Dennis still here?

347
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,453
I found christine.
She's safe. What more is there?

348
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,771
What I wanna know is
why is dennis still autistic.

349
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,410
If he's dead,
he should be cured, right?

350
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,470
Mmm, technically, yes.
Every soul is perfect.

351
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:53,251
When they cross over, the handicaps
they had in life no longer affect them,

352
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,071
but if they're earthbound,
sometimes they cling to the familiar.

353
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,363
They can't let go
of who they were.

354
00:27:57,378 --> 00:27:59,482
He did answer your questions
at some point, didn't he?

355
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:01,372
He's been mimicking me.
It's called echolalia.

356
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:03,330
It's when they echo whatever
you say so you know

357
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,643
that they can hear you,
even if they can't respond.

358
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:08,640
Ok, so all this time, he has
been communicating with you,

359
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,562
- ... just in his own way.
- Yes, through the ornaments.

360
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,443
The last one that I touched
showed me how he died.

361
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:15,521
Let's hope the answer to why
he's still here is in one of those.

362
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:22,163
These objects, they don't vibrate any
more or less than your average object.

363
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:25,573
And you can't see or hear anything
coming from inside them?

364
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:27,012
Like what?
What, a movie?

365
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:30,420
What am I gonna see, a movie? Listen to,
show tunes? It's wood. It's like my head.

366
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:31,940
Lady, it's normal.

367
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,260
There's nothing normal
about them.

368
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:40,573
So your "friend" said she felt transported
after she held these ornaments?

369
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:43,331
- Yes.
- Ok. Well, I held these ornaments.

370
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,790
I'm still here.

371
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,150
What time of day did your friend
say she had these visions?

372
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:51,050
Why is the time of day
important?

373
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:53,100
Well, yeah. If she did it
right after happy hour,

374
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,413
- I'd say it's very important.
- Yeah, that's real funny.

375
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:57,951
I thought you would at least
have a professional curiosity about this.

376
00:28:57,957 --> 00:28:59,070
Oh, I'm curious.

377
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:02,533
I have a lot of curiosity about you,
about what you're doing here.

378
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:05,463
I just wanna know if you can
see anything in these ornaments.

379
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,233
Melinda, you haven't touched
any of these ornaments

380
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:09,150
since you've been here,
not directly, not one.

381
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:12,142
I wanna know what happens when
you touch these ornaments.

382
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:15,441
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I'd like to find out.

383
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:20,251
This one, the bunny, had a higher
energy rating than the other ornaments.

384
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,490
What happens when you
touch that guy?

385
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:31,840
You know, I thought you
were a man of science,

386
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:33,801
and there's nothing
scientific about this.

387
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:37,072
What's more scientific than
collecting my own empirical data?

388
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:04,203
No! Stop it!
Mami... Don't leave me!

389
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,332
What? What happened?

390
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:09,733
What did you see?

391
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:13,612
I saw a child being taken
from her mother.

392
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,911
Are you telling me
the truth?

393
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:18,360
All I can say, professor,
if I could walk out of here

394
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,623
knowing that everything
we've talked about was made up,

395
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:24,371
- I would be the happiest girl on earth.
- Wait. Psychometry.

396
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:28,071
What you're talking about
is called psychometry.

397
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,781
It's when you get visions or flashes of
the past from touching these objects.

398
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:36,013
- That makes sense.
- Easy for you to say.

399
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:39,463
Maybe if you did some more
tests on the ornaments.

400
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,632
I'd like to actually
do some tests on you, melinda.

401
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,621
Thanks for your time.

402
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:44,402
Melinda, I'm not talking
about root canal here.

403
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm talking about
very scientific, controlled tests.

404
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,072
They could-
they can help us.

405
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:52,771
- I'm not an experiment.
- Melinda, listen.

406
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:58,343
When you get a chance,
just come by.

407
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,312
Come by and talk to me
some more.

408
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,190
This is important.

409
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:15,123
I don't think it's about him.
I think it's about both of them.

410
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,940
Oh, that's on sale,
by the way.

411
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,792
It's like it's his memories
of their life together,

412
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,441
you know, how he died,
when he first saw her.

413
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:21,771
- That makes sense.
- Well, whatever dennis wants,

414
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:23,501
it has something to do
with christine somehow.

415
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,882
It's too bad
she won't talk to you.

416
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:26,543
Maybe she'll respond
to the ornaments.

417
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,292
I thought that I would take them down to
the hospital and see if it could spark anything

418
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,841
Besides, if I leave now,
I can still make visiting hours.

419
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,430
Well, I'd offer to
mind the store, but...

420
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,851
it's ok. I know that you're busy
saving lives while I'm saving the dead.

421
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:41,810
- Bye.
- See ya.

422
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:03,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:06,482
How'd, uh,
ned do today?

424
00:32:06,486 --> 00:32:08,903
- Oh, I sent him home early.
- Really?

425
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,730
- What did he do now?
- Oh, no. Nothing.

426
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,122
It's fine.
It's just I had to close up.

427
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,153
I have an errand to run.

428
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:17,141
Well, don't let me
keep you.

429
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:19,440
You just let me know
if he causes you any trouble, ok?

430
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:21,443
You know, what I hate
is when people ask if you're ok

431
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,750
when you're so obviously not.

432
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:29,890
Yeah. I hate that, too.

433
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:33,260
So, are you ok?

434
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:37,340
I-
no. It's just...

435
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,561
I don't know.
It's just been one of those days.

436
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:43,302
I am so sick
of selling houses.

437
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:45,313
Every time
I turn around,

438
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:48,590
there's this new couple buying
their house for the first time.

439
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:52,222
They're arguing about where
to put the office or the guest room.

440
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:56,052
And if it's not newlyweds,
then it's new parents, and...

441
00:32:57,486 --> 00:32:59,961
they're trying to figure out
where the baby room goes.

442
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:02,972
Everybody has
their whole life ahead of them.

443
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:06,300
How long were you
and charlie married?

444
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:11,211
Sometimes it feels like
we're still married.

445
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,680
He's been dead
for 3 years now.

446
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,281
I've just been having
such a hard time moving on.

447
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,312
And ned's
been acting out.

448
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:26,901
I know he needs me, and I am doing
everything I can to be there for him.

449
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:29,872
I understand.

450
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,720
Anyway-heh.

451
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:37,151
Why don't you tell me
your secret?

452
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:40,262
Oh, well, having work that you love
takes your mind off things.

453
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,301
Ah. Well, my work
does just the opposite.

454
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:45,642
Well, maybe you should
try something new.

455
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:48,703
Like what? Brain surgeon?
Fighter pilot?

456
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:52,350
Heh. I was thinking of something
even more challenging, like...

457
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,580
why don't you come
and work with me?

458
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:59,620
- What?
- I need the help really bad,

459
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,403
and I can't pay
as much as one of your

460
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,172
sales commissions,
but it's a steady check

461
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:06,302
every week, and I think
you'd really like it.

462
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:09,141
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

463
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:15,492
- What?
- I just can't figure you out.

464
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,203
You're like
some kind of...

465
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,491
guardian angel
or something.

466
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:25,173
Promise me that you'll
at least think about it.

467
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:35,502
Bunny.

468
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:38,640
Tree.

469
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,333
Butterfly.

470
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,101
Cake.

471
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,771
House.

472
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:50,570
Bike.

473
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,613
Rocking chair.

474
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:59,190
What do these mean
to you, christine?

475
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,322
Bunny took me to school.

476
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:06,251
She wore a butterfly
around her neck.

477
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:09,632
She taught me
how to ride a bike.

478
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,860
We sat under the tree
in front of the house.

479
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,430
Who is bunny?

480
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,360
Who wore a butterfly necklace
and took you to school?

481
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:22,513
- She did.
- who is she?

482
00:35:23,397 --> 00:35:26,872
Mommy.
Mommy is she.

483
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:31,870
It's her mother.

484
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:35,080
These ornaments
symbolize mommy to christine.

485
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,472
Is that what you
wanted me to do...

486
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:40,302
find christine's mother?

487
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,993
F- find christine's mother.

488
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,562
I did.

489
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:03,221
Oh, no. No, no, no. They're faceup.
That's- that's the wrong way.

490
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:12,091
- This is a puzzle?
- This is a puzzle.

491
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,113
Bunny.

492
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:26,730
That's her mother?

493
00:36:30,828 --> 00:36:33,963
I believe these
were meant for you.

494
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,842
Why did you
give christine away?

495
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:50,552
You have to understand that
back when christine was born,

496
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:53,271
people didn't know
that much about autism.

497
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:59,423
Can you imagine having a child
that won't look at you or smile,

498
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:05,853
a child that starts to cry
every time you try to touch her?

499
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:11,351
I took christine to a doctor,
and he told me it was my fault.

500
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:17,212
He said the reason she was autistic
was because I was a bad mother.

501
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,090
That's terrible.

502
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:20,812
Well, I wasn't the only one.

503
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:25,011
Said we were refrigerator
mothers because we were

504
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:28,542
so cold and frigid
that our children had no one

505
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:32,662
to turn to for comfort,
so they turned inside themselves.

506
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,821
So you let them
take her.

507
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:40,771
I tried to see her,
to visit, but they said I couldn't,

508
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:46,343
said if she was ever gonna get
any better, I had to stay away.

509
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,030
Didn't you see her
when she was a grown-up?

510
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:54,120
Once.

511
00:37:57,547 --> 00:38:01,003
She was living
with a young man.

512
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,492
He was autistic, too.

513
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,303
But it ended up in a fight...

514
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:08,812
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

515
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,261
I saw that fight.

516
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,922
- Wh-what?
- It's not important.

517
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,601
What is important is that you
have to try again with christine.

518
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,980
She needs you.

519
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,700
It's my baby girl,
all grown up.

520
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:52,162
She's still in her
own little world.

521
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,702
Christine, your mother's
here to see you.

522
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,952
C- christine,
it's-it's mommy.

523
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:13,332
- I am so sorry.
- I am so sorry.

524
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:21,603
It's ok. She hears you.
Just tell her how you feel.

525
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:25,992
She's not holding a grudge,
and I promise that she

526
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,870
is not angry with you.

527
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:32,160
Doesn't make one bit of difference
to her whether I'm here or not.

528
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:36,431
That-
that is not true.

529
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,181
S- say, "love is patient. "
Say, "love is patient. "

530
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:43,301
You just have to
be patient.

531
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:56,911
Sweetheart...

532
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,583
liz, liz, wait.

533
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:28,350
- This was a mistake.
- She needs you now more than ever.

534
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:31,531
My child doesn't need me.
She never has.

535
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,463
Everyone
needs their mother.

536
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:37,151
But she will never
be able to love me, melinda.

537
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:39,560
She doesn't even know
what love is.

538
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:43,083
That's not true. Christine loves.
She just doesn't know how to show it.

539
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:45,013
Her boyfriend,
he was teaching her how.

540
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:48,801
You can't teach somebody how to love.
They either feel it, or they don'T.

541
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:52,231
- Ask her.
- Do you love christine?

542
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,771
I want to, but...

543
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,991
I don't know how
if she can't love me back.

544
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,252
Well, then you have to
show her love first,

545
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,813
even if it means
she doesn't know how to love you.

546
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:08,490
I think all dennis wants is just for
you to be in christine's life again.

547
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:18,413
That's what I want, too.

548
00:41:24,645 --> 00:41:26,550
Thank you.

549
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:33,041
I hope this is what you wanted.
This is what you wanted, right?

550
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:35,680
- Right.
- Are you ready to go?

551
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:39,162
- Where?
- Into the light. Can't you still see it?

552
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:45,450
- Mm-hmm. I see the sun.
- No, not the sun. The light.

553
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:47,350
The sun is the light.

554
00:41:47,478 --> 00:41:50,091
I thought you could
see the light.

555
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,263
Is there something else
than I can help you with?

556
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:59,080
You know what love is.
What is love?

557
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,411
What does it feel like?

558
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:11,352
Dennis, what you did to bring
liz and christine together,

559
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,910
that's what love is.

560
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:19,003
It's not about what we say.
It's about what we do.

561
