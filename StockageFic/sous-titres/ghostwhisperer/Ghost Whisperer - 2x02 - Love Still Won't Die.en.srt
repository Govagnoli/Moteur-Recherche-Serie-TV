00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:10,578
<i>My name
is Melinda Gordon.</i>

3
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:13,459
<i>I'm married,
I live in a small town,</i>

4
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:16,116
<i>and I own
an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,105
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:22,523
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,681
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

8
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,583
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

9
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,891
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

10
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:39,961
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

11
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,969
Are you serious?
Tonight?

12
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,653
Yes, I've been dying
to see it.

13
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,553
Are you kidding me,
I would love to.

14
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:54,323
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll call you if the chest comes in.

15
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,711
Yeah. We haven't
been to a movie in like 6 years.

16
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:59,062
Oh, all right, maybe it's been
more like a month.

17
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,343
No, it's a great idea.
It is.

18
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,190
I'll close up early.

19
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:07,430
You know, I'm sorry to cut you short,
but I have a little bit of a situation here.

20
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,631
Yeah, I'll see you
at the house. Bye.

21
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:11,331
Hey, do you really think
that I can't see what you're doing?

22
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,031
First, no skates
in the store.

23
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:17,251
They're heelys
not skates.

24
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,532
All right, no wheels on your
feet allowed and, no shoplifting.

25
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:22,671
I was gonna pay for it.

26
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,010
You just didn't give me
the chance.

27
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:26,040
They're $275 a piece.

28
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,681
And the register is that way,
not out on the street.

29
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:29,611
Whatever.

30
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,932
- What's your phone number?
- Why?

31
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,003
I'm calling your parents.

32
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:35,101
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

33
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:39,050
Look, my mother's sick.

34
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:42,613
Real sick. And this
would really upset her.

35
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,910
Do you really think
that I'm that out of it?

36
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:47,511
Do you think that i am so un
hip that i would fall for that?

37
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,412
Yeah.

38
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,251
- What's your name?
- Ned.

39
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:51,723
Ned, give me
your phone number,

40
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,460
or I will take you and your
heelys down to the police station.

41
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,303
I am so sorry.

42
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,273
He has never done
anything like this before.

43
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:01,042
No, it's fine.

44
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,541
I just thought that you
would want to know.

45
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,461
I was gonna
pay for them.

46
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,942
Ned. It's not like he doesn't have
a ton of this stuff anyway.

47
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,500
He's got
signed guitar picks,

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,082
keith moon's drumsticks,
old ticket stubs.

49
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,183
None of it stolen,
by the way.

50
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:19,521
He will never come back in here
again, I can promise you that.

51
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,272
I'm gonna go
wait outside.

52
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,151
You don't have to
do that. He's welcome.

53
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,731
Just with shoes
minus wheels.

54
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,912
- You have kids?
- No.

55
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:32,342
- No, not yet.
- Well, they're great.

56
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,862
Until they become
teenagers.

57
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,472
And then you realize
you're just being

58
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:39,202
paid back double for all the rotten
things you did as a teenager.

59
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:40,651
He seems like a good kid.

60
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,721
He is. He is.

61
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,340
It's just been a little
tough lately, you know?

62
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:49,630
He's been so moody. He doesn't talk,
he hardly sleeps.

63
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:53,050
'S just like his whole life
is this big secret all of a sudden.

64
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:56,981
Anyway, you have
to get back to work, so do I.

65
00:02:58,426 --> 00:02:59,762
I'm Delia Banks
by the way.

66
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,662
Oh, Melinda Gordon.
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,680
You look familiar.

68
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,103
I run the real estate office
on the other side of the square.

69
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,891
Oh, well, I'll see you
at village java.

70
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,480
Every chance I get.

71
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,150
Thank you.
And, uh...

72
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,392
I guess I'll see you
around campus.

73
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,580
you know, this was fun.
We should do this like once a week.

74
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:09,342
Yeah, just not
the same movie.

75
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:11,110
- I liked it.
- Hey, so did I.

76
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:12,363
I saw you sleeping.

77
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,670
I was burning
certain scenes into my memory.

78
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,790
Yeah, well, you're tired.

79
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,362
You worked your ass off
this weekend.

80
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,572
Hey, I had
a shoplifter today.

81
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,392
Shoplifting  is something I just don't
associate with antiques, you know?

82
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,620
I think I'm just
gonna take this

83
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,922
chippendale dresser
and stuff it into my jacket.

84
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,203
Yeah, right. It was grateful dead
backstage passes.

85
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,150
At least he had
good taste.

86
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:32,912
Yeah, he was a kid.
I called his mother.

87
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:35,090
Ooh, something no thief
worth his salt wants to have happen.

88
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,680
Delia Banks. She's great.

89
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:38,540
She sells real estate
in town.

90
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,601
Um... yes?

91
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,953
I just thought
maybe I...

92
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:49,441
hit something
on my way here.

93
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,812
- An animal?
- No. More like someone

94
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,141
who used to be alive
and now isn'T.

95
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,750
Is that what we're
calling ghosts now?

96
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:57,042
Yeah, I got bored
of calling them ghosts.

97
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,291
Wait a minute,
you tell me about the shoplifter,

98
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,513
but you don't tell me
about the ex living person?

99
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,183
Well, there won't be
a lawsuit.

100
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:08,053
Sometimes I think a lawsuit would
be easier. What happened?

101
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,922
Do you really want me to tell you
about every single ghost I run across?

102
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:13,761
Or run over.
Absolutely not.

103
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:15,543
I prefer to be on
a need to know basis.

104
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:16,972
Good. Then you drive.

105
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:42,142
- Hey.
- I'm not a thief.

106
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,000
Glad to hear it.

107
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,472
Shouldn't you be in school?

108
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:48,290
What, are you gonna
call my mom again?

109
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,181
Can I ask you a question?

110
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,790
If you're not a thief,
then why did you steal

111
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:55,233
- ... those backstage passes?
- I don't know.

112
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,470
I just felt like
I should have them.

113
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:58,520
Not you.

114
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:01,650
Your mom says you have
a lot of that stuff. You collect it?

115
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:06,511
- What about your dad?
- What about him?

116
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:09,561
- Where is he?
- In the ground.

117
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,823
Oh, well, that,
that must be hard for you.

118
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:16,612
For your mom.

119
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,172
He liked old things.

120
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:23,041
- Look, if you want-
- I gotta go.

121
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,292
Want to check
my pockets?

122
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:25,991
Jim?

123
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,462
Jim?

124
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,452
What is it? What?
Come on.

125
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:14,072
Ok. It's need to know time.

126
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:18,172
29th doesn't mean anything?

127
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,213
No.  Other than the fact
that it's next friday.

128
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,753
A birthday.
A day somebody died.

129
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,140
Well,  it could be
any of those things.

130
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:25,403
But until this guy
talks to me, we can only guess.

131
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,173
What?

132
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,073
I don't know, it's just...
another...

133
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,483
another formally
alive person. In our house.

134
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:38,511
Why can't our home
be off limits?

135
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,270
I don't like it any more
than you do, trust me,

136
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,990
but maybe this guy
doesn't know where he is.

137
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,051
Or what's going on.

138
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,303
It's like he doesn't
actually want me to see him.

139
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:47,513
Like some kind of
hide and seek game he's playing.

140
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,803
Sometimes spirits
have a kind of amnesia,

141
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,023
and they need time
to figure things out.

142
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,202
Maybe he's hoping that this date
will spark something.

143
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,043
Well, it certainly
sparked something.

144
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,859
Is this because
I was in the shower?

145
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:03,033
- You're afraid that-
- No. It's just about boundaries.

146
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,553
They don't belong
in our home.

147
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,202
I'm sorry that I have to
burden you with this.

148
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,092
Hey, it's no burden.

149
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,993
I'm just used to
having andrea

150
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,872
to puzzle these things
out with.

151
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,641
Oh, babe...
I know. I know.

152
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:35,492
- Who are you?
- I'm not sure.

153
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,881
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

154
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,090
Do you know why
you came to me?

155
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:45,502
- You can help me.
- How?

156
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:53,163
How did you die?
Were you hit by a car?

157
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,621
I think so.

158
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:59,631
I don't remember
everything exactly.

159
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,700
What does
september 29th mean?

160
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,293
- Don't you know?
- No.

161
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,243
Then I don't either.

162
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:11,102
Do you have a family?

163
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,662
Does someone know
what happened to you?

164
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,970
I had a wife.
In eastwick.

165
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:20,323
- Maine?
- She may not know. Will you tell her?

166
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,691
Well, I'm sure you had
I.D. On you.

167
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,380
The police have probably
called her by now.

168
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:28,052
I was no good to her. I hurt her.
I have to say I'm sorry.

169
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,211
- Do you remember her name?
- Donna. Donna ellis.

170
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,702
And what's your name?

171
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,203
I think people
callede mac.

172
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,971
Well, mac, eastwick is not
exactly around the corner,

173
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:40,703
- so I don't know that I-
- You have to find her.

174
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,140
- See her.
- Why?

175
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,542
It's important.

176
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,053
- Are you open?
- I'll be right with you.

177
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,591
I took a guess.
Mocha latte.

178
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:04,603
Oh, works for me.
That's so nice.

179
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,572
Consider it
a peace offering.

180
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:10,570
I think my son paid you
another visit the other day.

181
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,550
Oh... man, he's good.

182
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,351
We were talking
the whole time.

183
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,131
Yes. It makes a mother proud.

184
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,462
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of it.

185
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:23,752
No, no. I am so grateful
that you're not upset.

186
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,731
Honestly, I don't know
what his problem is.

187
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,812
He mentioned that his father
had passed away.

188
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:36,581
3 years ago. It has been really
hard on him.

189
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,360
For you, too.

190
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,391
The shoplifting
helps a lot.

191
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:47,090
- Good to know.
- I don't mean to pry but...

192
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:52,193
you lost your partner
recently, didn't you?

193
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah. She was like
a sister to me.

194
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:02,890
Well, I am right
across the square,

195
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:04,773
so if you ever need anything...

196
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:08,423
or you just want to grab
a cup of coffee.

197
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,622
Thanks for
bringing this back.

198
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,563
I tried to make ned do it,
but, you know.

199
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,012
I know.

200
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:21,831
Does he ever say that he can feel
his father's presence?

201
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,433
Presence?

202
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:27,190
Like he's around,
you know.

203
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:31,301
- Watching over him.
- He doesn't say it, but

204
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:34,672
I think he does.
Sometimes I do, too.

205
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:39,062
Or at least I wish for it so badly,
that I think I do.

206
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,593
I just wanted to thank you.

207
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,770
I know it sounds crazy,
but he asked me to go to maine.

208
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,933
Maine? As in new england?

209
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,553
Yeah, and you know
what's crazier?

210
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,782
I think I should do it.

211
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,520
You know, this is
one of the reasons why

212
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,230
mr. Alexander graham bell
was so excited

213
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,871
about his new invention
because you can just

214
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,070
pick one of these things up
and call people instead of-

215
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,251
you know what, it is hard enough
to do this in person.

216
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:08,690
Never mind on the phone.

217
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,063
How are you gonna find her?

218
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,780
Well, he gave me a name,
the town,

219
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,730
and there's that other
little invention, the internet.

220
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,810
I just think it's a long
way to go for a ghost,

221
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,771
a being who no longer
occupies the visual world.

222
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,513
Well, that's true,
but to be honest with you,

223
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,213
I kind of want to get
this guy crossed over.

224
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,593
There's something
off about him.

225
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,383
- Besides being dead?
- You are hilarious.

226
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,861
It's like he's holding
something back,

227
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,263
and you know what,
either I do this thing,

228
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:31,360
or I don't do this thing,
but I can't just say local calls only.

229
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,483
Well, I think there should be some
metaphysical frequent flyer miles involved.

230
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,440
****
It's pretty nice there this time of year.

231
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:41,053
Maybe yoshould
come with me. Change of scenery.

232
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:44,293
I'm back on sundays
starting tomorrow.

233
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:49,362
You should go.
You're right.

234
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,123
It'll do you good.

235
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,031
I'll call you
a million times.

236
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:08,823
Yes?

237
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:11,682
Oh,  um, sorry.

238
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,222
- Are you donna ellis?
- Yes.

239
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:17,431
I was hoping I could
talk to you for a minute.

240
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,653
Uh, sure. About what?

241
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:24,573
About your husband,
and please, accept my condolences.

242
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,000
Condolences?

243
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,460
I- I'm sorry.
What is this about?

244
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:32,050
Well, I assumed you knew.

245
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:35,471
- Knew what?
- Your husband.

246
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,220
That your husband
passed away.

247
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,321
What? What are
you talking about?

248
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:47,770
- You didn't know?
- How? When?

249
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:50,382
Um, he was hit by a car.

250
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,530
I'm so sorry.
I thought that-

251
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,671
where is he?
Where is he!?

252
00:17:56,638 --> 00:18:01,183
Michael? Michael.
You're ok.

253
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:02,711
I'm fine.

254
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:04,621
Wait. That's your husband?

255
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:07,623
Yes. This woman came here
and just said that you,

256
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,690
she said that you
were dead.

257
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,792
That you had been hit
by a car.

258
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,952
No, I'm sorry.

259
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,143
Why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

260
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,740
It was a mistake.

261
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:21,741
I guess. I...
I don't know what to say.

262
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,860
I Just don't get it, I had the right name,
and I had the right address.

263
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:31,582
<i>Well, maybe he's confused.</i>

264
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,840
You said sometimes they don't know
what's happened.

265
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,843
No, I think this guy
knows exactly what's happening.

266
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,130
I think I'm just
being played.

267
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,612
Oh, conned by a ghost, huh?

268
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,470
That's not gonna look
very good on a resume.

269
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,713
Sure. Laugh at my misery,
but you should've been here.

270
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,860
It was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.

271
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,441
Why is this guy
manipulating me like this?

272
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,842
Look, just come home.

273
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,313
Come  home. I'll be off
by breakfast time.

274
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,883
No. It's getting late.

275
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,612
I'm too stressed
to drive.

276
00:18:57,816 --> 00:19:02,190
I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to get
a room and start fresh in the morning.

277
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:06,660
Ok. Just call me before
you go to sleep.

278
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,061
Ok.

279
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,491
Excuse me.

280
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,010
Please leave me alone.

281
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,941
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about that.

282
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,440
It was
an honest mistake.

283
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,970
Ok, look, I don't know
who you are,

284
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:51,033
or what your problem is, but if you don't
leave me alone, I'm calling the police.

285
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:51,651
Understood?

286
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,532
Do you know a man
named mac?

287
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,201
- Do you mean my ex husband?
- Ex?

288
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,862
I thought
it was your husband.

289
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,610
Has something
happened to him?

290
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,291
Yes, I'm sorry.
He died.

291
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,031
He was hit by a car.
I came a long way to tell you that.

292
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,262
Why?

293
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,342
Because he wants you
to know.

294
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:19,331
He feels really bad about the way that
he treated you, and he wants to apologize.

295
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,871
You're speaking
in the present tense.

296
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,251
- Yes.
- But he's dead.

297
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:26,671
- Yes.
- Who the hell are you?

298
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,652
He wants to say
he's sorry.

299
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:31,921
It's what he needs to have closure
so that he can move on.

300
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:34,232
I can help you
talk to him if you'll just let me.

301
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,023
I need you
to stay away from me.

302
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:41,112
Even if I believed
any of this,

303
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,973
mac put me through hell
in our marriage,

304
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,671
and I have nothing
to say to him.

305
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,871
And I don't care what he
has to say to me.

306
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:06,221
Nobody's seen her
for 3 or 4 days.

307
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:08,881
She don't answer door,
she don't answer phone.

308
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:11,713
Nobody else is asking
around for her,

309
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:14,733
so I use key
just to check up.

310
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,720
She's gone.
1, 2 days probably.

311
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,002
Heart attack?

312
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,230
I think so.

313
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:40,121
You want to go downstairs and call this
in. I'll get going on the paperwork.

314
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,771
Yeah, ok.

315
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:48,813
Ve a nice trip.

316
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,410
She's mine.

317
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,011
Leave her.

318
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:24,490
Oh, come on.
Talk to me.

319
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,221
You think this is funny?

320
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,102
Making me tell that poor woman
that her husband is dead?

321
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:30,893
Let me in on the joke, pal.

322
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,243
This doesn't mean that i
believe any of this.

323
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:41,713
But just, by chance, if it's true, I
thought I should hear what you had to say.

324
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,563
I'm glad you came.
Come in.

325
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,152
Where the hell
have you been?

326
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:51,662
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

327
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,370
So how does this work?

328
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,120
Tell her
she looks good.

329
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,160
He says
you look good.

330
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,891
So he's here, like now?

331
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,760
All right, if he's here,
then...

332
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:10,132
why don't you ask him to tell you
what happened to our marriage.

333
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:16,752
Um, he said that you
were married 3 years ago.

334
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:18,202
That you moved
to this town together,

335
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,680
in the same house
that you live in now,

336
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,251
and then you
divorced him a year later.

337
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:22,560
Ask him why.

338
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,632
I don't remember.

339
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,042
He says he doesn't
remember.

340
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,922
Well, I remember. He was obsessed
with another woman.

341
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:31,541
- He cheated on you?
- No, not like that.

342
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,882
That would've almost
been easier.

343
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:37,652
Instead I had to compete
with the memory of his ex girlfriend.

344
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:40,240
He didn't realize
how hung up on her he was.

345
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,722
It was like he just
couldn't get her out of his mind.

346
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:46,571
He was constantly comparing me to her
and talking about her.

347
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,860
I tried to
make it work.

348
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,882
He said that he tried
to make it work.

349
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:51,640
Oh, bull, you just went
through the motions, mac.

350
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,642
And sometimes not even that.

351
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:56,330
I don't even understand why
you wasted your time with me.

352
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:59,041
Do you know how he ended it?

353
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,473
I told him that, you know, maybe we
should take some time apart,

354
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:06,083
so that he could figure out
what, or who he really wanted.

355
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:11,381
And he just said, ok.
Let's get a divorce.

356
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,921
Just like that,
like it was nothing.

357
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,512
He should've just gone out
and found that girl

358
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,883
and just figured it out,
but instead, you used me,

359
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:23,131
and you made me feel like
I didn't count for anything.

360
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,052
I did find the girl.

361
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:26,411
What?

362
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:28,652
I did find the girl
I was in love with.

363
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,611
Who  I'm still in love with.

364
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:40,762
I should've never
let you go.

365
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:47,312
Kyle?
Kyle mccall?

366
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:55,813
Just call him kyle?
No one's called him that since college.

367
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,153
We all called him mac.

368
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:02,752
Tell her you know me. Tell her you're
the one I never got over after we broke up.

369
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,782
Why? What's he saying?

370
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,480
that he's sorry
for the way that he treated you,

371
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:12,972
and he hopes
that you can forgive him.

372
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,371
Right?
You can do that?

373
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,920
She's not really
the forgiving type.

374
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:18,150
I can't believe you.

375
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,613
Ok, this is just
too weird.

376
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,492
I gotta get out of here.

377
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:24,153
And if this is real,
which I highly doubt,

378
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:26,382
tell him that
I don't forgive him.

379
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:29,392
He was an idiot then,
and he's probably still an idiot now.

380
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:34,492
- You played me.
- You're mad.

381
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:36,161
I could never stand
to make you mad.

382
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,603
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

383
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:39,692
Why did you send me
to your ex wife?

384
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,481
Don't you know?
Can't you see it?

385
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:46,343
- See what?
- You just don't understand.

386
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:51,420
No...
damn it.

387
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:53,040
Kyle mccall.

388
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:55,023
You told me about this guy.

389
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:56,743
You went out with him
in college.

390
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:00,630
- You said he hurt you.
- Yeah. That was an understatement.

391
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,952
Kyle was the first guy that I
thought I was really in love with.

392
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:06,913
Believe me, I did not
trust easily.

393
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,370
We were together
for a whole year in college.

394
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:11,990
He was complicated.

395
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:14,972
One of those tortured souls
you think you can save.

396
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:18,873
I thought if I opened myself up to him,
that if I took a risk and told him my secret,

397
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,512
it would show him how much
I believed in him.

398
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:22,871
In us.

399
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:26,412
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,703
You really believe
you can do this?

401
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:29,020
Kyle, I do it
all the time.

402
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:30,550
- See dead people.
- Yes.

403
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:34,131
- Talk to dead people.
- Don't say it like I'm crazy.

404
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:35,742
You're thinking it,
aren't you?

405
00:26:35,746 --> 00:26:37,373
- What?
- That I'm crazy.

406
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,232
I didn't say that.

407
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,771
Well, I can see that
you're thinking it.

408
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,001
Well, what am I
supposed to think?

409
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,310
That I wouldn't
lie to you.

410
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:44,243
And that I'm not crazy.
Stuff like that.

411
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:47,012
Do you...
talk to ghosts a lot?

412
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,231
- More than I want to.
- Like every day, once a week?

413
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:51,593
Third tuesday of the month?

414
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:54,220
I try not to speak to them
unless they speak to me.

415
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:57,110
- And what do they talk about?
- All kinds of things.

416
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,843
Mostly they need help.

417
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,702
I have to help them
cross over into the light.

418
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,262
Yeah.

419
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,452
I knew it was too good
to be true.

420
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,652
- What?
- You.

421
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:12,922
Us... I thought I
met the perfect girl.

422
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:14,392
Kyle, wait, I know that you
don't believe me,

423
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:17,271
but please don't walk away.
Just talk to me.

424
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,451
Yeah. Maybe when I'm dead.

425
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:26,712
That was it.

426
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:31,572
Never called me, never came to
see me again after a year.

427
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,901
- Still hurts?
- I guess.

428
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:36,652
A little.
First cut and all that.

429
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:38,800
And now he wants
a second chance.

430
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:43,103
I guess that explains the talking corpse
I had to deal with last night.

431
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:46,801
I'm sorry, jim. I wish that you never
had to deal with any of this.

432
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:48,673
Keeps things fresh.

433
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,573
You were my second chance.

434
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,391
I mean, you know that,
right?

435
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:55,611
I never thought that i was going to be
able to trust anyone again after kyle.

436
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,323
And then there was jim.

437
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:00,470
You're not gonna break into
song right now, are you?

438
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:01,432
I might.

439
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,792
Now what are we gonna do
about this guy though?

440
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,290
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my sense of humor.

441
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,781
I'll get him to cross over
and out of our lives, I promise.

442
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,841
All right, can you tell me
what the hell it is with these passes?

443
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:31,113
Dude, these are mine
from my collection.

444
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,870
Dude, I bought those
at a trade show in philadelphia.

445
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,843
I know. My mom,

446
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,981
she sold my whole collection
after I died,

447
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:43,090
and it got spread out all over the
place and this is the last of it.

448
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:45,452
You've been tracking
the whole collection?

449
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:48,300
Each and every single
piece meant so much to me.

450
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,870
My mother,
she never got that.

451
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,373
So she sold them
to some guy,

452
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:54,933
and he sold it to another guy,
and... my collection.

453
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,993
- What's your name?
- Jamey barton.

454
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,343
- You heard of me?
- No.

455
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,212
why are you still here?

456
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,672
I gotta make sure this stuff gets
to the right people.

457
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:05,021
People who care,
people who know

458
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,261
what it means, you know?

459
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:08,581
Hmm. So that's why you
attached yourself to ned.

460
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,180
And here I thought the whole time that
it was his father who was haunting him.

461
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,532
Maybe I'm losing
my touch lately.

462
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:15,473
You see, I hang out
at concerts,

463
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:18,463
and I try to get, you know,
a feel for the kids.

464
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,280
And then I try to get
the right kid a piece of the collection.

465
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:25,033
Well, you'll be happy to know ned has been
a real trouper about getting these passes.

466
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,623
That's my boy.

467
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:28,542
You're making him
a thief.

468
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:31,050
It's not like I can just
slip him the cash, can I?

469
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:32,723
How did you get him
to do it?

470
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:37,570
Well, I wait till he falls asleep, and then I
whisper in his ear all freaking night long.

471
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:38,972
"Steal the passes,
dude.

472
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:42,143
Steal the passes, dude. "
It's how I used to rember lyrics.

473
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,952
Well, he's not gonna
steal the passes from me,

474
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:45,383
and you have to
leave him alone.

475
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:47,802
You're messing with his energy.
He doesn't even know why.

476
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:50,562
It's time for you to go
to the big arena in the sky.

477
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:52,210
No can do.

478
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,141
I mean, he's the one
for these passes.

479
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,563
He understands.

480
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:59,163
I can't go anywhere until the last
of my collection is in the right hands,

481
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:02,273
so whoa, 3 o'clock already.

482
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,090
Note to self.

483
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:06,121
I gotta keep better
track of time.

484
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:10,011
He's getting out of school
right now, and so, I gotta skate.

485
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:01,071
Come on, kyle.

486
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:05,111
We have to talk about this. I can't help
you if I don't know what you want.

487
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:08,223
You could've told me
how great it is to be dead.

488
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,460
Go anywhere I want.
No travel time.

489
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:13,880
No one can see me.
Well, almost no one.

490
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,471
I've had more fun being dead so far
than the entire time I was alive.

491
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:19,752
What do you want?

492
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:21,742
I was on my way
to see you, you know.

493
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:25,131
- The day I died.
- Why?

494
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,001
I saw you on the news.

495
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:33,390
<i>All I can say is that
people in this town are strong.</i>

496
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:36,401
<i>They're survivors,
and we'll be ok.</i>

497
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,910
What's with you
and this chick?

498
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:42,582
Melinda? It's like
you're obsessed with her.

499
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:46,100
I wanted to see how
things turned out for you.

500
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:48,761
Things turned out
pretty good for me.

501
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:50,611
I see that.

502
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,403
Not so much
for me though.

503
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,690
And how is that
my problem, kyle?

504
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:01,403
Look, I made a big mistake
the day I let you go.

505
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:03,333
I didn't realize that
right away.

506
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,183
- Yeah, you moved on.
- But I didn'T.

507
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,711
- You married donna.
- Yeah, another mistake.

508
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,902
Donna looked like you,
I thought maybe somehow

509
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:11,281
I could turn her
into you.

510
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:12,792
It was a disaster.

511
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,782
That's why I wanted you
to meet her.

512
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:18,712
So you could see that I was
just trying to recreate you.

513
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:23,981
You affected
every part of my life.

514
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:27,310
You made me feel like a freak,
and that I didn't deserve to be loved.

515
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:28,832
I gave you everything.

516
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,380
Even the one secret
that I never wanted

517
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,523
anyone to know,
and you threw me away.

518
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:35,492
It was so easy for you.

519
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:38,212
You want to talk about
a ripple effect?

520
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:39,971
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:42,072
I really am. I was stupid.

522
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:44,430
I had no idea
what I was throwing away.

523
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:52,991
But don't tell me you didn't
think about me once in awhile.

524
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,810
Remember how we used to
make fun of the space needle?

525
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:00,623
Remember that movie theatre
in queen anne?

526
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,480
- The uptown.
- The uptown, right.

527
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:06,422
How many rainy afternoons
did we spend there?

528
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:10,070
Watching the worst
movies ever.

529
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:13,980
You used to hate that.
*****

530
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,321
You convinced me to stop
wearing socks.

531
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:21,711
You though my feet looked
sexy in sneakers without socks.

532
00:33:28,147 --> 00:33:30,222
You remember
that book store?

533
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,532
In pioneer square.

534
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:39,451
None of that matters now.

535
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,901
But it does.
It should.

536
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,782
I remember the first day
I talked to you in class.

537
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:50,573
The way you looked at me.
Those eyes.

538
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,580
I remember thinking
to myself,

539
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:57,030
now I know what it's like
to really be looked at.

540
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:01,912
No one's ever looked at me
like that since.

541
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:04,223
It's over.
You made your choice.

542
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:06,392
There's no going back,
and I'm happy now.

543
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:10,112
I found a man that I love
more than I ever thought was possible.

544
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,440
But it's not over.

545
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,543
We can be together now.

546
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,531
Like it was
supposed to be.

547
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,450
Are you listening
to me, kyle?

548
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:21,540
I'm happily married.
And you're dead.

549
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:25,413
September 29th is the day
we broke up.

550
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,801
And september 29th is gonna be
the day we get back together.

551
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:41,673
Are you gonna belate tonight?

552
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,183
Uh, I don't know. Friday nights
can be a little heavy.

553
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:46,092
Well, tonight would be
a good night to be late.

554
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,951
Why?

555
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:48,553
Because it's september 29th,

556
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,821
and he's got something planned,
I just don't know what.

557
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,801
Well...
I should be here.

558
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:57,473
- This guy feels like trouble.
- It's my deal, ok?

559
00:34:57,507 --> 00:35:00,141
I have to solve it, and besides,
he's really not that bad of a guy.

560
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:01,302
He would never hurt me.

561
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:03,352
Mel, you and this guy,
is there...

562
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,713
I can't believe
I'm asking this about a ghost.

563
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,272
Is there still
something between you?

564
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,572
- What?
- I heard you last night.

565
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:12,693
Jim, he's dead.

566
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:14,242
There was a time
in my life when that

567
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,790
meant case closed,
but then I met you.

568
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:17,261
One or two laughs
with kyle mccall

569
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:20,053
dead or alive will never compare
to what we have.

570
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,562
There was more depth
on our first date

571
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:24,923
than I ever had with kyle,
the problem is he doesn't get that.

572
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,540
All right. Be careful.

573
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,842
- Call me if you need me.
- Yeah.

574
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:59,102
Ned, it's no big deal.

575
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:01,203
You've just got to go in there
and take those passes.

576
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,333
Technically, it's not
even really stealing

577
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,521
because those passes
are mine,

578
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:06,522
in the big picture,
we're like one, you know, so...

579
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:13,543
- that was harsh.
- They're yours.

580
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,350
- Righteous.
- Why?

581
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:19,460
Sometimes my job
is about making sure

582
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:22,082
that the right people
end up with the right things.

583
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:24,181
Something tells me
that whoever owned them

584
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,563
would want you
to have them.

585
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,311
Seriously?

586
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:28,641
They're not for free.

587
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:32,422
I need some help
at the store on saturdays,

588
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:36,172
- For let's say, a month.
- I don't know.

589
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:38,722
Is that like
minimum wage, or...

590
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:45,282
- all right. Don't push it.
- Ok. So... thanks.

591
00:36:49,466 --> 00:36:52,422
Slickly done, I must say.
Slickly done.

592
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:55,900
Oh, thank you.
Whoa.

593
00:36:57,575 --> 00:37:00,392
That is one bright light.

594
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:05,133
Yeah. The ultimate,
all access pass.

595
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,893
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

596
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:18,110
<i>Check, check,
check one, check two.</i>

597
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:18,530
Stop it!

598
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,510
Leave my husband's
stuff alone!

599
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:47,921
******

600
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:53,550
Kyle, you have to stop
doing this.

601
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:56,833
You cannot just erase jim by getting
rid of everything that he owns.

602
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,200
Obviously, one of us
has to go,

603
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:01,010
and it's not gonna be me.
Not this time.

604
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:04,540
- Jim is not going anywhere.
- I love you, Melinda.

605
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:06,420
You have no idea
what love is.

606
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:09,443
I'm here, and he isn't,
so that's a good start.

607
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,923
He's not here
because he loves me.

608
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,960
I asked him to give me some space,
and he gave it to me.

609
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,563
- How is that love?
- That's just part of it.

610
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:21,081
And it's not the greeting cards
and sunset and flowers part.

611
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:22,683
That's easy.
That's not real.

612
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,991
It's about doing the things that you
don't want to do.

613
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,823
The stuff that
makes you mad.

614
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,131
The stuff that you do
without even being asked.

615
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:30,992
It's about having a friend
and knowing when to shut up.

616
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,360
You know, I can't tell you
what love is.

617
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:36,030
I can only tell you
what it isn't, and this is not it.

618
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:37,580
No, but you're wrong, Melinda.

619
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,733
I will never forget
the look in your eyes

620
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,572
when you walked away
from me.

621
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,611
- What look?
- Relief.

622
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:45,160
You were relieved.

623
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,470
To not have to risk
being in an honest relationship.

624
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:48,890
To not have to give
anything up.

625
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:50,801
To be able to blame
somebody else so you could be safe.

626
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:51,950
That's a lie.

627
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:54,601
Your ex wife told me that you did
exactly the same thing to her.

628
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:57,423
The first time that she called you on
the way you treated her, you left.

629
00:39:57,905 --> 00:39:59,791
Just like me.
You call that love?

630
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,673
Yeah, but I missed you
every day.

631
00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:03,572
I knew I had made a mistake.

632
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,183
That's because you had
already thrown me away.

633
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:07,960
I could be imaginary.

634
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:12,501
Was I that forgettable?

635
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,812
I hated myself for it.

636
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:22,723
I wanted to call you
a hundred times.

637
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,471
It would've been too late.

638
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,421
You did what you did, I saw what I saw.
There was never any going back.

639
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,300
Now I'm starting to hate
being dead.

640
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:36,721
Why?

641
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:40,941
Because the answer
to everything is too late.

642
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,493
Too late to fix
the mistakes.

643
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:46,673
Too late to catch up
with the things you missed.

644
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,902
Too late to make things
right with the people you hurt.

645
00:40:54,837 --> 00:40:56,801
Too late...

646
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,850
to love you the way
he does.

647
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:06,763
The beauty part
of my job is, kyle, it's never too late.

648
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,152
You wasted a trip.

649
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,390
I have nothing to gain
by talking to him.

650
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,413
Look, maybe you don't
have anything to gain.

651
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,253
Maybe you just have
something to lose.

652
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:22,502
A little piece of anger
or bitterness, or disappointment.

653
00:41:22,928 --> 00:41:25,272
He hurt me so much.

654
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:27,833
You know what,
he hurt me, too.

655
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,822
But you know
what happened, I got stronger.

656
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:34,182
I met the perfect
man for me.

657
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:37,101
Found a beautiful place to live,
and you, you're married again.

658
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:39,111
I saw how much
you loved your husband

659
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:41,070
when you thought
that he was dead,

660
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,993
and would you really
be this happy

661
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,980
if you were still
with kyle?

662
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:50,410
Would I?
Transformation.

663
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:55,051
Sometimes turns out to be
better than you could've imagined.

664
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:59,102
He just wants the chance
to say that he's sorry.

665
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:02,791
He's right behind you,
and he's ready to do that.

666
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,741
I screwed up, donna.

667
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,471
I was scared. I took
the easy way out.

668
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:10,671
I'm so sorry.

669
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,672
He knows
that he screwed up.

670
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,381
You son of a bitch, kyle.

671
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,271
Didn't you know...
how much I loved you?

672
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:23,482
What I would've
done for you?

673
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:30,713
How could you...
how could you just throw that away?

674
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,801
I'm glad you're happy now.

675
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,421
You're better off
without me.

676
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,432
He's glad that
you're happy now.

677
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,032
You're better off.

678
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,451
Yeah, well...

679
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:46,401
I guess I'll never
really know.

680
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:52,753
- I know.
- He knows.

681
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:55,861
Can I go now?

682
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:07,242
Time to cross over.

683
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:10,733
You ever think I'll get
a second chance?

684
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:14,321
Come back here again
and do this right?

685
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,832
It's really nice
to think so.

686
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:41,202
You were never forgettable.
