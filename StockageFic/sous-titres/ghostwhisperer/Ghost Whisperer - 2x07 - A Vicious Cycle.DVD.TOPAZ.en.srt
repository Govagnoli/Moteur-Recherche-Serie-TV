00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,902
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

3
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,122
<i>I'm married,</i>

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,417
<i>I live in a small town,</i>

5
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,499
<i>and I own an antique shop.</i>

6
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:19,511
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,260
<i>Except that from
the time I was a little girl,</i>

8
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:23,724
<i>I knew that I could
talk to the dead.</i>

9
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:24,902
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,234
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

11
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:30,704
<i>They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living</i>

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,459
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

13
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:38,312
<i>In order to tell you my story,</i>

14
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:40,518
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

15
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:47,792
So...

16
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,045
this is really,really great.

17
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:54,587
Out in nature,
no one but us for miles.

18
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:57,175
Who knew that camping
could be so much fun.

19
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:59,750
What'd I tell you?
The clean air. The smell.

20
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,324
- There's nothing like it.
- Yeah. I'm getting that feeling.

21
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:07,554
I'm just glad you
came this time, ok?

22
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:11,088
Besides, I thought when you said we were
going to the woods,you meant the woods.

23
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,355
That place where Delia
always wants to take you to?

24
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:17,609
Yeah. Salt scrubs,
seaweed wraps, massages.

25
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,706
That would be the one.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,338
Pushaw! Uhh!

27
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,418
Besides, we got all
the luxury right here.

28
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:27,187
Ahh. And these hands,

29
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:30,559
they got more magic in them
than any seafood wrap.

30
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:31,737
Seaweed.

31
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:33,487
Oh, right. That's it.

32
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,703
Ahh. Yep.

33
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:40,800
Ahh. This place hasn'
changed a bit.

34
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:43,766
You used to come out
here with your father?

35
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,071
Yeah.

36
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,292
Me, my brother...

37
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,484
and my old man.

38
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:50,328
No mom?

39
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,869
No. She loved camping
about as much as you do.

40
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,253
Hey! Ha ha.

41
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:56,128
Oh, no.

42
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,933
Sorry. The wood
probably was just green.

43
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:07,829
All right.

44
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,961
Oh!

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,083
Why don't you-

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,257
I'll go-

47
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,971
This the crisp air you
were talking about?

48
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,101
Did I forget to mention-ahh-

49
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,315
we might get a little weather.

50
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,991
Zip it.

51
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,119
Hey, do you hear that?

52
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,744
Hmm? Crickets.

53
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,834
Not that.

54
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,878
- Lanie.
- That.

55
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:05,263
Lanie.

56
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,359
Hello?

57
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,613
Somebody out there?

58
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,167
Lanie.

59
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:07,636
Come out,come out,
wherever you are. Come out,

60
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,111
come out

61
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,538
Hello?

62
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,436
Crap.

63
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,400
Oh, where is it?

64
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:02,661
Where is it?

65
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,589
Hey. No, no, no. It's ok.

66
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,713
It's ok, it's ok.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,768
You all right?

68
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,479
Oh, I'm so glad it's you.

69
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,249
I'm glad I saw your light because when
I woke up and you weren't in bed,

70
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,016
- ... I almost freaked out.
- Sorry. I heard something.

71
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,782
A woman's voice.

72
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:21,622
I found this.

73
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,839
That's been there for a while.

74
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:27,382
Yeah. Look at this.

75
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:29,488
The, uh...

76
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,020
the  moldy sippy cup?

77
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:32,525
No. No, there was a-

78
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,158
there was a creepy baby doll.

79
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,840
A baby doll.

80
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,714
The woman's voice,
it sounded desperate, and...

81
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,801
I don't know. I just feel like maybe
I should stay in case she comes back.

82
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,313
No.

83
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:48,488
I think she knows where you're staying.
We're the only ones up here for miles.

84
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,702
Ok. You're right. If she
needs me, she'll find me.

85
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:53,248
Yeah. Come on. Let's
go and get some sleep.

86
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,670
I got some plans for tomorrow.

87
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,451
Lanie.

88
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,419
Come out,come out, wherever you are.

89
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:17,059
Hello?

90
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,372
Don't be afraid.

91
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,334
I wanna help you.

92
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,444
Lanie!

93
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:51,898
Morning, sunshine.

94
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,203
It's disgusting how cheerfu
you are in the morning.

95
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,459
Well, you sleep much
deeper out here in the...

96
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,760
fine air.

97
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,764
Speak for yourself.

98
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,191
Ah. Breakfast smells
so good. I'm starving.

99
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,852
Yeah. Breakfast was about 4 hours ago.

100
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:08,826
This would be lunch.

101
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:10,199
Just tell me there's coffee.

102
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:11,240
All right.

103
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,623
Do I sense a less than
perfect night's sleep?

104
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,798
Well, between the ghosts,

105
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,900
stinking air-

106
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,933
Air mattress,

107
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,320
I didn't sleep all night.

108
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:22,811
She came back? Why didn't you wake me up?

109
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,233
'Cause I didn't have any dynamite?

110
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,667
You know, it's weird.

111
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,582
She made the doll appear in the fire.

112
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:31,133
That's creepy.

113
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,907
What's the message?

114
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,600
I don't know. Stay away?

115
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,775
She's done everything she can to get
rid of us,even that weird windstorm.

116
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,080
You know, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,111
I hope I haven't tainted
this place for you.

118
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,217
No. I feel sorry for your ghost.

119
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,510
Yeah. That hide and seek
song she keeps singing

120
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,513
makes me think
she's looking for a child.

121
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:51,648
Well, that would explain
why she's so territorial.

122
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,350
She's trying to say something else.
I just don't know what.

123
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,030
Yummy. I'm starving.

124
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,503
You're going to need it.

125
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,455
- Oh? - I was thinking that
we'd go on a little hike.

126
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:03,970
A hike sounds nice.

127
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,131
Might have to make a small detour.

128
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,519
Oh, come on. You got to admit,
this is kind of exciting.

129
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,504
Ah, I don't know. To me,

130
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,417
a swimming hole's exciting.

131
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:17,711
Haunted, rusty cars,not so exciting.

132
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,723
It doesn't look like
there was an accident.

133
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,858
Maybe they just ran off the road.

134
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:28,192
but  there is no road here.

135
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,493
Aha. There used to be.

136
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,587
The main road used to
run through the pass

137
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,880
till the forest service took over
and made this all a reserve.

138
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,463
Look at you with that thing.

139
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,599
Maybe this was a side road.

140
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,149
Well, how long ago was that?

141
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:43,483
I don't know. My dad and I first started
coming out here about 20 years ago.

142
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:48,243
car's been here at least that long.

143
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,083
I think I found a registration.

144
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:04,580
- Only thing I can make out is Anna.
- Well, it's a first name anyway.

145
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,919
Hey,  do you think you can trace this
license when you get back to work?

146
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,439
I can do better than that.

147
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:13,102
I can request a history of all
911 calls made out of the region.

148
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,871
I can do that if we get out of here now

149
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:19,155
because I'd really like to
make it to the falls by dark.

150
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,670
Last one there gets pushed down!

151
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:33,952
Oh, um, there's some really great
vintage baby rattles over there.

152
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,457
Thanks. I'm just waiting on a friend.

153
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:36,419
Ok.

154
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:39,041
These alabaster lamps
are really hard to find.

155
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:41,175
You've got a good eye.

156
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,226
No. Absolutely not.

157
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:48,229
That skateboard park is an
accident waiting to happen.

158
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,240
You sure grant's mom
is going to be there?

159
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,214
Is my receipt in the bag?

160
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,057
Can you just put
her on the phone?

161
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,131
- What? What do you mean she's not there?
- Here's your receipt.

162
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,146
No solvents. Just some
soap and water and, um...

163
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,611
something for your next purchase.

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,784
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:09,286
Ok, fine,but if I find out that you
didn't wear a helmet, you are dead.

166
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,876
Yes. I love you, too.

167
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:12,680
I am so sorry.

168
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:15,452
That woman is never
coming back again, is she?

169
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,184
Oh, I think she will. I gave
her a 20% off coupon.

170
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,282
You definitely don't miss a trick.

171
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,533
Thanks for covering for me.

172
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:22,576
Anytime. Was that ned?

173
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,046
Yeah.

174
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,540
I always thought I'd worry
about him less as he grew up,

175
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,213
but I worry about him more.

176
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,929
You know, at this rate, I won't stop
worrying about him until I'm dead.

177
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,197
If you're lucky.

178
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:38,449
- Chances are, I'll still be worrying
from my grave. - Lanie!

179
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,755
It sounds like I chose a
bad time to leave you...

180
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,798
- Come out,come out, wherever you are!
- With the store.

181
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,603
Oh, no. Just the opposite.

182
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,226
It was great to take my
mind off the little daredevil.

183
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,811
So, was camping as dreadful
as you thought it would be?

184
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,497
Actually, it was kind of exciting.

185
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:58,580
It was good for jimmy and
i to have some time alone.

186
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:04,550
Aha. Fess up. Do I detect a little
biological alarm clock going off?

187
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,609
Uh, ooh. No, nothing like that. Mm-mmm.

188
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:07,623
Come on. You can tell me.

189
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,612
I know I gripe,but motherhood rocks.

190
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:10,589
You are going to love it.

191
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:14,378
I'm sure I will. Can you just
excuse me for a second?

192
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:18,850
What are you doing?

193
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,314
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,736
I just wanted to
see your adorable baby,

195
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:25,360
and, oh, my god. She's so cute.

196
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,323
Thanks.

197
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:34,570
It's like she's testing me,

198
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,319
trying to see if she can trust me.

199
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,061
You think this ghost
is a worried mom...

200
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,073
looking for her kid.

201
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,401
Yeah, but I didn't realize until
today how intense that feeling is.

202
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:45,784
Wait a minute.

203
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,167
What happened today?

204
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,965
I just had a couple of anxious
moms at the store. Delia being one.

205
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,876
Please tell me that this is not the same
stove that you used with your dad.

206
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,389
Yes, miss change the subject.

207
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,010
That is the same stove
I used with my father.

208
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,181
And it works like new.

209
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:03,101
I got a little something for you.

210
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,812
That's the trace, with an
address for one anna fowler.

211
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,352
You traced the license already?

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,444
Yep. That's how I roll.

213
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,075
It expired in '86.

214
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,864
That's probably around when she died.

215
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,404
Well, we'll know that for sure
when the 911 trace comes back,

216
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,376
which will probably take
a couple of weeks,

217
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:23,498
because anything more than 10
years old is in the main archives.

218
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,336
You're my hero.
This is brookside. It's close.

219
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:27,298
Don't get too excited.

220
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:30,971
Anybody who lives in that house
probably never heard of... anna fowler.

221
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, I have a secret weapon.

222
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,021
Delia can trace real
estate transactions for me.

223
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,691
You know, one of these days
she is going to get suspicious.

224
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,933
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm going
to have to do something about it.

225
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,815
<i>Come out,
come out, wherever you are.</i>

226
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:46,364
Uh, you know,I'll be right back.

227
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:49,194
Can you throw this thing
in the trash for me?

228
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,736
Yeah, sure.

229
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,910
Anna?

230
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:02,050
Anna, I can't help you if
you won't talk to me.

231
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,131
Are you looking for someone?

232
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,273
I have to find her.

233
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,764
Who do you have to find?

234
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,613
My baby girl.

235
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,404
She's lost.

236
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,027
Can you tell me
what happened?

237
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:20,285
I... I was cold.

238
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,448
Mel, where'd you put the, um...

239
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,408
I scared her away,didn't I?

240
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,210
Yeah.

241
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,380
But  she left us something.

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,795
Lanie was a baby

243
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,147
she must dead too

244
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:54,198
I really shouldn't be doing this.

245
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:56,459
You said you wanted to keep
a foot in real estate.

246
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:59,990
Yes, to make money,but not
to snoop on other people's records.

247
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,173
Well, it's for a good cause.

248
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,923
A little girl's missing her doll.

249
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:07,923
Well, she wouldn't be a little girl anymore
if we're looking at records this far back.

250
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,436
Ok. Here it is.

251
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:15,804
The house was sold in 1991 and
the owner's name was brad fowler.

252
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:17,525
Does it say anything else about him?

253
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:21,186
Like what, he's a gemini and
likes long walks on the beach?

254
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:24,228
I mean, like his occupation.

255
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:25,738
Uh...  he was a therapist.

256
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:28,110
Hey, maybe you can kill
two birds with one stone.

257
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:32,203
You're hilarious. Thank you.

258
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,742
Sure.

259
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,293
I just thought you'd like to
know that the car was found.

260
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,175
This is, uh...

261
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:44,047
this is strange.

262
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,845
All those years...

263
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:49,137
I'm guessing it
belonged to your wife?

264
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,517
My wife is dead.

265
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:56,532
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

266
00:14:56,577 --> 00:15:01,362
it's just I found something in the car that
I thought may have belonged to a child.

267
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,297
Lanie.

268
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,756
This was my little girl'S.

269
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,967
It was really very,very thoughtful
of you to go to all this trouble.

270
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:21,809
It was no trouble.

271
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:27,349
My wife, anna, we were...
separated at the time.

272
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:31,822
She died up in those woods...
in a snowstorm.

273
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,943
Just a bit of a shock seeing all of this.

274
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:37,863
I understand.

275
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,467
I'd rather not have this.

276
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:46,377
Maybe you can give it to
a hospital or something.

277
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,380
Brings up some pretty
tough memories.

278
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:50,180
I don't mean to pry,

279
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,779
but did something happen
to your daughter also?

280
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,351
Worse thing that can
happen to a little girl.

281
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:56,980
I'm so sorry.

282
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,943
She was abandoned
by her mother.

283
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:01,814
You mean she didn't
die in the storm?

284
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,155
No.

285
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,905
She wasn't even in the car.

286
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,197
She was at home with me.

287
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,679
Where's my baby?!

288
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,641
I don't know yet.

289
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,224
Are you hiding her?

290
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,404
No.

291
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,183
I'm trying to help you, but I need
to know what you remember.

292
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,825
Nothing. I don't remember anything.

293
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,156
Ok. I know that this is hard,
but you have to try.

294
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,448
It will come if you're not
afraid of remembering.

295
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:44,829
But I am afraid.

296
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:54,053
Look at the doll.

297
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:57,224
That's what you were protecting.

298
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:02,604
I was scared.

299
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,894
It was bad out.

300
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,856
I knew it was stupid
to be on the road,

301
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,156
but I felt like I couldn't stop.

302
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,828
Like I shouldn't stop.

303
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,290
I don't know why.

304
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:45,078
I panicked.

305
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:47,160
Where was my baby?

306
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,202
I couldn't remember.

307
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,782
Anna, I...

308
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:55,002
I found your husband.

309
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,965
Lane was with him that night.
She wasn't in the car with you.

310
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,054
What?

311
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,425
She's alive.

312
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:10,347
I can't believe it.

313
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,358
Can I see her?

314
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,958
No, I haven't found her yet.

315
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,530
But there's something else.

316
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,381
Your husband said
that you left him...

317
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:23,161
and lane, that
he raised her alone.

318
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:24,711
No.

319
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,625
No. No, I would never do that.

320
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,463
She's my life,she's all I have.

321
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,375
Yeah. I'm sure that
that's true,but brad said-

322
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,756
no! I didn't abandon my baby!

323
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,047
Ok.

324
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,100
Maybe I should talk
to her alone first.

325
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,322
See how she feels.

326
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:48,442
Brad said that she
lives nearby, so...

327
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:49,780
I have to see her.

328
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,163
You will.

329
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,954
I swear. Just...

330
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,493
let me do this first.

331
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,493
My baby's alive.

332
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,925
Hi. I'm melinda gordon.

333
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:06,179
I own the antique
shop in town.

334
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:08,888
I found something that
I think you might want.

335
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:10,819
I talked to your dad-

336
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,720
oh, my god. My muffins.

337
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,389
Come in. Come in.

338
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,020
please don't burn

339
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:21,192
Hot, hot, hot!

340
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,484
Oh, oh!god

341
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,075
You'd never guess
I do this for a living.

342
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:29,577
Ah. Chocolate peanut butter cup.

343
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,088
My new greatest invention.

344
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,957
Those aren't the ones they
sell at village java, are they?

345
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,138
The very same.

346
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,087
I love those. I'm totally addicted.

347
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,588
It's part of my evil plan.

348
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,561
I do birthdays, too.

349
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,559
So, you were saying that,
uh, my father sent you?

350
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:47,720
But if what you found is a wedding dress,

351
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,472
- ... you can forget about it.
- A dress?

352
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,731
I know he means well, and I'm sure
your vintage pieces are very sweet,

353
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,326
but I told him a gazillion times,
it's a hawaiian luau.

354
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,445
I mean, I love the guy to bits, but

355
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:01,786
it's my wedding, right?

356
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,499
I'm-you know-actually-

357
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,766
ah! Oh!

358
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:05,998
Lanie!

359
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:11,671
I'm  such a klutz.

360
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,892
Don't scare me like that.

361
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:18,181
I thought you were
at the library studying.

362
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,432
Well, I couldn't stay
away from you so long.

363
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,695
Ok. Enough with the flowers.
I get it. You're sorry,

364
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:31,197
but we are running
out of vases.

365
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:32,678
Oh, god. I'm so rude.

366
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:34,077
Todd, this is melinda.

367
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,909
She owns that cute
antique store downtown.

368
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:39,051
Oh, yeah. It was nice to meet you.

369
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,209
Hey, babe, I'm gonna squeeze in a
couple more hours before dinner.

370
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,381
Great.

371
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:44,422
As if getting married
wasn't enough,

372
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,264
he's studying for the bar.

373
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:50,094
Mmm. Why all the flowers?

374
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:51,684
he feels bad.

375
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,224
It was a nothing argument really.

376
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,275
It was my fault.

377
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,654
But who's complaining, right?

378
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,148
Right. Um, actually,
I didn't come here about a dress.

379
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,779
I wanted to return
something to you.

380
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,081
Uh, no. That's-that's not mine.

381
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,631
Why would you think it is?

382
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,750
Because I found it
in your mom's car.

383
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:14,971
Lanie

384
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,671
It;s yours,isn't?

385
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,635
What?

386
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:26,096
we should go
outside and talk.

387
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:27,646
Ok.

388
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:35,859
My mom left
when I was 3,but

389
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:38,338
it still gets to me.

390
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,780
So you remember her?

391
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:42,832
Some.

392
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:46,091
How she used to sing along to the radio,

393
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:49,382
the way she smelled when
she kissed me good night.

394
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,195
The rest I just
learned from my dad.

395
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:56,305
Did your dad
tell you why she left?

396
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,319
Look, um...

397
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:03,730
you're real
easy to talk to, but...

398
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,568
why are you asking me this?

399
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,830
Your mother...

400
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,701
her spirit is still here.

401
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,043
I've seen her.

402
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:15,281
I've spoken to her.

403
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:19,123
You're telling me you've
seen my mother's ghost?

404
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,966
I know.

405
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,835
Believe me, I know
that it sounds crazy,

406
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,966
but... it's my gift.

407
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,349
She's the one who
gave me this doll,

408
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:34,660
and she wanted to find you very badly.
She loves you very much.

409
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,901
What are you doing?

410
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:40,283
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,444
What?

412
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:44,652
Nothing. I'm just
telling you the truth.

413
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,824
My mother was mentally ill.

414
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,243
My father said she had
delusional paranoia.

415
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,745
She left us.

416
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,026
She left me,
and then she died,

417
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:56,718
so I couldn't even know her.

418
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:02,971
Uh! What the hell!

419
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:10,602
- What happened?
- I don't know.

420
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,074
it just explosion

421
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,535
Anna.

422
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,324
What are you doing?

423
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,036
I'm sorry. I-I think

424
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:20,456
anna is doing this.
I'm just not really sure why.

425
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:26,548
Look,I don't know what you're trying to
pull, but I want you out of here,ok? Now.

426
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:30,670
You ok?

427
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:31,841
Uh... yeah.

428
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,275
- What happened in there?
- I had to see her.

429
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,576
She needs me.

430
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,237
She's a big girl now.
She grew up really well.

431
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:51,866
You don't have to worry
about her anymore.

432
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,126
Yes,I do!

433
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:56,209
Look,if your marriage ended badly,
I'm really sorry about that,

434
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:58,217
but you can't take
it out on lane and todd.

435
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:02,668
Believe me,the best thing that you can do
for your daughter is just to move on.

436
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:05,053
No.

437
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:08,302
As long as my baby needs me,

438
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,263
I'm never leaving.

439
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:57,408
Please!

440
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,002
- Todd?!
- No!

441
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,253
What's going
on in there?!

442
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:12,884
Todd?!

443
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,569
Hello?

444
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:23,189
You have to get
over here quick.

445
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,357
I think I need you.

446
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:29,249
The door's jammed.

447
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:30,871
Don't worry.
Jim will get us in.

448
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,413
Todd?!

449
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,132
Todd,

450
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,754
where are you,man?

451
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,134
Oh,my god!
Baby!

452
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:44,005
It's all right. He's all right.
Come over here. Come over here.

453
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,177
Oh,my god.
He's bleeding.

454
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:45,935
Go away!

455
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,686
He's gonna
need stitches.

456
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:48,729
- I'm gonna go grab
- my kit. Pressure.

457
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:51,609
It wasn't enough
that she abandoned me?

458
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,859
She's got to come back from
the grave to haunt me?!

459
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:56,458
I don't know why
she's not moving on,

460
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:59,029
but I'll try to fix it,ok?
I promise.

461
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:01,230
I have no idea
how to fix this.

462
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,374
Oh,yeah?
Maybe this'll help.

463
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,781
911 report. We just
got it faxed to us.

464
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:08,252
"Anna fowler.
Female. Caucasian.

465
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,913
Cause of death, hyperthermia.
"Page one of 3". Where's the rest of it?

466
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,875
Hey,hey,hey. That was before
we got computerized.

467
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:14,925
We're lucky to have
gotten anything at all.

468
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,559
I'm sorry
I'm so grumpy.

469
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:20,306
Grumpy? You got a crazy ghost
making you crazy.

470
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,150
Oh,I married
a comedian.

471
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:24,768
Hey,the guy who wrote this report,
do you know him?

472
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:27,400
Yeah. I know andy.

473
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,573
Sure,I remember
that night.

474
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,573
Changed me forever.

475
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,873
Got a call that morning
from the woman's sister...

476
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,876
she was worried because she
hadn't shown up the night before.

477
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,467
Andy,you led
the rescue team up,right?

478
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:48,879
Not right away. That storm
was something fierce.

479
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,388
Worst I'd seen up
till then.

480
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:55,471
Had to wait until it was
practically dark for it to subside.

481
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:59,062
It couldn't have been easy finding her
with all that snow falling.

482
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,694
You're not kidding.

483
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:04,841
There was no sign of her
along the main road, so we split up.

484
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:11,157
The footprints were pretty well
covered already.

485
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,708
But I knew
they had to be hers.

486
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:17,228
So I followed them
for quite a ways.

487
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:27,963
I knew right away that
she didn't make it.

488
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:37,209
I went to check
her pulse...

489
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:40,348
and that's
when I realized...

490
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:43,276
what?

491
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,078
What did you realize?

492
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:00,422
The little girl...

493
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:04,185
was alive.

494
00:28:04,907 --> 00:28:06,882
It was a miracle.

495
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:08,869
A true miracle.

496
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,133
Her mother used the warmth
of her own body to keep her kid alive.

497
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:20,577
Lane was with her mother
that night.

498
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,796
Anna died trying
to save her baby.

499
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,513
Why would her husband
lie about that?

500
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:34,385
y would bradlie about that?

501
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,933
I don't know. But I think
that you do and...

502
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:40,480
I hope bringing you back here
will help you remember.

503
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:47,259
She was with me.

504
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,533
She was with me.

505
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:53,867
Yes. She was. Anna...

506
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:57,419
no. You don't
understand. It...

507
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,097
it all makes sense now.

508
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,613
Mommy!

509
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:21,595
Mommy,my dolly!
Mommy!

510
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,774
I knew I should stay
in the car,but...

511
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:26,570
it was like
a refrigerator.

512
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:29,247
Mommy,I'm scared.

513
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,764
I thought if
I just kept moving.

514
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:39,750
Come on,sweetie.

515
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:43,042
I was scared.
I was trying to get away.

516
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:45,842
I just couldn't
let him find me.

517
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,571
Who?
Who were you running from?

518
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,238
- My husband.
- Brad?

519
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,502
- Yeah.
- Why?

520
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,264
He hit me.

521
00:29:58,157 --> 00:30:00,861
- Again.
- Anna...

522
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:03,488
I always thought
it was my fault.

523
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,719
If I could just be
a better wife.

524
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,113
Until that night...

525
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:14,156
Come back here!
I'm not done!

526
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:15,218
Open the door!

527
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,378
And we had another one
of our fights.

528
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:19,517
Anna!
Open the door!

529
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,081
I thought
she was asleep,

530
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:24,618
but our fighting woke her up.

531
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,339
Oh, baby.

532
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,774
- Oh, baby.
- Anna! let me in!

533
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,215
Mommy,don't
let him in.

534
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:36,180
Please don't
let him in.

535
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,125
I saw how scared she was.

536
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,215
And I knew
we had to get out.

537
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:43,560
But if you
were being abused...

538
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:46,446
why didn't your friends
or anyone help you?

539
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,246
I was too ashamed
to tell them.

540
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:52,934
I wore long sleeves
to cover the bruises.

541
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,773
And if anyone did notice,
I'd just laugh it off.

542
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,070
Clumsy me.

543
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,831
Everyone thought we were
the perfect couple.

544
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:05,177
And we were when
we weren't fighting.

545
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:08,149
Brad would feel so bad
after one of our fights,

546
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,654
he'd spoil me
like crazy,presents,

547
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,123
big bouquets of flowers,
the works.

548
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:19,649
Is that why
you attacked todd?

549
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:22,868
Because you saw him give
lane the bouquet of flowers?

550
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,496
When I saw him
with that bouquet,

551
00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:28,283
something just snapped
inside of me.

552
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:31,019
She has to know
what you went through.

553
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:34,452
What you did for her.

554
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:45,912
Please tell me
she's not here.

555
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:48,209
It's just me.

556
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,029
She gone for good?

557
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:55,523
No,but she said she'd stay away
until you're ready to see her.

558
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,665
That would be never.

559
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,553
Anna didn't abandon you.

560
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,817
What?

561
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,910
I talked to the paramedic
who rescued you.

562
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:12,171
You were with her
when she died.

563
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:15,851
I was with her
when she left my dad?

564
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:18,321
She took you
with her.

565
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:20,115
But...

566
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,093
why would my dad
lie about that?

567
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:25,640
Maybe he feels ashamed.

568
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,398
Ashamed of what?

569
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:30,864
My dad? He's the greatest dad
anyone could ask for.

570
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:33,161
Did some pretty bad
things to your mom.

571
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,387
Look,my dad would
never hurt anyone,ok?

572
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:38,185
If she said he did,
it's because she's crazy.

573
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:42,321
I don't know. Maybe she hates me.
You saw what she did to todd.

574
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,341
That was because
of the flowers.

575
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:46,556
Your dad always gave
her flowers after they had a fight.

576
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,934
It was a gut reaction when she saw todd
give you the bouquet.

577
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,992
Ok. Stop.
You've gone too far.

578
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,405
I don't need you
meddling in my life.

579
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,751
It's complicated
enough right now.

580
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:59,221
Your mom died trying to keep you safe.
She wanted to protect you.

581
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:02,229
And now she needs to
know that you're ok so she can move on.

582
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:05,157
Would it kill you
to just at least talk to her?

583
00:33:06,504 --> 00:33:08,629
That ship's already sailed.

584
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,456
At least I know I can trust my instincts.
Anna isn't crazy.

585
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,725
But lane didn't
believe you?

586
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:23,639
When I told her her mom was abused,
she just shut down.

587
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:26,046
Well,that's a pretty big
bomb you dropped on her.

588
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:28,041
Kind of blows away
everything she grew up believing.

589
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,767
Yeah. Her father is a therapist.

590
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:31,532
I mean,you'd think he'd
have it all figured out.

591
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,398
I guess she
never really know.

592
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:36,099
Yeah. Well,I wouldn't
mind meeting that guy in a dark room.

593
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,408
You are a bigger
softie than me.

594
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,472
It was a nothing argument.
My fault really.

595
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:49,108
I always thought
it was my fault.

596
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:56,308
- It's happening.
- It's happening.

597
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,857
Oh,my god!
I gotta go!

598
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:23,898
Lane! Lane,
it's melinda!

599
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,331
Are you ok?

600
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,364
I'm fine.

601
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:36,291
Now isn't a good time.

602
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,374
Do you want me
to get you out of here?

603
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,590
Are you crazy?

604
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,689
You've done
enough damage.

605
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,366
Lane, get in here

606
00:34:45,403 --> 00:34:46,908
Lane!

607
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,872
I left so this would stop.

608
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,961
But it didn'T.

609
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,016
It never will.

610
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,065
Then we have
to do something.

611
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:09,819
She won't listen to me...

612
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:11,938
or to you.

613
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,823
Not now.

614
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:15,649
What?

615
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,643
Is this some
twisted joke?

616
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:18,578
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,360
I would normally
do this slowly,

618
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,085
explain gently
that I have a gift,

619
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:24,210
I can see spirits,I can
cross them over,yada,yada.

620
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,295
Frankly,I don't have
the patience or the time.

621
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,730
- Lane needs you.
- What do you mean?

622
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:32,649
I think she's being abused,
just like you abused her mother.

623
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:38,636
What,um...
what makes you say that?

624
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,447
Look,brad,you don't have
to believe I can see ghosts,

625
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:43,280
but please believe
what I'm telling you about your daughter.

626
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:49,631
Ok. Ok. I'll admit
I had doubts about todd.

627
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,349
I always thought it was
just my own paranoia,

628
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,083
projecting my own
demons onto him.

629
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:55,957
But I know he loves her.

630
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:59,665
You loved me,too.
Said you couldn't live without me.

631
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:02,722
You always said
your heart beat only for me.

632
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,733
You said your heart beat
only for her.

633
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,837
Is she really here?

634
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:14,107
Can-can-can you tell her-

635
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,747
tell her that I'm not
the same person anymore?

636
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:21,629
That I've gotten help,and
now I'm helping others.

637
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:24,141
I know that look of his,

638
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:28,146
so full of guilt
and remorse.

639
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,818
She can hear you.

640
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:33,489
Anna...

641
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,033
I'm so sorry for...

642
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,965
for what I did.

643
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:44,670
I just...
hope you can forgive me.

644
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:55,725
All those times
you begged me to forgive you,

645
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:58,539
and I did...

646
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:01,242
because I loved you,

647
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:06,047
because I believed
you could change.

648
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,471
And it looks
like you have,

649
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:13,814
but I can't
forgive you.

650
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:19,187
I forgave you too many
times when I was alive.

651
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:23,610
She wishes she could,
but it's too late.

652
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,493
Right.

653
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:30,048
Of course...

654
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:34,219
brad,the reason that anna is earthbound
is not because of what you did to her.

655
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,813
It's lane.

656
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:38,446
You have one chance
to redeem yourself,

657
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,435
to help your daughter, please
tell her the truth about you,

658
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:44,030
so she that can she
can know the truth about todd.

659
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:53,297
I didn't want you to know.
That's why I lied.

660
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:57,342
I know it was wrong.

661
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:01,263
I hated myself
for what I did to her.

662
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:06,726
I couldn't live
if you hated me,too.

663
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,663
My mom didn't abandon me?

664
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,627
No.
She didn'T.

665
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:20,801
So you let me believe
that my mother left me?

666
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:24,972
That she didn't love me?

667
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:29,067
Lanie, the only reason I'm
bringing this up now

668
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:34,030
is because I don't want you to make
the same mistake your mother did.

669
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,084
What do you mean?

670
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:39,203
Anna thinks todd
is hurting you.

671
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:44,512
Lanie...

672
00:38:45,516 --> 00:38:49,102
they say that little girls
marry their fathers-

673
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:51,104
just stop it,ok?

674
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,117
Todd and I are happy.

675
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:55,529
We're getting married,
he's gonna pass the bar,

676
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,861
and everything
is gonna be great.

677
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,743
Just stop this.

678
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:01,586
Lanie,please.

679
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,181
No.

680
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,934
My head is spinning.

681
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:18,688
I can't even think
about this right now.

682
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,586
So you think she's waiting
to see if lane's okay?

683
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,507
Sure. And believe me, she'll know.
She's got the mommy-radar.

684
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:34,389
You know,I always wondered how my mom
knew I spiked the punch at junior prom.

685
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:38,984
Go ahead, make fun of me,
but,you know what, it's powerful stuff.

686
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:41,826
See, I think anna was in limbo.
Earthbound but unaware.

687
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:43,439
Her daughter got engaged,

688
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:46,183
and it sent a ripple effect through
the universe that woke her up.

689
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,123
Oh, to be continued.

690
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,801
Is my mother here?

691
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,975
I always told myself
it would get better.

692
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,989
When he passed the bar...

693
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,582
when we got married.

694
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,704
When we moved
into a bigger house.

695
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:20,130
He wasn't going
to change.

696
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,601
You did the right thing.

697
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,476
My mother did
the right thing.

698
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:28,405
Is that why
she stayed here?

699
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,859
To stop me from
staying with him?

700
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:38,967
Can I...

701
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:41,919
can I thank her?

702
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:45,430
You just did.

703
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:48,185
She's here?

704
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,867
She's so beautiful.

705
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:57,319
I can't believe this is the
tiny little girl I held in my arms.

706
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,042
Mom?

707
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,913
She wants you to know
how proud she is of you.

708
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:08,759
No,mom. It was you.

709
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:13,604
I can't believe how strong you were
to do what you did.

710
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,238
How tough you were.

711
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:20,240
You protected me.

712
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,086
You saved me.

713
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,628
We saved ourselves.

714
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:33,972
I'm so scared,mom.

715
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,975
I don't know
what I'm going to do now.

716
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:41,740
Yes,you do.

717
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:44,530
It's inside you.

718
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:48,035
Remember
how strong you are.

719
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,755
And just think of me,

720
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:53,967
and I'll be with you.

721
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:57,222
I'll be watching you
from wherever I am.

722
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,814
She wants you to remember
how strong you are.

723
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:04,607
She will always
be watching over you.

724
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:10,453
I love you,mom.

725
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,045
I feel like I never
got to say it to her.

726
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:18,009
You don't have
to say it.

727
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:21,140
We both know it.

728
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:37,496
Thank you
for everything.

729
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,228
She's gone?

730
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:51,946
Yeah.

731
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:54,029
But she's happy.

732
00:42:55,536 --> 00:42:57,822
At peace.

733
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:21,912
I can't
thank you enough.

734
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:28,507
I don't know
what else to say.
