I don't think of it
asaranor

195
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:41,397
i'm simply tg to apply
scientificxpnation

196
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:44,064
to phenomena
that seem unexplainable.

197
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,564
Is evp common?

198
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,198
Hard to know. We don
exacy keep stistics.

199
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:51,630
Most of the voic seem

with anything electronic.

202
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:59,797
Tv monitors, vcrs, eteter

203
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:03,897
most peoplreally don't know
exactly how or w it works.

204
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,897
Most peoe liev
it caused by ghosts.

205
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:08,931

206
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:10,997

She doesn't seem
to be in conversation

224
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:09,198
as much as trying
to g someone to hear her.

225

539
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,913
How could she
keep thaom me?

540

542
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,748
You ow tt's not true.

543
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,314
Sometimes
we don't understand

544
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:48,481
why people d
wh thedo.

545
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:51,980
Everybody fights
their own battle.

546
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:56,547
We may n even ow
what that is.

547
