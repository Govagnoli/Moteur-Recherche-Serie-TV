1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,500
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm married...

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,100
I live in a small town...

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
I might be just like you...

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,900
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,600
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,900
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,500
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,300
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:36,705
In order to tell you my story,

13
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,406
I have to tell you theirs.

14
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,502
Ok!

15
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:00,903
- How you doing?
- Pretty good!

16
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,301
All right! Everything's in.
Salad's almost done.

17
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:04,303
How did this happen?

18
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:06,102
You mean this insane mad dash
at the last minute?

19
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,202
That's the problem with having
a dinner party on a week night.

20
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,603
It is amazing how much work
really cuts into your day.

21
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:13,800
But you know what, this kind of chaos
is exactly what Holly thrived on.

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,302
Back in the day when you two
were a couple of single girls,

23
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:17,801
raising hell and breaking
hearts in the city?

24
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:21,601
All right, she was the one who played
the field, I was merely the spectator.

25
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,302
It's gonna be great having
her live in Grandview.

26
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,700
All right, are Scott and Holly
usually on time?

27
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:27,803
Yeah, always on the dot. But maybe
pregnancy has slowed her down.

28
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,103
You think pregnancy is gonna
slow you down?

29
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,002
I don't think we're gonna
find out anytime soon.

30
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,301
Well, I think it might make you
even more beautiful.

31
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:39,600
- All right, nice try. Move on.
- I had to go there, ok?

32
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,301
All right, everything's good.
I'm gonna go change.

33
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:45,002
Candles are lit, table's ready.
I'm gonna get dressed, too.

34
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,901
Want to race?

35
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:58,702
What is wrong with you?!

36
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,302
You thinking what I'm thinking?

37
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,700
Yeah, they're gonna be
here in 15 minutes.

38
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:17,500
Well, I thought you were
good at multitasking.

39
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,603
Saved by the phone!

40
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,603
Hello?

41
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,100
Holly, hi!

42
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,302
No. No, no, no.

43
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,001
No, you just take your time.

44
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,303
We'll be right here.

45
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,903
Ok. Bye.

46
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:32,001
Holly's running a little late.

47
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:34,402
Scott's stuck at work.

48
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,401
Bummer.

49
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah.

50
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,903
They could be at least half an hour.

51
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,600
Damn them.

52
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:50,301
Fantastic as usual, Jim.

53
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,903
Thank you.

54
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,901
Hey, you know, you should
take a plate home for Scott.

55
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,903
He's probably already
eaten at the office.

56
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,203
He's been working there
around the clock.

57
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,002
What's the matter?

58
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:05,201
The baby's been in a really
bad mood lately.

59
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:08,000
What does an unborn baby have to
be in a bad mood about?

60
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:11,201
Can't find the remote?

61
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,102
I know, it's funny...

62
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:17,602
but I really do feel like
I can tell his mood.

63
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:21,802
Kid, when you get out in the real world,
then you'll know what a bad mood is.

64
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,901
Do you hear how your
husband is abusing me?

65
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:28,202
Yes, and I wouldn't
take it from him.

66
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:35,101
Hey, have you guys worked on
picking a name yet?

67
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,003
No!

68
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:39,802
I want something simple but strong,
like David or Michael.

69
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:44,701
But Scott keeps throwing around
these names - Hunter, Tag, Chase.

70
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,701
It sounds like a game
of hide and seek.

71
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:50,800
- Hey, do you need anything?
- No.

72
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,003
Scott, you scared
the hell out of me.

73
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm sorry I'm so late.

74
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:03,502
Come in.
It's time for dessert.

75
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,902
Hey, you guys, look who I found.

76
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:11,502
Holly?!

77
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,902
Holly, are you ok?

78
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:15,900
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?

79
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:17,402
She's having some kind of seizure.

80
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:21,202
How can this be happening?
This is the beginning not the end.

81
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:25,001
How could you do this to me?

82
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,801
Mel?

83
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,802
Melinda!
Call 911.

84
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:07,003
EPISODE 2x13
"Deja Boo"

85
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,903
Holly!

86
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,202
Jim, he's in there.

87
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,502
I have to get in there.

88
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:35,902
It's all right. I cleared it with one
of the nurses. Just put these on.

89
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:08,602
This is the end.
This can't continue.

90
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,901
Not  ever again.
I'm the alpha and the omega.

91
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,001
This is the end,
not the beginning.

92
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,301
No!

93
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:24,203
Jim, I just had the weirdest dream.

94
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:29,103
Remind me to call the hospital
in the morning.

95
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,502
Who are you?!

96
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,801
- Eric Richard Johnny Oscar.
- Don't play games with me.

97
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:35,802
Who are you?

98
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,200
And what do you want
with Holly Newman?

99
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,903
Why are you trying to hurt her?

100
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:43,200
You're supposed to cross over.
Do you see a light?

101
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:45,303
Do I see a light?

102
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:49,301
Are you ok?
I heard you moving about.

103
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,302
Yeah.

104
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:53,700
- Why'd you get up?
- You kicked me in your sleep.

105
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:57,401
Must have been some dream.

106
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:03,601
So...

107
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,201
what did the doctor say
about last night?

108
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, it's a brand new one.
Preeclampsia.

109
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,500
I told him it sounded
like a carpentry term.

110
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,000
He didn't laugh. 

111
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,601
- What does it mean?
- High blood pressure.

112
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:19,002
Which would have lowered immediately if
he had just said "high blood pressure"

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,801
instead of preeclampsia.

114
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,800
Ok. Where's Scott?

115
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:25,103
At work, as usual.

116
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:29,503
Hey, do you remember
a guy named Oscar?

117
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,002
Oscar...

118
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:32,701
No.

119
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:35,602
What about a Richard or Johnny?

120
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:39,201
Wait,  this isn't about our trip to
Daytona over spring break, is it?

121
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,003
Ew, and no.

122
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,900
What about Eric?

123
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,901
- Eric? No, but...
- What?

124
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:48,702
I had a dream about somebody
named Eric last night,

125
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:54,501
and  i woke up thinking that's
what I wanted to name the baby.

126
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,102
Stop it!

127
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,901
Are you ok?

128
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,601
God, I feel like I just got stabbed.

129
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:08,102
I'm gonna go see
if I can find a doctor.

130
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:16,501
I guess you have to be 9
to figure this out, huh?

131
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,400
Or just like really smart.

132
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:26,302
- I've done it before.
- Ah, ringer.

133
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,803
You look familiar to me.

134
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,000
- Delia Banks.
- No, that's me.

135
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,902
You, that's you.

136
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,002
I'm Tim Flaherty.

137
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,902
Oh, we met at the...

138
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:37,801
- memorial.
- Right. For Eva Turner.

139
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,301
Uh, I'm looking for a gift...

140
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:41,603
uh, for my sister.

141
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,203
Oh, well, does she like
russian nesting dolls?

142
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,002
It's too complicated.

143
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,300
Yeah, I was maybe looking for something, you know...

144
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,600
pretty.

145
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:54,705
You know, something like
a female would like.

146
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:59,406
Let me see if we have anything in
this store that a female might like.

147
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,101
Let's see. Come over here.

148
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,703
I don't even know if the ghost
realizes that he's hurting Holly.

149
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,301
I don't know why
he's obsessed with her.

150
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,701
Holly used to be a poster child
for "girls gone wild."

151
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't think it's possible?

152
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,601
Ok, I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

153
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:17,102
What if Holly had an affair
with the ghost?

154
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,902
Well, don't you think she would
have at least told me about it?

155
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,401
All right, then why is he
still hanging around her?

156
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,200
I don't know.

157
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:27,203
Where is this place?

158
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:30,101
I have to go.

159
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:31,703
Between the white one
and the green one.

160
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,100
Vanilla Bean and Musty Cucumber.

161
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,202
Musty cucumber?

162
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:37,902
Why would anyone
want to smell that?

163
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:39,500
You know...

164
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,200
it's a female thing.

165
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,103
Which one do you like?

166
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,701
- Vanilla Bean.
- Sold.

167
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:48,102
Ok, so we're closed.

168
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,901
Oh, well, last sale
of the evening then.

169
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:51,901
$15.

170
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,601
That's quite the bean.

171
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:57,203
You know what, Tim, I think they're
really gonna enjoy the new aroma
at the firehouse.

172
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,002
Uh, it's for my sister.

173
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,703
Ok then.

174
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:05,003
You know what?
Maybe I'll see you...

175
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,203
When you close, you really close.

176
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:11,201
Yeah, you have to be firm,
or you never get home.

177
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,803
Speaking of which...
good night.

178
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,903
Oh, I'm in no rush. I thought
maybe we could do some invoicing.

179
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:22,301
You know what, I just need
a few minutes of alone time.

180
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:29,800
- You know...
- Good night.

181
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,903
Good night then.

182
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,402
We need to talk about
something really important.

183
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you the father of Holly's baby?

184
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,700
I don't even know who she is.

185
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,403
- Well, then why are you...
- Where are my t-shirts?

186
00:10:58,507 --> 00:10:59,703
What t-shirts?

187
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:02,003
Ok, tell me your name.

188
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,302
Eric Sanborn,
but this isn't my store.

189
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,700
You have a store?

190
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:08,800
Yeah, alt outside of Grandview.

191
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,502
Alt...

192
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:15,201
A-l-t. All-t. Alternative.
The alt button on your keyboard.

193
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,803
It kind of means a lot of different things.

194
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:19,902
That's what I like about it.

195
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,300
Eric?

196
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:25,803
Eric?

197
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:27,701
No, ma'am.

198
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,600
My name is John Richmond.

199
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,500
Friends call me Johnny.

200
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:33,801
You just said your name was Eric

201
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,902
and that you own a t-shirt shop
outside of Grandview.

202
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,601
I did?

203
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,703
Sun's awful hot.
Must have been working.

204
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm a day-laborer. Old man Miller's farm.

205
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,602
- Where's that?
- Near Tulsa.

206
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,203
- What do you want?
- What does who want?

207
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,703
Johnny.

208
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,500
No, sorry. Oscar.

209
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,502
So, I take it you're
not a day-laborer.

210
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,303
Me? No.

211
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:01,300
I'm a freshman.
I just started at state.

212
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,601
Who are you really?

213
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,903
You ask a lot of questions.

214
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,200
Who are you?

215
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,703
My name is Richard Ward.

216
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:12,400
You can call me Richie.

217
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:14,100
Look, I'm just trying to help you.

218
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,100
- You can help me?
- Yes, I can.

219
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,700
I just don't understand
what you want.

220
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:24,101
Or who you really are.

221
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:29,000
My name's Richard.

222
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,801
My friends call me Johnny.

223
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,602
Please.

224
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:34,503
Oscar Hodges.
I'm a freshman.

225
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,203
My name's Eric. I own a t-shirt
shop just outside of town.

226
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,600
Please.

227
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:39,900
Richard.

228
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,001
Johnny.

229
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,001
Oscar.

230
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:42,603
Eric.

231
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:44,400
Stop, you're making me sick.

232
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:45,400
Summerville.

233
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:46,201
Tulsa.

234
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,600
Please!

235
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:48,601
Chicago.

236
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,600
Grandview.

237
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:53,103
What are you looking at?

238
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,401
You're making me sick.

239
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,402
Can you help me?
You said you can help me.

240
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:15,002
You said you can help me!

241
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,503
Come on! This guy had multiple
personality disorder when he was alive,

242
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,501
now he's dead. So, he's using
his alter egos to haunt you.

243
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,800
That's it. Case closed.

244
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,902
This ghost thing is easy
once you get the hang of it.

245
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,802
I don't even know why you guys
make such a big deal out of it.

246
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,302
You don't have the hang of anything,
at least not with this ghost.

247
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:40,701
Look, when someone has
an affliction in their life,

248
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,403
they're free of it when they die.

249
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:43,602
The soul is pure and clear.

250
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you sure it's not
4 completely separate ghos?

251
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,503
They all look exactly alike.

252
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:50,400
I hate this!

253
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:52,503
I want to see this!
This isn't fair!

254
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,200
I should be able to see this!
I have a doctorate.

255
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:56,400
- You don't have a doctorate.
- Be careful what you wish for.

256
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,001
All right, I'm over it.
Listen, all right.

257
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,401
Are one of these personalities
more dominant than the others?

258
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,801
Yeah, I think at least the one
that I have the most information on.

259
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:05,100
- Hey, are you online?
- Yes, but careful.

260
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,100
Sometimes my modem and I
are not speaking.

261
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,701
That's private. Don't pry.
Don't be a prier, a nosy parker.

262
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,200
I won't.

263
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:17,101
I found a web site,
it's about a store he owned.

264
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,302
That's him.

265
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:22,602
So this is what it's
like to see a ghost.

266
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,200
Hey! This was not here yesterday. 

267
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:27,801
It says, "Eric passed away. Please
don't post messages to him any more."

268
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:28,901
"Brenda Sanborn."

269
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,903
We've gotta get out of here.
We have to go now.

270
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:34,001
We? Where?
To this Brenda person.

271
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,103
- To the store.
- Aha! That's my next stop.

272
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:37,500
They open at noon.

273
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:38,503
Damn it.

274
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,501
I have a class to teach.
Will you wait for me?

275
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:43,502
You  know the old saying:
"she travels fastest who travels alone."

276
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,103
It's Rudyard Kipling. I've read
all his books. And you know what?

277
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:48,702
I think I'm a little tired of you
using me just for my brain.

278
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:54,903
If only that were possible. But
so much of your mouth comes with it.

279
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,103
Hi.

280
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,100
I'm looking for Brenda Sanborn.

281
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:07,502
I didn't know collection
agencies made house calls.

282
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,103
Look, I told the first
chick who called

283
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm not gonna have a check
till at least...

284
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:13,301
Ok,  I'm not from
a collection agency.

285
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,702
I'm just a friend...

286
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,903
or an acquaintance of Eric.

287
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,400
I saw the web site.

288
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,302
I'm sorry you had to
find out like that. I just...

289
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,302
I didn't know how else
to get the word out.

290
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,703
How did he die?

291
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,302
An aneurysm.

292
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:29,901
What did you say
your name was again?

293
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:33,201
I'm sorry.
I'm Melinda.

294
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,900
I own a store in Grandview.

295
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,303
So, did Eric owe you money?

296
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,402
- No. Did he owe a lot?
- Not any more.

297
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,600
Now I owe it.

298
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,900
That's what brothers are for, right?

299
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:50,400
Eric never let a little thing like money
stop him from doing whatever he wanted.

300
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you know Holly Newman?

301
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:55,602
I didn't know most
of Eric's girlfriends.

302
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,401
Neither did he really.

303
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,100
Well, what about any
of his other friends?

304
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:01,200
Richard Ward,

305
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,302
Oscar Hodges,

306
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,200
John Richmond.

307
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:07,000
More people he owed money to?

308
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,802
Eric called these his collectibles. 

309
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:20,200
I called them junk.

310
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:21,702
What is all this?

311
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:23,303
Oh, weather vanes,

312
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:25,503
and plates and dishes,

313
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:28,301
and clocks.

314
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,701
- It looks like stuff I would sell.
- That was never for sale.

315
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:34,300
Eric was obsessed with this crap.

316
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,201
He'd  spend the weekends when he was
supposed to be working the register

317
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:42,203
looking for this stuff at
garage sales, flea markets...

318
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:44,401
- Do you know why?
- Just that he liked them.

319
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,801
I never understood it.

320
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,703
He spent a lot of money on it, too.

321
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:52,003
I have no idea where
he got the cash.

322
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,102
You think you could
sell any of this?

323
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,301
Let me look into it.

324
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,202
Do you think I could
take a couple pieces?

325
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:02,602
Let me just throw
some things in a box.

326
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:11,002
I've been going through this box
trying to find out something more
about Eric.

327
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:15,002
Simple. He was a man obsessed
with time and eating.

328
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,001
And the weather.

329
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,902
And why is it that everyone else
is better at my job than me lately?

330
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,202
Ho ho! Touchy.

331
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,400
I started with the clocks.

332
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:25,001
They're made at the same factory
at the same company in Massachusetts.

333
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,702
The place is still there,
so I asked somebody to check
the payroll files for me.

334
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,200
- And Eric worked there?
- No, but Richard Ward did,

335
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:33,302
and one of his other personalities...
Oscar Hodges.

336
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:34,703
- He worked there?
- No, he didn't.

337
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:38,603
But there was a family named
Hodges who owned Aritmeza.

338
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,301
- Aritmeza fine china.
- Absolutely.

339
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,002
Then I went online and searched
the public records

340
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,802
- for Eric's death certificate.
- Oh, I got it.

341
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,800
- Eric's not dead.
- Eric is dead.

342
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,602
And so are his other personalities,
Johnny, Richard, and Oscar.

343
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,902
They all had death certificates
on file. They were real people.

344
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,502
All right, so if Eric didn't make up
these ghosts' personalities,

345
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:57,803
he based them on people he knew.

346
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,902
There is no way he could have
known them. Listen to this:

347
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,501
John Richmond died in 1945,

348
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,402
Oscar Hodges - 1963,

349
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,700
Richard Ward - 1983,

350
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,903
a year before Eric was even born.

351
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,001
A connection to Holly.

352
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,102
Not that I can tell.

353
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,201
I told his sister that
I'd buy the rest of his stuff

354
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:16,203
and see if I could
find something else.

355
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,203
Told you I could figure it out.

356
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,301
I'm working.

357
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,700
Look.

358
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, it's perfect.

359
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,603
Baby steps.

360
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,803
- You really think he's interested?
- Yeah, definitely.

361
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,403
He's if you can believe it,
just a little shy around women.

362
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:41,302
Maybe we can help him along.

363
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:44,400
Oh, there she is.

364
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:47,802
Hi!

365
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:48,600
Hey.

366
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,203
You know what, it might be easier
to unload if you pull around back.

367
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:55,802
Ok. Hey, before I forget, I found
these under one of the boxes.

368
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,500
They're just some papers
and stuff of Eric's.

369
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:59,001
I really didn't go through it.

370
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,603
Why are you giving them to me?

371
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,103
Well, I think they belong to those
friends of Eric's you told me about.

372
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,003
I figured you'd be in touch with them.

373
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm sure I will be.

374
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:11,502
I'll see you around back.

375
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:16,202
Eric collected every official
document he could on Richard Ward,

376
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,902
Oscar Hodges,

377
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:20,201
and John Richmond.

378
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,702
Did his sister know why?

379
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:24,300
I get the feeling they weren't very
close, and I think I know why.

380
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,001
He was ghosting them.

381
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:26,702
Haunting them.

382
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,401
No, I mean like identity theft.

383
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,402
I think he was stealing
the identities of dead people

384
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,001
so he could get credit cards,
loans, stuff in their names.

385
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,501
That explains all your documents,
but what about the weather vanes,

386
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,601
the dishes, all that stuff?

387
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:39,702
I don't know. Maybe he was
obsessed with these people.

388
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,203
And now his karmic reward is
to be saddled with their identities

389
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,703
after death. That's perfect.

390
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, you know what
they say about payback.

391
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,203
I mean, maybe this was his way
of dealing with his guild.

392
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:51,101
Besides, ghosting can be a huge
deal for families of the dead.

393
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,802
I mean, all of a sudden, your dearly
departed is shopping and racking up

394
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,403
thousands of dollars in debt.

395
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:58,103
You have to clear their name
and declare them dead again.

396
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,300
I can see how that
would be stressful.

397
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,802
How you gonna help him?

398
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:05,600
Get him to remember it.
Face what he's done.

399
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,001
Anyway, I'll be back
in an hour or so.

400
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,801
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the store.

401
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:13,902
All of his collectables are there.
Maybe he will be, too.

402
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,200
Bye.

403
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,800
Eric...

404
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:48,400
I know you're here. Your energy
always makes me feel dizzy.

405
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:56,903
What is it?

406
00:20:57,008 --> 00:21:00,200
I just hurt so much.

407
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,700
Why?

408
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,900
This just too much.

409
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:09,802
What is?

410
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,700
Everything.

411
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:14,102
Eric, you have to try and remember
some things that happened,

412
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,600
some things that happened to you
when you were alive.

413
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:18,601
I remember too much!

414
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:22,002
Don't you understand?

415
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,401
Stop it!

416
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,503
Shut up, shut up.

417
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,100
Stop it!

418
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:38,101
Eric, it's ok.
I can help you.

419
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:48,402
Just tell me what you remember.

420
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,002
Dying.

421
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:57,400
- I know that's hard.
- I died 4 times.

422
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,703
4 times.

423
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:34,901
Did you just remember this?

424
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,700
I knew it when I was alive...

425
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:41,101
from when I was a kid.

426
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:45,902
I remember things that
never happened to me.

427
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,103
Just felt them.

428
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:55,501
When you died the last time,
did you go into the light?

429
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,201
I saw the light.
I wanted it so bad.

430
00:23:00,307 --> 00:23:02,801
- Yeah, but did you go into it?
- Yes.

431
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,502
It felt so good.

432
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:08,401
Then I saw it.

433
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:15,700
Every bad thing I ever did,
every bad thing I ever let happen.

434
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,402
Everyone I hurt.

435
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:20,501
I hurt everyone.

436
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,801
And then I wasn't
in the light any more.

437
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:28,502
What's the first thing that you remember
when you came back from the light?

438
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,101
I saw people I didn't know.

439
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,400
That couple.

440
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,802
I couldn't stop following them.

441
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:35,702
And then you.

442
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:38,502
You're the first person
that could see me.

443
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,301
What about the others?

444
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:44,003
The other spirits with you?

445
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:48,103
I'm so tired.

446
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:54,000
Reincarnation?!

447
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:54,700
It has to be!

448
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,401
It explains the memories,
the other personalities.

449
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,200
He remembers going into the light
and seeing his life review.

450
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,500
How did this happen?
How did you get ahead of me?!

451
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,802
You'll get the hang of it.

452
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,602
I thought you only deal
with earthbound spirits,

453
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:08,402
that once they cross over,
they're no longer on your radar.

454
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:09,702
True, but he came back.

455
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:14,101
Well, then how do you explain you saw
the ghost of Ricky, Fernando, and Jorge?

456
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,703
You mean Johnny, Richard, and Oscar?

457
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,702
Exactly. If they were reincarnated,
then they would have already crossed over.

458
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,601
Can you explain why
or how you saw them?

459
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:23,202
No.

460
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:24,303
Good! Good!

461
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,902
'Cause that means I'm ahead again!

462
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,500
You didn't see the ghosts
of those 3 guys.

463
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:31,203
What you saw was soul fragmentation,
or soul residue if you will,

464
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,601
and I hope that you will,
of Eric's prior incarnations.

465
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,702
Why?

466
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,200
Why? The guy had a lot of problems.

467
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:41,602
And he was holding onto a lot
of troublesome life experiences.

468
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,501
It's like when you turn off
a plasma television

469
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,502
and the image stays there a while.

470
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:47,802
Ok, this is actually
making my teeth hurt.

471
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:50,301
I've never dealt with
a reincarnated soul before.

472
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,001
Well, half the world's
cultures and religions

473
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:56,003
would actually disagree with you.
There's the Hindus, the Buddhists,

474
00:24:56,106 --> 00:24:59,802
the Chinese, the native Americans,
Shirley Maclaine, all the tops.

475
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,203
They believe we come back.

476
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:02,702
Every soul or just some?

477
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:05,700
Depends on what life lesson
is still needed to be learned.

478
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:09,000
But all cultures pretty much
have the same take on that theme.

479
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,302
That you keep coming back
until you get it right.

480
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,603
This soul remembers everything.
It's like it's torturing him.

481
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:15,902
It's like he doesn't
want to come back.

482
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:20,602
Souls are assigned.
There's no trial period here.

483
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,700
What?

484
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:24,602
My friend Holly is pregnant.

485
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,602
Eric's been haunting her.

486
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:30,803
You think that Eric's been assigned
to be born to Holly?

487
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:32,701
Why else would he
be attached to her?

488
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:33,902
Holly would know.

489
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:34,902
How?

490
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:36,800
When a soul is ready
to be reincarnated,

491
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:40,801
it lets its mother
know through a dream.

492
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,700
It's called an announcing dream.

493
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,502
She had that dream.

494
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:48,003
Eric came to her. That's how
she picked out the baby's name.

495
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:53,000
And he's trying to stop
the baby from being born.

496
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,401
That sounds...

497
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,901
crazy.

498
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,200
Eric, you're dead...

499
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:03,501
and yet you're standing
here talking to me?

500
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:06,600
Let's get a grip on
what's crazy and what isn't.

501
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:08,901
So, all these things I remember,

502
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:11,601
all these memories, I actually...

503
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,502
I actually lived those lives?

504
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,603
Yeah, I think so.

505
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:21,503
And I'm still here because I have to
come back and do it again.

506
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:23,402
I don't want to do that.

507
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:24,902
I don't think it's your choice.

508
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,300
You don't know what it's like
to remember so much,

509
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:31,100
to feel it over and over again.

510
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:34,103
You learn to love your life
and the people in it.

511
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,501
And then you lose them.

512
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:39,603
I've seen my parents die...

513
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,402
3 times.

514
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:46,303
The time before last,
I lost my little brother.

515
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:50,302
The friends, the people
you care about...

516
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,801
they just drift away.

517
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,000
You lose them all.

518
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:55,701
I'm tired.

519
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,502
I can't take another lifetime.

520
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,501
Ok, well, maybe you won't
remember next time.

521
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:03,503
- Maybe you can start fresh.
- And what's the point?

522
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:09,101
Why do I have to come back again?
What do I have to learn?

523
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:18,803
I'm supposed to come back
to your friend, aren't I?

524
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,002
I'm not coming back.

525
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,801
Eric, you can't do that.

526
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:30,700
I don't care what I have to do...

527
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:34,401
or who I have to do it to.

528
00:27:35,307 --> 00:27:38,103
I'm finished.

529
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:46,602
And there's nothing we can do
to protect Holly and her baby?

530
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,201
He's very powerful.
He made her sick, he made me sick.

531
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,603
Hey, two tickets for tomorrow night.
Name's Clancy.

532
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,103
Thanks.

533
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,601
Oh, that's perfect.

534
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,500
Hi, guys.

535
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,602
Oh. Hey.

536
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,401
Oh, it's so nice to see you guys.

537
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:06,400
I know, it's actually
perfect timing.

538
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:06,900
What do you mean?

539
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:09,802
Well, we had tickets to see
this show tomorrow night.

540
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:11,500
- And we can't go.
- Nope.

541
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,200
We think you should go.

542
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:16,303
Yeah, hate to see them go to waste.

543
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:17,602
- I...
- Fantastic.

544
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:20,000
You know, have a good time, and we
expect a report when you get back.

545
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:22,601
Good night.

546
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:26,000
Which one do you think is a brighter
shade of red, him or her?

547
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,600
This has gotta be him.
He's gonna kill me.

548
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,201
Listen, dude, you got...

549
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:34,001
Holly, no, shh!
Calm down, calm...

550
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,903
Fine, we'll be at the hospital
as soon as we can.

551
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,703
It's Holly.

552
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:45,300
- Scott!
- She's still not stabile.

553
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,901
They don't know why.

554
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,601
- She's starting labor.
- Ok, I have to get in there.

555
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,801
I can help her through this.

556
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:53,103
Ok.

557
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,101
I don't understand this.
Her blood pressure is still spiking.

558
00:28:58,207 --> 00:28:59,300
That's it, Holly.

559
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,202
You just keep breathing.

560
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,101
You're going good!

561
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,100
What the hell?! I'm sorry,
I have to ask you to leave.

562
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,802
I need this room cleared
of all visitors!

563
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:07,503
No, I can help her!

564
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,801
Please! And I'm telling you
you have to leave now!

565
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:13,303
You, too, Scott! Please!

566
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,703
The baby is deceling.
Get pediatrics down here stat!

567
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,501
Right away.

568
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:34,302
What is it?

569
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,903
What?

570
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:47,101
You have a baby girl.

571
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,200
I had no idea 7 pounds
weighed so much.

572
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:00,600
She's heavy.

573
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,600
Well, don't tire yourself out, honey.

574
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:04,500
Here, let me take her.

575
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,201
Do you want me to
put her down for you?

576
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:09,003
Sure. Yeah.

577
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, it looks like
we're gonna go with Erica.

578
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,402
That's perfect.

579
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:20,003
Thank you for being born.

580
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:23,402
I'm still here.

581
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:26,101
Why am I still here?

582
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:29,002
Uh, hey, Jim?

583
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,202
You know, I feel...
feel dizzy.

584
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:34,701
Could you just hold her?

585
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:46,103
- Are you all right?
- He's still here.

586
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:05,402
Hey, are you feeling all right?

587
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,603
I didn't sleep very well last night.

588
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,800
Whoa! Look at you.

589
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,803
Oh, that's right.
Tonight is your date with Tim.

590
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah, I'm finally doing something with
a guy who isn't my 13-year-old son.

591
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,903
Well, you look really beautiful.

592
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,003
Thanks.

593
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,602
I'm not going.

594
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:26,100
What? Why?

595
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:29,002
I can't find the right jewelry.

596
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,903
And I have, uh...

597
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:33,702
this feeling in the pit of my stomach.

598
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,602
Yeah. Those are butterflies.

599
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:38,102
No. It feels more like dread.

600
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:41,803
Why? Tim seems like such a great guy.

601
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,301
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

602
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:48,101
You would be surprised
at my crazy threshold.

603
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:51,601
I just feel like
I'm cheating on Charlie.

604
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:54,801
One date does not mean
that you love Charlie any less.

605
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:58,402
It's just I... I don't know.

606
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:02,100
Maybe it's because I'm afraid I'm gonna
start to forget him or something.

607
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,000
I know, see? I'm crazy.

608
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:07,301
You will always love Charlie, always.

609
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:11,301
And letting go and forgetting
are two completely different things.

610
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:13,102
I don't know why
this is so hard on me.

611
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:18,001
Well, you owe it to yourself to go
and have some fun. Talk, laugh.

612
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:20,901
Wouldn't Charlie want that?

613
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:25,202
Hey, you really are sick, aren't you?
I thought you got rid of that bug.

614
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:28,001
Oh, I've been trying.
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

615
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:30,203
You know what?
I have just the thing.

616
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:32,101
I am gonna write down
the ingredients of this broth

617
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,700
that will make you feel 100% better.

618
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:40,803
I used it when I had morning sickness
when I was pregnant with Ned.

619
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:53,500
No!

620
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,203
What? I figured out
why Eric's still here.

621
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:08,800
Why? He's still gonna be reincarnated
as somebody else's baby.

622
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:10,602
Whose?

623
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:13,002
Ours.

624
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:27,501
Well, if you'd told me this last week,
that you thought you were pregnant,

625
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,501
I would be walking on air.

626
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,903
Before I knew about Eric.

627
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:35,600
What if it was Eric's soul
and we just didn't know?

628
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,803
Well, then we wouldn't know.

629
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:38,902
Now we do.

630
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:41,403
Look, if this happens,

631
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:43,901
if it's real, will you be ok?

632
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,600
Now, you know I want
to have a child with you.

633
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,002
I mean, look, this is not what
I imagined or how I imagined...

634
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:51,100
The way that this baby is
coming to us, is it gonna...

635
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:53,000
change things?

636
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,500
Change how you feel?

637
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,300
Well, you're not seriously asking me
if it's gonna change the way

638
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:58,101
I feel about you, are you?

639
00:33:58,206 --> 00:33:59,900
I really need to know.

640
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,601
Ok. Hey...

641
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,703
If this child is coming to us,
however it comes,

642
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:11,200
it's still our kid made by us,
made by us, part of us.

643
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:15,602
Maybe we're supposed to
teach him something or her.

644
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:20,603
Things because of what you know,
only you and i could do.

645
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:22,601
Mel, I'm there.

646
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,502
I'm so there.

647
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,701
But what about you?

648
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:34,102
Look, I know you don't think you're
ready to have a child. I know that.

649
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,100
I know it's huge.
I get it.

650
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:41,000
And I will wait as long as you want
to wait, but if this baby is coming,

651
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:44,701
are you gonna be all right?

652
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:50,700
Are you gonna be there with me?

653
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:52,402
'Cause I can't lose you.

654
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:55,501
I can't lose what we have.

655
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,302
Me neither.

656
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:01,602
Promise?

657
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:04,302
All right.

658
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,100
More hot water?

659
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,902
I mean, this is a soul that
doesn't want to come back. So...

660
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:22,202
what if he tries to hurt you?

661
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:25,200
I just need to talk to his sister.

662
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,702
Explain it all to her and...

663
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:30,900
maybe if she can be there
for him once he's reborn,

664
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:33,402
he'll feel better
about coming back.

665
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,101
All right.

666
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:29,602
Look, I'm not saying I believe
any of this for a second,

667
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,100
but if you're asking me
if I will be there for Eric

668
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:35,001
when he comes back,
I can't do that.

669
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,101
I can't.

670
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,403
Why?

671
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:40,603
Eric didn't really know who
I was to him when he was alive.

672
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:43,200
He could care less
that I was there last time.

673
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:46,503
He's not gonna care
if I'm there this time.

674
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm not taking care of him again.

675
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,401
- Well, you don't have to...
- Oh, believe me, I would.

676
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:53,302
It's what he does.

677
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,500
Did.

678
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,900
He gets people to take care of him,

679
00:36:57,005 --> 00:37:00,601
but he never returns the favor.

680
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:03,300
You know, uh, maybe we should
talk again some other time.

681
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:06,402
You know, my brother was
a selfish bastard.

682
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,102
I gave up everything for him.

683
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:10,702
My mom died, I raised him.

684
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:15,600
My dad died, I skipped college so he
wouldn't have to go into foster care.

685
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:19,403
This store, this is his dream,
not mine.

686
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,401
But I put everything I had
into it to make it work,

687
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:25,603
and he could care less.

688
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:26,601
That's who he was.

689
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:30,400
So why do you keep doing it?

690
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:34,200
Because he was my brother.

691
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:37,400
And because he had something.

692
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:40,202
I don't know, when you
were in his good graces,

693
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:43,403
you felt like you were really...

694
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:46,100
really special.

695
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:48,400
You know, I kept thinking that, um...

696
00:37:48,506 --> 00:37:54,903
if he could see how much I loved him
that maybe one day he would love me back.

697
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,500
I mean, we're all the family we have.

698
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:02,600
But then he just goes
and dies on me.

699
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:08,302
I just wanted to know that
I counted for something with him.

700
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:12,502
But he took that with him
when he died.

701
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,401
So no,

702
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:18,301
no, I am not gonna be there for Eric

703
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:23,001
or whoever the hell he's gonna be
when he comes back.

704
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:25,402
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.

705
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:28,003
Me, too.

706
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:41,002
So it's you.

707
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:44,102
I'm coming back to you.

708
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:48,203
Don't fight it, Eric.
Just don't.

709
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:51,300
But I heard Jim say
you didn't want a child.

710
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:52,203
Not yet.

711
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,002
I didn't think I was ready,

712
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:59,801
but if this is what's supposed
to happen, then I'll get ready.

713
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:05,001
How can you be like that?

714
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,501
Like what?

715
00:39:11,605 --> 00:39:13,901
So generous with yourself.

716
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:17,100
Look, I know how important
it is for you to move on.

717
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:20,001
To not have to live
another life, so...

718
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,700
Jim and I are going to do
the right thing by you, Eric.

719
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:27,000
I heard everything you and Jim
said last night.

720
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:28,603
So?

721
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:34,300
I haven't had a conversation
like that in any of my lifetimes.

722
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:38,402
I've never listened to anyone the way
you guys listen to each other.

723
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:42,702
I've never cared what anyone wanted.

724
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:47,600
I saw how much you wanted
to have that kid,

725
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:51,903
and I saw how scared
you were by him.

726
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:56,502
But you're willing to do it
not for you...

727
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,501
for me.

728
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,601
So I'm not gonna fight it.

729
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:06,302
I'm not gonna do anything
to get in the way.

730
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:10,902
I'll come back again...

731
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:14,701
and I'll do it for you.

732
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,700
Maybe I'll get it right this time

733
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:21,101
and you'll help me.

734
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:24,102
We'll help you, Eric.

735
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,001
We both will.

736
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:33,902
I don't know if you're gonna remember
any of this when you're born, but...

737
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:38,403
we're gonna take
really good care of you.

738
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:40,403
And we'll teach you
the best that we can,

739
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:45,900
and we'll try to make sure
that this is your last time around.

740
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:49,003
I know you will.

741
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,802
I see it.

742
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:58,001
I see the light.

743
00:40:58,108 --> 00:41:00,503
You've seen it before.

744
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,701
Not as beautiful.

745
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,301
I feel like it wants me to come.

746
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:07,502
I don't understand.

747
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:12,300
I don't feel like
anything's holding me back.

748
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,001
What does that mean?

749
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:17,102
I see my father.

750
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:21,503
I see my dad.

751
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,700
I see all my dads.

752
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:29,001
They want me to come.

753
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:34,302
They want me to come.

754
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:42,800
But I'll stay.

755
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:47,700
I'll go through another life...

756
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,000
for you.

757
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:55,700
If that's what you want,
I'll do that.

758
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,200
I know.

759
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:04,202
That's why you can go.

760
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:08,302
You sure?

761
00:42:09,306 --> 00:42:14,302
There's just one more thing
you have to do for me.

762
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,303
Eric?

763
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:31,901
He's here.

764
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,401
He's right beside you.

765
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:38,503
He has his hand on your shoulder.

766
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,700
He wants to tell you everything...

767
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:47,102
that you meant to him.

768
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:32,303
It's negative.

769
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:37,200
Who knows if I was even pregnant
in the first place.

770
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:40,202
I'm not sure how I feel.

771
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:43,003
Me neither.

772
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,601
I do know one thing.

773
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,101
What?

774
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm ready.

775
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,100
No matter what's ahead for us,

776
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:56,501
I'm ready to go down
any road with you...

777
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:59,201
go through any door.

778
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,800
I know that now

779
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:04,200
more than I ever did.

780
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:07,803
That's all I need.
