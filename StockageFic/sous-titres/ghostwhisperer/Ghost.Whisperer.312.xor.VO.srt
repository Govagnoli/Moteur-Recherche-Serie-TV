1
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,230
Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,415
Yeah? Yeah.

3
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,590
We've got an apartment fire on town square.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

4
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,780
Pull that hose, set the
master stream on top.

5
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,905
Hey, will.

6
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,175
What was it, gas?

7
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,445
Yeah, most likely.

8
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,940
Looks like a couple floors
collapsed on themselves.

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,095
Better get in there.

10
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,580
Yeah, we will, as soon as we
get the word that it's stable.

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,445
Anybody left in the building?

12
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,800
don't know until we get inside

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,200
That's it, let's go.

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,480
Anyone in here?

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,235
Ok, if anybody can hear
us, make a sound. Please!

16
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,590
Make a sound!

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,695
help me.

18
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,050
Will, I got one.

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,095
Hey, how you doing?

20
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:42,950
How is he?

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,350
Get me out of here.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,245
I ca-can't feel anything.

23
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:48,275
Take it easy. Keep breathing.

24
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,035
We're gonna get you out of here.

25
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,390
Jim, get this one. Got it?

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,630
Lift up the beam.
- All right.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,965
It's not going, it's not going.

28
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,045
Come on!

29
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:04,455
It's not moving.

30
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,330
That's fine, that's fine.

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,080
We're gonna get you out
of here. Come on, ready?

32
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,405
Damn it, come on!

33
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,755
Jim, jim, we got another one! We got two!

34
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,330
We need more men, we got a guy trapped!

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,030
I never stopped. Never.

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,000
We'll get you out.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,195
Look, I need more men. I got
a guy trapped in here. Please.

38
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,565
Send them in.

39
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:38,525
Are you ok?

40
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,165
Unstable, evacuate now.

41
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:43,265
I repeat, you must evacuate now.
- Jim!

42
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:44,850
I'll be right back.

43
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,725
Jim...
- what?

44
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:47,755
They're calling us out.

45
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,405
The building's too
unstable. It's coming down.

46
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,165
But we
can't leave-

47
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,055
we gotta go, it's too unstable!

48
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,055
Damn! Can he move?

49
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:55,900
Yeah, I think so.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,300
Take him, take him.

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,730
Grab his legs.

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,970
All right, go. Let's go.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,800
Move, move, move, move, move!

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,650
We've got a live one coming out!
There's still a guy in there.

55
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,251
what?
- I have go back in there, come on!

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,685
It was clear. It was obvious.

57
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,025
The guy under the beam, he was gonna
die the minute they took it off of him.

58
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,685
He was half-dead already
when I got to him.

59
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,375
So you did the right thing.

60
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,835
You know, the guy, he's sitting up.

61
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,305
He's looking around, he
knows what's going on.

62
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,655
I only have time to get one guy.

63
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,680
I have to make the call who's
got the better shot. I mean...

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,905
I had to.

65
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,260
Exactly.

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,035
Then why do I feel like I
just condemned a man to death?

67
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,615
Like I should have saved them both.

68
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,970
Because you're you.

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,480
That's why I love you.

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,225
A man's life was saved tonight.

71
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,445
Thanks to you.

72
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,995
Hey, medic.

73
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,835
We've got half a dozen people coming in.

74
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,245
We're shorthanded in the E. R.

75
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,625
Can you help us out?

76
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,370
Jim: Yeah, I just gotta
scrub up. I'll be right in.

77
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,400
The man who was under the
beam, what was he wearing?

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,410
A bathrobe, I think.

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,295
Don't even tell me...
- no. Go.

80
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:39,650
All right.

84
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,980
Leaving that guy behind
was the right thing.

85
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,995
Yeah, that's what
everybody keeps telling me.

86
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,325
Decisions like that
get made all the time.

87
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,165
You don't ask for them, but
you have to make the call.

88
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:46,740
All you can do is focus
on the ones you can save.

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,855
You're good.

90
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,125
So are you.

91
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,955
Be sure of yourself, that's important.

92
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,070
I'm not sure what I'm sure about.

93
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,645
Even applying to med school.

94
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:59,000
Pressure on that right there.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,930
Mid-life career change?

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,750
I prefer to think of it as maybe a third
of the way through my life career change.

97
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,630
It's not easy, I know.

98
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,670
Did you do something before this?

99
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,680
doesn't matter. Just
retract that right there.

100
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,055
Ok, guys, thanks.

101
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:19,495
We'll take it from here.

102
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,770
Thank you.

103
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,220
What are you doing?

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,130
You need to be a little
more careful, nurse.

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,620
sorry.

106
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,015
Melinda: So the guy who was
left behind didn't make it?

107
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,255
Yeah.

108
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,365
Died in the building collapse.

109
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:51,275
I'm really sorry.

110
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,690
I just wish there was
something I could do.

111
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,025
Yeah.

112
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,360
I just can't get his
face out of my head.

113
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,835
Well... I know I asked, but you didn't
see his ghost in the hospital, did you?

114
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,225
I mean, he's not haunting me?

115
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,735
Well, there's always
ghosts in the hospital.

116
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,185
You know that.

117
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:07,915
Can't tell who's who.

118
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah, there was just something
weird happening in the E. R.

119
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,370
Look...

120
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,195
if his ghost was around, could
I talk to himth rough you?

121
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:25,160
I mean, just to explain
what happened, why.

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,005
I guess.

123
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:31,085
I mean, sometimes ghosts get angry, and...

124
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:35,050
anyway, you're not being haunted, so
don't even worry about it.

125
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,165
Well, I'm gonna hit the shower.

126
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:39,845
Do you want tea or juice or something?

127
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:41,435
Scotch would be better.

128
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,790
Juice is good.

129
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,875
Do you want this in there or by the bed?

130
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,230
Jim: In here, please.

131
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,370
When the curtain closes, people die.

132
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,325
Are you ok?

133
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:42,285
Uh, yeah. I just, um...

134
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,885
I thought you were in
the shower. Duh. Careful.

135
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,240
There's glass everywhere.

136
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,225
Look, I don't know if you're
here, or if you're even listening,

137
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:07,920
but I t ow thaknyou must be really
angry about the way things turned out.

138
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,410
I can help you if you'll let me.

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,540
You have to understand that
my husband wanted to save you,

140
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,400
he just couldn't, and it's not his fault.

141
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,100
See, he's really torn up about things, and I just
think if you blame him, he may never get over it.

142
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,255
You see, he's got a lot to deal with it.

143
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:33,670
I mean, just being married
to me, that's a lot to...

144
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,180
anyway, I know that you've been through
something very bad, and I just want to...

145
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,445
joe?

146
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:48,150
Joe grimaldi?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,895
Melinda, right? Jim clancy's wife.

148
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:53,445
Yeah, we met a few years ago.

149
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,245
Do you still run the vfw?

150
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,935
I volunteer there. Now I
have a landscaping business.

151
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,290
You know, I keep busy.

152
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,090
Did you lose someone in the building?

153
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,730
My brother.

154
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,175
They said he was trapped in there.

155
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:14,830
The hospital said he was alive when they
got to him, but they couldn't get him out.

156
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,880
Your brother?

157
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,430
I just had to come here.

158
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,605
I don't know why, I...

159
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:26,935
I just wanted to see all
this for myself, I guess.

160
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,475
What was your brother's name?

161
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,055
Vince.

162
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,410
I'm so sorry.

163
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,930
Were the two of you close?

164
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,810
Well, as close as you can be, I guess.

165
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,955
No. I guess we weren'T.

166
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:46,310
It was my fault.

167
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,835
What if you could change all that?

168
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:52,975
What would you do if you could
just talk to him one more time?

169
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,830
What?

170
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,610
Look, I know how this
is going to sound...

171
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,755
but I see spirits.

172
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,465
I can talk to them.

173
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:06,325
I can help them cross over, and
your brother is still here.

174
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:08,095
He's an earth-bound spirit.

175
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,795
My brother's a ghost?
- Yes.

176
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:14,405
And jim, my husband, he was the
paramedic who found him last night,

177
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:17,695
and he wanted to save him so badly,

178
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,765
but I just think your brother's
coming after him now, because

179
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,890
he blames
him- - look!

180
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,585
I don't want to hear any of this.

181
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,305
I don't know what it is
you're trying to sell me.

182
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,485
Please, just hear me out!

183
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,785
It's not funny, you know?

184
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:33,280
To mess with people's emotions like this, or
whatever the hell it is you're trying to do.

185
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,510
It's not right.

186
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,910
Joe, please...

187
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,675
************

188
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:48,235
Do you remember me?

189
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,730
Jim, right?

190
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,715
The future doctor.

191
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,005
Feeling better?

192
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:53,895
Well, that's debatable.

193
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,185
Hey, I wanted to ask you, the guy
I had to leave in a building,

194
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:57,875
where you here when they brought him in?

195
00:11:57,975 --> 00:11:59,775
Yeah, he was D. O. A.

196
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,360
But they kept him in the E. R. Until
they reached the next of kin.

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,915
Look, I don'T...

198
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,305
I want to try to talk to his
family and explain what happened.

199
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:10,725
I don't think the hospital's
gonna release that.

200
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,840
Yeah, uh...

201
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,500
that's why I wanted to ask you.

202
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,615
Don't do this.

203
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,335
You know every cliche about not getting
emotionally involved with the patients.

204
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:23,545
Yeah, I know all about that, but
I'll tell you, if it was me,

205
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,465
if it was my family, I'd want
to know exactly what happened.

206
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,945
You know, why decisions were made.

207
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,465
This isn't about that guy's family.

208
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,105
You want to make yourself feel better.

209
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,725
You want them to look
you in the eye and say,

210
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,320
"it's ok, we don't hold it against you. "

211
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,685
Ok. Maybe.

212
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:43,790
But you can't tell me that family wouldn't want to
talk to the last person that saw their son alive.

213
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,505
Jim, you can't do this.

214
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,165
Take it from me, you have
to be able to let go.

215
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:49,785
You do your job, you do your
best, but you have to move on.

216
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,145
You have to put up the walls.

217
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:53,500
Otherwise...

218
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,235
otherwise you'll lose yourself.

219
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,985
Just move on, save the next patient.

220
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,935
You have a lot more wins than losses.

221
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:03,290
You can't
let the-

222
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,015
hey, hey, what are you doing?

223
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,730
I don't know!
I- I can't-

224
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,990
*******

225
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,755
Are you ok? What happened?

226
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,480
I don't know.

227
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,020
I- I don't know what happened.

228
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,525
I'm sorry, it...

229
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,045
it was some sort of spasm.

230
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,255
Now, look.

231
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,345
Do not be sorry.

232
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,900
Don't be sorry. This-this
had nothing to do with you.

233
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,150
You better...

234
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,710
you gonna be all right?

235
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,070
Jim: Are you here, huh? I wish I knew.

236
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,555
I don't even know if
you can hear me, but...

237
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,145
I want to tell you that I'm sorry.

238
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,865
If there was anything else, I could have
tried, if there was any way to save you,

239
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:06,170
I would have done it, I promise.

240
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,175
But you...

241
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:15,805
you were so badly hurt.

242
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:19,950
I knew you were gonna die, I
could see it in your eyes.

243
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,015
Leaving you there...

244
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:27,310
like that was the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

245
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm not real good at this.

246
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,595
My wife would know what to say to you.

247
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:40,115
She knows how to handle grief.

248
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,045
She knows how to handle loss.

249
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:44,505
Me, not so much.

250
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,180
For so many people...

251
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,480
she knows how to make a difference.

252
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,590
I'm not sure I do, in the
grand scheme of things, but...

253
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,690
Look, for whatever its worth,

254
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,965
Accept my apology for what it is.

255
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:13,745
If you want to punish me, here I am.

256
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:19,165
But do not take it out
on the people around me,

257
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,750
or the people I love.

258
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,690
Jim, I'm home.
- That's her.

259
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,670
Honey, I'll be down in a minute.

260
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,285
Miranda: Look, I know that
you have no reason to,

261
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,695
but I really need you
to take a leap of faith.

262
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,890
I know that you'd want your brother to
be at peace, and you can help him do that.

263
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,025
When I left you last night, I did something
I haven't done in probably 30 years.

264
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,260
What?

265
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,850
I cried like a baby.

266
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,800
This isn't just about not
believing in ghosts, is it?

267
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,640
The truth is...

268
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,080
I was a lousy brother.

269
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,225
I did things.

270
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,620
Things that I'm ashamed of.

271
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,455
About a month or so
ago, I sent vince a letter.

272
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:21,795
I- I tried
to explain.

273
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,790
I- I asked him
to forgive me.

274
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,525
I didn't hear back.

275
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,705
Yeah, but this could be your chance
to do it in person- kind of.

276
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:34,245
If it's true, and
vince is out there-

277
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:39,315
look, I could stand here all day and talk to you about
unfinished business and the importance of closure,

278
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,635
but there's much more at stake.

279
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:45,880
I really believe that your brother's
ghost is trying to hurt my husband.

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,540
You're the only one that can help me.

281
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,555
Ghosts usually come
back to where they died.

282
00:16:54,655 --> 00:17:00,580
Your brother knows that I can see him, so
if he senses me here, maybe he'll come to me.

283
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,130
If you're here, I brought
someone to talk to you.

284
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,160
Please.

285
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,455
He's here.

286
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:30,810
Just speak from your
heart. He can hear you.

287
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,550
I- I, uh, I really don't know how
to do all this, where to start.

288
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,250
If you're really here...

289
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,780
I just want to say I'm sorry.

290
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,705
It's not like you went out
of your way to stay in touch,

291
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,840
I mean, I don't know why you
couldn't pick up the phone.

292
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,560
Yeah.

293
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,465
I guess none of that matters.

294
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:07,370
The thing is, vince, I owe you an apology.

295
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,345
When we had that big
fight that christmas,

296
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:14,745
I said things I shouldn't have
said; things I didn't really mean;

297
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,785
things that changed
everything between us.

298
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:21,915
If I could take it all back, I would.

299
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,085
I sent you that letter.

300
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:29,380
When I didn't get an answer, I figured you
were through with me, and I didn't blame you.

301
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,020
Anyway...

302
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,930
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

303
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,040
Please.

304
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,480
Is there anything you want to say?

305
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,395
Yeah, who is this guy?

306
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:52,455
Your brother.

307
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,865
I don't have a brother.

308
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,635
Well?

309
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,160
Does he forgive me?

310
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,165
Didn't you die in the building collapse?

311
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:05,905
What building collapse?

312
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,245
What's going on?

313
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,695
Well, if you didn't die in a building
collapse, then why are you haunting my husband?

314
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,915
I can care less about your husband.

315
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,475
She's the one I want.

316
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:18,290
She's the one who killed me.

317
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,150
What's going on?

318
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,235
knownthis couldn't be real.

319
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,615
Look, it is real, ok?

320
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:38,715
I just made a mix-up
and I'm really sorry!

321
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:41,855
So what? I just poured my heart out
to some dead guy I don't even know.

322
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:45,245
Look, it means that your brother crossed
over right away; that he's at peace, ok?

323
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,145
That's a good thing!

324
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,700
Well, maybe he's at peace, but I'm not.

325
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,825
So it wasn't his brother.

326
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,135
It was another guy altogether.

327
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,855
The good news is, the ghost that I thought
was haunting you wasn't haunting you.

328
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:03,210
The bad news-
- wait a minute.

329
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,025
Wait a minute, back up here, mel.

330
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,715
You told me in the hospital that you
thought there was not a ghost haunting me.

331
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,055
Well, you know what, you
were really upset,

332
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:13,635
and I just didn't want to add to it by
telling you there was an angry ghost-

333
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:14,875
I just wanted to talk to this guy.

334
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,285
I wanted to tell him how sorry I was.

335
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:17,865
This ghost was not in the mood to talk.

336
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,365
He's all about revenge.

337
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,825
Mel, this is wrong, ok?

338
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:21,825
I don't need to be protected.

339
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,105
I don't need to be treated like a child.

340
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,805
I was not treating you like a child.

341
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,565
I was actually looking out for
you a little, like you do for me.

342
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:29,765
You don't let me look out for you.

343
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:32,395
But here I am, trying to find the next
of kin of this guy, somebody to talk to.

344
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:33,825
You're talking to his
brother behind my back.

345
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:34,815
It wasn't his brother.

346
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:37,170
So what?

347
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,035
Look, I know that I screwed up here, and
we will talk about this later. Ok?

348
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,665
But for right now, I've really
got to get a pen in this thing.

349
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,805
I mean, this ghost is haunting
some nurse at driscoll.

350
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:51,045
Um, jennifer quinlan.

351
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:53,065
He says that she killed him.

352
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:53,985
What?

353
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,065
Wait, is that credible? Is that true?

354
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:55,875
I don't know.

355
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:59,745
I mean, he's been very confused and a little
hard to figure out, but I did get a name.

356
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:01,565
Peter. Peter harrison.

357
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:02,815
Wait, I know this nurse, ok?

358
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,135
She's solid. She's solid.

359
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:05,655
What's happening here
is what happened to me.

360
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,825
She had a patient, dheied, he's
blaming her.

361
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:10,355
Well, I need to check online
and see if I can find anything.

362
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:14,090
In the meantime, can you please just check
on jennifer and how peter harrison died?

363
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,125
Yeah.

364
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,085
Yeah, I'll check on her when I go in.

365
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,505
We'll talk about the rest of this later.

366
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:22,860
Whatever you want.

367
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,345
Callin' it a night?

368
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:36,325
Yeah.

369
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,680
Just worked a double.

370
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,005
So how are you liking grandview?

371
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:43,635
Oh, it's ok.

372
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,990
A little provincial, maybe.

373
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,235
I'm still getting my bearings.

374
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,590
Yeah? Where'd you work before?

375
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,285
I moved around a lot.

376
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,590
Been a bit of a gypsy.
- Oh, yeah?

377
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,990
But always hospitals, huh?

378
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,720
Are you doing my bio?

379
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,585
Uh, yeah, look, I'm sorry.

380
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:05,115
This is gonna sound a little
weird, but, um, I came across a name.

381
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,515
A patient I was wondering
if you might know.

382
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:09,870
Um, peter harrison.

383
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,415
What is it you want to know?

384
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,395
I want to know if you
know if this patient died,

385
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:19,810
and if there were any circumstances surrounding
his death that were a little strange.

386
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,125
You remember how I told you how important it
was not to get personally involved with patients?

387
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:27,125
Yeah.

388
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:30,570
Well, I wasn't always good
at taking my own advice.

389
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,245
Peter harrison was a patient
of mine at my old job,

390
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:40,075
and he was very sick, and I
came to care for him very much.

391
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,210
Too much.

392
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,050
And when he died, well, I
was just wrecked.

393
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,120
I felt helpless and alone, and I knew
I should have never let it go that far.

394
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,655
So you quit?

395
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:59,710
I wanted to start over some place where I didn't
know anybody, where maybe I would never know anybody.

396
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,585
Nothing

397
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:03,665
What did you think?

398
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:06,175
Nothing. I'm sorry.

399
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,530
I was just curious.

400
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,095
Well, I should probably get going.

401
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,450
Yeah. Good-bye.

402
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,935
No, don't!

403
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,290
Please don'T.

404
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,210
When the curtain closed, I died.

405
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,790
Did someone kill you?

406
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,645
Was it the nurse, nurse quinlan?

407
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:46,325
No. It was my doctor.

408
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,445
Doctor sutherland.

409
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:50,855
No. No!

410
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:53,210
Please don't!

411
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,550
Jim... come on in, bud.

412
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,210
Thanks.
- Yeah.

413
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,040
Well, listen...

414
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,675
I got nothin'.

415
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,955
You mean like nothing suspicious?

416
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,535
No, I mean like nothing like in nothing.

417
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:24,245
6 months ago, jennifer quinlan, she shows
up in grandview, rents an apartment,

418
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:27,585
puts all her paperwork through the
dmv, and the next thing you know,

419
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,235
she's got a job at the
driscoll county medical center.

420
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,590
All right, but what about before that?

421
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,805
Jim, I
got-nothing.

422
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,225
It's like she dropped out of the sky.

423
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:40,305
I mean, she's got a fake social security
number, yeah, but no other documentation of any kind.

424
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,735
I mean, not in driscoll
county, not in the northeast.

425
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,960
It's like she's got no
past, like she's a ghost.

426
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,150
She can't be all bad.

427
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,365
She does volunteer work.

428
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,720
Where?

429
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,510
You're gonna let her do this again?

430
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,270
Jennifer: Can I help you?

431
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,805
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:47,745
Do I know you?

433
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:50,330
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

434
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,110
All this from a bumper.

435
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,660
NO RESULTE FOUND

436
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,400
Jim?

437
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,620
Jim?

438
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,790
What are you doing here?

439
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,510
Just looking for you, dr. Sutherland.

440
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,225
You want to talk to me?

441
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:41,015
Wait a minute.

442
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:44,760
Nora, talk to me about peter harrison.

443
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,025
Or were there others?

444
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,705
Like peter harrison's father?

445
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,660
You shouldn't stick your nose
into other people's business, jim.

446
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,145
I just need this ghost to come to me.

447
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:03,545
I need something more credible, you know?

448
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:05,445
Something I can actually
go to the police with.

449
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:09,175
Yeah, but why would the ghost come to
you if it was haunting dr. Sutherland?

450
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,705
I don't know. Probably because he knows
that I'm the only one who can see him.

451
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:15,225
There was no suspicion, no
investigation of the san diego hospital?

452
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:16,105
Not that I could find.

453
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,890
She quit, and nobody ever saw her again.

454
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,455
I just came from the hospital and
jennifer, nora sutherland, whoever she is,

455
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,895
didn't show up for her shift, her phone's not
picking up, and she hasn't returned any of her pages.

456
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:28,855
She skipped town.

457
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,605
Yeah, but what if the
ghost skipped with her?

458
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:35,105
I mean, what if she just shows up in a new
city with a new identity and kills more people?

459
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:37,215
There's not a damn thing
we can do without proof.

460
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,075
Ok. You know what?

461
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:40,295
I need to go home and try
something. Do you mind?

462
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:42,205
No, no, go. Go do what you have to do.

463
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:45,105
I promise I'll give you, like, a
month off when this is over.

464
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,460
Call me.
- I will.

465
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,005
I really need to talk to you.

466
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:03,450
The doctor that killed
you, dr. Nora sutherland,

467
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,390
probably at sisters of angels
hospital in san diego...

468
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,850
I really need to know what happened.

469
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,760
Any details that I
could give the police.

470
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,075
Dr. Sutherland, did she
treat your father, also?

471
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,745
My father? I don't think so.

472
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,135
Look, you may not be the only
person that she did this to,

473
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:33,160
and she could do it again, so
please, you have to try-

474
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,595
I remember getting sick.

475
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:38,270
I was in the hospital for a long time.

476
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,455
We've ruled out a bunch of
things, which is good news,

477
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:44,715
but we're still going to have to
work you up some more tomorrow.

478
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:47,165
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

479
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:49,335
I'm gonna be with you on
this every step of the way.

480
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:53,440
I started, like, getting
confused, feeling lost.

481
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,570
She was there every day for me.

482
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,570
I fell in love with her.

483
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,115
She made me feel so young, just
like I could do anything.

484
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:11,930
So what happened?

485
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,855
I don't know.

486
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:15,545
Please. You have to try.

487
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,900
No, I do know.

488
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,270
Well, one night she came to me...

489
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,915
I was so sick that night.

490
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:27,660
I couldn't even speak, I was helpless.

491
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,160
The thing is, like, I
still feel love for her,

492
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,305
even now, remembering all this.

493
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,995
I just-I want to know why, how
she could do this to me.

494
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:48,565
Peter, I really need you to concentrate.

495
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:52,840
I need you to see dr. Sutherland, and
I need you to tell me where she is.

496
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,020
The bus station.

497
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,635
Yeah, I'm heading to the bus station.

498
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:04,300
It'll probably be the first day
that bus is actually on time.

499
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,355
Jim: Hey, did you ask if the
other ghost is his father?

500
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,025
There is no other ghost.

501
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,205
Wait a minute...

502
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:13,555
both ghosts, same guy.

503
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:16,210
I'll explain it later. Bye.

504
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,935
No, don't walk away! Talk to me.

505
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:36,290
It's time for you to do the right thing.

506
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,175
Peter harrison told me that you
injected something into his I. V. Drip,

507
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:43,790
that you closed the curtains
and that you killed him.

508
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,070
I did it.

509
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,940
I killed pete.
- Why?

510
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,370
Because he begged me to.

511
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,005
Isonwas an older man, right?

512
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,455
Are you really saying
you've seen his ghost?

513
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,795
He kept coming to me as a young man.

514
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:18,150
He was really confused, and then...

515
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,755
then he told me that
you made him feel young,

516
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:27,390
so I figured out that's why I saw him as
his younger self, ghosts sometimes do that.

517
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,150
He was 78.

518
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,600
End stage alzheimer's and a lot of other
problems. He was with us for months.

519
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,260
He had no family, he
outlived all of his friends.

520
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,260
He was truly alone in
the world. He just...

521
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,585
I don't know, he had this spark.

522
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,740
He had this amazing life, and
adventures all over the world.

523
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,455
Sometimes he would forget he was old.

524
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:59,100
He really believed he was a young
man, with everything in front of him.

525
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,755
I never knew anyone like that before.

526
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:05,025
I had spent my whole life
obsessed with my career.

527
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,055
I moved through the
world with blinders on.

528
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:11,930
I never once stopped to look at life
the way this crazy, sick old man did.

529
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,035
And I never looked at
it the same way again.

530
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:19,300
We became dependant on each other.

531
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,610
I shouldn't have still been his doctor,

532
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,330
but I didn't trust anyone
else to be with him.

533
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,115
Then things got harder.

534
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,925
The disease progressed, and he sort of...

535
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:36,375
withdrew into some place in his
head where I couldn't reach him.

536
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,135
I knew he was suffering.

537
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:41,120
I knew he hated what
was happening to him.

538
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,840
One night...

539
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,460
All of a sudden, it got real clear.

540
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,510
Let me go.

541
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,100
Make this stop.

542
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,320
Please. Kill me.

543
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,130
I saw so much suffering
every day in that hospital.

544
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,690
Good-bye.

545
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,440
I held his hand while he died.

546
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,465
And then I felt the most awful guilt.

547
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:00,445
I realized I had violated my oath.

548
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:03,320
I had no right to do what I did.

549
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,375
I didn't think I deserved to be a
doctor anymore, so I started over.

550
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:11,480
Or at least I tried to.

551
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,850
You did what I asked you to do.

552
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,560
And I loved you for it.

553
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,560
Listen, peter's still here.

554
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,395
His spirit is with us right now.

555
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,495
I blamed her.

556
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:33,580
At the last second, I-
I became so afraid.

557
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,770
Afraid of dying.

558
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,050
And after I was dead, I
couldn't remember why...

559
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,445
except her giving me that injection.

560
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:49,070
He wants you to know how
confused he was when he died.

561
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,475
He thinks I killed him.

562
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:53,755
Murdered him!

563
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,845
But now he knows what really happened.

564
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:59,380
He knows that you were
just trying to help him.

565
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,855
Peter, if you can hear me, I am so sorry.

566
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:07,765
I never should have done it.

567
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,955
You gave me so much.

568
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:15,965
Tell her how much she
gave me just by listening.

569
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:18,320
Just by...

570
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,840
by being there.

571
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,520
I couldn't have had a better friend.

572
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,095
She made those last few months so rich.

573
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:31,785
He wants you to know
how much you gave him.

574
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:35,120
Having you as a friend made
his last months so rich.

575
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,960
Having you for a friend
made my life so rich, pete.

576
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,090
I'll never forget you.

577
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,540
I... I think I have to go now.

578
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,830
So many old friends waiting
for me right over there.

579
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,445
He's ready to cross over now.

580
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,800
Does that mean I'll never...

581
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,030
That he'll never be near me again?

582
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,940
No!

583
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,840
Tell her I'll watch over
her like a father would.

584
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,500
The way she watched over me.

585
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,095
He said you'll always be
like a daughter to him.

586
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,930
He'll always be watching over you.

587
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,625
I guess I have to go back
and own up now, don't I?

588
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:42,040
What do you think?

589
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,240
Jim, I'm sorry.

590
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,035
That I held things back from you.

591
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,585
And I know that you don't
need to be protected.

592
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:09,345
I just feel like I make your
life so complicated sometimes,

593
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:13,700
and I was trying to spare you of any
more stress than I already bring you.

594
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,080
You don't bring me any stress, mel.

595
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,350
Ok, maybe a little. But...

596
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,745
I can't think of a smaller price to
pay for everything else you bring me.

597
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,100
Really?
- Yeah.

598
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,320
You're not gonna get fed up and dump me for one
of those girls who only sees ghosts in the movies?

599
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,630
I'd be bored out my
skull in about 10 minutes.

600
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:51,970
I know how much it would have meant to you to talk
to a relative of the man that died in that building.

601
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,635
Yeah.

602
00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:58,020
There's your chance.

603
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,005
Joe grimaldi?

604
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,360
He's the brother.

605
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,350
I can't tell you how much I
wanted to get out of there...

606
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,885
to save him, but he was trapped, and
he was really badly hurt.

607
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:23,480
And the other guy was going to live.

608
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,430
I had to make the choice.

609
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,250
He wasn't going to make
it, no matter what, huh?

610
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,930
No.

611
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,705
If it helps any, he wasn't in any pain.

612
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:37,895
I mean, he wasn't suffering.

613
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,450
I don't think he had any feeling.

614
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm sorry, joe.

615
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,035
Did he...

616
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:48,925
say anything, my brother?

617
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:52,825
No, he wasn't making much sense.
You know, they're- no, I'm wrong.

618
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:55,130
He did say something.

619
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,660
He said,"I never stopped. Never. "

620
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,310
Joe?
- Does that mean something to you?

621
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,810
I sent my brother a letter asking him to
forgive me for the things I said to him.

622
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,810
And the last thing I
wrote in that letter was...

623
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,300
"I wouldn't blame you if you
stopped loving me a long time ago. "

624
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,255
Do you think that means that...

625
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:33,670
yes. He forgave you.

626
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,410
And you were the last thing he
was thinking about when he died.

627
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,250
I feel like 100 pounds lighter.

628
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,220
Like everything is... is ok.

629
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,750
Just thanks. Thanks, ok?

630
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,080
No problem.

631
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,200
Congratulations.

632
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,440
You just made it through your
first crossing over. Sort of.

633
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,490
That's a feeling. I mean...

634
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:25,405
just to know you brought somebody
a little peace, even by accident.

635
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:30,530
Look, um, I don't want you to ever feel
like you don't make a difference...

636
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,065
or that I could make more
of a difference than you.

637
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:37,355
Sometimes it's just
about the little things;

638
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:40,220
the things that you
do day in and day out.

639
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,620
The things that you do every single day.

640
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,315
That's what makes a real
difference in the world.

641
00:43:48,415 --> 00:43:50,855
You heard me talking to
that ghost, didn't you?

642
00:43:50,955 --> 00:43:53,210
A little.

643
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,160
Let's go home.
