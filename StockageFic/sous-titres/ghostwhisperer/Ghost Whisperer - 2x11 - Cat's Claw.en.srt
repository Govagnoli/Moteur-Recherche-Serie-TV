1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,500
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm married,

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,900
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,100
I might be just like you

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,900
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,600
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,500
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,300
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:40,005
In order to te you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,706
I am frozen.

14
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,901
I think it's gonna snow.

15
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:09,701
How did we buy all this
in one trip?

16
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:11,100
Whoo! Teamwork.

17
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,901
I don't even remember
what we bought.

18
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,002
Oh. I just hope you don't remember
what we spent.

19
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:18,101
That I'm gonna remember
for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,101
Oh, my gosh. I'm just glad
that it's over.

21
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,502
Oh. Um, actually, it's not.

22
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,203
The groceries are in the back.

23
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:26,702
I knew that.

24
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:27,601
You want my help?

25
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:28,903
No, but I could use a drink.

26
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,101
- Oh. Something hot?
- Uh, not for the cold.

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,803
For the bills.

28
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,303
Right.

29
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,402
It's raining outside.
Can you believe this?

30
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:27,501
Is this a mosquito?

31
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,700
This time of year?

32
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,801
Wow. All right.

33
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,903
Global warming has come to Grandview at...

34
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,502
9:53 P.M.

35
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,802
You ok?

36
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:47,003
I just feel hot all the sudden.
I'm gonna go change.

37
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,403
Yeah. That's a mosquito.

38
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,803
EPISODE 2x11
Cat's Claw

39
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:51,101
All I did was walk into our room,
and all of the sudden,

40
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:55,103
I was in the middle of a jungle
with vines and yellow flowers.

41
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,201
It was raining, and there were
bugs crawling all over my feet.

42
00:04:58,306 --> 00:04:59,800
I mean, it was awful.

43
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,103
Maybe it was something you ate.

44
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,701
We were at the same restaurant.

45
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:04,500
Yes, but did not have
the spicy egg roll.

46
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:09,201
Yeah. It was not the egg roll,
and I know a ghost when I see one.

47
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,700
Or a ghost's hands
when I see one.

48
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,701
Have a little ice cream,

49
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,202
help cool you down.

50
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,801
What I want to know is
how a ghost from the jungle

51
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:18,900
made it into our house.

52
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:23,001
The closest I've been to a jungle is
the Central Park Zoo, and I was 10.

53
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:24,702
Hey. Maybe you brought him
back from the mall.

54
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,300
Well, it doesn't matter now
that he knows where I live.

55
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,603
I just hope he's done with me
for the night.

56
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,503
Yeah. Me, too.

57
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:37,202
Man, it's coming down.

58
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,103
Jim.

59
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,601
Morning!

60
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:52,201
Good morning!

61
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:53,900
Hey. I think I struck gold,

62
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,803
but I'm gonna need some help
carrying everything in, ok?

63
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,900
I have a friend who just bought a house
out of probate about a month ago,

64
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:03,203
and apparently, there was a little old
lady who lived in it her whole life,

65
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:05,602
so she got everything
in the house, as well.

66
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,402
I guess there was a whole bunch
of great stuff in the attic,

67
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:09,801
and she knew we worked together,

68
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:13,600
and she wanted to know if we were
interested in consigning any of it,

69
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,601
so I brought a few things down.

70
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,302
This stuff is in amazingly good shape.

71
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,100
I don't know what it is, but I like it.

72
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,500
It's a sextant.

73
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,502
No kidding.
That's what they call that?

74
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,501
I don't kid about sextants.

75
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,401
Hey. I love this.

76
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,600
See, that is definitely you.
You look great in that!

77
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:34,801
Don't I have to be
a tap-dancer to wear this?

78
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:37,903
Ohh! This is beautiful.

79
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,602
This...

80
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,703
is definitely me.

81
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:45,001
She's mine.

82
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,203
Take it off!

83
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,803
Something wrong?

84
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:52,003
- I thought I saw a spider on it.
- Oh, god! Really? Was it big?

85
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,003
Big one.

86
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh. Well, ok.

87
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:57,003
No more old hats for me.

88
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,701
You know what?

89
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:01,503
Um, I have a quick errand to run.
You good here?

90
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,402
Yeah.  Sure.

91
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:08,302
I just want to get this dry-cleaned
before we put it on display.

92
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, god!

93
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,403
Ugh! I hate spiders.

94
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,103
Damn it!

95
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,403
Oh, damn it!

96
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,003
Damn it!

97
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,901
How long have you been standing there?
You know what? It doesn't matter.

98
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:40,502
I don't have time. I have a meeting in
15 minutes, and I can't find my keys,
so make it snappy.

99
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,103
I did not leave my keys there.

100
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:45,302
Ok. Well, I've only got
15 minutes, so...

101
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:49,402
No. I didn't leave my keys in the door.
I never leave my keys in the door.

102
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:52,501
- This is--this is really strange.
- Everyone loses their keys.

103
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,402
I'm not everyone, and I don't
leave my keys in the door.

104
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,303
That's what I'm trying to explain
to you. This is... this...

105
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,702
is that a cake?

106
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,103
No.

107
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,503
Recognize this?

108
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,402
Oh, my god.

109
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,103
What?

110
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,200
It's a hat. 

111
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,403
It's a nice one, too.
I'd say 1940?

112
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,503
How much do you want for it?

113
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,301
That's not why I brought it.

114
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,300
As if I didn't know.

115
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:17,503
No!

116
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,300
What are we afraid of?

117
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,403
- I think it might be Romano's.
- Who's Romano?

118
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:24,201
- The cult leader. The one that you...
- Oh, yeah. Him.

119
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,200
You really thought
it belonged to him, huh?

120
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,102
You  brought this to me, so...

121
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,403
So I could tell you if
it meant anything terrible?

122
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,802
Well, aside from messing up my hair
and giving me headaches,

123
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,490
- hats don't really mean much...
- What's this?

124
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:39,502
Careful!
Don't knock that over.

125
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,901
Congratulations,  Melinda.
You just saved a life.

126
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,402
- Excuse me?
- It's a manikin.

127
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:47,501
It's used to treat sickness by
a shaman, medicine man, witch doctor,

128
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,900
whatever you want to call it.

129
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:52,903
It's placed near a patient, and an
incantation is given by Mr Hocus Pocus.

130
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,500
If this wooden figure is to remain
upright during said incantation,

131
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:59,602
then the patient will live.
They'll recover, but if during

132
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,103
said incantation this
were to fall down...

133
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:08,102
that would mean impending death
or severe drunkenness.

134
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:11,400
- I think I've seen this.
- Really? Where?

135
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,802
A museum, I think.
Where'd you get it?

136
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,703
That was given to me by a member
of the Machiguenga tribe,

137
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,401
which I almost died getting it,
and that's a different story.

138
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,503
Look. I have...
I have really got to go.

139
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,403
I thought you said
that I had 15 minutes.

140
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,400
You're on Payne time, baby.

141
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,002
Professor Payne!

142
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,602
I was 3 weeks in Peru.

143
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:33,800
I was documenting native cultural
traditions for my beloved university.

144
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:37,500
Religious, tribal, symbols,
belief systems, et cetera,

145
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,205
and I came across this practice
called kanaima.

146
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:45,706
It's the mutilation and killing of
enemies and then the consumption
of a rather awful concoction.

147
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,300
Smells terrible, and it's made up
of putrefied human remains,

148
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:51,903
which I accidentally almost ingested.
At least, I think it was accidental.

149
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,802
I prefer to think that they were
trying to assassinate me.

150
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:57,002
It makes for a much more
compelling story. Excuse me.

151
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,703
- Can I just ask you...
- No. You know what?

152
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,800
This I should really...

153
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:03,703
do by myself.

154
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,502
Are you ok?

155
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,900
Are you ok?

156
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,601
And then I turn around, and I am
back in the forest again,

157
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,703
and this manikin falls
right on top of me.

158
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:19,503
A mannequin.

159
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,800
And not one of those James Perse
kind of mannequins in the window
at Neiman Marcus.

160
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:27,102
I'm talking about the kind
of manikin that witch doctors
use to treat sick people.

161
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,000
Did the ghost tell you that?

162
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:32,202
No. Professor Payne,
anyway, all I know

163
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:34,803
is that if it falls over
someone will die.

164
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,802
- Seems like somebody already did.
- No. Not the ghost.

165
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,002
Somebody's going to die.

166
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,400
Hey. You know what
I can't figure?

167
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:42,402
How is it that the ghost of someone
who died in the jungle

168
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,701
ends up in Grandview?

169
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,503
I mean, the jungle's not
exactly down the block.

170
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,303
You know, maybe it was Payne.

171
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:49,101
He said he was in Peru.

172
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,001
Peru has jungle?

173
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:56,003
Yeah. And he does have
the carving in his office.

174
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,500
Maybe it's attached to Payne, huh?

175
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:59,502
I mean, is that where you saw
the ghost, in Payne's office?

176
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,902
No. Down the hall
near the men's restroom.

177
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,301
The ghost is haunting the men's
restroom? That's disgusting.

178
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:08,101
No. Payne was in the restroom,
and the ghost was behind me.

179
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:12,101
Either the ghost followed you,
or it was on campus.

180
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,301
You know, maybe he was student.

181
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,900
Whatever happened to him,
it was really unpleasant.

182
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,603
I mean, every time
he tries to talk,

183
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:21,400
it's just all this blood just
running out of his mouth and...

184
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,502
Hey.

185
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,101
Oh. Sorry.

186
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,602
Hey! This is where I was.

187
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,000
Look!

188
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,700
Definitely not Grandview.

189
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:36,200
No. That is the plant.
That's the thing that the ghost
was holding that cut my hand.

190
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:38,400
- Una de Gato?
- Yeah. Cat's Claw.

191
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,300
It's from the rain forest in South America.

192
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:44,100
"Being studied as a medicinal treatment
for dengue fever, yellow fever, and ebola."

193
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,703
Wow! Those are really the big ones.

194
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,403
You know what? If he caught one of these,
that explains the blood in the mouth.

195
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,600
- They can cause internal hemorrhaging.
- Hey! Listen to this.

196
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:55,802
"Dr. Penn Grogan, one of the experts
on tropical medicinal plant research

197
00:12:55,905 --> 00:13:00,302
brought back these specimens from
the Rockland university research
expedition last summer. "

198
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,601
Bingo.

199
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:10,403
You know, why do I have a really
sinking feeling I know where you're
gonna be tomorrow morning?

200
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:18,700
And the liani is a semidomesticated
plant found in the western amazon basin.

201
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:22,300
Scientific name -
banisteriopsis caapi malpighiaceae.

202
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:26,301
Known locally in Quichua as ayahuasca,
or vine of the soul.

203
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:31,003
This name is given to the plant
by the indigenous people because of
its effectiveness in healing wounds.

204
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:34,401
We harvested several samples
in the urubamba river drainage.

205
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,100
In this same area,
we took samples of kemishitsa,

206
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,003
a very powerful hallucinogenic.

207
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,201
The plant research we're doing
will help find treatments

208
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:46,003
and hopefully cures for some of
humanity's most virulent diseases -

209
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:52,500
marburg, lassa fever, ebola, yellow
fever, dengue fever, and the diseases.

210
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:58,301
The hemorrhagic fevers that...

211
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:13,103
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong.

212
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:24,700
We'll have to continue this
another time. I'm sorry.

213
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,100
Dr Grogan, please,
I need to talk to you.

214
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,402
Not right now, please.

215
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,903
- It will only take a few minutes.
- Not right now, please.

216
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,700
Are you ok?

217
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:03,900
You surprise me!

218
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,000
I saw you in that lecture,
and I thought to myself,

219
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,101
"what interest could she possibly
have in medicinal jungle plants?"

220
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,603
I like flowers.

221
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,401
Really?
Anything in particular?

222
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,600
Una de Gato. What about you?
What flowers do you like?

223
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,403
I don't. I was there for dr. Grogan.
She's a friend.

224
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,202
Is she ok?

225
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,500
Well, she's going through some
personal issues right now, getting

226
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,203
a lot of pressure from the university.
It's very difficult being the top

227
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,103
in one's field, as I very well know.

228
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,002
I thought you said
this was about flowers.

229
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:34,402
I just want to know
if someone died on that expedition.

230
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:37,402
Martin Schaer was one of
our premier research scientists.

231
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:40,402
Great writer.
He wrote a brilliant book.

232
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,200
I have it here somewhere.
Let me tell you something.

233
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,303
This guy had it all. He had
the charisma, the brains, the smarts.

234
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:47,402
Great writer, brilliant professor.
I know what you're thinking.

235
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,403
"Hey, that sounds a lot
like professor Rick Payne."

236
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:52,102
But seriously, he was...
he was truly one of the greats.

237
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,402
That's... that's Marty right there.

238
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,300
He was a heck of a racquetball player, too.

239
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,502
He beat me almost every week, and
I'm not easy to beat at racquetball.

240
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:00,903
I'm good at racquetball.

241
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:04,303
Even had a couple species of
jungle plants named after him.
Did you know that?

242
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,602
You knew him well?

243
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:06,401
Oh, yeah.

244
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,102
Whenever he'd go on
one of his expeditions,

245
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:10,502
he would always come back
with something for my collection,

246
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,900
as you can see.

247
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:15,500
He died on this expedition,
and not...

248
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,902
not in a good way.

249
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,103
Dr. Grogan was on
that same expedition.

250
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,601
Made her famous. She got
all the accolades and awards,

251
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,402
all the kudos
they could throw at her.

252
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:24,803
A lot of people think
she didn't deserve it.

253
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,603
It was actually Martin Schaer
who was the driving force
behind that expedition

254
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:30,903
and she was taking advantage of
his death because he was her mentor,

255
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,201
but either way you look at it,
he's dead, she's not.

256
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,701
She looks great in a pair of shorts,
and she's got brains and talent,

257
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,102
and when you look like she does
and you can go into the jungle

258
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,803
and hang out with guys that
sharpen their teeth with files,

259
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,702
you're gonna get a lot of attention.

260
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:44,902
And whenever I see dr Grogan,
I think to myself,

261
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:48,501
"Wow. Has she got a body or what?"

262
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:51,301
Do you have to be this crass,
or can't you help it?

263
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:55,901
I can help it. I usually do it
as a defense mechanism so I don't get
too emotionally attached to humanity.

264
00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:00,201
You might have to be
a different person with your wife.

265
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:03,900
With her, I don't have to be
so charming.

266
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,501
Where's that book? 
"Cat's Claw."

267
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:10,301
It was right... here.
"Cat's claw" was the name of it.

268
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,301
- Do you see it?
- Maybe somebody borrowed it.

269
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,400
No, if they borrowed it,
I would know. It's my book.

270
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,001
I would know if it was... borrowed.

271
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:20,402
- Can I buy a copy?
- Yeah, at the university bookstore.

272
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,802
- Sorry.
- Ok.

273
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,101
Wait. Why are so you so interested
in this all of a sudden?

274
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,301
Why... what's going on?

275
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,401
Do  you think Grogan had something
to do with Marty's death?

276
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,303
I don't know yet.

277
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:30,602
Well, why were you at the lecture?
What were you gonna ask Grogan?

278
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,102
I need to read the book first.

279
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,800
You're talking in circles.
You know I know you're not being
straight with me, right?

280
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,301
- How would I know that?
- You're doing it again!

281
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,202
You don't think I know a circle-talker
when I meet one?

282
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,103
I don't think you'd find
my ideas very interesting.

283
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:43,102
Hey, don't prejudge. Just because
I'm rude, snide, and sarcastic

284
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,703
doesn't  mean I don't have
a sensitive side.

285
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:49,300
If you do see something strange,
call me.

286
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:03,403
Son of a bitch.

287
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:09,702
Where were you?

288
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,902
Damn it!

289
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:49,303
All right. Come on!

290
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,601
You cannot believe the things
this guy has done.

291
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:21,201
I mean, the places he's been,
just looking for plants.

292
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,101
Get this:

293
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:26,200
He was held for 10 days by drug dealers
in the rainforest of Venezuela.

294
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,003
The guy's Indiana Jones.

295
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,303
You know?

296
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,001
He's the guy every guy wants to be.

297
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,301
And he's dead.

298
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,801
Well, yeah, except for that part.

299
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,400
He got his ph. D. when he was 22,
then he spent the next 13 years

300
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:41,601
teaching at the university and going on
expeditions for months at a time

301
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,401
looking for cures to disease.

302
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:47,001
He was leading a university-sponsored
research expedition in a remote section

303
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:51,100
of the peruvian jungle Yomuibato?

304
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,501
And that's where he died.

305
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,100
Sad.

306
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:56,902
He had a real passion for what he did.

307
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

308
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,203
Anyway, I think he's got 
an issue with dr. Grogan.

309
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,902
Ever since she got back
from the expedition,

310
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:04,501
she's been getting the credit
for all their discoveries.

311
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,100
Hey, does Grogan know
that she's with ghost?

312
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,601
Well, I think she knows
that something's wrong.

313
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,500
I just don't think
she knows it's him.

314
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:13,300
I guess somebody's got to tell her.

315
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,203
You?

316
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:17,802
No.  This is me going to work,
although I could call her.

317
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:20,202
And say, "dr. Grogan, you know
you've got a ghost attached to you,"

318
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:21,703
and then hang up real quickly.

319
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,502
That's a great idea.
Maybe I'll try that.

320
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,301
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

321
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:27,801
I'll try not to wake you up.

322
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:30,502
Please do.

323
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:34,302
I like to know you're back.

324
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:40,301
Ok, Martin.

325
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:13,802
Honey! I'm home!

326
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:53,501
Who is it?

327
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,002
You saw me!

328
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,102
You saw me!
There's no denying you saw me!

329
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:11,902
Now open up!
We need to talk!

330
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,003
- Hi.
- You've been drinking.

331
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:17,402
- Statement or question?
- What do you want?

332
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,600
What do I want?
Good.

333
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:22,702
I'll tell you what I want.

334
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,702
I want to know...

335
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:27,402
I want to know what it is that you do.

336
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:28,802
You shouldn't be doing this.

337
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:32,800
The world is filled with people
doing things they shouldn't be doing.

338
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:35,203
Having sex with other people's wives,

339
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:37,902
cheating on their taxes,

340
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:41,303
running red lights...

341
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,103
Iraq.

342
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,203
What's your deal, lady?

343
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:51,202
What is going on? You come to me with
this Romano character and his hat,

344
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:55,602
and then you start drawing me pictures.
Not very good pictures, I might add

345
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:58,601
and the next thing you know,
things are going bump in the night,

346
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,803
and I'm not a bump-in-the-night
type of guy.

347
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,202
I don't get it.

348
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:07,601
You draw me symbols, numbers, music...

349
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,601
How long have you lived here?

350
00:23:12,706 --> 00:23:14,202
Almost two years.

351
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:17,200
That's good. That was a test.
You passed.

352
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:21,600
Get the easy question out of the way
before I ask the hard one.

353
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,000
Good for you.

354
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:25,502
I guess your husband's not home,

355
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:30,002
because if he was, I'd probably
be pulling his fist out of my face
right about now.

356
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:32,901
You might get to do that
at a later date.

357
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:35,303
Well, that's the really good thing
about being too drunk,

358
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,400
because you have a false sense
of invulnerability.

359
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,501
Yeah, well, eventually,
it wears off.

360
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:43,402
So let's get started.

361
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:46,102
This isn't about a book
you guys are writing.

362
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,902
You're not writing a book,
Melinda Gordon.

363
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,302
You're not writing a book.

364
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,501
You got something inside of you.

365
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:55,601
Something special inside of you.

366
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:59,701
That store that you got down there,
that's not what you're about.

367
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,801
No.

368
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:05,600
That's a front
for what's inside of you.

369
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:10,802
And I don't know, you could say it is
or not true, and it won't matter to me

370
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,302
because I know it's true.

371
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:14,501
Ok. Well, if you know it's true,
then why don't you go home?

372
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:17,102
Because I don't even know
what I know anymore.

373
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:21,400
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

374
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:25,401
That's why I'm here,
trying to make sense of something.

375
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:29,703
I'm trying to make sense of anything.

376
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,603
Why are you interested in jungle plants?

377
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,702
No, forget that.
I don't care about jungle plants,

378
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,703
and I don't think you care
about jungle plants, either.

379
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:44,303
Suddenly you want to know
about my kanaima manikin

380
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:47,803
and how does dr. Grogan

381
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:49,903
figure into all this?

382
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,203
Yeah, I really don't want to talk
to you when you're like this.

383
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:56,703
I may be drunk, Melinda Gordon,
but at least...

384
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm telling the truth.

385
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,903
I'm gonna cut to the chase, ok?

386
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:04,303
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

387
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:07,603
I don't think there's enough
give and take between you and I
in this relationship.

388
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:12,903
So I think we'd better cut it off
before it gets too serious.

389
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,301
Yeah. I said that.

390
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,703
Besides, whatever it is you're doing,

391
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,303
I'm sure it's probably
just smoke and mirrors.

392
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:25,002
Next, you'll just pull
a rabbit out of your hat.

393
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,701
Full circle.

394
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,602
Back to the hat.

395
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,903
I never really looked good in hats.

396
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,702
But with your hat, there's
a very interesting question,

397
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:38,300
and that's whether or not will
the rabbit be dead or alive.

398
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,000
I should call you a cab.

399
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:42,602
Now, that's a good idea!

400
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,801
Call the professor a cab.

401
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:46,902
Ah, too bad I won't be in it.

402
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,903
I will see you again...

403
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,403
never.

404
00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:00,102
Damn it!

405
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,102
What is wrong with you?

406
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:05,501
I can't find my keys.

407
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:07,002
You got my keys!

408
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,702
You took them when you grabbed my arm,
and you took my keys.

409
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:12,900
Now give them back.

410
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,302
Please go to Grogan now.

411
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:21,902
Are you all right?

412
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,303
What the hell just happened?

413
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,202
Where does dr. Grogan live?

414
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:30,600
- What?
- Do you know where she lives?

415
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,600
Why are we going to dr. Grogan's house?

416
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,200
We'll find out when we get there.

417
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,602
If you think something's wrong,
tell me.

418
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,002
You told me.

419
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:49,203
Look at the blood.

420
00:26:50,305 --> 00:26:52,400
I should get to a hospital, I think.

421
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:55,301
It's not yours.

422
00:26:55,408 --> 00:27:00,202
Why does that not make me
feel one bit better?

423
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:07,002
Maybe she's not home.

424
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,400
Something's going on in this house.

425
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:12,503
Are you serious?

426
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:21,300
She's inside.
Break down the door.

427
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,300
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yes!

428
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,603
Fine.

429
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,301
No, no, no, no, no, no!
I'll do it.

430
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:31,603
Come on. I'll do it.
Back up, please.

431
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:44,503
I killed him.

432
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,802
Oh, my god.

433
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:48,801
I killed martin.

434
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:51,700
I killed him.

435
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,501
Call 911!

436
00:27:58,106 --> 00:28:00,600
It's ok.

437
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,501
We just tried to keep her walking
until you got here.

438
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:08,402
Well, you did the right thing.

439
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,402
Did Payne have something
to do with this? Or her?

440
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:15,203
No. It was an anonymous tip.

441
00:28:16,507 --> 00:28:19,501
Fill me in later.

442
00:28:20,105 --> 00:28:22,303
Hey, I could really use a ride home.

443
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:23,601
Your car's at my house.

444
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:28,003
Well, it's not going anywhere.
No keys.

445
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,900
That was an interesting evening, huh?

446
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:45,301
Yeah.

447
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,803
So...

448
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,603
look, if I ask, will you tell me?

449
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:52,600
How I knew?

450
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:56,501
Among other things I can't blame on
my overindulgence in alcohol, yes.

451
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:59,003
I just wish I knew what
your reaction was gonna be.

452
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:05,100
It'll probably be a high level
of incredulity, but I'll try
to keep it within reason.

453
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,800
If I'm gonna say it,
I'm gonna need you to promise

454
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,602
because it's not something
I want everyone to know.

455
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,303
I... I won't tell anyone.
Do you want the cross-my-heart routine?

456
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,500
You got it.

457
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:18,102
No. A simple promise will be good.

458
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:24,602
I promise you, Melinda,
whatever you tell me in this car
doesn't leave this car ever.

459
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:28,201
I can speak to and see...

460
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,901
Is this fill in the blank?

461
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,600
The dead.

462
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,803
You don't mean the grateful, do you?

463
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:38,000
That's how I knew that
dr. Grogan was in trouble.

464
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:41,802
Martin Schaer. He used you
to tell me to get to her.

465
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,102
It's his spirit that you felt.
That's why you had blood your mouth.

466
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:47,901
Because he did when he died.

467
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,900
Now you know. Happy?

468
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:55,403
I don't if "happy" is the right word.

469
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,100
Does this happen a lot?

470
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,002
It's not something
I want to go into right now.

471
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:05,300
Look, you can believe me or not,
and if you can find another way
to explain what happened tonight,

472
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:08,300
it's ok with me.

473
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,503
I wish you could hear the argument
I'm having with myself in my head
right now.

474
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:14,802
Is that why you came to my house?

475
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:15,703
Yes.

476
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,900
Was it necessary to be drunk?

477
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:25,202
Yes, because I didn't decide
to come to your house until after
I had started drinking.

478
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,700
I want to go home now.

479
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:23,202
Oh... no.

480
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,900
Not again.

481
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:31,700
This is where I found it.

482
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:35,703
I had to be part of a ceremony
with the Machiguenga.

483
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:41,200
A ritual, so they would take me
to a place they considered sacred.

484
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:43,401
I wanted to find the plant
that they told me about.

485
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:44,901
Una de gato,

486
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,503
The cat's claw.

487
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:52,501
The Machiguenga were very protective.
They'd only take two of us.

488
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,400
Where have you been?

489
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:59,101
With my new best friends,
the Machiguenga.

490
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:04,302
- Can those guys party or what?
- Will they take us?

491
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:08,703
- Yes, but just two.
- Is that a good idea?

492
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:10,802
It's their jungle, their rules.
I'd go by myself if that's what they...

493
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:14,301
Ok, ok. So you and who?

494
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,602
Gee, I wonder.

495
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:25,703
What have you been drinking?

496
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:27,203
I'm really not sure.

497
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:28,200
You don't know what you drank?

498
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:33,500
It was a machiguenga cerenial concoction.
I had to drink it to seal the deal.

499
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:37,101
I have no idea what was in it, but I'm
positive it wouldn't get FDA approval.

500
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:41,701
It tasted just you know, pine tar
and a little hint of bat urine.

501
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,302
Oh, that's nice. That's romantic.

502
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,903
Actually, it was.

503
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,903
I had...

504
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:52,602
I had the most incredible visions,
all of them involving you.

505
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:56,803
And they swore to me
that it would increase sexual...

506
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,200
Ok, ok, ok. Fine, fine.

507
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:02,300
So when do we go?

508
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:05,501
3 hours.

509
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:08,602
And apparently it's quite a hike.

510
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:12,500
- Is that ok with you?
- Yeah.

511
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,900
You're a little hot.
Do you feel ok?

512
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:20,103
Oh, yeah. If I'm hot,
it's just because I'm here with you.

513
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,600
- I'm telling you, those visions...
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

514
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:27,703
- I think you've got a fever.
- What? Oh. I mean, come on.

515
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,801
A little temperature?

516
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,401
That's not gonna keep me
from going there,

517
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:33,401
especially after drinking what
I had to drink to make it happen.

518
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:36,503
If the Machiguenga think that I'm a wimp,
it's gonna blow the whole deal.

519
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:37,801
Come on. We go.

520
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:38,701
We're going.

521
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,100
We go no matter what.

522
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:46,500
Hey, I'll take two aspirins,
and call you in the morning.

523
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,002
All right? If I can find a phone
that works in the Yomuibato.

524
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,403
Call.

525
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,902
Sorry!

526
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:26,003
How's dr. Grogan?

527
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,000
We got in there just in time.

528
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:32,703
They pumped her stomach immediately,
but they still don't know what she took.

529
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:35,503
You saved her life, you know.

530
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,600
You know, people get awards from
the mayor for doing that sort of thing.

531
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,500
I'd have to share mine with a ghost.
He told me.

532
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:46,801
Tell me, what was
Payne doing there?

533
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:49,801
I told him.

534
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:51,402
Wow.

535
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:55,700
I think my ghosts are starting
to invade his life.

536
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:56,700
Did he say that?

537
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:59,002
No, not exactly.

538
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,303
But he knows
that things are happening,

539
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:06,803
and I couldn't come up with
a rational explanation, so...

540
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,401
I run out of lies sometimes.

541
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,801
Hey, they're not lies.

542
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:16,800
I mean, whatever you think,
but they're not lies.

543
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:22,601
He probably didn't believe me anyway.

544
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:26,303
- Now you're here, I can sleep.
- That's right.

545
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,800
Well...

546
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:34,100
Melinda Gordon?

547
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:37,601
Wow. I mean, yeah.

548
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:40,803
Sorry to just show up like this.

549
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,400
Rick came to see me in the hospital.

550
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:46,600
Uh, sorry.
Professor Payne.

551
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,100
He told me how you found me.

552
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,802
He did?

553
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:53,201
Yeah.

554
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:57,501
He said you saved my life.

555
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:58,902
Yeah.

556
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:02,600
Um, do you want to come in?

557
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:11,503
Uh, Rick said he was with you...

558
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:16,701
That you knew I was in trouble?

559
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,403
And he said you knew things
about Martin Schaer.

560
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,201
He said he couldn't tell me
what you knew, just...

561
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:26,302
I had to ask you.

562
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,900
Did... did you know Martin?

563
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,700
I know him, yes.

564
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:35,300
You were with him when he died.

565
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:38,402
It was my fault.

566
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:43,601
I knew he was sick.
I should have kept him from going.

567
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:47,300
Do you think you could have?

568
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:50,700
You don't understand.

569
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:54,602
I left him.

570
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:58,001
I left him.

571
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:03,202
The guards were moving too fast.

572
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,802
I can't see where they went.

573
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:08,000
Marty, I see some.

574
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:10,803
It's right here.
We found it.

575
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,900
Marty, are you ok?

576
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,401
Marty.

577
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,101
Uh! Ok. Marty.

578
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:17,103
Come on.

579
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,702
We can't stop here.

580
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:20,300
Wait. Wait.

581
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,302
No. No.
We're going back.

582
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,601
Ok.

583
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,502
Penn, it's ok. I'm ok.
It's ok. I just--

584
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:29,800
We have to go back.

585
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:33,701
- This is the only time we can do this.
- No. No. We have to go back.

586
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:36,801
Will you hold...

587
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,202
I want you to go.

588
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,002
Go back the way we came.

589
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:46,002
I'll wait here.

590
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:53,001
I love you.

591
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:56,903
I'll be here when you get back.

592
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:59,601
Ok.

593
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,402
I'll go back. I'll bring help.

594
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,403
I'll promise.

595
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,000
I went back to camp as fast as I could,

596
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:11,103
but he wasn't where I'd left him
when we got back.

597
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,600
We looked for him for two days.

598
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:24,802
We were supposed to get married
when we got back.

599
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:27,901
When I got back, I...

600
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,901
I was so empty inside,

601
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,301
all I could do was work.

602
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:36,203
I couldn't stop to think. If I did,
I would think of him, and...

603
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:42,501
and then I was getting all the credit
for things that we did together.

604
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:47,501
I couldn't have done
any of it without him.

605
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:50,400
And the university
insisted it was ok.

606
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:55,003
The more famous the professor,
the more grant money for the university.

607
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:59,503
He was sick for 3 days
before you left him.

608
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:02,600
How do you know that?

609
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:04,403
I've seen Martin.

610
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,200
His spirit.

611
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:09,800
He's here with us right now.

612
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:11,102
I...

613
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:13,402
I don't believe you.

614
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:15,403
I didn't want to believe I was sick.

615
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:18,801
There was so much work we had to do,
and there wasn't enough time to do it.

616
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:22,300
He didn't want to say anything
about being sick because

617
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:24,102
there was so much work
you had to do.

618
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:26,803
And now she blames herself for
what happened, but there's nothing

619
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:30,602
that could have saved me. It was
dengue fever. Mosquitoes carry it.

620
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:33,000
He knows that you blame yourself,

621
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:34,800
but he was already dying.

622
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,603
He had dengue fever.

623
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:43,401
I tried to make it back on my own,
but I wasn't thinking right,
and I got lost.

624
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:54,902
I couldn't find her.

625
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:59,503
When I finally couldn't walk anymore,
I just...

626
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:02,702
I lay down to die.

627
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:06,201
But I thought that...

628
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:09,703
no matter what happened,

629
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,501
I would always love her.

630
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:18,302
He was thinking of you
when he died.

631
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:22,702
He knew that he would
always love you.

632
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:27,602
I'm so lost without you.

633
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:30,802
Everywhere I go,

634
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:32,801
everywhere I look,

635
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:35,301
I can feel you.

636
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,501
Us.

637
00:40:37,606 --> 00:40:41,102
You showed me everything.

638
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:42,901
And now I don't want...

639
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:47,202
I don't want to be here
without you.

640
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,100
Please don't leave me.

641
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,303
We were meant to be together.

642
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:55,902
We were meant to show each other
the things we did, to teach each other,

643
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,601
and now it's...
it's meant to be different.

644
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,802
But nothing...
nothing can take it away.

645
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:07,201
We'll both bring all of it
with us wherever we go next.

646
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:10,501
I'll tell her.

647
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:12,602
Tell her to keep working.

648
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,302
But tell her she's got to
keep living, too,

649
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:18,803
because one's no good
without the other.

650
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,500
It's gonna be hard for him.

651
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,802
Who?

652
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:26,002
Rick Payne.

653
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,400
It's gonna be hard for him
to stay so cynical now.

654
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:32,501
He'll find a way.

655
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:46,600
What is it?
What's happening?

656
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:50,002
He's crossed over.

657
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:52,702
He's gone.

658
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,000
That's a good thing, right?

659
00:41:59,107 --> 00:42:02,501
Yeah, it's a good thing.

660
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:04,401
Come on.

661
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:09,202
Let's take a walk,
and we can talk some more.

662
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:39,302
I had to come back and get my car.

663
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:42,303
Find your keys?

664
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,401
Martin crossed over.

665
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:50,001
- He told me...
- Hold on.

666
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:56,701
I need a moment to keep my knee-jerk
cynical reaction from ignoring
all other possibilities.

667
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,803
Ok.

668
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:00,201
Martin told you...

669
00:43:00,305 --> 00:43:03,201
That he was worried about you.

670
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:06,903
He doesn't know how you're going to
be able to stay so cynical now.

671
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:08,501
I'll find a way.

672
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:11,101
Exactly.

673
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:18,301
I think I might have been partially
inebriated the other night.

674
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:19,603
Partially.

675
00:43:19,707 --> 00:43:24,703
Partially, which I probably
owe you an apology for,

676
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:28,402
which will come
in the very near future.

677
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,002
No rush.
