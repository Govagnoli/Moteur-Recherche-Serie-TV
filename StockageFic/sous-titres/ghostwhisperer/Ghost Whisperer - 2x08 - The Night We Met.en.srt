00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,934
My name
is melinda gordon.

3
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:13,401
I'm married,
i live in a small town,

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,568
and i own
an antique shop.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,623
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:19,803
Except that from the time
i was a little girl,

7
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,788
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,867
Grandmother:
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,134
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,690
They're stuck here
because they have unfinished

11
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:29,484
business with the living

12
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,225
and they come to me
for help.

13
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,589
In order to tell you
my story,

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,722
i have to tell you
theirs.

15
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:54,071
Hey, do you want to see
what i'm getting jim?

16
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,171
Sure.

17
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,013
Walk with me.
It's in shiffman's window.

18
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,010
What's the occasion?

19
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,510
It's our anniversary
on friday.

20
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:00,610
5 years.

21
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:01,571
Really?

22
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,412
I didn't know
you guys were together
for 5 years.

23
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,110
No, we haven't been.
It's the night we met.

24
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:07,523
Wait. You're celebrating
the night you met?

25
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,240
That's disgusting.
Was it romantic?

26
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:12,002
Yeah.
A little scary, too.

27
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,270
Anyway, there it is.

28
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,441
What? Where?

29
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:17,871
Right there.
And it actually works.

30
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,670
That's sweet.

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,440
You know, jim's been
so busy lately,

32
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:25,301
he hasn't even mentioned
our anniversary.

33
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:27,573
I think he forgot.

34
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:31,440
Really? Um... did he say
he wanted one of those?

35
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:33,473
It means something to us.

36
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:34,742
Ok.

37
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:39,543
I will never get used
to that sound.

38
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,842
Is jim working tonight?

39
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,402
Man: Are you guys safe?

40
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,043
As long as you
all are safe.

41
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,873
Ok. Come on.
I'll get you home.

42
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:21,040
Do you see jim
anywhere?

43
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,041
No.

44
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:31,840
You're all right.

45
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:32,901
Wait. There he is.
He's right there.

46
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,341
He's right there
with that guy!

47
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:44,371
Jim! Jim! Jim!

48
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,612
I'm lit! I'm lit!

49
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:50,341
Hey, no!

50
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,373
No, please, please,
see if everybody's out.

51
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:57,301
It's empty, it's empty.
It's all right.

52
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,941
Did everyone
get out?

53
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,510
Please, please,
make sure.

54
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,370
Let us take a look at you.

55
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,370
Get him some oxygen,
get some water.

56
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:08,843
Are you ok?

57
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,933
Ahh. You see, they saved
the basic structure,

58
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:28,131
but the interior's
totaled.

59
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:29,763
What a shame.

60
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,293
And it was
the opening night.

61
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,961
Mm-mmm. Re-opening.

62
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:37,492
That thing burned down once
before, like a year ago.

63
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,533
And i think i have it
bad when i can't find
a parking space.

64
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:41,763
Ooh. Ouch.

65
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:42,831
No, that's my line.

66
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,861
You're too tough
and stoic.

67
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,433
Oh, it's good
you reminded me,

68
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,333
'cause i wanted
to scream when you were
taking off my shirt.

69
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,992
You want a hot pack?

70
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:52,690
No. Enough heat
for one night.

71
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:54,131
Ice?
No thanks.

72
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,791
Look, tell me more
about this ghost.

73
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:57,993
He was on fire?

74
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,963
Yeah. He felt
pretty powerful.

75
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,791
But nobody died
in the fire.
Where'd he come from?

76
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,733
I  don't know.

77
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,593
It like he was getting
his power from the fire.

78
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,030
I mean, he looked at me,
and i got the chills.

79
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:09,691
Chills. Get it?

80
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,430
Oh, all right.
You're delirious.

81
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,493
Get some sleep.

82
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:14,633
You're going to be so sore
in the morning.

83
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:18,990
Oh, i'm already
sore as hell.

84
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,630
Ah. Hell? Fire?

85
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,830
Ok, sleep
before i slap you.

86
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:23,833
All right.

87
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:25,732
I think
everything'll be fine

88
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:28,201
as long as i'm
better by friday.

89
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:33,163
Really?
Well, what's friday?

90
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:34,893
Poker night
at richie's.

91
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,791
I didn't know that.

92
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:40,282
Is it sore right there?

93
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:42,532
Ow!
Oh, i'm so sorry.

94
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:00,933
There's
no reason to panic.

95
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,193
Interior collapsed
in the building
next door.

96
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,333
There's no fire
jumping.

97
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,493
Oh, my slipper.

98
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:12,993
I can walk on my own
just fine, thank you.

99
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:15,560
You're welcome.

100
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,631
Oh!

101
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:52,663
So, what is it?

102
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:53,832
The gift.

103
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,660
I just had to get it
out of the window
before jim saw it.

104
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:59,061
Anyway, i'm only
going to leave it
here until friday.

105
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:00,891
So, do you know what
he's going to get you?

106
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,760
Uh, i think he forgot.

107
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:05,030
He has plans to play
poker on friday night.

108
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,160
Ohh. Trouble
in padise?

109
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:09,530
No, he's just been exhausted,
working doubles.

110
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,100
And he got his dates
mixed up.

111
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,532
He'll realize it,
figure it out.

112
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:17,890
So, do you want me
to drop a hint the
next time i see him?

113
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:18,493
I'm pretty good at it.

114
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,490
No, it's ok. Thanks.

115
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,502
I really want him
to remember on his own.

116
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,201
I mean, it was a big night
for him... for us.

117
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,373
I just can't believe
that he would forget.

118
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,802
Do you smell smoke?

119
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,302
Mm-mmm. You know,

120
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,300
it's probably just
some leftover stink

121
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,972
from the fire
the other night.

122
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,301
I still smell it
on my clothes.

123
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,003
Reminds me
of my clubbing days.

124
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:42,201
Professor payne!

125
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,831
I can't tell you
how many times

126
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:47,733
i've walked past
this store and was almost
tempted to come in.

127
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,370
I'm honored. I think.

128
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,671
Delia banks,
this is professor payne
from rockland university.

129
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:53,600
He teaches a course on...

130
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,502
i teach the use of symbols
in the world of the occult.

131
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,103
Man's need to believe
in the unbelievable.

132
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,803
O-kay.

133
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:05,332
Uh, i'm going to go
across the street and
get some air freshener.

134
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,602
Air  freshener? Did i...

135
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,773
nothing to do with you.

136
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,442
Your husband got knocked
down in that fire.

137
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,982
Is he ok?
Yes, thanks.

138
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:18,482
I met him, you know.
I know.

139
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:19,720
He's a nice man,
your husband.

140
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:20,492
I know.

141
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,921
Does he always
drool like that?

142
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,752
He's a mouth breather.
Is that a problem?

143
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,250
I don't think
you came here to just
make fun of my husband.

144
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,684
No, i did not,
although i do enjoy it.

145
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:33,555
I  miss you.
I miss you, and i...

146
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,089
you're avoiding me.

147
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,090
Not intentionally.

148
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:37,172
Did i scare you off?

149
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,751
I don't scare easily.

150
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:39,753
Crazy. It's...

151
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,350
new neck exercise?

152
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,083
yes, actually.

153
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,023
You know,
that reminds me, i have
a question for you.

154
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:54,840
You always have
a question for me.

155
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:56,493
This time before you ask,

156
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:59,152
let's talk a little
quid pro quo.

157
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,181
If you get to ask a question,
i get to ask you a question.

158
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,653
Ok. What's
your question?

159
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:04,151
How many college
professors does it take

160
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,550
to screw
in a light bulb?

161
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,381
No, don't answer that.
That's not the real question.

162
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,650
My question to you is...

163
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,822
do you claim to have
supernatural powers?

164
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:13,422
Define "supernatural."

165
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:15,152
Ahh! Now we're
getting somewhere.

166
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:20,380
Supernatural meaning,
not of this world.

167
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,922
Do you claim to be connected
to the supernatural?

168
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,481
Sometimes
it feels that way.

169
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:27,493
How do you...

170
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,592
ok, that was
your one question.
Now it's my turn.

171
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,663
If somebody said to you

172
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:36,063
that there would
be 5 signs and then
death would come,

173
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:37,911
what would you think?

174
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:39,352
I would think about
selling my house

175
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:40,650
and moving to the nearest
police station.

176
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:41,813
I'm being serious.

177
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,083
That's what scares me.

178
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,913
I mean, aside from...

179
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:50,683
5...

180
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,952
5 represents
the unification of 2,

181
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:55,180
in the feminine element,

182
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:57,652
and 3, the masculine element.

183
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,051
Unification?

184
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,310
5.

185
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,680
5 represents the 5 senses,

186
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,413
the 5 wounds of the christ,

187
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:09,253
the 5... the 5 pillars
of piety.

188
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,711
In islam 5 is a big one.

189
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,652
A powerful, strong number.

190
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,783
Let's not kid
ourselves, sister.

191
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:20,010
It wasn't the jackson 4.

192
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:23,952
So what's going on?

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,553
Not yet.

194
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:30,483
Hi. Can i help you?

195
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,550
Thanks for coming.

196
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,151
Who are you?

197
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,311
It burns.

198
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,153
Everything burns.

199
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,883
What does that mean?

200
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,350
He knows.

201
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,011
He knows why.

202
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,310
Who knows?

203
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:19,700
so, what are
we saying here?

204
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,302
The ghost set the fire
at the restaurant?

205
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,471
Let's just say
he caused it.

206
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:24,391
He said "he knows,
he knows why."

207
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:25,721
Who? The owner?

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,051
Yeah. You said that
it had burned down
once before, right?

209
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,320
Yeah, about a year ago.

210
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,851
Ahh. See? That's the one
i need to know more about.

211
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,723
Hey, you know
my buddy freddy diaz?

212
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,090
I've heard you talk about him,
but i've never met him.

213
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:38,821
He's the county
arson investigator.

214
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,261
He's been on
the scene all week.

215
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,491
Arson?

216
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:43,490
Does that mean
i'm not the only one
who thinks it was set?

217
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,723
No, it's routine.

218
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,533
You see, every fire gets
investigated the same way

219
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:48,301
until they've figured out
how it happened.

220
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,852
So, look, i don't think
you're going to find

221
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:50,991
any wanted posters
for ghosts.

222
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,090
So, why don't
you go, talk to him,

223
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,230
see what
he can tell you?

224
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,430
I'll give him a head's
up. You want a glass?

225
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,501
Mm-mmm.
Ok.

226
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,993
Mmm. Thank you.

227
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,361
Melinda, my husband's
still in there.

228
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,780
Are you sure?
Maybe he came out
around the corner.

229
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,130
No! No.
He's in there.

230
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,300
He's at the bottom
of the stairs.

231
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,791
Ok.

232
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,462
I'm really sorry
to bother you.

233
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,163
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're supposed to be
behind the barricade.

234
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:31,403
There's a man
trapped inside.

235
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,731
No, there isn't. We got
everybody outside.

236
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,301
Please believe me.

237
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:38,130
Noah.

238
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,131
Yo?

239
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,130
Come on.

240
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,132
Where we going?

241
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,030
Back  inside.

242
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:44,663
You're welcome.

243
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,300
Man: Everything ok?

244
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:54,930
Is everything ok?

245
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:59,331
Oh, i'm sorry.

246
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,661
You looked like you were
a million miles away there.

247
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,792
You caught me.

248
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:05,332
Actually, i'm looking
for freddy diaz.

249
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,400
Oh, that's me.

250
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:07,401
You are...

251
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,490
hi. I'm melinda gordon.

252
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,363
I think that you know
my husband, jim clancy.

253
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:11,490
Oh, are you kidding?

254
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,560
You have any idea how
much beer i have consumed

255
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,992
with  that man
over the course of...

256
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,501
anyway. Uh...

257
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,031
what can i do for you?

258
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,730
The first fire happened
in the middle of the night.

259
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,732
They were closed,
no customers.

260
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:26,661
Did you investigate
that one, too?

261
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:27,990
Oh, yeah.

262
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,860
Figured that one out
in about a half-hour.

263
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:30,862
Arson?

264
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,202
In a big way.

265
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,332
How can you tell?

266
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,792
Tons of ways.

267
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,133
You look
for accelerants,

268
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,530
pour patterns,
ignition sources.

269
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,232
But the surest way
to know is when you find

270
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,231
the arsonist's
body right where
the fire started.

271
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:43,561
Pretty much a slam dunk.

272
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:46,270
Someone died in that fire?

273
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:47,282
Co-owner.

274
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,682
Tried to screw
his ex-partner over.

275
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,443
Insurance scam
is what we figured.

276
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,081
See it all the time.

277
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:55,442
It's amazing
what people try
to get away with.

278
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,713
Not too smart, though.

279
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,740
Guy burned to death.

280
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,942
People have
no idea how fast
a fire can spread.

281
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:03,942
What about this fire?

282
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,780
Any idea what caused it?

283
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,043
This matters to you, why?

284
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,943
Sorry. I'm just doing some
research on arson, fire,

285
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:12,283
things like that.

286
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:14,283
Mmm. You mean,
for a book or something?

287
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,012
You never can tell.

288
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,541
I haven't found
any evidence
to suggest arson.

289
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,442
We're gonna keep
looking though.

290
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,283
Say hi to jim
for me.

291
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:24,611
Watch your step
on the way out.

292
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:25,683
Thanks.

293
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,682
Lilly chen.

294
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:16,142
Lilly.

295
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:18,302
What is that?

296
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,380
Stained glass?

297
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,583
Everything will burn.

298
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,002
Everyone will burn.

299
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,441
Yeah.

300
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:29,722
I'm fine.

301
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:32,290
I just got so hot
i couldn't breathe.

302
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,792
I can't decide whether
to move into the firehouse

303
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,101
or have the firehouse
move in here.

304
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,673
Well, at least i know
who the ghost is.

305
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,771
It's the guy who set
fire to his own restaurant?

306
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:41,290
Yes.

307
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,763
And then a year later
set fire to it again,
after he died?

308
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,061
I think so.
Why?

309
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,020
Maybe... i don't know.

310
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:51,193
Maybe he's been
in some kind of sleep
state all this time.

311
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:54,961
You know, it does
usually take some
big event or...

312
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:57,121
i don't know,
some kind of ripple.

313
00:16:57,195 --> 00:17:00,820
And you think the re-opening
of the restaurant set him off?

314
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,261
Well, yeah!

315
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,721
I need you to lie down.

316
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:07,662
That's not lying down.

317
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,260
Well, why don't you
turn your head sideways,

318
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,121
and then it'll look
like i'm lying down?

319
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,423
You are a terrible patient.

320
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:16,891
He said that everything
was going to burn.

321
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,121
Every one
was going to burn.

322
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:19,760
What for?
I don't know.

323
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:22,223
But, you know,
he's obviously coming
to me for some reason.

324
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:23,310
Maybe he wants my help.

325
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,211
And maybe he's
just completely evil,

326
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:26,261
and he enjoys the attention.

327
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,821
Either way i have
to cross him over

328
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,493
before he burns
something else down.

329
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,092
All right.

330
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,732
You said
he recognized his wife?

331
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:36,931
Yeah, he said her name.

332
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,433
I tried to find her
before you got home,

333
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:39,931
and there's no listing
for her anywhere.

334
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,462
Why don't you talk
to that guy jesse
at the restaurant?

335
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,330
He knows...
warren chen.

336
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,902
Right. His partner.
Talk to him,

337
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,160
see what he can tell you.

338
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,930
Can you get me
his address?

339
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,730
Well... that depends
what's in it for me.

340
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,931
How's your
blood pressure?

341
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,431
Elevated.

342
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,642
Now lie down.

343
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,983
Ok, i'll lie down.

344
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,582
I hope you don't mind
if i keep working.

345
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,840
I got to get
this place in shape.

346
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,983
It's gotta go on
the market next week.

347
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,643
I know that
this is a bad time
for you right now.

348
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,581
Yeah. Well, that's
what happens when you lose

349
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,313
a business twice
in one year.

350
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,312
Wasn't there
any insurance?

351
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:27,043
Yeah, but with the first one,
they didn't want to pay.

352
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:29,310
Insurance companies
tend to frown on arson.

353
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:32,311
Then i had to borrow money
from my father to rebuild,

354
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,111
and no one wanted to insure
the new place.

355
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:37,211
Look, i really appreciate
what your husband did for me,

356
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,642
but i really don't
want to think about any
of this right now.

357
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:44,243
I'd like to talk
about the first fire,
last year.

358
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:45,513
And warren chen.

359
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,483
Why  are you doing this?
What do you want from me?

360
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,381
I'd just like
to know more about him.

361
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:54,313
Warren was my partner,
and he was my friend.

362
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,682
He burned down
your restaurant.

363
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:58,283
And it broke my heart!
He was like a brother to me.

364
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,440
Look, i don't know why he did
what he did that night.

365
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:01,941
But you didn't know him,

366
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,503
and you can't come here
and talk about him

367
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:05,310
like he's some kind
of criminal.

368
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,443
Ok, i'm sorry.

369
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:10,040
Ok. Well, now
i have things to do.

370
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,341
What about lilly?

371
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,501
Do you know
where she is?

372
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:15,501
She had a total
breakdown after warren.

373
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:18,513
Look, what do you want
from her and what do you
want from me?

374
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,311
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:21,502
I didn't mean to...

376
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,010
just leave us alone.
Leave me alone.

377
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,842
Leave her alone.
We've l been through enough.

378
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:31,880
I really hate being
the only one who knows
how that fire got started.

379
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:34,043
So, did jesse
say anything helpful?

380
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:35,643
No. He's pretty raw.

381
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,481
I'm guess i'm going
to have to find lilly

382
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,012
and see if she knows
anything that can help.

383
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:39,751
Well, how are you going
to do that?

384
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,710
You said there
was no listing.

385
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:42,582
You can help me.

386
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:43,741
I knew that was coming.

387
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:45,141
Ok. All you have
to do is find out

388
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,242
where she lived
with warren.

389
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,112
I'm sure
there's a record
from the last fire.

390
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,683
She might
still be there.

391
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:51,181
I'll take a look.

392
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,180
Ok.

393
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:53,183
One kiss.

394
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,413
Go to work.

395
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,211
They're gonna take a look.

396
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:09,312
Don't worry.

397
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:13,482
Let's go, let's go.

398
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,183
There's somebody
still here.

399
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:20,110
You ok?

400
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:21,040
I'm all right.

401
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:22,112
Let's do this.

402
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,610
Anybody here?!

403
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:25,782
Can you hear us?

404
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,743
If you can hear us,
make a sound!

405
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,041
Did you hear that?
What's that?

406
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:32,242
Man: Get out!

407
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,203
I hear something.
I think someone's here.

408
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,723
Turn off the radio.
Radios off.

409
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:43,752
Right there.
That's it.

410
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,091
We got 2!

411
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:54,221
Radio: We got them!
We found them!

412
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:56,121
Move it!
Let's go!

413
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,521
Make sure you
check on him, ok?

414
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:42,791
Make sure he's ok?

415
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:44,991
I will.

416
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,222
Thank you.

417
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,493
Hey, i'm going
across to lentos
on the square.

418
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:45,141
You want anything?

419
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:46,073
No, thanks.

420
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,142
Whatcha looking up?

421
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,673
Trying to find someone.

422
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:50,471
Aren't we all?
Old friend?

423
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:51,640
Not really.

424
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:52,872
Old enemy?

425
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:55,443
It's a long story.

426
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,373
I'm starting
to get the idea

427
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,142
that there's
a lot of long stories
attached to you.

428
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,143
More than you know.

429
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,803
Hey, it's cool,
i was just gonna...

430
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:06,001
you know, it's a friend
of mine whose husband died,

431
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,710
and i'm trying
to check up on her,

432
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,513
but i don't
know how to find her.

433
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,002
Phone book?

434
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:12,943
No, i tried
the old number and it just
said disconnected.

435
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,070
Hmm. You know,
i love those kind
of good puzzles.

436
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,102
Yeah. I'll figure
this one out.

437
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:22,342
So, has jim remembered
your anniversary yet?

438
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:25,773
No. He's still playing
poker on friday night.

439
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:28,373
Time for a hint?

440
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,331
I don't want to trick him
into remembering.

441
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:35,331
You know, men have so
much crap on their minds
this time of year.

442
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:38,101
There's football,
basketball,
ice hockey...

443
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,301
<i>america's
next top model.</i>

444
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,903
Yeah. I guess
it's no big deal.

445
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:47,862
I mean, maybe
this stuff isn't that
important after all.

446
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,600
Yeah, my husband
was really excellent

447
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,033
at forgetting
our anniversary, too.

448
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:55,532
And it didn't really
matter that much,

449
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:57,900
or at least that's
what i told myself.

450
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:00,030
And i would drop hints
all the time,

451
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,961
but it never worked.

452
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,403
And finally one day
i just looked at him
and i said,

453
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,300
charlie,
what the hell is it
about our anniversary?

454
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,731
Why won't you
just remember it and
get it over with?

455
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:13,831
And he looked
at me and he smiled,

456
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,402
and he said...

457
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:18,163
'cause
it's just one day.

458
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:22,733
What's one day
when you compared it...

459
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,901
to being married to you
every single day?

460
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,261
That's a really good answer.

461
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,500
Yeah. That was charlie.

462
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,533
The funeral home.

463
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:44,531
Sorry?

464
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,732
Your friend.

465
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:47,733
Why don't you check
with the funeral home

466
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,262
where her husband
had his wake?

467
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:52,361
What if she moved,
you know, after the wake?

468
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,832
I bet they have
a cell number

469
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:56,201
or maybe
her work number.

470
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:57,950
You are a genius.

471
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,531
Right.

472
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,460
Please tell my son that.

473
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:01,963
Bye.

474
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:03,663
Bye.

475
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,303
The chens.

476
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:24,232
I remember the chen family.

477
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:25,393
Do you remember
the wife?

478
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:26,433
Lilly?

479
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,431
Just that she seemed so sad.

480
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:32,260
It was only her and a man,
about her age...

481
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,061
he was just inconsolable.

482
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:37,361
Cried more than she did,
if i remember.

483
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,493
Must have been jesse,
his partner.

484
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:40,733
I didn't get the name.

485
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:42,061
I tried to comfort them,

486
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,861
tried to tell them that
warren was at peace now...

487
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:48,230
but, of course...

488
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:49,563
i know.

489
00:25:49,637 --> 00:25:51,390
So sorry
to keep you waiting.

490
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,432
We do still have the records
from that funeral,

491
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:57,220
but i'm afraid
i couldn't give you any
personal information.

492
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,062
Oh, i understand.

493
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:01,732
But if i could
impose on you just
a little bit more...

494
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,990
um, would you mind
calling ms. Chen

495
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,192
and just giving her
my phone number,

496
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:08,863
just let her know
that i have a message
about warren,

497
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,830
and that it's
really important
that i speak to her.

498
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:11,931
If it's that important...

499
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:13,832
thanks, i really
appreciate that.

500
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,192
Tell him he did
a fantastic job on the hair

501
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,693
for the woman in room 5.

502
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,331
The family loved it.

503
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,393
So did she.

504
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:24,730
People really
love your work.

505
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,093
Let's walk.

506
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:42,132
I have to admit,
i didn't think
you'd call me back.

507
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:44,163
I'm not sure why i did.

508
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,433
But for some reason
i felt like i had to.

509
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,562
You said you had a message
about warren.

510
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:51,242
Did you know him?

511
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:53,060
No, not really. Um...

512
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:55,460
i've been doing
some research on
the restaurant fire,

513
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:57,033
the red noir.

514
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,491
You know,
i don't mean to pry,

515
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:01,393
but do you know
why warren would
do what he did?

516
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:03,762
It doesn't make sense.

517
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:05,762
What was he like?

518
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:08,860
He always said his life
had perfect balance,

519
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:12,260
except then he got
into business with jesse.

520
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,590
To be his partner.

521
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,591
Yes, and that
was the problem.

522
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,132
He wasn't just
a chef anymore.

523
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:18,661
He had to deal
with the business...

524
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,793
the hiring, the firing.

525
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:24,230
He hated it.
Worst of all,

526
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,030
it had nothing
to do with his talent,

527
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,531
what made him happy.

528
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,493
His mood changed.

529
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,332
He was always
so stressed.

530
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:35,091
Do you think that's
why he set the fire?

531
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,962
So he could
get out of it?

532
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,632
I just don't know.

533
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,632
What if i told you
there was a way you
could ask him?

534
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,923
I don't know what you...

535
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:48,191
what if i said
that warren's spirit
is still here?

536
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:54,462
I can help you talk
to him, through me.

537
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:59,831
No. Lilly, please...

538
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,791
he showed me
a piece of glass.

539
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:04,260
Stained glass, does that
mean anything to you?

540
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:07,992
I don't want him to see me.

541
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,792
??????????

542
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:20,331
Warren?

543
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:24,231
Warren chen?

544
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:26,933
I need to talk to you.

545
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,361
I can help you.

546
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:32,763
I spoke to your wife
and jesse.

547
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:36,763
They don't really
understand why you
did what you did.

548
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:37,832
Warren:
What did i do?

549
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,933
Set the restaurant
on fire. Twice.

550
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,162
Don't you remember that?

551
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:45,661
I remember being mad
at jesse.

552
00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:47,491
Why?

553
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:48,731
I wanted him to buy me out.

554
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:50,702
I needed him to buy me out.

555
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:52,062
He kept telling me
he'd pay me off,

556
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,173
and then he'd always
have an excuse.

557
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:54,741
He was never going
to give me what was mine.

558
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,270
Did you think you
were going to get money
from the fire?

559
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,240
From the insurance?
Or were you just trying
to get back at jesse?

560
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,270
I don't remember.

561
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,733
You really hate
this place.

562
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:08,200
I was a chef...

563
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:09,803
before.

564
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:11,291
I used to love
to come to work.

565
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:12,360
I couldn't wait.

566
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,430
People loved what i did.

567
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:15,492
When i got this place
with jesse,

568
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:16,560
it all changed.

569
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:20,330
I used to dream
about fire...

570
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:24,003
about this place
burning down.

571
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,862
And then i'd be free.

572
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:32,901
Warren, i know how
much pain you're in,

573
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:35,003
but you have to cross over.
There's a better place for you.

574
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,503
I can't.

575
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:42,331
Ok. Look, the revenge
that you wanted to get
on jesse, you got it.

576
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,660
All right? He's ruined.

577
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,362
He's probably
never going to be able

578
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:46,430
to open a business again.

579
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:47,830
It's lilly.

580
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,562
There's something
she has to know.

581
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:52,860
What?

582
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,062
I don't know.

583
00:29:58,137 --> 00:30:00,132
Does it have something to do
with that stained glass?

584
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,533
I love her so much.

585
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,203
I'm afraid i hurt her.

586
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:14,530
I have to talk to her.

587
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,432
Don't let lilly think
i forgot her.

588
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,600
You know what, noah?

589
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,462
I think i'll see you
back at the station.

590
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:00,103
Ah!
Sorry...

591
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:02,030
aah!
It's ok.

592
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:05,530
You remember me?

593
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,501
Yeah. You threw
my slipper at me.

594
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:09,932
Tossed.

595
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,490
I tossed it at you.
There's a difference.

596
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:12,490
Let me see
if i can fix this.

597
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:13,493
There's a trick to it.

598
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:14,632
Yeah.

599
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:17,552
That's not it.

600
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:20,222
I hope you're better
at putting out fires.

601
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,691
I'll buy you a new one.

602
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,251
Don't worry about it.

603
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:26,103
I'm jim...
jim clancy,
by the way.

604
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:26,652
Melinda gordon.

605
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:27,651
Nice to meet you.

606
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:28,851
I have to...

607
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:30,022
where you headed?

608
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:34,023
Uh... now
to get an umbrella.

609
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:35,350
Right.

610
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,451
Produce. My apartment
is full of soot, so...

611
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,750
i don't know about you,
but i'm starved.

612
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:42,120
Well, good luck
with that.

613
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:45,053
Hey, let me buy you
a late dinner.

614
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,452
I know a place.

615
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,123
What place?

616
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,890
Ever heard
of the umbrella room?

617
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,352
No.

618
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:54,352
Come on.

619
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,681
?????????

620
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:02,551
Well, you got class,
i'll give you that.

621
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,652
Anybody can take
you to sardi's.

622
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,052
Thanks, boss.

623
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:08,252
You won't find
this kind of food there.

624
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:09,892
One can hope.

625
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:15,650
Do you live close by?

626
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,723
Well, near.
West 90th.

627
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,293
That's the upper west side.

628
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,993
This is the east village.

629
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,753
That's not close at all.

630
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:28,353
I was never any good
with a compass.

631
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:34,691
You got a little, uh...

632
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,253
on your lip.

633
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:44,791
What?

634
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:46,321
Nothing.

635
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:48,792
I know.

636
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:51,291
You were pretty
sure that guy was
in that apartment.

637
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:52,822
Lucky guess.

638
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:54,250
No. You knew.

639
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:55,392
You were sure.

640
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,023
I've been thinking
about it all night.

641
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:58,023
How did you know?

642
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:59,793
You know what?
I have to go home.

643
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:00,952
I have work in the morning.

644
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:02,792
You know,
i hate secrets.

645
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,021
So, how did you know?

646
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:14,820
Maybe someday
i'll tell you.

647
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,823
Earth to melinda.

648
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,091
Sorry.

649
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:31,221
I was lost in thought.

650
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:32,621
What about?

651
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:35,752
Um... about...

652
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,921
about how to get lilly chen
to talk to her husband.

653
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:43,221
I never got her number
when she met me.

654
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,623
But she called you, right?

655
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:46,621
So it's probably
in my phone memory.
Hello.

656
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:49,120
Uh. Here. Look.

657
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,350
This number...
i don't recognize it.

658
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:53,451
That's got to be it.

659
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:54,992
So?

660
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,592
I just don't like
doing this kind of thing
over the phone.

661
00:33:57,657 --> 00:34:00,521
You mean you really
don't like the hanging-up-
in-your-face part.

662
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:02,723
Exactly.

663
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:03,751
You online?

664
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:05,091
Yeah...

665
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:06,090
let me try something.

666
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,351
All right.
This is a reverse
phone directory site.

667
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:11,790
You put
the phone number in,

668
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:13,793
you get
an address, unless
it's been blocked.

669
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,021
You never cease to amaze me.

670
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,723
Ditto.

671
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:26,791
What?

672
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:30,850
You already
gave me this address.

673
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:08,333
There was a time
he was like my brother.

674
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:12,462
I'm so sorry, warren.

675
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:13,562
And lilly...

676
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:17,500
she was my wife.

677
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:19,560
We went through
so much together.

678
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:21,502
Look, we don't really
know what happened...

679
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:22,492
or when it happened.

680
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:23,491
I just died.
How could they...

681
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:25,230
you died a year ago, warren.

682
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:27,162
Things change.

683
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,502
People change. Sometimes
they have to move on.

684
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:30,972
I'm going to burn them.

685
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:32,233
No.

686
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:35,003
I will burn everything.

687
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:49,302
Jesse!

688
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:50,502
Jesse!

689
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,561
Ow! Jesse!

690
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:58,030
Hey, what the hell is...

691
00:35:58,106 --> 00:35:59,431
god, it's hot.
Are you all right?

692
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,160
It's just my furnace.
What's wrong with you?

693
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:03,160
There is nothing wrong
with your furnace.

694
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:04,433
Ok? Just please
come outside?

695
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:05,432
Why?

696
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:06,931
Just please.
Warren's here.

697
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,970
Warren? What are you
talking about?

698
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,602
Warren's spirit
is still here.

699
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,263
Ok? He's been haunting
the restaurant.

700
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,762
He caused the fire.
And he knows about
you and lilly,

701
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,162
and he's really mad...

702
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:16,162
are you on drugs?

703
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:18,002
Warren, don't do this!

704
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:26,700
What the hell?

705
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:29,463
She says warren's
spirit is still here.

706
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,972
Look, he knows
about you and jesse.

707
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,032
You have to talk to him

708
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,631
before he burns
the house down.

709
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:35,902
Are you ok?

710
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:38,733
Aah! Please!

711
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:41,263
If that's you,
if you're doing this,

712
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,903
please stop!
I'm so sorry!

713
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:46,181
Tell him how much
you love him.

714
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:48,432
Use his name.

715
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:51,763
Warren!

716
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:54,600
I love you so much!

717
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,903
He's right here...

718
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:59,332
next to me.

719
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,830
Ask her how long.

720
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,362
How long was she with him?

721
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,870
Before i died?

722
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,062
He wants to know

723
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:12,460
if you were with jesse
before he died.

724
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,660
No, never...

725
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:14,870
it wasn't like that.

726
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,232
Warren...

727
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:18,561
i knew you loved me.

728
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:25,831
All i wanted was for us
to get our lives back...

729
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:29,603
i wanted you to quit,
to be happy...

730
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,533
i didn't mean for it
to happen, warren.

731
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,631
I never thought
of jesse that way...

732
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:38,631
but when you...

733
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:41,301
when you died...

734
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:45,002
we were
both so... so lost.

735
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,403
Jesse was destroyed.

736
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,563
He cried for you...

737
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:54,931
he called your name.
He was so torn up.

738
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:57,432
Warren: No!

739
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:59,433
He cried.

740
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,002
Jesse.

741
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,262
Now i remember.

742
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:08,362
He remembers.

743
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:15,131
Lilly was making
a stained glass window
for our bedroom.

744
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:19,060
I saw this beautiful piece
of glass on my lunch hour.

745
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,231
I hadn't bought her a gift
in such a long time.

746
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,432
And i'd had another fight
with jesse about the money.

747
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:24,930
I left work mad
and was halfway home

748
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,732
when i realized
i forgot the gift.

749
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,661
I went in the back way...

750
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,002
jesse!

751
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,870
What are you doing?

752
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,762
He watched you.

753
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:52,702
He watched you
set the fire.

754
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,662
Is this true?

755
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,902
Lilly, please.

756
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:07,731
You have to believe me.
I didn't mean to.

757
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,001
I did it for all of us!

758
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,462
We were going broke!

759
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:17,500
It wasn't working!

760
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,491
And i thought
if warren found out,

761
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:20,501
that he'd quit
for sure.

762
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:24,561
The insurance paid off,
we'd just start over.

763
00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:26,100
Clean slate.

764
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,760
I made one mistake.

765
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:29,500
He wasn't supposed
to be there.

766
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,063
I don't know why
warren came back.

767
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,100
What the hell
are you doing here?
Get out!

768
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,461
Go on! Go on!
Go back!

769
00:39:40,536 --> 00:39:41,462
I can't!

770
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:42,460
Why'd you come back here?!

771
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:43,790
Why did you do this?

772
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,961
Warren, get out of here!
Go on! Come on!

773
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:49,200
Make a run for it!
No! No, no, not there!

774
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:50,762
Aah!
Not there!

775
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:51,833
Aah!
No!

776
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,060
I swear i didn't
mean to hurt him.

777
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:05,033
Just let him
take the blame.

778
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,933
Yeah, but what
difference did it make?

779
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,861
Nothing could have
brought warren back.

780
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,792
I never said he did it.

781
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,230
The arson
investigators did.

782
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:18,961
Lilly please...
uhh!

783
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,302
Get away from me!

784
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:26,243
It wasn't the reopening
that woke you up.

785
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:29,061
It was lilly and jesse
being together.

786
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,862
You had to tell her that
the man she was living
with killed you.

787
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:36,763
Please tell her...

788
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:39,732
i always loved her.

789
00:40:39,797 --> 00:40:43,262
No matter
how hard i worked...

790
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:47,690
no matter how much it seemed
like i wasn't there.

791
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,463
I did it for her.

792
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:55,433
I wanted to give us a life.

793
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,561
He wants you to know
that he always loved you.

794
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,261
And he worked so hard

795
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:04,600
because he wanted
the two of you to have
a good life...

796
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,303
we did have a good life.

797
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,462
You and me
together, warren.

798
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:11,263
I didn't need
anything else.

799
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,133
How can i be dead...

800
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,530
if this hurts so much?

801
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:20,401
If i love her so much?

802
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,560
You'll always
love her.

803
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:26,500
Tell her no matter
what happens...

804
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,561
i'll be waiting for her.

805
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,762
Tell her i'll never
forget her eyes.

806
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,732
I'll see them again,
with mine someday.

807
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,332
He's ready
to cross over now.

808
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,563
Well, are you going
to open it,

809
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,731
or you just going to
wait for your x-ray
vision to kick in?

810
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,162
Come on.
What's the occasion?

811
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:34,732
There doesn't have
to be an occasion.

812
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:36,691
I just saw it
and thought of you.

813
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:38,331
Ok.

814
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,263
Hot dogs!

815
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:46,261
Whoa!

816
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:48,601
It works
and everything.

817
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,003
Ha ha! Perfect!

818
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,560
You are a genius.

819
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:53,560
I love you.
What a surprise.

820
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,132
Um, you know,
i don't want you
to be late for the guys.

821
00:42:58,205 --> 00:42:59,341
So, you should
get going.

822
00:42:59,356 --> 00:43:01,261
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you know what?
Could you do me a favor?

823
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:03,461
Grab my jacket
out of the closet. I'm
just gonna plug this in.

824
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:04,891
I just want to see if
it works once, you know?

825
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,631
I'll get an extension cord.
Sure.

826
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:08,131
Sometimes these things
are a little temperamental.

827
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,261
Right.

828
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,301
The fuse might not
hook in just right.

829
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:14,200
I'll get your jacket.

830
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:38,002
There's a trick to it.

831
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:43,401
Dinner at the umbrella room?

832
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:54,161
I'd thought
you'd forgotten.

833
00:43:54,237 --> 00:43:56,033
Never.

834
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:09,132
I'd thought
you'd forgotten.
