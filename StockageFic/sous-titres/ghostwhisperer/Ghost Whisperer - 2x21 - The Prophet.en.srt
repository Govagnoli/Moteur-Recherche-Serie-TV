1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:02,136
previously
on <i>ghost whisperer.</i>

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:04,958
how come you
can see me and they can't?

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,457
that's a long story.

4
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:07,791
there's
a better place for you.

5
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,190
well, that means
there's someone else
out there...

6
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,491
like me?
i know!

7
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:18,824
it's the 5 signs.

8
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:20,624
the dead dove
on the doorstep.
the bee.

9
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:22,331
the writing
on jim's back.

10
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:24,273
the dead will walk.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,707
and now, the forgotten
have returned.

12
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:27,707
wait, so, all 5 of
those things have happened.

13
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:28,973
not the writing
on your back.

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,173
it was latin.

15
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:31,752
it translates to,
"death of a loved one."

16
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,520
what is this?

17
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,087
what are you doing
with all these spirits?

18
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:41,087
we're getting ready.
for what?

19
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:42,154
for what's coming.

20
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,839
he's been planning this
for quite some time.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,939
no, this is
bigger than just him.

22
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:23,972
hey!

23
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:54,371
you shouldn't be here.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,007
why not?

25
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,162
this is your fault.

26
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,266
no.

27
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,333
yeah?

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,133
hey, sorry,
i got lonely.

29
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,932
everybody's healthy
in grandview tonight.

30
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,773
i got no work.

31
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,173
i can't believe
i have a week of this.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
what time is it?

33
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,073
4:10.

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,673
delia!
what?

35
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,373
i have to call you back.

36
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,063
hello?

37
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,143
it's melinda,
i'm so sorry.

38
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,234
what time is it?

39
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:04,336
10 after 4:00.
i'm so sorry,

40
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,302
i just--
i need to know
that you're ok.

41
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,603
well, i'm not.

42
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,636
you're not?

43
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,402
no, i'm awake
at 10 after 4:00.

44
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,869
why are you
doing this to me?

45
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,202
ok, i'm--i'm sorry.

46
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,302
go back to sleep.

47
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,102
ok, wait,
are you ok?

48
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,102
i'm fine.

49
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,536
forget i called.

50
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:21,536
all right,
good night,

51
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,836
 good morning,
 good bye.

52
00:03:53,102 --> 00:04:03,102
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

53
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:13,102
<font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@
sync:frm@illuminatorl</font> 

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,646
once again
you have proven to be
my best customer.

55
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,821
this is a birthday gift
that ned will never expect.

56
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,588
you know, do you think
he's going to get it?

57
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:36,022
i mean,
will he know what it is?

58
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,489
oh, yeah, this is
all making a comeback.

59
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:39,688
because they discovered

60
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,855
vinyl produces
a better sound than digital.

61
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:44,355
can you believe that?
do they still make vinyl?

62
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,851
well, you know,
it's hard to find,
but it's out there.

63
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,970
besides, i still have
my whole collection
in a box somewhere.

64
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:53,103
right, i bet ned
can't wait to listen
to tom jones and neil young.

65
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,179
ok, so, we'll skip
my collection,

66
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,746
but a lot of bands
are releasing on vinyl
these days.

67
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,621
you know what?
i think it's great,
totally original.

68
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,454
hey....

69
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,254
did i dream
that phone call last night?

70
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,200
yes, you did.

71
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,032
oh, you are such a liar.

72
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,867
what was that?
were you sleep-dialing?

73
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,767
nothing, i just--

74
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:14,940
i just had
a weird dream.

75
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,004
about me?

76
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,843
i don't remember

77
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:19,978
what it was about.

78
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,678
but don't worry, ok?

79
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,178
now, when are you going
to give this to ned?

80
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:26,011
oh, well, tim is
trying to find
some really cool records.

81
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:27,511
before his birthday,
i hope.

82
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,744
so, that's going well?

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,176
yeah, i mean,
i don't know,

84
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:36,166
it just kinda
feels comfortable.

85
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,267
you know?

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,434
even if we're
just sitting there,

87
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,033
not even talking,
it just feels right.

88
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:43,830
that's great.

89
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:46,565
yeah, well, baby steps.

90
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,565
hey, do you mind
if i hide this in the back?

91
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:49,964
uh, if you can find
a place for it

92
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:50,964
in the black hole
back there,

93
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:51,964
be my guest.

94
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,886
hey! you know what?

95
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,187
i'm going to go
get some coffee,
do you want something?

96
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,299
yeah, that'd be great.
surprise me.

97
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,934
ok.

98
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:31,157
who are you?

99
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,126
they told me
you would know.

100
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,779
who told you?

101
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,813
they said you would help.

102
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:39,543
i don't understand.

103
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,822
mary o'connell.

104
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,192
mary o'connell?

105
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:45,929
that was the beginning.

106
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,947
the beginning of what?

107
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,245
you remember what happened,
don't you, lynn?

108
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,078
don't you remember?

109
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:05,511
that day, the accident?

110
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,245
your dad
tells me you've been

111
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:22,810
making these drawings
ever since.

112
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:28,143
well, tell me, please,
why have you been
making these drawings?

113
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,744
'cause i have to.

114
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,011
but why do you have to?

115
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,577
it's in my head,
isn't it?

116
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,243
every day, i have to.

117
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,810
same as it never was.

118
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,176
hey, it's me,
i'm looking right at you.

119
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,922
i forgot to ask
if you wanted anything
from java?

120
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,740
uh, no, i'm good.
you go ahead.

121
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:25,959
you know,
i think i'll wait.

122
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,227
i want to try
and get a head start--

123
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,094
whoa!

124
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,713
i am so sorry.

125
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,079
are you ok?

126
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,761
i didn't even see you.

127
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,995
no, it really was my fault,

128
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,595
i wasn't even
paying attention.

129
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:41,129
stay off cell phones.

130
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,296
delia, are you all right?

131
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:43,929
do you want to just
go sit for a minute?

132
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,929
no, i'm ok, really,
please, i'm fine.

133
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:50,296
it was a close call,
but that's it.

134
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,296
hey, everything's fine.

135
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:53,463
next show is 2 p.m.

136
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,862
i'm going
to be here all week.

137
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,129
it's fine, please,
i'm gonna just, um...

138
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,529
i'm going to go
sit down in the shop.

139
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:24,625
ok, i get it.
it's about water.

140
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,960
all right, so this woman
died on a ferry 2 years ago,

141
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,060
or maybe she didn't,
maybe she doesn't
know how she died,

142
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,427
and you have to tell her,
i don't know.

143
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,027
it sounds
simple to me, whatever.

144
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,268
yeah, but what about
the visions
of impending death?

145
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,919
you think they all
refer to delia?

146
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,097
look, there were
5 signs this past year.

147
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,898
the dead dove, the bee,
the dead will walk,

148
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,432
 the return
 of the forgotten.

149
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,532
the only thing
that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

150
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:18,265
don't you think that
it--it could be related?

151
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,465
how do i know? you're
the one that gets
all the neat visions.

152
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,498
you drink the champagne,
i only get the hangover.

153
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,098
sorry,
guess i caught you
at a bad time.

154
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,666
oh, no, no, you caught me
at a great time.

155
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,132
you seem to be packing.

156
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,200
yes, i'm packing.

157
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,233
i am going
on a sabbatical.

158
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,834
i have
a fantastic opportunity

159
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,801
to do research
in a peruvian jungle.

160
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,582
just like that,
up and gone?

161
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,683
just like that.

162
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:39,576
nothing supernatural,
either.

163
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,443
although, i should check
and see if jungle insects
have souls,

164
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,710
i'd hate to be haunted
by an earth-bound cicada.

165
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,977
you know we never really...

166
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:52,911
we never got to talk about
everything that happened.

167
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:57,043
talking's not always
the best thing.

168
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,710
i'm in that odd place
where i may speak

169
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,877
the unadulterated truth
about everything
i think and feel.

170
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:04,818
can't have that.

171
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,852
no, we can't have that.

172
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:10,427
anyway, nope,
this is going to be great.

173
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,527
really a--just a great time
for me to take a break.

174
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:15,441
i mean you do this
10 times a week.

175
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,426
you know,
you talk to ghosts,
argue with ghosts,

176
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:18,908
 you get your heart
 broken by a ghost,

177
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,176
but for us mere mortals,
come on.

178
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:24,646
hey, hey, hey, come on.

179
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,646
this is a good thing,
be happy for me.

180
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,212
i'm going to be doing
what i do and loving it.

181
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,176
i hope you'll
keep in touch.

182
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,097
maybe, maybe not.

183
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:34,202
maybe we'll just
be 2 ships passing
in the night.

184
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,570
don't say ships.

185
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,135
hey, good morning.

186
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,136
oh, thank you!

187
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,436
boy, do i need this.

188
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:49,638
yeah, you don't look like
you got enough sleep.

189
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:50,604
you look great, too.

190
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:54,150
as do you, tired or not.

191
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,678
nice backpedal.

192
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,579
listen, i really have
to talk to you.

193
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,224
ok.

194
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:01,586

195
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,054
 pink floyd
 <i>wish you were here,</i>

196
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,460
 <i>led zep 4.</i>

197
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,427
mint condition,
still shrink-wrapped.

198
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:08,193
those are great.

199
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:09,944
where did you find these?

200
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,844
i'd rather not say.

201
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,677
in case i outlive
my usefulness, someday.

202
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:16,811
that way you'll
always come back to me

203
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,378
for the vinyl.

204
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,677
this is fantastic.

205
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,111
now all we need
is some today vinyl.

206
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:23,710
you know, bands ned
has actually heard of.

207
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,311
i'm all over it.

208
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,246
hey, you said
you needed to talk
to me about something?

209
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,880
oh, no, no,
never mind.

210
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,474
come for lunch?

211
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,173
i've got invoices
to do, but hey,

212
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,474
bring me back
something gooey.

213
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,340
all right.

214
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,940
bye.
buh-bye.

215
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
look, no offence,

216
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,706
but we're going
to have to wrap this up,

217
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,506
i don't have
flood insurance.

218
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:24,414
i know that you
died in a ferry accident
in england.

219
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,715
do you remember
anything about it?

220
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,387
the water
took my breath away.

221
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,120
i was so scared.

222
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:36,717
i'm alone now.

223
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:37,818
is there
something you need?

224
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:39,119
someone i can contact?

225
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:40,219
you can't help me.

226
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,551
why not?

227
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,052
i have to help you.

228
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,562
how can you help me?

229
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,328
is this a warning?

230
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:49,899
are you trying to tell me
something about my friend?

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,733
all eyes will be on you.

232
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,045
what do you mean?

233
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,878
i have to go
to the other place.

234
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,790
ok...

235
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,021
next time, bring a mop.

236
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,626
you say she's been
doing this for how long?

237
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,160
since the accident.

238
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:21,726
every day,
every single day.

239
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,793
can you ask her
why she keeps making these?

240
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,412
she says she has to.

241
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,480
it is in her head,
and she has to get it out.

242
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:31,257
it's too girly.

243
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:31,913
shush.

244
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,151
what do you want,
football helmets
on the curtains?

245
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:35,654
i don't want
curtains at all.

246
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:36,655
why do you want
to cover the windows?

247
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:37,976
i don't want to cover them,

248
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:39,089
 i want to enhance them.

249
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,690
this house has had
enough enhancement.

250
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:42,720
when do we say,
"finished"?

251
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,622
ah, never.

252
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,955
why do i have the feeling

253
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,622
that the words "never"
and "home improvement"

254
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,888
go hand-in-hand
together, forever?

255
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:49,589
you know what?

256
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,857
you are very impatient.

257
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,124
ok, it takes a while
to make a house a home.

258
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,142
it took a while to make
this house a house.

259
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,133
aren't you late for work?

260
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,933
fine.

261
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,786
you know
what my theory is?

262
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,821
that window treatments
destroy marriages?

263
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,775
well, yeah, that's
one of my theories.

264
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,708
but...

265
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,142
you're nervous,

266
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,775
and you're
distracted by something,

267
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:12,076
and that's why
the house is getting
another makeover.

268
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:15,409
hmm, i was hoping
to appear industrious.

269
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,276
well, you hoped wrong.

270
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:21,359
i just keep getting
these weird visions,

271
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,793
and there's
this strange ghost.

272
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,193
strange ghost, huh?

273
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:27,894
she keeps
showing me things,
and i don't know why.

274
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,528
it's like she's sad
and in mourning.

275
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:32,387
well, you think she's
trying to warn you
about something?

276
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,162
i don't usually get
stuff about the future.

277
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:36,897
you did last year.

278
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,564
that turned out
to be right.

279
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,361
i just know that i'm
not going to rest easy

280
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,496
until
i can figure this out.

281
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:42,763
and i will.

282
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,196
and until then,
we get curtains?

283
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,262
exactly!

284
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,364
what is this place?

285
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,996
part of it.

286
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,163
of what?

287
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:38,158
of what you have to know.

288
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,992
what i have to show you.

289
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,583
who sent you to me?

290
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,999
they won't let me
see my husband.

291
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:47,957
not until
i show you everything.

292
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,309
so what do you think?

293
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,390
how many times
do i have to explain

294
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,024
the meaning of the word
"sabbatical" to you?

295
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,457
definition--
leave with pay

296
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:08,657
for teacher or professor

297
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,958
for extended period
of study or rest.

298
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,291
alternate definition--

299
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:15,124
 an excuse for a confused
 and troubled man

300
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,824
who wants to forget
about his real life

301
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,691
and go and study
cicadas instead.

302
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,791
don't forget
the "with pay" part.

303
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:22,791
you know,
have you ever thought about

304
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:24,557
new curtains
for this room?

305
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,824
i don't think i've thought
about curtains, period.

306
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:28,907
there might be more
to these visions

307
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:30,074
than just
a ferry accident.

308
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,507
well, you know what?

309
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,607
these visions might not
be about just some ghost.

310
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,607
you might have
a prophet ghost.

311
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:36,607
ooh, that's a new one.

312
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:38,074
prophet ghosts
are very common

313
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,275
in all mythologies.

314
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,574
i mean, ulysses
consulted a prophet ghost

315
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:42,741
for homer's <i>odyssey.</i>

316
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:43,774
native american traditions

317
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,074
are rich
with prophet ghosts.

318
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:46,774
let's not forget about
that rockin' trio--

319
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,644
the ghosts of christmas
past, present, and future.

320
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:50,845
so dickens knew about
the prophet ghosts

321
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,797
and i don't?

322
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,620
well, he didn't know
much about curtains,

323
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,721
so i guess
it all evens out.

324
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:55,954
can i just say
that this sabbatical

325
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,287
has not improved
your mood?

326
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,520
here's another theory.
how about this?

327
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,752
how about your dreams aren't
really about the accidents.

328
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,919
they're about the symbolism
behind the accidents.

329
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:04,472
such as?

330
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:05,773
well, you have a ferry
and a water motif,

331
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,949
which makes me think
 of the river styx.

332
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:10,649
in greek mythology,
it's the river that separates
the living from the dead.

333
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:13,882
souls are ferried
across the river
into the underworld.

334
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:15,049
what about last night?

335
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,152
it was like there was

336
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:17,338
some kind of
mining accident.

337
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,403
yeah, but you said
they were all wearing
suits and ties.

338
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,455
 i would think that
 suits and ties in a mine

339
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:22,927
would be sort of
a fashion don't.

340
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,465
a tunnel collapse then?

341
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,833
a tunnel.
now you're talking.

342
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,532
that's the classic symbol
 for crossing over.

343
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,093
there were souls
following the light.

344
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:31,061
it seems like someone's
trying to get you

345
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:32,595
to intercede in something.

346
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,994
what?

347
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,782
whatever's...coming.

348
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,265
he died, my boy, for three minutes.

349
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,383
then he came back.

350
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,519
is this why you came to see him?

351
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,684
you said he's been drawing something?

352
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:55,668
everyday

353
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:57,687
since the accident .
everywhere.

354
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,928
school, the walls, 
even on pillowcases.

355
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:16,700
nice work stefano.

356
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,290
tell me why  you do this

357
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,911
i do it for her

358
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:24,504
who?

359
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,659
for her

360
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:00,180
it really does
sound better.

361
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,213
how come?

362
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,646
'cause
it's analog.

363
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,347
means it records
continuously.

364
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:06,646
digital
is cleaner,

365
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:08,695
but that's
because it has
to break it up

366
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:10,194
and reassemble it.

367
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:13,473
wow! i'm going out
with an audiophile.
who knew?

368
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,907
you're going out with a guy

369
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:17,007
who knows how to look up
stuff fast on the internet.

370
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:18,055
so this is
how you guys
listened to music

371
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:19,022
back in
the old days?

372
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,355
yeah. mm-hmm.

373
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:21,989
when dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

374
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:24,422
what are all those
crackles and pops?

375
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,922
it's just somehow

376
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,655
part of the whole
experience, you know?

377
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:30,522
when i hear it,
i am instantly
a teenager again,

378
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,563
lying on my bed,

379
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,163
dreaming about
the future.

380
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,697
hearing it makes me
feel like i have
a lot of pimples.

381
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:38,535
ooh! spoken like
a true poet.

382
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,369
oh, hey. party is over.
the boss is here.

383
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:42,369
hey! the party
is just getting
started.

384
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:43,569
ta-da!

385
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:45,036
damn! i forgot
the matches.

386
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:47,070
oh, and the candles.

387
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:49,536
and the song that
i was gonna sing to you.

388
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:50,970
i'm not very good
at birthdays.

389
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,536
hey, i still know
my part of the song.

390
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:54,836
i could sing it.
whoa! ha ha. that's ok.

391
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,436
we have a bunch of stuff
in the back.

392
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:57,536
here you go, bud.

393
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,036
hey. is that dope 6?

394
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,135
yeah!

395
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,135
tight.
nice.

396
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:03,869
yeah.
how did you know that?

397
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,070
i like music.
so do i.

398
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:07,070
yeah,
but i like music

399
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:08,703
even after 1990.

400
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,936
that hurt.
hmm.

401
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,036
hey, do you mind
if i skip out early
this afternoon?

402
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:17,184
sure. what's up?

403
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,518
i think i found a tenant
at long last

404
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:20,638
for the house
on colonial road.

405
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,706
ha ha. you mean
the <i>mansion</i>

406
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,006
on colonial road.

407
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,873
it's big, it's furnished,
and it's a rental.

408
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,173
 it sounds like
 what they need,

409
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,207
so i'm just going
to go take some pictures

410
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:29,473
and email them.

411
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,473
sure you don't mind?

412
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,606
are you kidding?

413
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,606
how many times
have you covered for me?

414
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:34,372
don't worry about it.

415
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:37,842
are you ok?

416
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:39,641
me? sure.

417
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,997
the last couple of days

418
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,598
you seemed
really distracted,

419
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,965
like something was wrong.

420
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,471
it's just stress.

421
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,971
the kind that you would
rather not know about.

422
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:50,837
hey, look, i don't--

423
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:57,033
you know how i feel
about all of this
supernatural stuff,

424
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,034
but i don't...

425
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,934
want it to put a wedge
between us.

426
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,300
i don't want to be
on the outside of
the rest of your life.

427
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:04,651
delia, this is my life.

428
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:05,951
ok? it's--
it's who i am.

429
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,318
there's no part of me

430
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:09,551
that's not
affected by it.

431
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:10,618
it's kind of like...

432
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:13,117
love me, love my ghosts.

433
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:27,487
ned! please don't
turn me into a clich?

434
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,421
just turn it down,

435
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:29,524
or i'm going
to take it away.

436
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:33,712
thank you.

437
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,563
you're gonna lose her.

438
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,496
you're gonna lose her.

439
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:06,663
you're gonna lose her.

440
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,863
you're gonna lose her.

441
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,696
you're gonna lose her.

442
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,297
you're gonna lose her.

443
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:25,963
you're gonna lose her.

444
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,364
you're gonna lose her.

445
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,629
you're gonna lose her.

446
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:32,097
you're gonna lose her.

447
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:33,397
you're gonna lose her.
you're gonna--

448
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,397
aah! aah! ahh!

449
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:40,396
???

450
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:47,931
ned...

451
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:52,052
i am so sorry.
what happened?

452
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:54,851
it was that turntable.

453
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:58,851
it started saying
weird things.

454
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,719
she tried
to turn it off, and...

455
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,118
she just froze.

456
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:05,786
i didn't even know
what was happening.

457
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:07,252
it's all right.

458
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,419
is she dead?

459
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:10,786
shh.

460
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,985
no, we don't talk
like that, all right?

461
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:16,234
ok.

462
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:17,569
she's gonna be
all right.

463
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,702
she's got a burn
on her hand,

464
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,769
she took a pretty
good jolt from
that turntable.

465
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,669
it was a freak short
or something.

466
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:27,435
yeah, maybe not so freaky.

467
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:28,869
tell me
all this later.

468
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,435
i've got to get back
out there.

469
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,635
flaherty's gonna
come stay with ned
as soon as he can.

470
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:33,836
ok.
all right.

471
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,001
bye.

472
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:53,153
???

473
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,823
melinda,
you're looking well.

474
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:55,991
what the hell
are you doing here?

475
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:58,024
good question.
it seems i'm a little early.

476
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,358
early for what?

477
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:02,038
call me sentimental.

478
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:04,228
i just can't seem
to get over grandview.

479
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:06,245
???

480
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:17,981
the guy's a freak.

481
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,917
he plastered a whole room
with your photograph.

482
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:21,383
he's stalking you.

483
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,216
yeah, i know.
i was there.

484
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,652
what was he doin'
at the hospital?

485
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,484
i don't know
exactly,

486
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:29,118
but he said he was
a little early.

487
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,494
little early, for what?

488
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,733
wait, you don't think
he was going to try
to grab delia's soul--

489
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,833
don't even say it.

490
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,100
you gotta think
gabriel had something
to do with this.

491
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:41,275
i mean, is this about
death of a loved one?

492
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,415
i don't know.

493
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,050
but i'm...scared.

494
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:49,831
i feel like
there's this game
being played,

495
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,330
and i'm the only one
who doesn't know
what it is.

496
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,625
you're not the only one.

497
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:57,293
and you will never be
the only one.

498
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,260
you're not alone.

499
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,336
aah!

500
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,131
aahh!

501
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:09,878
why are you showing me
all of this?
what does it mean?

502
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,179
so you can know
who to save.

503
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:13,678
why can't you tell me?

504
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:16,446
it's not for me
to know.

505
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:35,593
it was raining cars

506
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,564
and you didn't call me?
i did call you.

507
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,916
yeah, after the fun,
as usual.

508
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:42,787
all right, this is
what we have so far.

509
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:43,649
we have a prophet ghost

510
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,455
who's showing you
visions of
big disasters,

511
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:47,888
and these disasters
are metaphorical
for death itself.

512
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,755
you have a ferry,
you have a bridge
and a tunnel.

513
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:51,589
these are all
mythological journeys
of the soul.

514
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,097
and weird visions
of someone's death,
i think, delia's.

515
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,997
well, that could
bring to mind

516
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:58,897
the death of a loved one
warning that we had,

517
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,663
and last night
she almost
got fried, right?

518
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,230
uh, i would put it
a ???

519
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:04,830
but, yes.
and gabriel was there,

520
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,630
just hanging out
at the hospital
like a vulture.

521
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:09,197
yeah, the self-proclaimed
collector of souls

522
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:10,897
awaiting his spoils.

523
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:12,730
you gotta admit,
i turn a good phrase
now and then.

524
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,497
focus.
please stay focused.

525
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,596
all right, all right,
look, this is what's happening.

526
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,497
it's so secret
that in the past year,

527
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:20,431
the way things
have been going,

528
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,075
ghosts being able
to do things they never
could before,

529
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:23,442
it doesn't take
a genius to see

530
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:25,076
that the whole order
of things is being
shaken up,

531
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,409
that the veil between
the living and the dead
is very weak.

532
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,542
yeah, and all eyes
are on me, so what
do we do?

533
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,809
we?
oh, come on!

534
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,542
you can't tell me that
you're gonna leave now.

535
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,909
i mean,
with the thin veil
and everything?

536
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,475
oh, no, i should stay here
where cars fall from the sky

537
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,442
and wives betray me
from beyond the grave.

538
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,713
quitter.

539
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:41,347
look, melinda...

540
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:43,634
i'm gonna help you
do this.

541
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,901
you're the bravest person
i've ever met in my life,

542
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:48,493
and i won't quit on you.

543
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,994
and?

544
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:52,662
i'm waiting
for the joke.

545
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,529
yeah, i can't think of one.

546
00:34:58,828 --> 00:35:01,362
the peruvian job
is gonna have to wait.

547
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:06,928
heh heh, all right, hey,

548
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,629
let's go tell delia
to watch her back.

549
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:15,895
so what am i
supposed to do,
just run away?

550
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:18,295
andrea was killed
last year, you know that.

551
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:20,429
yeah, because
of a plane crash.

552
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:24,029
because she knew what i knew,
and she acted on it.

553
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,863
look, if i had
never told her
what i could do,

554
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,963
then i wouldn't have had
to tell her about the signs
that i was getting,

555
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,730
and she never would have
gotten in her car.

556
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,229
so what are you saying?

557
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,996
that there's gonna be
another plane crash?

558
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:34,999
i don't know
what there's gonna be, ok?

559
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,434
but i keep getting signs
and having dreams,

560
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,934
and i think that they
involve you.

561
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,867
i think that they're trying
to hurt me by hurting
the people that i love.

562
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:46,878
you could be in danger.

563
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:50,946
jim could be in danger,
and i think that's
what happened last night.

564
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,876
last night was
an electrical problem
with an old turntable.

565
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:57,077
yes, it scared
the hell out of me,
but there was no--

566
00:35:57,144 --> 00:36:00,710
ned told me about the voices
on the turntable.

567
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:03,245
the record
was skipping, melinda.

568
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,845
please.

569
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,078
ahem. if i could
barge into
this conversation.

570
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:10,837
um, i teach this type
of thing at the university,

571
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,205
i made a lifetime
studying it,

572
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:14,338
and i'm the world's
biggest skeptic.

573
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:15,704
until i met melinda,

574
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:18,138
i never believed in anything
i couldn't touch or see.

575
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:20,005
see, i'm a man of science,
miss banks.

576
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:23,171
although i've also
been taken for a man
of mystery,

577
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:24,738
man of intrigue--

578
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:27,671
is there a caboose
to this train
of thought, professor?

579
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:29,704
yes, there is.

580
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,471
you can fight it,
you can deny it,

581
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,205
 you can turn
 a blind eye to it,

582
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:34,905
but to quote
william shakespeare,

583
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:37,638
"there is more in heaven
in earth, horatio,"

584
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:41,604
or in this case, delia,
"that can be dreamt of
in your philosophy."

585
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,606
point, please.

586
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:45,207
the point...

587
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:50,952
the point is
what do you lose
by believing?

588
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:58,419
i think there is
something

589
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,419
very special
about you,
melinda, i do.

590
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,853
i believe
you feel things,

591
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:07,219
maybe even see things
that we can't.

592
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:09,281
are they ghosts,
can they hurt us,

593
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:14,082
can they actually change
the course of our lives
from beyond the grave?

594
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,849
i'm asking you
to believe that they are,

595
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:19,822
and that they do.

596
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,556
and i need you
to believe it,

597
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:24,922
because i need you
to be safe.

598
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:32,256
ok.

599
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:36,089
i believe you.

600
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,974
this is one of those
female bonding moments,
isn't it?

601
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:56,463
you've got to see this.

602
00:38:56,494 --> 00:38:58,095
hey, uh, come on in.
don't be shy or anything.

603
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:01,120
it's not like it's 12:30
in the morning.

604
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:03,420
ok, this is about
the past and the future.

605
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:04,786
that's a pretty
sweeping statement.

606
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:05,886
you could be talking
about my credit
rating, or--

607
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:07,786
ok, just listen.

608
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,089
 we have been assuming
 that these visions

609
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,689
have been some sort
of sign or warning
that something's to come.

610
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,323
how's your italian?
 <i>bene.</i>

611
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:21,984
well?

612
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,987
no, that's it. <i>bene.</i>
that's the italian i know.

613
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,975
i'm gonna kill him.

614
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,941
all right,
look at the date.

615
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:29,842
uh...

616
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:31,135
may 11, 2003.

617
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,637
ok, this bridge
collapsed 4 years ago,

618
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,942
killing more than
111 people.

619
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:36,976
then, a ferry
sinks off the coast
of england

620
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,543
may 11, 2005.

621
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,777
the tunnel vision?

622
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,510
a subway collapse
in moscow

623
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,243
on may 11, 2004.

624
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,310
flash forward.

625
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,810
plane crash
outside of grandview

626
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,110
may 11, 2006.

627
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:50,943
a terrible tragedy,
hundreds dead,

628
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,043
same date, same time,
all within the last
4 years.

629
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,744
this has been about stuff
that already happened.

630
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:58,813
what are you doing?

631
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,826
well, this might still
all be about the future.

632
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,827
how? all the visions
are accounted for.

633
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:04,760
yes, but there were
5 signs, melinda.

634
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:07,227
the, uh, the tunnel.
how many killed?
32, right?

635
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:09,893
3 plus 2 equals 5. next?

636
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,493
the ferry sinking,
311 dead.

637
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,927
3 plus one plus one, 5.

638
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,693
and how about
the bridge?

639
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,727
111 people,
2 on the ground.

640
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:21,693
one plus one plus one
plus two, 5.

641
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,526
ok, but wait.
the plane trash killed 238.

642
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:25,860
no, it didn't,

643
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,626
'cause the initial
reports were wrong.

644
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,593
family members
reporting the missing
were so frantic,

645
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,394
they reported them
missing 2, 3 times over.

646
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:34,560
and some of the people
that were pronounced dead

647
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,893
weren't even on the flight.

648
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,927
the official number's now
228 passengers,

649
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:41,660
and there were 2 victims
on the ground, that's 230.

650
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,760
look at this.

651
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:48,727
that's 230,
2 plus 3 equals 5.

652
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,994
this is all about fives.

653
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,394
5 signs, 4 accidents.

654
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:54,893
now we've come
full circle,

655
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,760
which means
something else
is going to happen

656
00:40:56,827 --> 00:40:58,827
at the same time,
same date.

657
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:01,227
may 11, 2007.

658
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:05,960
one week from tonight.

659
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:14,427
