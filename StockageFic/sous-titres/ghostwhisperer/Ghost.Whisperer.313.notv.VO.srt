1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,480
Don't worry about that.I'll finish up.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,770
Jim's got the late shift,
so no one's waiting at home.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,140
Oh, i don't mind.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,990
No one's waiting for
me at home, neither.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,690
Is ned out with his basketball friends?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,990
Not exactly.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,060
Ok, what's going on?

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,710
Nothing.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
Or at least that's what
i keep telling myself.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,240
Ned's on a date.

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Like a date-date, with a girl?

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,970
Is it his first one? Because...

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,260
You don't seem very pleased.

14
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,350
I am trying so hard not
to be overprotective.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,500
Well, what is there to protect
him from? He's on a date.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,260
What's there to protect
him from? Are you kidding?

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,900
He could get his heart broken,
he could catch a disease.

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,520
And what do i know
about this girl? Right?

19
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,840
She could be into drugs, she
could be into self mutilation,

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,270
She could be into animal sacrifice.

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,490
Animal sacrifice?

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,050
You know what i mean.

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,870
Not really, no.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,830
What wouldn't a teenage boy do if
you promised to take your shirt off?

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,240
What wouldn't jim do now?

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,290
You think this is funny.

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,500
Yes. Look, i love you, but you
are not making any sense.Ok?

28
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,940
Ned is a smart kid.

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,410
Besides, it's his first date, right?

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,280
So they probably haven't
even held hands yet.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,400
Was that ok? I mean...

32
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,780
I hope that it's ok that i kissed you.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,530
So... It was ok then.

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,740
Um, maybe we can get
together again sometime?

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,660
Yeah. I'd like that.

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,550
Great. Awesome.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,340
I gotta get in, it's late.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,270
Hey, lisa, you forgot
your sweatshirt--

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,270
Lisa?

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,340
I'm just dropping your sweater inside.

41
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,490
I'll see you at school, ok?

42
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,420
Your mom just left.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,860
I know. I watched her go.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,080
What happened to your nose?

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,180
I walked into a door.

46
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,410
Here, let me help you.

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,000
Now what happened, really?

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
If i tell you something,
you promise not to tell her?

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,320
No, i do not keep secrets from
your mom, and neither should you.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,830
It might be about a ghost.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,740
Well, maybe your mom doesn't
need to know about that.

52
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,810
What happened?

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,050
Ever since i started being with
lisa, it's felt like we weren't alone.

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,070
Maybe i'm just a loser who doesn't
know how to act around girls,

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,210
But with all the weird stuff that
happens whenever i'm with her;

56
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,640
All the accidents and whatever, it's
like there's something else going on.

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,340
And then when she told me that
her dad had died a while ago.

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,660
Now, i know what you're thinking.

59
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,400
That you never should have taught me about
ghosts, because now i see them everywhere.

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,510
Uh, no, that's--that's
not what i was thinking.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,880
What, did you see something?

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,460
I see things all the time.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,880
Doesn't have to mean anything.

64
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,630
How did lisa's father die?

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
Some kind of accident.

66
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370
She doesn't talk about it much.

67
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,680
Well, i'll make you a deal.

68
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,190
Um, if you can stay away from lisa for a
little while, i'll look into it for you.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,810
Come on, why can't i see her?

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,290
Or i can talk to your mother.

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,690
Ok, fine.

72
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,720
Hey, ned?

73
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,160
Be careful.

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,170
********About a ghost
that's haunting her son?

78
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,860
Yeah, and i feel even worse that ned's
out there unprotected, but what can i do?

79
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,580
I mean, i can't follow
him around all day,

80
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,610
And it doesn't do any good to scare
delia when i don't know anything.

81
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,740
Best way i can protect ned is to figure
out who this ghost is and cross him over.

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,860
And you think the ghost is
ned's girlfriend's father?

83
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,440
Maybe. Check this out.

84
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,800
According to this, 2 years ago nathan
benton died in his auto repair shop

85
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,630
When a car fell on top of him.

86
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,950
When you saw the ghost, was he
wearing a mechanic's uniform?

87
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,160
No, but that doesn't mean anything.

88
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,180
He could have died later in
the hospital or something.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,390
What else do you remember about him?

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,660
He had a lot of bruises on his face.

91
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,250
Kinda like you'd have
if a car fell on you?

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,030
Well, i mean that would
explain the nasty mood.

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,880
Lisa: why weren't you
in campbell's class?

94
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,530
Ned: oh, i was in the
library studying for bio.

95
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,850
I've got a test tomorrow.

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,170
That's good, because i was beginning to get
the feeling that you didn't want to see me.

97
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,080
Not at all. You have no idea.

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,850
I don't want to scare you away, but...

99
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
My life's been kind of weird lately.

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,560
And it just means a lot to have
someone like you; someone who listens,

101
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,290
And you make me feel like
i have some place safe.

102
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,810
Oh, my god!

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,140
Oh, my god, ned, this can't happen!

104
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,100
She's gonna kill me!

105
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,290
Who, your mom?

106
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,130
I can't get in trouble!

107
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,630
You don't know what's
going to happen to me!

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,450
Don't worry. I'll just
say that it was my fault.

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,560
I can't let you do that.

110
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,840
Maybe it won't matter. Maybe nobody saw.

111
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,540
Out of the car. Both of you.Now.

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,810
You two are so lucky nobody got hurt.

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,830
Lisa, where's your mom?

114
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
I just called her.

115
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,830
She should be here any minute.

116
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,290
Well, i don't know what
she's going to do with you,

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,880
But i can tell you ned is going to
pay for his share of the damages.

118
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,360
Since both of you were in the backseat,
it's kind of hard to tell who's at fault.

119
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,980
- Mom!
- What, ned?

120
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,780
Is there something i'm missing here?

121
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,310
Lisa! Get in the car.

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,890
You're in a lot of trouble.

123
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,680
Um, excuse me. I'm
ned's mother.Who are you?

124
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm sorry. My name's
amy.I'm lisa's sister.

125
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,340
Where's your mother?

126
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,320
She's at work, and she feels incredibly
bad, but she just couldn't get away.

127
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,830
She said to tell you she'll
call you as soon as she can.

128
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,530
Ok, well, i hope it's soon.

129
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,590
Definitely. Bye.

130
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
Ok.

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,000
Start at the beginning, and
don't leave anything out.

132
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,610
Hey, is everything ok with ned?

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,120
Did you tell him that the ghost of his
girlfriend's father was haunting him?

134
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,010
I saw a ghost around ned, and i told him
that i would find out if it was haunting him.

135
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,190
I didn't ask if you saw a ghost.

136
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,180
I asked if-- we are talking about
you keeping secrets with my son,

137
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,360
Which frankly, i don't understand how you
can do after what happened with his father.

138
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,440
Ok, i knew that you were going
to get upset about this topic,

139
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,400
And i shouldn't have kept it from you.

140
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,990
Ok.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,410
Look, i know you're trying
to help, but next time--

143
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,760
I will tell you everything i know.

144
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,820
Ok.

145
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,380
Well, what do you know?

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,070
Lisa's father died in an
accident in his auto repair shop.

147
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,880
So he knew about cars, which might
explain the parking lot business,

148
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,660
And it seemed like he
had a logical motive--

149
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,490
Protecting his child.

150
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,040
From ned?

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,310
I remember that you had
the same fears about lisa.

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,940
Yes, and i was right.

153
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,920
Have you talked to her mother yet?

154
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,110
She called. She apologized up and down.

155
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,260
She said it was all her daughter's fault,
that she wasn't going to charge ned a thing.

156
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,460
So we're gonna get together
later and talk about it.

157
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,390
Good.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,330
Look, melinda, maybe...

159
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,040
You shoul  go over there
and snoop around, you know?

160
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,640
If there really is a ghost...

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,610
That was my next move.

162
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Who is it?

163
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,330
Hi, uh, i'm melinda gordon,
a friend of ned banks.

164
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh, hi.

165
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
Ned's talked about you before.

166
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,930
You work with his mom.

167
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,250
Are you lisa?

168
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,630
Did you want to talk to my mom?

169
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,430
I do, but i'd actually like to
talk to you first if you don't mind.

170
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,930
Can i come in?

171
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,570
You know what, it's
such a nice afternoon.

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,730
- Why don't we just sit out here?
- Ok.

173
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,610
Look, i came here because...

174
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,250
I know that ned likes
you, and i want to help.

175
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,980
So do you mind if i
ask you a few questions?

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,520
About what?

177
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,210
I don't know if you'll understand the connection,
but i wanted to know more about your father.

178
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,490
Hi, i'm amy.

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,220
I'm lisa's sister.

180
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,870
Did i overhear that
you're a friend of ned's?

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,730
Yes, hi. Melinda, nice to meet you.

182
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,750
Did lisa offer you anything to drink?

183
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,220
Some tea, maybe?

184
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,100
You know, i don't think i even gave her the
chance, but that would be great, thank you.

185
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,680
- I'll tell mom you're here.
- Ok.

186
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,200
Go say hello, henry.

187
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,560
Hi, i'm henry. It's nice to meet you.

188
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,040
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

189
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,400
I've never met such a polite family.

190
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,120
Woman: lisa, sweetheart, can
i talk to you for a minute?

191
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,990
That's mom. I'll be right back.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ok.

193
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,200
So, how long have you
guys lived in grandview?

194
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,940
Oh, what was it... 3 years?

195
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,900
I lose count.

196
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,970
3 1/2. I was 9.

197
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,840
Mom says she's getting a migraine.

198
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,490
She's seeing her shapes and spots.

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,920
Yeah, i think i know what that's like.

200
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,030
We're going to go help her out.

201
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,060
- Bye.
- Bye.

202
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,400
You know, i should just
come back later, maybe,

203
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,460
'Cause it sounds like you need
to go and take care of your mom.

204
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,440
Yeah. Come back tomorrow
when she's feeling better.

205
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,570
Ok. I will.

206
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,630
Really nice garden.

207
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,960
I've never seen such
beautiful snapdragons.

208
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,020
Oh, they're hybrids. Thanks.

209
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,990
Are you a friend of the bentons?

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,040
A new friend, yes.

211
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,050
They haven't had the
best of luck, have they?

212
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,650
Hmm, not really.

213
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,490
You know, i didn't know
nathan... Very well.

214
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
What was he like?

215
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,020
He wasn't a very nice person.

216
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,390
Not just to me.

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,680
What does that mean?

218
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,310
He was always yelling at me to trim my trees,
even if they hung over one inch into his yard.

219
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,170
Said he was afraid that the branches were
going to fall on the kids, but honestly!

220
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,760
So he was a little overprotective.

221
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,630
You should have seen the
way he treated those kids.

222
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,900
I have never seen anything like it.

223
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,120
He didn't let them out of that house for
the whole first month that they lived there,

224
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,880
Not even for a minute. I mean...

225
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,620
I'm not saying things are
any easier for karen now.

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,480
She has to work 2 shifts at that phone
rep job just to support the kids. But...

227
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,450
I think things are starting to look up.

228
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,530
How so?

229
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,850
Well, i see her getting dressed up
and going out every once in a while.

230
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,700
I think she's finally met someone.

231
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,630
And she's gardening again, and
she says the sweetest things

232
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,230
about my flowers, and my trees.

233
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,270
Good to hear.

234
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,770
Thanks.

235
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,790
Stay away!

236
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,250
My family belongs to me!

237
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,830
The ghost is behaving in death
the same way he did in life--

238
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,930
Overprotective, smothering, controlling.

239
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,090
Yeah, but the weird part is, it's
like they all knew he was there.

240
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,690
How do you mean?

241
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,540
Well, if he's dead, you know,
why be on your best behavior?

242
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
These kids were being so polite.

243
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,290
And the mom, when she got her migraine,
said that she was seeing shapes and spots.

244
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,180
I mean, maybe she's actually just
seeing a manifestation of him.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Is that possible?

246
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,740
I don't know.

247
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,130
But if he moves enough stuff around, they
don't have to see him to know he's there.

248
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,010
Yeah.

249
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,310
Well, you know you're describing
the behavior of an abuser.

250
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,050
That's exactly what i was thinking.

251
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,990
Well, they isolate people from any relationship
that will take their victims away from them.

252
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,340
Well, i know he doesn't
want lisa to be with ned,

253
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,010
And i'm guess he's not a big
fan of his wife's new boyfriend.

254
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,500
And you.

255
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,150
I'll be careful, ok?

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,320
- I promise.
- Ok.

257
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,610
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

258
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,710
Hi, delia.

259
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,100
I know you're down here.

260
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
Nathan?

261
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,620
Please talk to me.

262
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,870
I just want to help you.

263
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,360
I want to help your family.

264
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,550
Melinda, are you ok?

265
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,880
What happened to you?

266
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,700
I don't... Know.

267
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,670
A vision, i think?

268
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,850
I was reliving someone
else's experience.

269
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,600
Of what?

270
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,370
Of being hit, knocked to the ground.

271
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,120
Is this about ned's ghost?

272
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,120
Is ned in any kind of danger?

273
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,370
This is so wrong.
It's so totally unfair.

274
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,150
No, it's not, ned.

275
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,580
If your child was in danger,
you'd do the very same thing.

276
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,750
In danger from what?

277
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,490
From the whole bad situation!

278
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,660
What situation?

279
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,380
The house, that family, everything.

280
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,740
You mean the ghost.

281
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,220
Ok, the ghost.

282
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,690
You're such a hypocrite!

283
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,620
First you yell at melinda for
talking to me about ghosts,

284
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,460
And now you say i can't
see lisa because of one.

285
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,000
What am i supposed to think?

286
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,420
The first time you see her,
you get your nose bloody.

287
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,750
It wasn't the first time.

288
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,580
The first 5 times you had no
problem, until i said the word "date,"

289
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,820
And all of a sudden you
started freaking out.

290
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,610
Yes, and then the next time you saw
her, you get into a car accident.

291
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,050
I have been trying to meet with her mother
ever since, and she keeps rescheduling on me!

292
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,600
She's a widow trying to raise
her kids alone, just like you.

293
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,140
She is not like me, ned.

294
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,780
I keep my appointments.

295
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,060
What are you really
afraid of, mom? Tell me.

296
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,610
Because i'm pretty sure it's not ghosts.

297
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,930
I am not afraid of anything.

298
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,710
Good. Then i can see lisa.

299
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,330
No. No, ned, you can't.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,100
Try and stop me.

301
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,410
Ned...

302
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,680
Ned, come back here!

303
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,490
She's so overprotective, it's nuts.

304
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,170
She won't let me out of her sight.

305
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,930
I feel ya.

306
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,950
Your mom ever get like that?

307
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,620
My mom, my dad.

308
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,430
I hope it's ok melinda came over.

309
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,200
She wanted to ask about your dad.

310
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,980
Ned, do you ever think that
maybe your mom might be right?

311
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,800
About being with me?

312
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,670
No way. Why?

313
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,610
Remember i told you
before that my family...

314
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,730
My life's been a
little bit weird lately?

315
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,180
Yeah.

316
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,060
Never mind.

317
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,580
Look, i can't explain.

318
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,470
Maybe we should just try and be friends.

319
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,100
Lisa, wait.

320
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,390
Whatever it is you don't think you
can tell me, maybe i'd understand.

321
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,940
Maybe i already do.

322
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,970
I'm sorry, i gotta go.

323
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,720
Nathan?

324
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,170
I know you feel like you're doing what's
best for your family and your children.

325
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,540
Maybe you think you're
being a good parent.

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
But you're not.

327
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,520
You're hurting them, still.

328
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,550
Uh, excuse me?

329
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,850
But what are you doing here?

330
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,430
Amy. Look, um...

331
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,880
I know that you lost your dad, and
that's hard for you and your mom.

332
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,390
But i think you've seen some
things and felt some things that

333
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,930
Maybe you can't explain,
and that's really scary.

334
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,720
No, no, what's scary is you, sneaking
into our yard when our mom isn't here

335
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,900
And asking us all sorts
of weird questions.

336
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,840
I really need you to hear this.

337
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,020
Your father is still
here, i've seen him.

338
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,540
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,260
I know it sounds strange,
but i can see ghosts.

340
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,060
You've seen dad?

341
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,000
What does he look like?

342
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,030
She's lying. Don't ask her that.

343
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,060
I can only see them the way that they died, which
means that he may not look how you remember  im.

344
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,750
He's wearing a sweatshirt, and
there's bruises on his face--

345
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,730
Ok, you know what...

346
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,690
You need to leave.

347
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,530
Come on, let's go inside.

348
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,820
Amy, please just tell your mom.
If you don't, i will.But your--

349
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,810
Your father needs help
crossing into the light.

350
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,160
I said... Leave.

351
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,120
Hey, i got your call. What's wrong?

352
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,830
We didn't want to admit it, but you
and melinda, you sorta guessed right.

353
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,840
Things aren't right at our house.

354
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,850
Admit what? Lisa?

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,670
Mom's gone. She's missing.

356
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,120
We were afraid to tell anyone, 'cause
people might say she's not a fit mom.

357
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,900
What people?

358
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,500
Social services.

359
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,940
People like that.

360
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,520
See, she started seeing this guy.

361
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,470
His name's steve, but he lives
out of town, like an hour's drive.

362
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,950
She wanted to be with him.

363
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,810
We said that it would be ok on our own
for a night, but we haven't seen her since.

364
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,170
How long's she been gone?

365
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,110
2 days.

366
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,170
We keep calling her cell, and nothing.

367
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,120
I don't know what to do,
ned. I don't know what to do.

368
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,340
First thing?

369
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,680
We tell the police.

370
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,390
Keep your eye on the
kids. Take them with you.

371
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Really? They had to bring the kids here?

372
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,530
They just need somebody to
identify the mother's belongings.

373
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,980
Her belongings? What did they find?

374
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,330
Nothing. Her purse is on the front
seat, keys are in the ignition,

375
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,750
Driver's side door is wide open,
there's not a scratch on this car,

376
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,720
And the engine started right up.

377
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,180
The kids say she was on her
way to meet her boyfriend.

378
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,520
So do they think she was
carjacked, the police, or kidnapped?

379
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,470
Probably, but, uh...

380
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,750
More important, do you?

381
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,920
No That's the good news.

382
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,850
Bad news is...

383
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,640
He's here.

384
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,500
Thank you. And thank
you very much for coming.

385
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,480
Man: absolutely.

386
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,950
Hey, henry. Are you ok?

387
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,900
Yeah.

388
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,280
What book are you reading?

389
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,170
It's nothing.

390
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,390
Can i see it?

391
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
Memory book for dad.

392
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,630
Did you make this?

393
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,980
We all did.

394
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,390
It's beautiful.

395
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,910
You really loved your dad, didn't you?

396
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,940
Must be hard...

397
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,910
To hear things that are critical.

398
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,110
It's hard to hear things that arewrong.

399
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,150
What do you mean?

400
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,880
My dad wasn't like that.

401
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,900
He wasn't mean or scary.

402
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,590
He was awesome.

403
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,560
Well, i-- i really want
to believe that, but...

404
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,290
What about when you first moved here?

405
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,120
I mean, someone told me that he
wouldn't even let you out of the house.

406
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,340
We had measles. Of course not.

407
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,460
You had measles?

408
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,950
Yeah. That's when we made
our first memory book.

409
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,530
I think it was called
the great outdoors.

410
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,720
Dad quit his job to come home and
stay with us until we got better.

411
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,800
those flowers...

412
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,430
Amy: oh, my god, mom. Oh, my god!

413
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
I'm so glad you're ok!

414
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,600
Where have you been?

415
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,810
The whole town's been
going nuts worrying!

416
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,700
You called.

417
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,260
No, no there are no
messages, we didn't get any.

418
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,830
When are you coming home?

419
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,030
Ok.

420
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,150
Ok, well, call back as soon as you can.

421
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,550
I'm so glad you're ok. I love you.

422
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,730
Bye.

423
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,660
That was mom!

424
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,800
She's ok! She's coming home!

425
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,550
Henry: that's great!

426
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,520
She's all right. Awesome.

427
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,980
Bye. Thanks.Bye.

428
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,990
You guys...

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,040
She's still here.

430
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,320
Everybody's left. Is
there something you need?

431
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,460
Morning glories.

432
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,520
Were those one o  her favorites?

433
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,730
Your mom?

434
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,620
You know, i noticed them before.

435
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,730
It just... Didn't hit me.

436
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,020
These only bloom early in the morning, and the sun's
pretty high in the sky right now, and look at 'em.

437
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,790
Wide open, beautiful.

438
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,880
Her spirit's affecting them.

439
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,450
They can sense her just like you have.

440
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,050
Wait, so first you're seeing dad's ghost, and
now you're--you're saying you're seeing mom's?

441
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,360
Was it cancer?

442
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,730
Is that how she lost all her hair?

443
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,540
'Cause i saw a picture of her inside,
and she looks so different now.

444
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,330
She's still sick?

445
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,850
- Is she hurting?
- Henry...

446
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,660
No, sweetheart.

447
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,650
She's not hurting anymore.

448
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,780
All the pain's gone.

449
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,550
No, i just talked to mom, she's fine.

450
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,480
Yeah, i found this, where you left it.

451
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,040
There was an outgoing call made to
this house at exactly the same time

452
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,370
You said you were on
the phone with your mom.

453
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,560
Ok. Whatever you think you're
doing for us, we're not interested.

454
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,300
- We're going inside, come on!
- Is this how she wanted it?

455
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,090
She wanted her death to be a secret?

456
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,680
Is that why you buried her here?

457
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,940
You guys...

458
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,790
How could you be so stupid?

459
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,460
How could you bring her here?

460
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,320
Is she here?

461
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,210
How long have they lived alone?

462
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,040
They're not alone,
that is the whole point!

463
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,870
You've ruined everything!

464
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,000
You've destroyed my family!

465
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,680
So one call from you and police send over
their burliest men with picks and shovels.

466
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,180
I said you told me the truth, so for your
own sake, please don't make me a liar.

467
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,130
You said your mom was sick.

468
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,370
She fought it so hard.

469
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,450
She had so many rounds of chemo,
and that's why she lost her hair.

470
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,350
She got weak and thin, and any
little thing would bruise her.

471
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,200
Why? It's not fair!

472
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
So the spirit you saw...

473
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,160
We knew you were talking about your mom,

474
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,430
And we knew it would only be a matter
of time before you realized that, too.

475
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,330
So you pretended she was kidnapped.

476
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,660
You weren't the only one looking for her,
so we had to buy time, figure out what to do.

477
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,840
What made you decide to hide her death?

478
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,220
It was mom's idea.

479
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,050
She wanted us to be
together no matter what.

480
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,770
How long have you guys been on your own?

481
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,360
Mom died last fall.

482
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,290
We wanted her to always be with us.

483
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,760
It was the only way to keep her close.

484
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,740
I'm gonna be 18 in a few months, and
the  i can legally file for custody.

485
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,030
How many months?

486
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,630
i don't understand.

487
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,690
The neighbors said that she saw
your mother leaving on dates.

488
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,950
We had a sitter.

489
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,060
She'd come at night and help henry with
his homework and do some grocery shopping.

490
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,570
And let me guess, she just
happens to look like your mom.

491
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,710
So the voice that i heard coming from inside
the house, the woman on the phone with delia,

492
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,540
The one that's been talking to all
the neighbors, that's--that's all you.

493
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,730
Mom taught me how to do her job.

494
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,320
She taught me how to be her.

495
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,080
Mom knew she was dying.

496
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,100
Her job has benefits--
health insurance.

497
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,770
And it's not like we're stealing.

498
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,170
I'm doing the work.

499
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,450
And the house is kept clean, we're
fed, lisa and henry get straight as.

500
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,700
What about you?

501
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,200
How many days of school have you missed?

502
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,950
Do you even have friends anymore?

503
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,330
I'm fine.

504
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,560
We're fine.

505
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,370
And it's hard, but mom was tough,
so we have to be tough, too.

506
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,680
You're not fine.

507
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,600
Look around you.

508
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,830
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

509
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,280
mom!

510
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,260
Mom!

511
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,160
Henry

512
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,220
Henry, wait.

513
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,390
I warned you to leave them alone.

514
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,240
I couldn't, because you did.

515
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,860
Look, i didn't know that you were
sick, and i'm sorry that you died,

516
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,850
But you have to move on,
you have to let them go.

517
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,090
Go? Go where?

518
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,690
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

519
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,670
There are people who
will take care of them.

520
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,720
The county, you mean.

521
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,750
Didn't you have any
relatives? Did your husband?

522
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,170
There's no one.

523
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,950
Well, what about friends?

524
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,260
I mean, you went through the
trouble of doing all this planning.

525
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,310
Didn't you make out a will
or specify any custody?

526
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,840
Do you think i didn't try?

527
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,730
Who wants 3 grieving
orphans in their home?

528
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,020
The system can hardly
place 2 siblings together.

529
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,850
There's a social worker now.

530
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,130
I just wanted them to stay a family.

531
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,060
That doesn't have to change.

532
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,540
You couldn't be more wrong.

533
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,230
Lisa: i just wanted to say i'm sorry.

534
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,670
I couldn't tell you, i just couldn't.

535
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,840
Ned: no, i feel bad.

536
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,900
If i hadn't pushed to get closer, maybe
you guys could have just gone alone.

537
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,550
None of this would have happened
if i didn't like you so much.

538
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,700
I do, ned.

539
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,380
You hear me, right?

540
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,980
Yeah. I hear you.

541
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,260
I have to go.

542
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,920
Can i see you tomorrow?

543
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,600
I'd love that.

544
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,500
You kids are incredible.

545
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,210
You didn't let me cook,
at least let me clean up.

546
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,960
We have an alternating chore list.

547
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,170
We like to stick to it.

548
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,530
Look, i--i know that
foster care sounds...

549
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,800
Scary, but it's not.

550
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,120
I don't know very much about it.

551
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah, the social worker seemed nice.

552
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,650
Let me get that.

553
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,150
To think after all these months you were
here by yourself, it just breaks my heart.

554
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,390
Lisa, we should take henry upstairs and get his
schoolwork together for the social worker tomorrow.

555
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,120
Oh, well, i'll come
up and help you kids.

556
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,160
This lock is broken.

557
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,360
Could you have mr. Alden fix it?

558
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,800
Oh, i'm not
sure.I, um--

559
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,400
could you call him?

560
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,860
Because if they take us from the house tomorrow
and the door's broken, someone might break in.

561
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,340
- Oh, yeah, ok.
- Thanks.

562
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,200
Come on, guys, it's late.

563
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,490
Hi, honey, can you call me on the cell?

564
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,130
I'm over here
with those poor--

565
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,450
kids, are you all right?

566
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,620
Amy: yeah, we're fine.

567
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,200
Um, there's a fuse box in
the cellar. Can you get it?

568
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,980
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, honey, i'll get it.

569
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,750
Come on.

570
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,410
Did you get the tickets?

571
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,120
- Where are we going?
- Just walk.

572
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,680
The cashier at the bus
station cut up the credit card.

573
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,500
"deceased," she said.

574
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,900
I took off before she
could call security.

575
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,560
It's ok, we still have cash.

576
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,350
How much cash?

577
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,530
How long can it last us?

578
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,430
Just keep walking.

579
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,900
Where are we going to go,
what are we going to do?

580
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,880
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

581
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,540
What about the house?

582
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,640
What about mom and dad's
stuff? What about our life here?

583
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,180
Don't you get it? That's already gone.

584
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,290
We're not gonna be in that house.

585
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,050
And you can pack up your stuff and take
it to some orphanage or halfway house

586
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,170
- or whatever will take you.
- All right, stop.

587
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,760
You're scaring me.

588
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,120
Yeah, well, you should be scared.

589
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,150
Because if you think you're gonna end up with a
nice family with lisa tucking you in every night,

590
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,260
- You're not.
- Shut up.

591
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,700
Look...

592
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,950
I'm almost 18, but you guys...

593
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,900
Who's going to want you

594
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,740
Freaks who stuck their
own mother in the ground.

595
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,820
Now, i'm scared, too, but
this is what mom told us to do.

596
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,020
We have to stick together,
we have to be tough.

597
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,360
Ok.

598
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,470
We have to go.

599
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,070
Henry? Henry?Henry!

600
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,850
Where'd he go?

601
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,770
Henry? Henry?

602
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,020
Henry: sorry, you guys.

603
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,890
But i just can't do this anymore.

604
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,890
Yeah, murph overheard the a.d.a
and the social worker talking.

605
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Medical records have
confirmed their mom had cancer,

606
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,290
Nobody wants to press charges,
but lockin' up the neighbor?

607
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,330
It was the ghost.

608
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,360
Yeah, but they could
charge amy with a crime.

609
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,690
Try her as an adult.

610
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,050
She's here.

611
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,820
- Can you give me a second?
- Yeah.

612
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,040
They're splitting them up!

613
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,190
Henry's going to some foster home,
while amy and lisa are being detained.

614
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,220
I knew it!

615
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,300
This is what happens to
families when both parents die!

616
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,210
You can't control their lives anymore, and
every time you do, you just make it worse.

617
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,670
The best thing that you can do is just help
them understand what's happening to them.

618
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,810
You're the one who doesn't understand!

619
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,230
You keep saying that,
but understand what?

620
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,020
What is it that you're not telling me?

621
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,960
Because you're afraid of something, and
it has nothing to do with the county.

622
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,920
Or is itsomeone?

623
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,660
Is it someone who'd
get them when you died?

624
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,910
I need to talk to the
officer who found henry.

625
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,890
Sure, what's up?

626
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,730
This ghost is hiding a
lot more than her death.

627
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,350
OK

628
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:17,550
she kept saying she knew this would
happen, the kids would get torn apart.

629
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,420
Officer: actually, the country
prefers to keep siblings together.

630
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,830
Where was she getting her information?

631
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,410
Well, that's what i was wondering, but then
it made me think, what if she has someone?

632
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,740
A sibling who is in foster care or
adopted, someone that the kids never knew?

633
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,880
You're talking about family
services records. They're sealed.

634
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,130
Come on. Not for you.

635
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,500
Please.

636
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,410
That little boy had everything to
lose when he came to you for help.

637
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,210
He's lost so much already.

638
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,240
Hi, are you tracy edmondson?

639
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,290
Yes.

640
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,390
My name is melinda gordon.

641
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,950
I knew your sister karen.

642
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,770
My sister?

643
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,110
There's so many questions. I...

644
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,670
I'm not honestly sure i
want to know the answers.

645
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,120
She had 3 children.

646
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,150
Their father died,
too. They have no one.

647
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,970
You didn't know that, did you?

648
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,160
You're not one of the people
she asked to take care of them.

649
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,050
She probably figured i'd say no.

650
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,690
Because you didn't take
her when your parents died?

651
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,790
I know about the accident.

652
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,100
I know that you were
19 when you lost them.

653
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,860
You were old enough
to take over custody.

654
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,020
I sat in a courtroom while the judge
asked her over and over if she wanted me.

655
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:59,410
She cried every night until
she passed out from exhaustion.

656
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,940
And they were my parents, too.

657
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,040
I could barely function.

658
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,300
How was i supposed to
fix her broken heart?

659
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,840
I don't think anyone
expected you to do that.

660
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,090
Except maybe you.

661
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,480
Well, it's too late now. She's gone.

662
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,700
What if it wasn't too
late just meet her kids.

663
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,610
They're really...

664
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,490
Really self sufficient and loving.

665
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,930
And they need you to be their family.

666
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,660
Legally, it's the only
way they can stay together.

667
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,010
She is a complete stranger to them.

668
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,970
I'm not their family.

669
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,580
If karen were here, she'd
tell you i'm not her family.

670
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,040
I gave up that right.

671
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,330
Listen to her. She's right.

672
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,250
So...

673
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,930
I can't. I don't...

674
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,330
Deserve a second chance?

675
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,670
You all do.

676
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,660
What are you doing?

677
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,260
Oh, i'm just picking up ned.

678
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,980
He wanted to help lisa's aunt
move the rest of her  tuff in.

679
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,280
Are you guys ok?

680
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,150
I mean, did he ever apologize
for just walking out?

681
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,460
No, actually, i apologized to him.

682
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,460
Yeah, he was right.

683
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,420
It was just very hard
for me to think of him...

684
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,490
Dating.

685
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,120
Is that why you're looking this way?

686
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,040
'Cause you literally can't face
the idea of ned having a girlfriend?

687
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,600
No, i am trying to
give them their privacy.

688
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,980
This is me... Letting go.

689
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,190
So what are they
doing? Are they kissing?

690
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,790
Uh, no, she just hit him.

691
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,930
Oh, thank god.

692
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,590
But it was full of sexual tension.

693
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,290
Ned, come on, let's go!

694
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,530
We're late for practice!

695
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,340
What? We are!

696
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,740
I don't know, melinda.

697
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,920
I think they just want to be left alone.

698
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:00,710
Maybe, maybe not.

699
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,730
I remember when dad came to pick you up, and
you had all that gum stuck in your braces.

700
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,220
Yeah, but i won the contest.

701
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,860
- Yeah.
- Ok, now mom.

702
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,960
I rember mom taking
henry to work one day.

703
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,700
i love this one.

704
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,680
And you gave her computer
a big drink of grape juice.

705
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,570
Please don't stop because of me.

706
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,490
Oh, no.

707
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,340
It's just a family thing
we do, just the three of us.

708
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,540
Tell her tracy is her family.

709
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,580
Tell her she might remember
some things they'll want to hear.

710
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,870
Amy, uh...

711
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,530
Your mom wants you
to let your aunt play.

712
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,970
Lisa: wait, mom's here?

713
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,410
Where is she?

714
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,690
I remember...

715
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,190
I remember making up a
game with your mother.

716
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,710
It was called "i rember."

717
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,700
Sweetheart, listen.

718
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,580
'Cause after our parents died,

719
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,120
i told your mother to rember one
thing about each of them every night

720
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,520
Before she went to sleep, and that
way, they would be with her always.

721
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,120
Even if i couldn't be.

722
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,050
Youmade up the game?

723
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,290
Tell them to listen to their aunt,
because she knows the story about

724
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,980
When we camped out on copper
island with mom and dad.

725
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,910
Tracy...

726
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,260
Can you tell them the story
about camping on copper island?

727
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,860
Oh, come on, aunt
tracy! What's the deal?

728
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,360
'Cause mom always hated camping.

729
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,810
Well, how do you think
she learned to hate it?

730
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,920
I remember your mother, a rope swing,

731
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,760
and a giant bed of poison ivy that

732
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,280
She fell into, because...

733
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,830
What is that?

734
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,330
It's so beautiful.

735
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,930
It's time, isn't it?

736
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,500
Only you know that.

737
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,320
There's room over here, aunt tracy.

738
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,680
come on, tracy. Sit down.

739
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah, tell us more.
