1
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,169
<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

2
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:17,681
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,784
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

4
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:23,874
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

5
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,854
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

6
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,763
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

7
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:33,292
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

8
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:41,539
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

9
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,945
H- help me.

10
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,294
Can you get me out of here?
Can anybody hear me?

11
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,354
I can hear you.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,727
And I know
your secret.

13
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:02,869
What secret?

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,947
That you are seriously in touch
with your inner child.

15
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,865
What can I say?
Easily amused.

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,739
No, I love that
about you.

17
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:14,010
You know, large shoes,
big, red nose, and I'm all set.

18
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:16,167
- Where did ned go?
- Hey, houdini.

19
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,064
How about making
an appearance?

20
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,905
You said I wouldn't
have to stay.

21
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,558
Yeah. I also said...

22
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,393
that you would
have to explain why.

23
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,700
I have a really important
math project due tomorrow.

24
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:30,402
I was actually counting on another
pair of hands today.

25
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,532
Will these do?
I'll stay.

26
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:35,428
I hope you're
not upset.

27
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,108
As long as you're
ok with it.

28
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,243
Cool. Thanks, mom.
Thanks, melinda.

29
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,627
If he even cracks a "c"
on this project,

30
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,763
I can live with getting
a "c" on my parenting.

31
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,910
So, what do you
need me to do?

32
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:51,234
Close up.
We're going shopping.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,046
...This place for the last 20 years
I never thought I'd have to leave.

34
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,573
Business is that slow?

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,234
Ever since eba
dead as a doornail.

36
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:14,460
Well, you could sell
your stuff online, too, or...

37
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,557
get somebody else to do it
and sell your stuff

38
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,192
from the comfort
of your own home.

39
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:22,774
Aw, nah. I'm too much of a people
person. I'd miss talking to folks.

40
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,944
Melinda, you have
to look at these.

41
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,445
See what I mean?

42
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,282
Oh. I didn't know
that I had put those out.

43
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:32,589
Are these not for sale?

44
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,643
Uh, n-no. No, they're for sale.
Everything must go.

45
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,426
I can understand why you
wouldn't want to part with them.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,542
They're gorgeous.

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,394
Wow. Hand-painted
on the front.

48
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,600
Are they
christmas ornaments?

49
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:44,151
Oh, well, could be,
or whatever you like.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,625
If you don't get these, I'm gonna
get them for the store myself.

51
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,051
Ok, I'll take them.

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,575
You have a good eye, delia. You can go
shopping with me anytime you want.

53
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,998
Oh, you're gonna be
sorry you said that.

54
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,784
So where do you
want me to put these?

55
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,638
Oh, we don't
have to do that now.

56
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,033
Are you kidding?

57
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,414
I haven't been this jazzed
since I sold my first house.

58
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,899
Seems like
a thousand years ago.

59
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,398
And please don't tell ned.

60
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:18,610
I want him to think that covering his
hours was a huge sacrifice for me.

61
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:35,068
you know what?
I think this shelf isn't level.

62
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,471
You wanna put a piece of
wood right underneath this leg.

63
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:40,876
You know, maybe we could just keep
the ornament in the box for now.

64
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:42,735
P.O.P.- "Point of purchase. "

65
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:48,868
You always wanna put some out front
where everyone can see them.

66
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,719
- I'll think about that.
- That's the point.

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,837
You don't wanna think.
You just wanna buy.

68
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:56,049
Can you just
put them back, please?

69
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,576
S- sure.

70
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:00,178
I didn't mean to-

71
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,331
it's just sometimes
when I have new things,

72
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:05,814
I like to hold off on putting them out
until I'm really sure where they're going.

73
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,351
I understand.

74
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,659
Melinda, I am so sorry.
I just...

75
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,636
get carried away
sometimes.

76
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,660
Me, too. I guess I'm
just a little on edge.

77
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,107
I know it's not easy
being your own boss.

78
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,840
I used to think that I was
gonna open up my own place,

79
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,774
have a little store
like this one.

80
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:45,560
I was either gonna call it delia's
decorations or the curbside curator.

81
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:47,630
And why didn't you?

82
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,716
I got married, I had ned,
and then the concept

83
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,024
of someday just becomes
a little more abstract.

84
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,950
Uh, how did you
get into real estate?

85
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,557
When my husband died.

86
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,583
I had to think of
a plan "b" in a hurry.

87
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:07,096
There's no time to grow
a small business.

88
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,471
I had to get out there
and make some money, so...

89
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:10,837
got my real estate license.

90
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:15,330
Could you grab some newspapers
and maybe check for estate sales?

91
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:16,980
Sure. No problem.

92
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,193
As soon as you can,
before they run out.

93
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:22,730
On my way.
Want anything else?

94
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,132
- No. Thanks.
- Ok.

95
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,697
Who are you?

96
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,079
What's going on?

97
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:56,374
What's happening?
Talk to me. I can help.

98
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,295
Stop it.
Don't do that.

99
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:05,183
Just please stop it.

100
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:16,079
Please. Stop it!
Aah! Stop! Please.

101
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,488
Can you see me?

102
00:07:56,381 --> 00:08:00,506
So you can see and hear this ghost,
but he can't see or hear you?

103
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,965
Yeah. How's that for
a cruel twist of fate?

104
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,510
Maybe this ghost
is deaf and blind.

105
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,845
It's like
he's trapped here,

106
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,019
being tormented by these
christmas ornaments.

107
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,775
Not everybody likes
the holidays.

108
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,256
He's definitely trying to get rid of
them. It's like they're alive, breathing.

109
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,136
I've never seen
anything like it.

110
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,249
Where are they now?

111
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,149
Well, I was hoping
the answer was hidden,

112
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,790
you know, deeply away
somewhere in the store.

113
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,970
- Well, they're pretty.
- I wish you could see this.

114
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,249
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

115
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,826
<i>- Can't I touch you?
- No!</i>

116
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,898
<i>Don't do that.
No. Stop it!</i>

117
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,432
<i>Leave me alone!
No. Stop it!</i>

118
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,721
Come on.
Keep breathing.

119
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:55,689
- Stand up. You're all right.
- What happened?

120
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,463
You tell me. You just
blacked out there for a while.

121
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:03,840
I- I felt scared and really angry.
It was overwhelming.

122
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,849
- Maybe you should sit down.
- No, I don't think I can.

123
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,693
I should walk it off.

124
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:13,442
- Did you see anything?
- Yeah, I did. 2 people hitting each other

125
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,219
and some kind
of fight.

126
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,995
Ok, I want this ghost
out of here.

127
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,448
If the ghost wants
to destroy these ornaments,

128
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,361
he can't do it himself,
fire is the best way

129
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,456
that I know to destroy
something made of wood.

130
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,613
If I do it for him,
he can cross over.

131
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:10,534
- Is he gone?
- Yes.

132
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:13,502
Come on.

133
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,660
Oh, I am so hungry.

134
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,997
Ey're back.

135
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,813
So is he.

136
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,678
Professor payne?

137
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:08,654
- Professor payne.
- Go away!

138
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,580
I changed my mind!
No student office hours today!

139
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,704
I'm not a student. It's melinda
gordon. You helped me before.

140
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,767
Ow! Note to self-

141
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,991
stop helping people.

142
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,358
What are you looking for?

143
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,465
Well, before I hit my head, I was
looking for my lunch.

144
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,855
It's in a paper bag.

145
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,800
Oh. Brown-bagging lunch.
That doesn't sound like you.

146
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:30,477
Ms. Gordon. All right.
What do you have for me, huh?

147
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,111
Bunch of ambiguous
questions that you probably

148
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:34,518
- already know the answers to?
- You give me too much credit.

149
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,688
Maybe not enough credit. Hmm?

150
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,466
In your studies,
have you ever come across

151
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,664
a situation where a spirit can
make an object appear in our world?

152
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,009
- Materialization?
- I guess.

153
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,499
What I'm talking about is an
object that the spirit can see

154
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:48,443
and touch and that we
can see and touch, too.

155
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,632
Let's hope it's jewelry
and cash then, huh?

156
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,090
Yes or no?

157
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:55,327
Look, I've heard of it,
but I don't believe it.

158
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,312
- And why not?
- Because I don't believe in ghosts!

159
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,565
How can you study this stuff
and not believe in it?

160
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,386
I don't study the stuff,
ms. Gordon.

161
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,785
I- I study people's need
to believe in the stuff,

162
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,530
people like you standing
in front of me, looking...

163
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,112
Looking beautiful. And smelling delicious
is what- that perfume, is that french?

164
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,502
Let me smell it.

165
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:19,489
Ok, let's just assume for a minute that
spirits exist and they can move objects.

166
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,700
Yeah. They called apports.

167
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:24,080
It's from the french word
apporter. It means "to bring. "

168
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:25,071
Bring what?

169
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:28,868
More of that perfume you're wearing,
'cause seriously, it's making me bananas.

170
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,093
I'm kidding.
Unless I'm not.

171
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,775
Ok, I'm kidding.
Um, it brings clarity,

172
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:38,697
deeper understanding,
aside from the literal,

173
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:40,677
you know, interpretation
that an apport

174
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,805
is sent from beyond
to the living,

175
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:46,168
maybe it's a manifestation
of something that's so important,

176
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,961
you know, something
really symbolic.

177
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:50,540
So if a ghost couldn't talk,

178
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,942
they would maybe make an object
appear as a way of communicating.

179
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:57,508
- And can these apports move on their own?
- Yeah, and cats can water-ski.

180
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,793
- Is that why they glow?
- Cats don't glow!

181
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,812
- Apports.
- I know you're talking about apports!

182
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,220
- Why are you yelling?!
- I'm not yelling.

183
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,677
I'm yelling, right?!
I make that mistake.

184
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,178
I'm sorry.
I tend to disassociate.

185
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,872
- That's an understatement.
- Wh-what do you want?

186
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,351
Why are you here?
Do you have an apport at home,

187
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,042
and it's just glowing
with ghostly energy? Whoo!

188
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,257
Well, if that's true, why don't you
bring it in so we can test it?

189
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,430
Why would I have
an apport?

190
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:26,100
I mean, there's no such thing.
It's make-believe, right?

191
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:38,789
Ah. You... you baffle me!
You little minx.

192
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,110
Aw, I had a feeling
you'd be back.

193
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,942
- Really?
- I know a repeat customer when I see one.

194
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:54,899
- Still got a few things left.
- Any more ornaments?

195
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,281
No, don't worry.
You've got the only ones.

196
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,570
I was hoping you could tell me
where you got them.

197
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:02,134
- Why?
- In case they have any more.

198
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,362
Well, I doubt
that there are.

199
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,393
Yeah. Pretty unique.

200
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,234
Well, I don't know
where they came from.

201
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:11,973
If I did, I'd let you know. Now, if you
excuse me, I gotta get back to my packing.

202
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:15,412
Maybe the ornaments just
appeared out of nowhere.

203
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,188
How do you mean
"just appeared"?

204
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,838
Last night, a set of ornaments
just like the ones

205
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:28,817
that you sold me just appeared
on my kitchen table.

206
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,870
- I thought I was going crazy.
- You're not.

207
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:35,733
I racked my brain
trying to remember

208
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,505
if I picked 'em up
from someone yesterday

209
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:41,006
or if I saw someone
drop 'em here at the stall.

210
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,540
What about a man
in his mid-thirties,

211
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:47,252
um, short, brown hair,
stubble, pale skin,

212
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:50,158
a little disheveled,
doesn't like to look you in the eye?

213
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:54,091
Shifty I tend to remember,
but no, no, he's not ringing a bell.

214
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,599
If I see anybody like that,
I'll let you know.

215
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,110
Please.

216
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:04,751
Melinda...
Wait.

217
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,394
I just found this.

218
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:15,736
- I'll buy it from you.
- Uh, no, no, no.

219
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:18,714
Y- you take it.
I- I think you should have it.

220
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,254
Ok.

221
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:53,305
I need your real-estate
expertise to find this house.

222
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:55,186
It sounds like
an amazing house,

223
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,673
but you don't remember
where it is?

224
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,041
Uh, I've never been.
A client of mine told me about it.

225
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,001
He can't remember
the address?

226
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:04,042
He's not from around here.
Is he looking to buy?

227
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:05,419
Do I have a shot?

228
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,339
Uh, I'm not so sure
he could swing a mortgage,

229
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,765
but he's got me curious.
I'd love to see it.

230
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,865
This is the website
that tracks

231
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,215
all of the residential
properties in the area.

232
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,263
You can go ahead and
use my account number

233
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:18,954
and just put in as many
details as you can

234
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,522
and then search the database
and see if you find the house.

235
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,644
If you convince him to buy,
will you steer him my way?

236
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,159
Thank you.

237
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,342
Well, at least now the ghost
is, uh, communicating with you.

238
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:36,984
Oh, yeah.
We're like this.

239
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:40,351
He won't talk to me, look at me,
or even acknowledge my presence.

240
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:43,568
Well, you did say it takes some
longer than others to adjust to death.

241
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,824
Yeah. Everybody deals
with death differently.

242
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,592
I think delia's having
a hard time with it.

243
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,555
Oh, yeah?
Did you talk to her?

244
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,455
I've been meaning to, but I
haven't really had the chance. Oh.

245
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:58,746
That's it.
That's the house.

246
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:48,992
Hello?
Is anybody home?

247
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:52,607
Hello.

248
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,549
Hello.

249
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:16,988
Miss.

250
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,148
Give me a minute.

251
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,546
- She ok?
- Physically, she's fine.

252
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:56,218
She's just completely withdrawn.
She won't talk.

253
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,131
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

254
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,668
The woman's
christine nelson.

255
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,964
Found her picture I.D. Inside.
And he's, um-

256
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,264
well, he was dennis hightower.
I don't know if that does you any good.

257
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,259
Something terrible must have
happened in this house.

258
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:11,061
I mean, do you remember
the first vision I had?

259
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,838
- 2 people fighting.
- I have to get him to talk to me.

260
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:15,199
Look, you found his body.

261
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,966
Maybe that's all he needed to
resolve before he could cross over.

262
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,929
But he's still here.

263
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,757
Yeah, well, the police
will be, too, so...

264
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,117
Dennis Hightower.

265
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:43,409
Are you surprised that
I found out your name?

266
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:46,302
- Your name?
- Melinda.

267
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:48,638
It's really nice
to meet you.

268
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,350
Everything's
gonna be ok now.

269
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:53,741
We found your body.
You can cross over.

270
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:56,631
All you have to do
is go into the light.

271
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,258
Dennis, can you
see the light?

272
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:07,603
- You see the light?
- No. I can'T. Only you can.

273
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,136
Is there something else
that you need?

274
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,343
Something that
I can help you with?

275
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,446
Tell me
what happened to you.

276
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,517
What happened to you.

277
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,668
You know that
you're dead, right?

278
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:26,781
- Right.
- Who did this to you?

279
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:31,168
- You. You.
- Why don't you understand me?

280
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:32,960
Understand me.

281
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,631
Coroner's report says it looks
like dennis was poisoned.

282
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,802
Why didn't he
tell me about that?

283
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,822
Maybe I'd be better off if I
talked to christine.

284
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,982
Let the police do that.

285
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,897
I mean, he obviously
led me to her for a reason.

286
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,715
She might be
an important part of his life.

287
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:49,734
She might be an
important part of his death.

288
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:51,686
No. You think?

289
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,975
Dennis and christine
might be the 2 people you saw

290
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,387
fighting in your vision.

291
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:59,062
Why would she poison dennis
and then stay with the body?

292
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,456
Guilty don't always
run and hide.

293
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,202
Maybe dennis led
you to the house

294
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,940
not to help christine, but
to help you find his killer.

295
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,111
Why didn't he
cross over?

296
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,584
You're right. You should
try and talk to christine.

297
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you have
an appointment?

298
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:20,653
No. I'm, uh, looking for a patient,
christine nelson.

299
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:23,663
The emergency room at mercy hospital
told me that she was taken here.

300
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,802
- This morning.
- And why was she moved?

301
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:27,579
Too many heads,
not enough beds.

302
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:30,341
If your condition isn't serious,
life-threatening, or fatal,

303
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:32,368
you get turfed out.
Follow me.

304
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:36,480
Christine,
you have a visitor.

305
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,857
We met yesterday
at your house.

306
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,914
I'm melinda gordon.

307
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,332
I should get back
to my desk.

308
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,959
I know that the police were here
and you wouldn't talk to them.

309
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:57,190
I'm not the police,
and I need you to talk to me.

310
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,580
I knew dennis.

311
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,215
I think I know how he died,
but it would help to know why.

312
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,457
Christine,
can you hear me?

313
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,453
It's gonna take some time
before christine's

314
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,298
communicatmmn skills
are back to where they were.

315
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,835
Ms. Gordon,
dr. Hillary sloan.

316
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:21,015
I thought that she didn't suffer
any physical damage.

317
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,142
She didn'T.

318
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,066
But this kind of change is a lot
for a person with autism to process.

319
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:31,169
Wait. Did you just
say that christine is autistic?

320
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,334
Do you have a minute?

321
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:56,611
As you can see,
they like puzzles and games.

322
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:01,277
Pacing, hand flapping,
rocking back and forth-

323
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:05,205
they are all coping mechanisms
for people with autism.

324
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,325
You know, there are
high-functioning

325
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:11,691
people with autism who've learned to
behave in a more socially acceptable way.

326
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,705
A lot of them are loners.

327
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,738
They relate better to objects
than they do to people.

328
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,678
They don't like to talk.

329
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,823
Or look you in the eye.

330
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:24,368
They don't follow
a lot of our social rules.

331
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,215
Dennis is autistic.

332
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:29,472
Christine and dennis had lived
together since their twenties.

333
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,610
They were a couple.

334
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:33,902
Yes. They had a home-care worker
who came over once a week.

335
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:37,332
Other than that,
dennis took care of her.

336
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:52,417
- Where did she get this?
- Oh. Um, that's mine.

337
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:56,480
I sell those in my store. She must
have taken it from my purse.

338
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,631
It's beautiful.

339
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:21,654
- It was the oven.
- I'm sorry?

340
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,570
I know how dennis died.

341
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,278
Wait, if it was
carbon monoxide poisoning,

342
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,905
how come christine
wasn't affected?

343
00:27:36,914 --> 00:27:39,608
Because it's her ritual every time she
comes home to open up all the windows.

344
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:42,994
- I saw it in a vision.
- She's not a murderer.

345
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,072
- Murderess.
- Touche.

346
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:48,702
Question is why is
Dennis still here?

347
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:50,990
I found christine.
She's safe. What more is there?

348
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:53,314
What I wanna know is
why is dennis still autistic.

349
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:54,959
If he's dead,
he should be cured, right?

350
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,023
Mmm, technically, yes.
Every soul is perfect.

351
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:59,809
When they cross over, the handicaps
they had in life no longer affect them,

352
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:02,637
but if they're earthbound,
sometimes they cling to the familiar.

353
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:03,936
They can't let go
of who they were.

354
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:06,058
He did answer your questions
at some point, didn't he?

355
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:07,954
He's been mimicking me.
It's called echolalia.

356
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,917
It's when they echo whatever
you say so you know

357
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,235
that they can hear you,
even if they can't respond.

358
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:15,238
Ok, so all this time, he has
been communicating with you,

359
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:17,168
- ... just in his own way.
- Yes, through the ornaments.

360
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:19,054
The last one that I touched
showed me how he died.

361
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:22,137
Let's hope the answer to why
he's still here is in one of those.

362
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:28,794
These objects, they don't vibrate any
more or less than your average object.

363
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,214
And you can't see or hear anything
coming from inside them?

364
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,662
Like what?
What, a movie?

365
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,074
What am I gonna see, a movie? Listen to,
show tunes? It's wood. It's like my head.

366
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,603
Lady, it's normal.

367
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:40,926
There's nothing normal
about them.

368
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:47,246
So your "friend" said she felt transported
after she held these ornaments?

369
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:50,020
- Yes.
- Ok. Well, I held these ornaments.

370
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:51,486
I'm still here.

371
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:55,852
What time of day did your friend
say she had these visions?

372
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,761
Why is the time of day
important?

373
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,816
Well, yeah. If she did it
right after happy hour,

374
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,135
- I'd say it's very important.
- Yeah, that's real funny.

375
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,679
I thought you would at least
have a professional curiosity about this.

376
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:05,804
Oh, I'm curious.

377
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:09,270
I have a lot of curiosity about you,
about what you're doing here.

378
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:12,209
I just wanna know if you can
see anything in these ornaments.

379
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,987
Melinda, you haven't touched
any of these ornaments

380
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,909
since you've been here,
not directly, not one.

381
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,906
I wanna know what happens when
you touch these ornaments.

382
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:22,213
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I'd like to find out.

383
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:27,031
This one, the bunny, had a higher
energy rating than the other ornaments.

384
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,282
What happens when you
touch that guy?

385
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,659
You know, I thought you
were a man of science,

386
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:40,624
and there's nothing
scientific about this.

387
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,900
What's more scientific than
collecting my own empirical data?

388
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:11,099
No! Stop it!
Mami... Don't leave me!

389
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:14,243
What? What happened?

390
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:16,650
What did you see?

391
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,535
I saw a child being taken
from her mother.

392
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,843
Are you telling me
the truth?

393
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:25,298
All I can say, professor,
if I could walk out of here

394
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:27,567
knowing that everything
we've talked about was made up,

395
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:31,321
- I would be the happiest girl on earth.
- Wait. Psychometry.

396
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:35,032
What you're talking about
is called psychometry.

397
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:38,750
It's when you get visions or flashes of
the past from touching these objects.

398
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,996
- That makes sense.
- Easy for you to say.

399
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:46,456
Maybe if you did some more
tests on the ornaments.

400
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:48,631
I'd like to actually
do some tests on you, melinda.

401
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,626
Thanks for your time.

402
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:51,409
Melinda, I'm not talking
about root canal here.

403
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:54,382
I'm talking about
very scientific, controlled tests.

404
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,092
They could-
they can help us.

405
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,795
- I'm not an experiment.
- Melinda, listen.

406
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:05,385
When you get a chance,
just come by.

407
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:07,360
Come by and talk to me
some more.

408
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,243
This is important.

409
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,209
I don't think it's about him.
I think it's about both of them.

410
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:24,032
Oh, that's on sale,
by the way.

411
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,889
It's like it's his memories
of their life together,

412
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,543
you know, how he died,
when he first saw her.

413
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:28,877
- That makes sense.
- Well, whatever dennis wants,

414
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,610
it has something to do
with christine somehow.

415
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:31,996
It's too bad
she won't talk to you.

416
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:33,661
Maybe she'll respond
to the ornaments.

417
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,415
I thought that I would take them down to
the hospital and see if it could spark anything

418
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,973
Besides, if I leave now,
I can still make visiting hours.

419
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,568
Well, I'd offer to
mind the store, but...

420
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,996
it's ok. I know that you're busy
saving lives while I'm saving the dead.

421
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:48,967
- Bye.
- See ya.

422
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:11,064
- Hey.
- Hey.

423
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,702
How'd, uh,
ned do today?

424
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,129
- Oh, I sent him home early.
- Really?

425
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,962
- What did he do now?
- Oh, no. Nothing.

426
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:20,359
It's fine.
It's just I had to close up.

427
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,396
I have an errand to run.

428
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:24,389
Well, don't let me
keep you.

429
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:26,694
You just let me know
if he causes you any trouble, ok?

430
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:28,703
You know, what I hate
is when people ask if you're ok

431
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,015
when you're so obviously not.

432
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,170
Yeah. I hate that, too.

433
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,548
So, are you ok?

434
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:44,640
I-
no. It's just...

435
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,869
I don't know.
It's just been one of those days.

436
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:50,617
I am so sick
of selling houses.

437
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,637
Every time
I turn around,

438
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:55,917
there's this new couple buying
their house for the first time.

439
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:59,558
They're arguing about where
to put the office or the guest room.

440
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:03,399
And if it's not newlyweds,
then it's new parents, and...

441
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,320
they're trying to figure out
where the baby room goes.

442
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:10,338
Everybody has
their whole life ahead of them.

443
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,676
How long were you
and charlie married?

444
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:18,599
Sometimes it feels like
we're still married.

445
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:22,078
He's been dead
for 3 years now.

446
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,688
I've just been having
such a hard time moving on.

447
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,728
And ned's
been acting out.

448
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:34,324
I know he needs me, and I am doing
everything I can to be there for him.

449
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:37,311
I understand.

450
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,169
Anyway-heh.

451
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:44,606
Why don't you tell me
your secret?

452
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:47,725
Oh, well, having work that you love
takes your mind off things.

453
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,772
Ah. Well, my work
does just the opposite.

454
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:53,121
Well, maybe you should
try something new.

455
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,188
Like what? Brain surgeon?
Fighter pilot?

456
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:59,843
Heh. I was thinking of something
even more challenging, like...

457
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:03,084
why don't you come
and work with me?

458
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:07,133
- What?
- I need the help really bad,

459
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:08,924
and I can't pay
as much as one of your

460
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:10,698
sales commissions,
but it's a steady check

461
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:13,832
every week, and I think
you'd really like it.

462
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:16,681
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

463
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,046
- What?
- I just can't figure you out.

464
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,766
You're like
some kind of...

465
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:27,058
guardian angel
or something.

466
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:32,753
Promise me that you'll
at least think about it.

467
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:43,113
Bunny.

468
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:46,259
Tree.

469
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,963
Butterfly.

470
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,742
Cake.

471
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,419
House.

472
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:58,224
Bike.

473
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,275
Rocking chair.

474
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,015
What do these mean
to you, christine?

475
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:10,161
Bunny took me to school.

476
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,104
She wore a butterfly
around her neck.

477
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:17,500
She taught me
how to ride a bike.

478
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,747
We sat under the tree
in front of the house.

479
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:23,334
Who is bunny?

480
00:35:24,113 --> 00:35:27,275
Who wore a butterfly necklace
and took you to school?

481
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:30,443
- She did.
- who is she?

482
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:34,821
Mommy.
Mommy is she.

483
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:39,851
It's her mother.

484
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:43,069
These ornaments
symbolize mommy to christine.

485
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,476
Is that what you
wanted me to do...

486
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,320
find christine's mother?

487
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:51,021
F- find christine's mother.

488
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,607
I did.

489
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:11,339
Oh, no. No, no, no. They're faceup.
That's- that's the wrong way.

490
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:20,255
- This is a puzzle?
- This is a puzzle.

491
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,330
Bunny.

492
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:34,966
That's her mother?

493
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:42,229
I believe these
were meant for you.

494
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:54,168
Why did you
give christine away?

495
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:58,891
You have to understand that
back when christine was born,

496
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:01,630
people didn't know
that much about autism.

497
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:07,800
Can you imagine having a child
that won't look at you or smile,

498
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:14,258
a child that starts to cry
every time you try to touch her?

499
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:19,785
I took christine to a doctor,
and he told me it was my fault.

500
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:25,672
He said the reason she was autistic
was because I was a bad mother.

501
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,575
That's terrible.

502
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:29,306
Well, I wasn't the only one.

503
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:33,513
Said we were refrigerator
mothers because we were

504
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:37,064
so cold and frigid
that our children had no one

505
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:41,200
to turn to for comfort,
so they turned inside themselves.

506
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:45,390
So you let them
take her.

507
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:49,348
I tried to see her,
to visit, but they said I couldn't,

508
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,947
said if she was ever gonna get
any better, I had to stay away.

509
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:58,656
Didn't you see her
when she was a grown-up?

510
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:02,771
Once.

511
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,678
She was living
with a young man.

512
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:13,188
He was autistic, too.

513
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,015
But it ended up in a fight...

514
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:17,533
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

515
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:20,996
I saw that fight.

516
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,672
- Wh-what?
- It's not important.

517
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:29,364
What is important is that you
have to try again with christine.

518
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,770
She needs you.

519
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:57,597
It's my baby girl,
all grown up.

520
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:01,082
She's still in her
own little world.

521
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,634
Christine, your mother's
here to see you.

522
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,933
C- christine,
it's-it's mommy.

523
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,346
- I am so sorry.
- I am so sorry.

524
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:30,651
It's ok. She hears you.
Just tell her how you feel.

525
00:39:31,463 --> 00:39:35,067
She's not holding a grudge,
and I promise that she

526
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,962
is not angry with you.

527
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:41,261
Doesn't make one bit of difference
to her whether I'm here or not.

528
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:45,561
That-
that is not true.

529
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,325
S- say, "love is patient. "
Say, "love is patient. "

530
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,464
You just have to
be patient.

531
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,138
Sweetheart...

532
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:31,930
liz, liz, wait.

533
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,720
- This was a mistake.
- She needs you now more than ever.

534
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:40,916
My child doesn't need me.
She never has.

535
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,863
Everyone
needs their mother.

536
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:46,561
But she will never
be able to love me, melinda.

537
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,987
She doesn't even know
what love is.

538
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:52,521
That's not true. Christine loves.
She just doesn't know how to show it.

539
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,468
Her boyfriend,
he was teaching her how.

540
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,265
You can't teach somebody how to love.
They either feel it, or they don'T.

541
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,713
- Ask her.
- Do you love christine?

542
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:04,272
I want to, but...

543
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:08,507
I don't know how
if she can't love me back.

544
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,784
Well, then you have to
show her love first,

545
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:13,353
even if it means
she doesn't know how to love you.

546
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,046
I think all dennis wants is just for
you to be in christine's life again.

547
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:28,020
That's what I want, too.

548
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:36,201
Thank you.

549
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,717
I hope this is what you wanted.
This is what you wanted, right?

550
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:45,370
- Right.
- Are you ready to go?

551
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:48,865
- Where?
- Into the light. Can't you still see it?

552
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:55,180
- Mm-hmm. I see the sun.
- No, not the sun. The light.

553
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:57,099
The sun is the light.

554
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:59,849
I thought you could
see the light.

555
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:03,035
Is there something else
than I can help you with?

556
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:08,870
You know what love is.
What is love?

557
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,234
What does it feel like?

558
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:21,203
Dennis, what you did to bring
liz and christine together,

559
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,786
that's what love is.

560
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:28,893
It's not about what we say.
It's about what we do.

561
