00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,478
My name is Melinda Gordon.

3
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:12,359
I'm married,
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,216
and I own
an antique shop.

5
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:17,205
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:21,623
Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:25,581
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

8
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:28,683
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

9
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:31,091
and they come to me
for help.

10
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:39,263
In order to tell you my
story, I have to tell you theirs.

11
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:42,837
<i>Previously
on ghost whisperer...</i>

12
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,233
there's a plane in the air...

13
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:47,533
no one is flying it!

14
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:54,812
Yeah, I really don't get the feeling
that he was on that flight.

15
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:55,562
I mean, what are the chances?

16
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:57,542
I can't lose
my brother, melinda.

17
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:01,962
- Wait!
- They're mine.

18
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:13,431
I've been trying to work up
the courage to go in there,

19
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,581
- look at the passenger list.
- Andrea...

20
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,601
there's
something I have to tell you.

21
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,630
- You saw mitch.
- Andrea--

22
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:24,393
- Don't! No. No.
- But I'm not sure--

23
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:26,392
no way.
It's not him.

24
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,501
It was 250 people, jim.

25
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:30,763
Do I really have
the right to ignore that?

26
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,041
What about the thousands people
you could help the rest of your life?

27
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,693
You can't trick those souls
into staying here.

28
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,780
I will release
all your precious souls.

29
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:44,550
And in return,
I'll take...you.

30
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,251
Mitch!

31
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:56,003
- Mitch?
- I'm so sorry, Mitch.

32
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:58,142
I was supposed
to be on that plane, Melinda,

33
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:00,140
I can't believe Andrea
it's dead.

34
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,941
How'd it happen?

35
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:05,720
She was driving
to your apartment in the city.

36
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,911
She tried so hard
to reach you.

37
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:12,501
I guess her car got caught in the
path of the plane.

38
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,973
- Do you think she suffered?
- No.

39
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,561
No, I don't think so.

40
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:23,911
This can't be happening!

41
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:30,831
she's mine!

42
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:58,931
- Andrea! Andrea!
- Melinda, I don't know what's happening!

43
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,261
- Please, help me!
- I've been looking for you, where are you?

44
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,412
At the store.
I'm so scared!

45
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,341
- Well, can you get to my house?
- I don't know!

46
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:10,811
Ok. I'll come to you.
I have really good news.

47
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,910
Hello?!

48
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,882
How is she calling you?

49
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:18,500
She had her cell phone with her. You know,
maybe she can tap into the energy fields.

50
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,260
- I'll come with you?
- No, she's gonna want to talk to me alone.

51
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:25,192
She's gonna be so happy!

52
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,770
Don't!

53
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,691
The light hurts my eyes.

54
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:53,772
Andrea, I've been
so worried about you!

55
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:57,371
- Tell me everything's gonna be ok.
- I think maybe it is.

56
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,931
You may not really be dead.

57
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,082
- What?
- It's truim found you,

58
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,033
Jim found you,
your body.

59
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:07,312
You're in a coma at mercy hospital,
but you're gonna be ok.

60
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,153
You're just out of body until ypu come out
of the coma. Doctors are working so hard.

61
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:14,753
You're not lying to me? You're not just
trying to make me feel better?

62
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,773
Look, you're not out of the woods.
You have some injuries.

63
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:20,050
but the doctors think that
you're gonna pull through.

64
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:23,903
We've been with you
at that hospital every day.

65
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:28,012
- It's scary here.
- What's it like?

66
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:32,042
I don't really like to look around too
much. There...there are people here.

67
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,301
- People?
- Not people...

68
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:39,931
I guess, maybe, um, beings or something?
They're dark, and they're always watching.

69
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,300
- I can't really see.
- Melinda!

70
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,942
Melinda... Open the door!

71
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:54,500
- Open the door, let me in!
- I can't!

72
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:56,833
- The door!
- It won't open!

73
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,142
Andrea!...
No... No!

74
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:03,941
- No!
- It's ok, it's ok.

75
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,461
- Shh, just a dream.
- Sorry.

76
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:09,390
Want some water?

77
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,080
I dreamt
that she was alive,

78
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:16,151
that you found her body
and that she was gonna be ok.

79
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,231
Think she's trying
to come to you in the dreams?

80
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:22,721
It doesn't usually work that way.
Scared the hell out of me, though.

81
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:24,200
No kidding.

82
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,073
- Sorry I woke you.
- Yeah, me, too.

83
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:31,572
I was dreaming that I was floating on
a river of beer and I had a big cup.

84
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,123
Are your dreams
always that complex?

85
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,281
Pretty much.

86
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,313
Gonna be able to sleep?

87
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:43,162
I don't want to keep you up. You know what,
I think I'm just gonna go downstairs and read.

88
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,202
Romano.

89
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,642
Mine.

90
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:06,293
Help me.

91
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:48,270
Death is nothing at all.
It does not count.

92
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:51,521
I have only slipped away
into the next room.

93
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:54,060
Everything remains
as it was.

94
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:57,712
The old life that we live so fondly
together in unchanged.

95
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,840
Is andrea here?

96
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:04,272
Whatever we were
to each other, that we are still.

97
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:10,561
- I am but waiting for you. For an inverval,
interval, somewhere very near... - No.

98
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:15,171
I just don't understand why
she's not coming to me.

99
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,561
- Maybe she's crossed over.
- No, she hasn'T.

100
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,722
I would know if she did.

101
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:22,000
I just can't figure out
what's keeping her here.

102
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:27,310
...How we shall laugh at the trouble
of parting when we meet again.

103
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:31,312
Maybe she's still in the department.
I will be going to see later

104
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,801
Thanks for everything
you did, melinda.

105
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:55,132
I hope you know
how much andrea loved you.

106
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,870
I loved her, too. So much.

107
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,310
You were like her sister.

108
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,283
Do you ever...feel like
she's with you??

109
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,131
In some ways, you know,
like she's near you?

110
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,501
No. Not really.

111
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,681
Do you?

112
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:17,652
I'd like to.

113
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:22,462
Andrea said that you understood death
in ways that most people don'T.

114
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:25,292
What else
did she say?

115
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,830
Just that you knew
how to help people who were grieving.

116
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,151
Now I'm one of them.

117
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:37,751
We both lost a sister.

118
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,322
Here in the stricken
town of grandview,

119
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,592
residents struggle to resume
their normal lives

120
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,553
after the tragedy
of flight 395.

121
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,821
We're here today to see
how they're doing. Excuse me,

122
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:57,261
We're here in grandview today to see
what kind of progress the town is making

123
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,051
in the aftermath
of the plane crash.

124
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:01,301
How do you think
things are going?

125
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:05,191
Um...I can only say that the people
in this town are really strong,

126
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,121
they're survivors.

127
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,612
- We're gonna be ok.
- Thank you.

128
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,470
Well, there you have it
from a local merchant.

129
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:16,382
This town is grieving, but determined
to get back to business as usual.

130
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:31,081
Andrea?...
Are you here?

131
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:36,712
I just want
to talk to you, please.

132
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:39,342
I know that you're scared.

133
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,471
- Where's andrea?
- I'll be glad to take a message.

134
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:41,252
- What are you doing to her?
- I don't have to do anything.

135
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,333
- She's doing it all to herself.
- Who are you?

136
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:47,341
I was alive once.
Just like you.

137
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:51,380
- ...I had names, I had lis.
- Romano... Is that your name?

138
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,561
- I'm just a humble teacher.
- Teacher?

139
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:56,152
Trying to spread the word.

140
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,643
- Much like yourself.
- What are you doing here? What do you want?

141
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:01,932
- I have what I want.
- No. No, you don'T.

142
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:06,311
Andrea will not go with you. I
know her. She's going into the light.

143
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:09,802
I'm going to have her,
and I'm going to have you, too.

144
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,819
It's just a matter of time.

145
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,373
Andrea, you have to cross
over. Please let me help you.

146
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:23,333
- I can'T. - Why not?
- You could never understand why!

147
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,530
<i>Cloudy and cold in the seattle area
tonight. Possible showers tomorrow,</i>

148
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:43,470
<i>but the rest of the week
looks like we might see some sunshine.</i>

149
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,910
<i>In other news across the nation,
the small east coast town of grandview</i>

150
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:49,672
<i>is still recovering from
that tragic plane crash.</i>

151
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:56,031
<i>Um, all I can say is that people in
this town are strong. They're survivors,</i>

152
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,310
<i>and we'll be ok.</i>

153
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,423
<i>Thank you.</i>

154
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,882
Melinda...

155
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:10,831
That brings us back
to the power of the mind.

156
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:15,420
Something so powerful that it creates
that which we want to be true.

157
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,551
That's why athletes are taught
visualization techniques

158
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:20,653
because if you imagine it,
it will happen.

159
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,372
Now, how do we extrapolate this
theory to the world of the supernatural?

160
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,430
Specters, demon n tities,
poltergeists, hauntings.

161
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:29,250
Well, what do we do? We say that all
these things are complete bull,

162
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,061
or they're all explainable
in some way or another.

163
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,250
Now, my question
to you is this--

164
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:38,310
could it be all of these phenomena
are just an extension of brain function,

165
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:43,331
an extension of our collective minds
creating myths, filling in the blanks,

166
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:46,990
if you will... And that is what we will
be studying in this class.

167
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,992
Professor payne,
hi, I'm melinda gordon.

168
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,592
- Good for you.
- No, we spoke on the phone, remember?

169
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,721
- About what?
- I read about your work.

170
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:55,722
- Why?
- I need some help.

171
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,311
I need a lot of help, too, more
than you can imagine,

172
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,271
but I don't come to your
workplace and ask for it, do I?

173
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,072
Look, you're supposed to be the
expert on the history and beliefs

174
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,421
of the occult and the supernatural--

175
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:06,320
As it pertains to contemporary
psychology. If you want to find

176
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,742
your dead aunt's will,
I can't help you.

177
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:11,180
- Is it necessary to be this rude?
- Necessary, no. Amusing, always.

178
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:13,183
Hey, you're the go-to guy,
and I need somebody to go to.

179
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,191
They say
you're a genius.

180
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:16,221
I can't believe you can't spare
half an hour!

181
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,680
Makes me crazy the way they throw the
word "genius" around, all right?

182
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:22,111
Although, coming from you,
it does give me a certain tingle.

183
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:24,143
- Will you buy me food?
- Yes.

184
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,752
- Follow me.
- Great!

185
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:29,430
I don't teach
the supernatural.

186
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,913
I teach society's need to believe
in the supernatural,

187
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,842
the myths and the legends
throughout the ages.

188
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,802
There are lots of myths about
dark spirits and light spirits.

189
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,652
I'm just trying to
find out more about them.

190
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,863
- Why?
- Because I really need to.

191
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, most cultures
favor the same motifs.

192
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:49,351
Basically, it's demons, dark entities,
shadows, phantoms.

193
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:53,231
You know, the relationship between
good and evil has always been symbiotic.

194
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,800
You can't have one without the
other... And speaking of evil,

195
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,772
- don't try that shrimp.
- What function do they serve?

196
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:02,142
- Apparently to make us violently ill.
- Are you still talking about the shrimp?

197
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:05,542
- Aren't you?
- Spirits, dark spirits.

198
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:08,133
Dark spirits. Dark spirits and
light spirits are linked--

199
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:12,262
at opposite ends, obviously, and the
dark spirits are here to create evil,

200
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:14,093
not only create evil but to grow it.

201
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,370
And the light spirits?

202
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:18,750
The light spirits make sure that
the dead pass on to the other side.

203
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,463
The light, heaven,
whatever you want to call it.

204
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,462
They're the protectors
of the souls.

205
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:25,461
They, uh, they just go
around spreading all things good.

206
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,732
Love, happiness,
blah blah blah.

207
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,821
And can one dark spirit become
more powerful than the others?

208
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:33,502
Well, that depends on how many
souls they can take up,

209
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,383
and that's why the dark spirits
hate the light spirits so much,

210
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:40,712
because the light spirits are always
taking souls away from them.

211
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,633
Well, uh, there's
an east african version

212
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:47,080
where if a dark spirit can take over
the soul of a light spirit,

213
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,791
that's like triple bonus
points right there.

214
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:54,733
By engulfing the soul of a light spirit,
the dark spirit becomes invincible.

215
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,482
- You ok?
- Yeah. Have you ever...

216
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:00,402
come across this image?

217
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:05,060
- Heh, a villain from old-time radio?
- That's not funny.

218
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,770
- Do we have a name?
- Romano, maybe, I'm not sure.

219
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:11,702
Ok. Is your romano
a dark spirit or a light spirit?

220
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,450
Oh, you're right. They are too careless
with the word "genius."

221
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:16,510
That's harsh.
Who are you again?

222
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:20,621
Just someone who wants some help.
Someone who needs to learn.

223
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:25,002
- Can you just check the sketch for me?
- I'm already on it. Good-bye.

224
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:33,460
I'm just not sure what you hope to
get talkin' to this professor guy.

225
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:36,921
I'm not exactly sure, either, but at
least, if I can find out who this romano is,

226
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:39,033
then I can keep her
away from him.

227
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,313
Does he know what you can do?
The professor.

228
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:45,533
- Why don't you tell him?
- I don't tell people.

229
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,762
- You told andrea.
- Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have.

230
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:52,452
Maybe this whole spirit thing evaded
her life just as it has ours.

231
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:55,891
Maybe she would have been
better off not even knowing.

232
00:16:55,928 --> 00:17:00,823
Hey. Slow down. You gotta realize you're
hurting, too. You've been through...

233
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,872
a terrible shock.
Take a beat.

234
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,262
Yeah, I can'T.

235
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:08,910
- Why? - Because, if I stop
and think, I just feel so guilty.

236
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, like maybe
what happened to andrea is my fault.

237
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,381
I mean, it's only because of me that
she knew about the plane.

238
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:17,061
It's only because
of me that romano went looking for her.

239
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,073
Maybe...

240
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,463
Maybe... I unleashed something
that even I don't understand.

241
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,640
Just do the best you can
do with what you know.

242
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,782
I can't believe
that she's gone.

243
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:31,611
I can't believe that she's not gonna
walk in this door at any minute

244
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,533
with her coffee and a joke.

245
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:40,351
I would give anything just to hear
her laugh one more time.

246
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:44,980
She never doubted me.

247
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:50,483
- Even for a minute. - Ok, there's
something that you should know about me.

248
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,203
- Ooh, uh-oh.
- Yeah. And it's gonna sound crazy.

249
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,200
And I'm telling you
for 2 reasons.

250
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:02,873
One, because I have a good feeling about
ypu. You don't seem like you're judgmental.

251
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:06,220
- Ok...
- ok, so here it is.

252
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,901
Uh, sometimes when people
die, their spirits don't leave.

253
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,613
They stay earthbound
for all kinds of reasons.

254
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:23,611
And, well... I can see those people.
Those...spirits.

255
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,392
They talk to me,
I can help them.

256
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:30,780
You should say
something soon.

257
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:36,101
That...is... the...

258
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:42,551
-... coolest thing I've ever heard.
- You don't think I'm nuts?

259
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:47,921
Ooh, ahh, no more nuts
than I am.

260
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,153
I mean, I buy it. I like it.
I knew you'd get it, I just knew it.

261
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,762
Yeah, but you said there was another
reason that you were telling me.

262
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,103
Yeah, you have a ghost
attached to you.

263
00:18:57,106 --> 00:19:00,563
I'm sorry, what?
What--where? Where?

264
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:05,262
I thought you could see me!

265
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:09,240
He's, uh, behind you. He's been
following you for the last 2 weeks.

266
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,610
What--why?
What does he want?

267
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,382
Finally!
Ok, it's like this all right--

268
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,110
you don't have to shout! Just because you're
dead doesn't mean that I can't hear you.

269
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,602
All right, all right, what do I know?
I thought I was talking

270
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,243
from the great beyond or something.

271
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:27,391
Anyway, the point is, I used to live
in the apartment she lives in now.

272
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:31,062
Ah, he's an older man who used to live
in your apartment.

273
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,960
Ok, please tell me he didn't die
in my apartment.

274
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:38,051
I didn't die there. I crapped out on
a bus one day coming home.

275
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,093
Heart attack.
But I digress. The point is this.

276
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:47,561
There's a stack of pictures of my
grandson that fell behind the stove,

277
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:52,460
and I never got around to gettin' them out,
and my daughter would love those shots.

278
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,383
Oh, there's pictures of his grandson
behind your stove.

279
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:58,883
My daughter's name is nancy howard.
She's in the phone book.

280
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:00,870
He wants you to send the pictures
to his daughter. I have her name.

281
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:02,510
She's in the phone book.

282
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,951
Hey, you're kidding, right?

283
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:16,992
Ok, I am so gonna
love this job.

284
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:38,161
Andrea?

285
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:55,482
Got here about
a half hour ago.

286
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,783
My key won't turn in the lock.
I knock, but no one answers.

287
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:03,833
Hello? Who's in there?

288
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,682
Try your key again.

289
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,221
Who could have
done that?

290
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,620
That's sick.
I don't get it.

291
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:13,441
The words... that name, romano.
I have no idea who that is, do you?

292
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:17,793
- Everything just seems a bit crazy right now.
- Should I call the police?

293
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,783
- If it'll make you feel better, but I don't--
- Melinda, if you know something,

294
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,203
please, tell me.

295
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,623
I really don't know
what's going on.

296
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,203
You feel like you
could know a person...

297
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:32,802
I mean, really know who they
are through and through?

298
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,850
- I do.
- I do, too.

299
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,951
And I know my sister.
I know it sounds crazy,

300
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:42,720
but I feel like something's wrong.
Like she's not at rest somehow.

301
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,383
I can't shake it.

302
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:51,041
You probably know things weren't
always great with us.

303
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,253
She told me you didn't talk
for 2 years..

304
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:55,862
It's worse than that.

305
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,413
There's somethin'
I never told her.

306
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:01,162
Something she should
have known.

307
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:04,602
- What?
- What difference does it make?

308
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,072
It's too late.

309
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:18,853
Andrea?
Are you here?

310
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,631
Andrea?

311
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,623
He told me not to believe
a thing you say.

312
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:37,931
Romano?

313
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:41,153
I don't want to be dead!
I shouldn't be dead!

314
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:50,890
Please...help me. I don't want
to be here. But I deserve it.

315
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:53,680
- No, you don't!
- What'll happen to me if I go with him?

316
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:57,520
He'll turn you into something,
something just like him.

317
00:23:57,526 --> 00:24:03,052
- He makes me want to be with him!
-Andrea, it's all lies!
Please don't let him do it--

318
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:06,783
- I have to go.
- Where?

319
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,551
Back to the beginning.
Oh, my god.

320
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,101
Andrea, please!

321
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:16,982
- I have to go now.
- Andrea!

322
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,940
- Hello.
- Hi, melinda, it's rick payne.

323
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:18,272
Uh, I just got back
to my office.

324
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:21,102
Is there any chance you can
come over here? Right away?

325
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,182
Could this wait till morning?
It's been kind of a long night.

326
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,660
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe not.

327
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:30,832
Ok, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

328
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:33,100
Is there any chance
you'll pass a noodle parlor?

329
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:35,333
- None.
- Fair enough.

330
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,071
- when did this happen?
- Today. I'm teaching a class,

331
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:12,011
and then I go out to
dinner--polynesian food.

332
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,872
Have you ever had tongue
and papaya? I don't recommend it.

333
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:19,203
I come back to my office to get some
books, and all this has happened.

334
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:22,191
I--who could have done this?!
Some disgruntled janitor? No. No. No.

335
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:25,693
Please. I don't think so.
And then--ooh-- check this out.

336
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,780
Here's a drawing that i
didn't even know I had.

337
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:31,472
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah, sure.

338
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,363
- Well?
- Oh, sorry, uh,

339
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:38,151
basically it's a warning.
It's a dark motif favored by the incans.

340
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:42,191
"Back off or die" being
the fundamental message.

341
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:46,710
Who are you really? Come on, you come here
asking me some very interesting questions.

342
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:51,280
Next thing I know, my office is redecorated.
And I'm on the wrong end of
an incan death threat.

343
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,771
Look, I'm really am
just kind of a student.

344
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,791
There are some things that I know and
some things that I'm trying to find out.

345
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,791
Ok. That's--
that's great.

346
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:01,812
But are you going to tell me this all
happened because of a supernatural event?

347
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:04,693
- Yes.
- Come on! That's crap!

348
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:07,252
Who--who sent you here?
Who put you up to this?

349
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,163
Is it spiegelman from princeton,
that son of a bitch?

350
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:11,783
Ok, the sketch that I gave you.
Did you find out anything about him?

351
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:13,812
Oh, yeah.
I did actually.

352
00:27:13,818 --> 00:27:18,640
There's an obscure sect in algeria,
sort of a quasi devil worship...

353
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:22,991
sort of a quasi devil worshiping group. They
use this image as the object of their reverence.

354
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:26,323
I also found another group in morocco,
and there's another one in portugal.

355
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,342
Wow.
This is amazing.

356
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:32,261
Come here!, you maybe want
to see this.

357
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,692
Is this...

358
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,760
that's an american cult leader living in
Spain-- went by the name romano.

359
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,052
This guy had 115 followers.

360
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:47,513
And he convinced them all to
commit themselves to their dark sides.

361
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:51,322
And like you were telling me that dark
spirits like souls to be angry and toxic.

362
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:55,340
Toxic is an understatement. This guy convinced
these people to commit the ultimate dark act...

363
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:58,143
That would assure them
a place alongside him in eternity.

364
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:00,630
- Suicide?
- On a grand scale.

365
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:03,223
You say you've seen
this guy recently?

366
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:05,540
- Kinda.
- You know, that's fascinating to me,

367
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:10,072
this happened in 1939! And romano
killed himself with all the others.

368
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,163
And became
a dark spirit?

369
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,900
Let's say the sake of argument
that dark spirits are real.

370
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:18,150
I would say your friend romano there
was a dark spirit long before that happened.

371
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:20,423
- A living one?
- As these entities get stronger,

372
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,772
they have the ability
to take over a weaker human.

373
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:24,770
Literally take over
their bodies?

374
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,911
In theory-- look, that's a picture of
some loser named romano

375
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:30,321
with an evil heart and a weak will.,
But once the spirit got ahold of him

376
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,490
all the negative energy
from that mass suicide--

377
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:37,233
he was 100 times stronger. And then when
he died, he was released back into
the ether badder than ever.

378
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:40,321
- And now?
- Now...

379
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:42,831
regrouping
for a bigger bite.

380
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:46,343
Maybe he's just sucking
up soul after soul and building more

381
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:48,440
and more strength until the next
human being he takes over

382
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:49,960
he could do some real
hurt to the world.

383
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:53,472
And this guy's not gonna stop
until he destroys everything that's good.

384
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:57,562
- You sound like a believer.
- I'd like to believe.

385
00:28:57,575 --> 00:29:02,060
I'd like to believe there's more than
this short rocket trip to the grave.

386
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,083
I'd like to believe in
an afterlife.

387
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:08,371
I believe in science. I need proof.
I need facts and figures.

388
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,822
I can't just take it on faith
alone. And there lies the rub.

389
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:14,721
No faith, no belief.

390
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:24,273
I--I have
to plan breakfast now.

391
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,922
Um...romano-- he didn't kill
anybody himself, did he?

392
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,613
I mean, he just convinced them
to kill themselves.

393
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,841
That also fits in
with the dark motif.

394
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,831
In order for these things to win,
they have to take over a soul

395
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:41,463
that acts with its own free will. They
have to cooperate in their own destruction.

396
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,170
Hey, where the hell
have you been, kyle?

397
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:21,020
- Well, I've been busy.
- I can see.

398
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,593
Man, what's with you
and this chick...melinda?

399
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:27,391
Like you're obsessed
with her.

400
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:33,543
She and I--we have some
unfinished business.

401
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:38,151
So the fact that romano
never physically killed anyone

402
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,840
means that he has less power
than you thought.

403
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,240
Means he has more power.

404
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:45,922
Imagine being able to convince people--
100 of them-- to kill themselve

405
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,670
- Gets in their heads, huh?
- No, he gets inside their souls.

406
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:50,972
Makes them feel like
they're worthless, that they're bad.

407
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:54,193
He poisons their spirits. And the weaker
they get, the stronger he gets.

408
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:56,570
- He's doing this to andrea?
- Yeah, he's trying.

409
00:30:56,585 --> 00:31:00,300
And it makes me so frustrated, because
she's the only one who can turn him away.

410
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,492
And I have to make her
understand that.

411
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,282
- You don't know where she is?
- She said that she was going

412
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:09,012
back to the beginning,
but the beginning of what?

413
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:11,102
Your friendship?
The store?

414
00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:15,212
Wait a minute...

415
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:20,343
I used to tell andrea all the time that
death isn't the end, it's the beginning.

416
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:22,810
That's where she is.

417
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:24,943
She went back
to where she died--

418
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,961
where this began.

419
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:19,092
- I can't cross over.
- Why not?

420
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:21,091
Romano said I'd be punished.

421
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:23,090
- For what?
- That night

422
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:25,322
when mitch
came to the store

423
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,353
and when you told him
I was dead.

424
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:33,291
When I realized that was true--
that mitch was alive and I was dead...

425
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:37,172
for just one minute

426
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:41,792
I wanted to trade places.
I wanted to live so badly

427
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:45,892
that I wished it was mitch who had
been killed by the plane and not me.

428
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:49,060
I prayed for it.

429
00:32:49,078 --> 00:32:51,130
We were all in shock.

430
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:56,533
But you have to talk to mitch. And he has
something that he has to say to you, too.

431
00:32:56,536 --> 00:33:01,380
My own brother,
and I wished him dead!

432
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:05,001
I can't be forgiven for that.

433
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:08,620
- Yes, you can.
- I don't want to be.

434
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:34,792
I know you're packing,
but, I have to talk to you.

435
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:41,950
I know this is a lot
to take in.

436
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,891
- Ahh, you think?
- You tell me how well you know andrea.

437
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,891
That she's not at rest, that
something's wrong. You can feel it.

438
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:53,973
Did andrea know about this? That
you could... that you see the dead?

439
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:57,212
Yes. I used to talk to her
about it all the time.

440
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:59,402
I can't believe she never
said anything to you.

441
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,300
- Did she believe you?
- Yes.

442
00:34:01,897 --> 00:34:04,581
She was so open
and curious.

443
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:08,621
She had lots of questions,
always wanted to know more.

444
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:15,311
That night...
in front of the store,

445
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:17,951
when I saw you and you told me
what happened to andrea.

446
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,370
Are you saying
that andrea was there?

447
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,160
That you saw her? She
saw us, and she couldn't--

448
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,862
she couldn't let me
know she was there?

449
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:28,992
She was confused, mitch.

450
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:32,663
She thought that you were the one that
was dead. It was hard for all of us.

451
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,763
She's in a bad place.

452
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:38,601
She can't cross over
into the light, and you're the reason.

453
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:42,671
You have one last chance to do
something good for your sister.

454
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:54,191
There's a lot of her in this place.
It'll help us to be here.

455
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,080
So...how do we..

456
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:10,780
- what am i supposed to do? - The best
way is tell me something about andrea.

457
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:13,071
Just tell me a story.

458
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:22,322
she was traveling
all the time,

459
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:27,433
always away and never too good
about being in touch.

460
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:31,901
My father was sick,
and it got bad real fast.

461
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:35,551
And I think my dad was hanging on
so he could see her one more time.

462
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:37,672
But we couldn't find her.

463
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,762
I was with my pop
the night he died.

464
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,482
He knew andrea would be heartbroken
about not being with him...

465
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:49,102
how guilty she'd feel.

466
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:54,071
And he wanted me to tell her
that it was all right,

467
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:57,640
that he loved her,
and that he knew she loved him.

468
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:00,130
And that he'd see her again.

469
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:05,160
He didn't want her
to hurt.

470
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,811
You never told me that.

471
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:11,122
She's here, mitch

472
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:15,293
Now?

473
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:17,333
In here with us?

474
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:20,680
She wants to know why you never
told her what your father said.

475
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:25,300
Because I was so mad
about her not being there.

476
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:30,330
And I know it's wrong. And I'm sorry.
I was going to tell her someday.

477
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:32,380
I just--I never thought
it would be too late.

478
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:35,751
Will you tell him, melinda?

479
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:42,071
Mitch, the night that you came
to the store, andrea was there.

480
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,811
She was watching when I told
you that she was dead.

481
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:50,831
And for a moment, when she realized the
truth she wanted to change places with you.

482
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:54,323
She wanted to be the one who was alive even if
it meant that you were the one that was dead.

483
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,581
It was only for a split second.

484
00:36:56,588 --> 00:36:59,120
And she feels
full of shame about that.

485
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:05,742
It's part of what's keeping her here.
She needs your forgiveness.

486
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:12,402
- Tell her I--
- she can hear you.

487
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:17,212
Andrea...

488
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:22,851
I wished the same thing.
I wanted it to be me on that plane,

489
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:25,511
and you still safe--

490
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:27,793
still alive.

491
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:31,631
I mean you were always
the one who lived.

492
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:36,431
I was always so cautious,
and so worried about the rules.

493
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:38,522
And what people think...

494
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:46,333
you always charged ahead. You're the
one who should have gotten more life.

495
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,663
She needs to hear you say
that you forgive her.

496
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,532
There's nothing to forgive.
She didn't do anything wrong.

497
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:03,363
Can you forgive me?

498
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,912
Let's just say we're even.

499
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,932
She says you're even now.

500
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:29,023
He says I'll be judged
in the light.

501
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:33,493
Don't be scared.
Don't let him into your head.

502
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,970
Why isn't he coming inside?

503
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:43,012
He can't now.

504
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,272
There's too much love
in here.

505
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:48,273
And that's what's in
the light, not judgment.

506
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:54,001
Look, we all feel guilt
about what happened that night.

507
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:58,210
But it's time that we let it go.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

508
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm scared.

509
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:04,380
I know you are.

510
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:08,541
Just try and remember l the good
things that you're leaving us with.

511
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,422
Remember that every person
that knew you is better for it...

512
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,960
especially me.

513
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,730
You taught me
to be fearless.

514
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:20,450
And you loved really well,

515
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,542
and you were loved. And that's what you're
bring into that light, nothing else.

516
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:32,510
Ahh...I see it.

517
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,791
The light...ohh.

518
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:45,611
It's more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

519
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:48,122
Then go into it.

520
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:54,381
You're free.
This is how it's supposed to be.

521
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:58,763
Melinda...

522
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:04,900
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

523
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:07,660
You'll see me again.

524
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:11,121
And when I get to that light,
you better be waiting.

525
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:15,040
You better be
the first face that I see.

526
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:18,960
I'll be waiting.

527
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:23,381
Good-bye.

528
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,892
Say hi to pop for me.

529
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:37,502
He says hi back.

530
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,721
She's gone.

531
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:42,183
Let's see, you're going to driscoll
county, connecting in chicago.

532
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:45,332
You're all set. Just need
to see a photo I.D.

533
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:51,791
Oh, shoot. I left
my I.D. In the car.

534
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:55,753
Got time. Go and get it, and just
come back to the front of the line.
