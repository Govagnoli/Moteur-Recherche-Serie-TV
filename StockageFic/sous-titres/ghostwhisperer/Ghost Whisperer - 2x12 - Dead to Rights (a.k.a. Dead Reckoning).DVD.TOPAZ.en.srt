1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,400
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,700
I'm married,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,000
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,900
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,800
Except that from time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,300
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,600
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:30,300
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,109
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:41,107
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:47,605
- He sure is good looking.
- And he's completely unaware of it.

14
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,503
Bob has no idea of the effect
he has on women.

15
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,000
And a sharp dresser.
Check out the tie.

16
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:55,401
Well, you know what they say.
The clothes make the man.

17
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:57,401
And the dog.

18
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:00,400
This is amazing. I mean,
I've heard a lot about therapy dogs.

19
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,601
How did you get him into it?

20
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:05,201
Well, he's just always been so good
with people, especially children.

21
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,800
He had to go through some training,
but he's the perfect dog for it.

22
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:12,901
- He's huggable. He's patient.
- And you do this every weekend?

23
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,200
Whenever we can.

24
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:18,400
This hospital was really
great to my husband.

25
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:21,400
They did everything they could
to try and save him.

26
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,601
Everybody was really kind.

27
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:28,101
Anyway, we have some more stops
to make. Are you in a rush? - No.

28
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,503
Good.

29
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,001
Hey, Bob!
How ya doin', boy?

30
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:51,901
Ooh, nice tie.

31
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,803
Notice how Bob gets all the attention
and we're just the appendages
who happen to be nearby.

32
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,603
Oh, don't forget your donation
for the silent auction.

33
00:01:57,707 --> 00:02:00,401
Oh, I won't. I have so much stuff.
Don't worry.

34
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:01,801
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to ask her something.

35
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,702
Can you please hold bob?
Thank you so much. I'll be right back.

36
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,600
Violet!

37
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,801
Bob.

38
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,603
Ok.

39
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:12,200
Let's go this way.

40
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,401
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my god, I am so sorry.

41
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:17,400
My fault. My fault.
Oh, gosh.

42
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:22,503
- Oh, beautiful dog. May I?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

43
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,203
Are you all right?

44
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,300
I've just had a really tough day.

45
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:37,301
And he reminds me of a dog
we used to have. Don't you?

46
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,302
Is there anything I can do?

47
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,701
No. Thank you.

48
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:45,003
Just enjoy your day.

49
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,102
I mean it.

50
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,903
Enjoy everything.

51
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,602
Friend of yours?

52
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,002
Uh, new friend of Bob's.

53
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,002
Did she look familiar to you?

54
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,002
You know, I really
didn't see her that well.

55
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:01,001
I swear I've seen her somewhere.

56
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:04,002
Anyway, I need to use the restroom
and then get going.

57
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,201
They're through those
double doors, I think.

58
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:09,103
Ok. Bye, bob.

59
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:25,101
Excuse me.

60
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,301
Can I help you?

61
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,401
I'm looking for a rest room.

62
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,002
Well, you won't find it here.

63
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:44,700
Ok. Sorry.

64
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,500
Let me show you.

65
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,003
It's right here.

66
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:58,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

67
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,301
EPISODE 2x12
Dead To Rights

68
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:13,303
I was looking forward
to a nice toasty store.

69
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:14,300
It's freezing in here.

70
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:18,002
Oh, sorry. I just needed some
fresh air. I was feeling a little
claustrophobic today.

71
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:21,801
- Is it ok if I close the door?
- Sure.

72
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,403
Hey, what's in that box?

73
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,102
Oh, the donations for the hospital.

74
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,102
Ah! The silent auction.
I totally forgot.

75
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,401
- Are you taking this in today?
- Yeah. After work.

76
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:32,502
If I can get ned to bring everything
by and it in the back of your truck?

77
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:35,003
- Yes. I will add it to the haul.
- Excellent.

78
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,801
Ned. Ned, I left everything
in a bag by the door.

79
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,801
If you could just bring
it by after school.

80
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,802
But I have volleyball practice.

81
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:45,703
That's at 4:00. That leaves you
40 minutes. It'll only take you 20.

82
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:48,401
- Ok.
- Oh, shanka sho musch.

83
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:51,401
I know. It's a bummer.
I'll see you after school.

84
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,001
I am gonna make myself some tea.

85
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,503
Sorry.

86
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,103
Are you ok?

87
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,900
Yeah. Uh...

88
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:47,001
nasty leg cramp.

89
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,301
- There you go.
- Thanks.

90
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:59,002
So, 2 creepy visions,
but no ghosts.

91
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:01,203
Yeah. Someone's trying
to tell me something.

92
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,703
What?

93
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:07,802
I just keep gettin this feeling
like I can't breathe, can't move.

94
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,400
Why do they gotta make
everything a riddle?

95
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,500
Why do they a play
these games with you?

96
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,502
They communicate with me
the only way they can.

97
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:16,002
Yeah. Well, it makes it
really hard to know what to do.

98
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,902
I'm gonna start with the obituaries,

99
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:21,600
see if I can find an stories 
on deaths in mental hospitals.

100
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,201
Maybe that's why I was in
a straitjacket in the vision.

101
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,902
That's  a great way
to spend the afternoon.

102
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:29,803
That's why god created coffee.

103
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,301
So,  where do I put the stuff
for this auction?

104
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,700
Just right here on the table.
That looks heavy.

105
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,501
Did your mom make you
throw out your video games?

106
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,303
Nah. It's just some random stuff.

107
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:45,403
- Need some help?
- No, thanks.

108
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:49,403
Obituaries. Whoa.
Are we doing some ghost business?

109
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,100
We  are not doing anything.

110
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,302
I just thought you might want
to bounce some stuff off of me,

111
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,603
since, well, you know, I know.

112
00:07:56,807 --> 00:08:00,102
Thanks. That's sweet.
But it's kind of a solo act.

113
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,500
Whatever. I had
volleyball practice anyway.

114
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,602
But I'm on cell.

115
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,800
Hey, Ned, wait a minute.

116
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,403
I knew you'd see it my way.

117
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:20,401
This is your dad's stuff, isn't it?

118
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,603
Yeah. So?

119
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:24,502
So, I'm surprised that Delia
would want to get rid of it.

120
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,600
Are you...

121
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:28,003
you sure that you grabbed
the right box?

122
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,203
Yeah. That's the one.
Definitely.

123
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:35,502
Ok. Well, I'm not sure how much you're
gonna be able to get for this hat.

124
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,800
Bye.

125
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,002
I'm listening, honey.
I'm listening.

126
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,902
You have no idea
how horrible it was.

127
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,902
I was using all my strength,
my whole being,

128
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,301
just to even move my little finger
and say that I was alive

129
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,800
and that I could feel it.

130
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,101
Honey, I still don't get it.

131
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:02,400
I mean, the ghost was killed
by an undertaker?

132
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:03,901
They thought he or she was dead,
but he wasn't?

133
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,602
They died in some kind of surgery?

134
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:07,301
The ghost was obviously
feeling helpless.

135
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,603
There was stuff being done to it
that it couldn't stop,

136
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:12,703
that it didn't want, but what
was I supposed to do about it?

137
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,900
All right, just tell me how
this vision was different
than your other visions.

138
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:20,002
You know, I mean,
how you felt about it or something.

139
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,603
Well, in this one I left my body.

140
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:28,600
Like I died and I could see
everything around me.

141
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,700
Look, maybe this ghost, uh...

142
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,400
just wants people to know
what happened to it.

143
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,000
You know, whatever it was,

144
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,809
what he felt,
if they were aware of it.

145
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:42,907
Maybe you should check, see if
anybody died in a funeral home,
freak accidents, surgery.

146
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:45,105
Do you feel it?

147
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,400
Feel what?

148
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:51,503
Do you feel anything on your back?

149
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:53,900
No, honey. What...

150
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,402
There's...
I don't feel anything.

151
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:58,301
There's nothing.

152
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,003
What is it, Mel?

153
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,401
What?

154
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:08,403
"Srom itcelid." Is this a new
character in Lemony Snicket book?

155
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:09,701
Do I look amused?

156
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:13,202
No. You look grumpy and mildly tired,
yet oddly bewitching.

157
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,000
- Does it mean anything or not?
- Not. Is...

158
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,900
Is it a secret code?
Is it a sorority?

159
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,200
- Can you put it in context for me?
- My husband's back.

160
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:21,402
As in a tattoo?

161
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:25,802
As in it appeared on his back
as if someone was writing it
and then disappeared.

162
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:28,702
You know how to put a slight spin
on someone's day, don't you?

163
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,003
Welcome to my world.

164
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,603
Is there any way he can
come into my office.

165
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:33,603
'Cause then maybe it would
happen again and I could do some...

166
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,603
No. I just need to know what it means,
if it means anything.

167
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:39,003
I need more information.
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,900
I'm trying to unravel a haunting.

169
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,402
It either has to do with a mental
patient who died in an institution

170
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:46,300
or somebody who died on
the embalming table at a mortuary.

171
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,002
Ok. There is actual hair standing up
on the back of my neck.

172
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,100
Would you like to feel it?

173
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,300
I will take your word for it.

174
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,800
- Look, professor Payne...
- Rick.

175
00:11:55,907 --> 00:12:01,102
I just want you to know that
it's not just me who took a chance
when I told you what I could do.

176
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:02,603
The weird things that
have been happening to you,

177
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:06,403
- the things that have been moved...
- Things that are still happening.

178
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,100
This can really invade your life.

179
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:12,003
It's all right. I've been through
worse. I was in a bar in Philly...

180
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,803
I'm serious.

181
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,400
Well, maybe I've been waiting
for something to invade my life
for a long time.

182
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,801
Maybe this is just what I needed.

183
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,502
I'm gonna go figure this out.

184
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,803
I'll get back to you.

185
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:27,003
- Thank you.
- Sure.

186
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,501
If I wanted to give this stuff away,
I would have put it in the box myself.

187
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:30,402
Then why didn't you?

188
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,403
Hey, I don't have to answer
to a 13-year-old.

189
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,002
I'm your mother and
you'll do what I say.

190
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:38,300
- You always tell me I can be myself.
- You had no right to take these.

191
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,502
What were you thinking?

192
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,901
These are your father's things, Ned.

193
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,301
Think I don't know that?

194
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,902
What is wrong with you?

195
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:48,301
- I am so damn furious...
- I don't get it!

196
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,303
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, you get it.

197
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,502
And you know you get it.

198
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:59,603
You are just lucky I figured out
what you were trying to do
before it was too late.

199
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,002
Oh, god. I am so sorry you
had to hear all that.

200
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,201
No, it's ok.

201
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,203
What happened?

202
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,403
I have no idea
what's gotten into him.

203
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm just gonna bring
this all to the car.

204
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:17,002
So, Ned,

205
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,500
you want to talk about why
you pulled such a loser move?

206
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:22,100
It wasn't a loser move.

207
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:27,302
Ok, you want to come out here
and tell me what's up?

208
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,400
What's up is,

209
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:31,501
I'm sick of seeing mom
sad all the time.

210
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:33,603
Ned, I don't think
she's sad all the time.

211
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,203
That's because she's good
at putting on a happy face.

212
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,003
Try living with her.

213
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:41,403
She cries every
single day about dad.

214
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:44,403
It's like she hopes
he's still alive somewhere.

215
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:48,100
She just won't let him go.

216
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:50,802
Say that again.

217
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:52,002
What?

218
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:55,301
The part about still being alive
and not wanting to let him go.

219
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,803
So?

220
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:59,600
Ned, I really want to finish
this conversation, ok?

221
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:04,703
You're in charge of the store.
I'll be right back.

222
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,503
Please stop it!

223
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,602
No!

224
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:38,100
Please!

225
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,002
No. No. Please.

226
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:45,402
Please don't. Please!

227
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:52,200
Please stop!

228
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:05,100
Found it.

229
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,900
Hi. Uh, I'm lost again.

230
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,802
Do you know where I could find
the coffee machine?

231
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,100
No.

232
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:50,100
Well, you seem pretty sure
about that, so...

233
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,800
Great.

234
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,901
I got these out of the recycling bin.

235
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,901
Oh, thanks. Just dump 'em
on the table.

236
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,203
- Can I help you go through these?
- Thanks. But I have to.

237
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,100
You know, it's just that woman
I saw at the bedside,

238
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:18,101
she looked so familiar.

239
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,303
I know that I have seen her
in the news.

240
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,403
Maybe on TV?

241
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:26,803
Maybe. But I think it was a magazine.
Some sort of family thing.

242
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:29,202
Are you sure you found this ghost?

243
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,303
Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,703
I saw his energy, I guess,
hovering over the bed.

245
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,401
He  was hooked up
to all these machines.

246
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:37,603
There were wires all around him,
just like I've been seeing
in the visions.

247
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,600
How'd you find him?

248
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,301
It was actually something Ned said.

249
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,103
Do you remember last year
when I had that ghost

250
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,400
who was brain dead but he could only
come to me when he flatlined?

251
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,502
Well, it made me realize
that this ghost may still be alive

252
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,601
but trapped in his own body.

253
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,700
And he hates the things
that are being done to him,

254
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:53,400
but he still has a message he has
to get across to me or someone else.

255
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:57,601
And it makes total sense with everything
that I've been seeing and feeling.

256
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,103
It makes sense to me.

257
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:03,203
Anyway, I think that he attached himself
to me when I was at the hospital.

258
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:05,002
But how can you tell...

259
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,901
Hey! Wait.
This is it.

260
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,602
This is the spirit.

261
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:12,503
Hugh Bristow.

262
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:17,201
He's been brain dead for months.

263
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,300
There's a big court battle over it.

264
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,900
I read about that.

265
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,101
He had A.L.S., Right?

266
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,303
Yeah. Lou Gehrig's disease.

267
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:26,203
His wife took him to some
mysterious clinic in Europe.

268
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,403
He was in a coma right after.

269
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, rich family.
Keeping him on life support, huh?

270
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,603
Yeah. Now his wife
wants to pull the plug.

271
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:33,803
Nice.

272
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,000
You know, he was only married for
a month before he went into a coma?

273
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:41,601
The family thinks she just wants
his money and that somehow
she put him into this coma.

274
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,300
How are you gonna get to this guy?

275
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:46,403
You said the family has guards.
They feel like they're under siege.

276
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:50,103
But I have a secret weapon.

277
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,400
Come on, Bob.

278
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:09,902
Are you kidding me?

279
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,600
Oh, he's a therapy dog.
She met him a couple of days ago.

280
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,303
That's all right, Ben.

281
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:16,701
I remember you.

282
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah. We were just making our rounds
and I thought maybe you could use
some company.

283
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,801
Well, I don't know
if he can go in there.

284
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:27,901
I'd have to check with the doctor.

285
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,600
But I could always go for a break.

286
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:32,102
Do you want to go for a break?

287
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:34,102
Ok. Is that good?

288
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,902
Yes, you are a good dog. 

289
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:40,002
- Come on.
- Oh! You lead.

290
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:44,501
You know, my husband doesn't even
have a tie that nice.

291
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,501
Gosh, there's nothing like
some doggy love, huh?

292
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:54,002
And it gives bill a chance
to talk to our son.

293
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:56,601
Bill thinks it's important
to talk to him.

294
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,501
You know, in case he hears us.

295
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:02,403
This must be such
a hard time for you.

296
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:03,801
You have no idea.

297
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,903
Come  on.

298
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,201
And then there are all the lawyers
and the reporters.

299
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm so sorry.

300
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,001
You must need your privacy
in a time like this.

301
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,600
Well, thanks to her,
that's impossible.

302
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,902
Come on.

303
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:22,402
You're being polite. I'm sure
you've heard it all over the news.

304
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,200
I know there's a conflict.

305
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,100
You are polite.

306
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,000
I guess "conflict" is a good word for a
wife who's trying to kill her husband.

307
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:32,903
After having failed once before.

308
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,501
My son trusted her.

309
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,001
He said he loved her.

310
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,400
But maybe that's just
because we didn't.

311
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:40,202
Help them.

312
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,703
Please.

313
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,401
Help them.

314
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:45,903
Then he said, "help them."

315
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,603
That's easy. Sounds like you're
describing an astral projection.

316
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,200
That's an out-of-body experience?

317
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,903
Or an O.B.E., as we pretentious
experts like to say.

318
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:58,202
An energy body or an astral body
carries the consciousness
from the physical body.

319
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:01,701
And the energy would have to stay close
to the physical body, wouldn't it?

320
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:03,401
Well, that depends on
how advanced the energy is.

321
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,100
Some people say they
travel to other planets

322
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,800
where no doubt they have wonderful
conversations about all this.

323
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:09,403
What about the silver cord?

324
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:12,801
Umbilical cord? Keeps the soul
tethered to the body, and if you...

325
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,201
cut that cord,

326
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,801
you're going to be spending
a lot of time with Elvis.
What's this all about?

327
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:21,300
Turns out that my ghost is not a ghost.
He's in a coma on life support.

328
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,100
Wait a minute. He's...

329
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:26,300
- He's astral projecting at you?
- That's one way to put it.

330
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,602
What does he want?

331
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,303
I think he wants to cut
the cord once and for all.

332
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:32,001
You think this entity speaks latin?

333
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,103
I don't know. Why?

334
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:38,300
Well, that message that
was on your husband's back.

335
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,500
Mors dilecti.

336
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,601
It's latin.

337
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,102
Why do you think
it was written backwards?

338
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,703
You said this was written
on Jim's back, right?

339
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, maybe it was written
from the inside.

340
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:51,001
Do you know what it means?

341
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:52,803
Do I know what I means?
Me, the guy with "professor"

342
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,103
in front of his name
on the red door over there?

343
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,701
- Well?
- Yes, I know what I means.

344
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,301
Aren't you even impressed
that I figured out the whole
latin backwards thing?

345
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,603
- I worked the mirror in...
- You have no idea what it means, do you?

346
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,602
I know what it means.
It's the...

347
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,500
it's roughly translated from latin, 

348
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:09,003
"the body of a crime,"
the body or the proof...

349
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,302
proof that a crime
has been committed.

350
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:12,500
That makes no sense.

351
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,203
Oh, like a phantom writing on
your husband's back makes sense?

352
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,602
Will you just check it for me?

353
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:17,800
You wound me.

354
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:22,700
- Bound to happen.
- The first cut's always the deepest.

355
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,701
Did  anything else weird
happen with your back?

356
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:27,003
No one's used it as a notepad today,
if that's what you mean.

357
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:31,003
- Where are you?
- I'm at the Bristows' house.

358
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,300
I just want to see
if I can talk to his wife.

359
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,001
Why?

360
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,202
I don't know.

361
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:39,402
Just get her side of it, I guess.

362
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,500
I couldn't bring myself to tell his
parents that I could see his spirit.

363
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:46,303
Ooh, here she is.
I gotta go.

364
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,903
Bye.

365
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:50,200
Hi.

366
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,802
- You just won't stop, will you?
- I'm sorry?

367
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:56,602
You just won't leave me alone!
You bastard!

368
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:59,201
You no-good bastard!

369
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:02,803
You... leave... me... alone!

370
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,403
You want a story?

371
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:06,002
Here's a story for you!

372
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:09,101
Gold-digger wife!

373
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,403
How's that?!

374
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:30,002
Do you have to print that?

375
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:32,202
I'm not a reporter.

376
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:33,600
What are you?

377
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:36,403
Detective, then?
A private eye mommy and daddy hired?

378
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:39,000
No. I'm just someone
who wants to help.

379
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:39,902
You look...

380
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,403
it's this simple.

381
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:44,201
Hugh didn't want to be
hooked up to machines.

382
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,300
He told me so.

383
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,203
Ok. Well, did he
put it in his will?

384
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:50,803
No. But he was my husband.

385
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:51,900
We talked.

386
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,903
He told me things.

387
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,401
And I'm not going to let
their big money and their

388
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:00,701
big lawyers stop me from trying
to do what Hugh wanted.

389
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,303
You tell them that.

390
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:06,300
You tell them I'm not giving up.

391
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

392
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,903
Hey. What you doin'?

393
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,303
Oh, I'm just sorting some things.

394
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,803
You?

395
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:37,401
Nothin'.

396
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:42,100
I don't like to fight with you.

397
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,900
Me neither.

398
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:49,703
Maybe I should have asked you
why you did what you did

399
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,002
before yelling at you.

400
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:55,403
So I'm asking you now.

401
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,600
Why did you want to get rid of
all your dad's stuff?

402
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:01,701
It makes you sad.

403
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,103
It helps me remember.

404
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:06,900
It seems like the same thing.

405
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:09,002
Sometimes remembering...

406
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:12,101
does make you sad.

407
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:16,800
Sometimes it makes you smile.
Sometimes it makes you feel grateful.

408
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,803
Sometimes it reminds you of...

409
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:22,703
the good life you had
with somebody...

410
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:26,002
and all the things they gave you.

411
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,300
Ned, it's just a...

412
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:29,802
a big jumble of things.

413
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,000
There's grief,

414
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:32,100
there's joy,

415
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,202
there's anger...

416
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,701
there are so many emotions,
you just have to figure out a way

417
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:42,101
to sort through them.

418
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:45,903
I don't know how.

419
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:50,003
Well, I got a news flash for you.

420
00:24:54,908 --> 00:24:57,002
Neither do I.

421
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:59,703
Neither does anybody.

422
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:03,702
You just have to work through it,
feel the feelings.

423
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:06,801
Just takes time.

424
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:10,102
How much time?

425
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,600
Well...

426
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:15,203
all I can tell you is that every day

427
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,300
it starts to hurt a little less.

428
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,900
Does that mean I'll forget about him?

429
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:23,801
Oh, no, kiddo.

430
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,400
You will never forget him.

431
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,602
And neither will I.

432
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:39,003
And having said all that...

433
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:42,500
I think you were right.

434
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:44,603
About what?

435
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:48,500
Maybe I do hang on to too much stuff.

436
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:48,901
But...

437
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:51,303
Maybe if we gave some of it away...

438
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:52,401
not all of it,

439
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:55,400
but some of it,

440
00:25:55,707 --> 00:26:02,503
it'll be like your dad's still out there
making other people smile, not just us.

441
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:07,300
Ok.

442
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:09,302
Except...

443
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:13,303
I vote for letting go of
the beer can cap.

444
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,501
My thought exactly.

445
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,600
All right, why don't you go
get the box? It's in the back.

446
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:23,302
I'm going to take Bob
for a quick walk, ok?

447
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:27,401
Ooh! Sorry. I just had
a few errands to...

448
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:29,201
Hey, no problem.

449
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:32,501
Ned and I have a few things
that we want to donate
to the hospital after all.

450
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:35,300
The box is a little lighter,
but he's in the back getting it.

451
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:38,003
- Ok. Well, I'll take it by later.
- Oh, it's ok. I can do it.

452
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:40,903
No, I have to go by there anyway.
If you can do me a favor.

453
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:41,503
Sure.

454
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:44,303
Could I borrow Bob again?

455
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:47,703
Is there something going on between the
two of you that I should know about?

456
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:51,302
He's really good company.

457
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:56,500
My wife is sure that
Hugh's coming back.

458
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,900
What about you?

459
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:00,300
I...

460
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,902
wish I...

461
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,203
I wish I could be so sure.

462
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:09,103
The doctors, they all say he's gone.
He's been brain dead for months.

463
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:12,801
They say there's no chance,
there's no...

464
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:17,003
chance my son's going to come back.

465
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:19,703
But Jenna doesn't want
to hear anything.

466
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,903
You know, that's still her son
in there, and he's still breathing.

467
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,501
I just...

468
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,800
I just wish I knew if
I was doing the right thing.

469
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,001
What about his wife?

470
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,803
She just wants the money.

471
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:34,700
That's why she married him.

472
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:36,702
She knew damn well how sick he was.

473
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,103
She was waiting tables.

474
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:42,303
She didn't even go to college.
She doesn't love him the way we do.

475
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:45,303
But I don't want to keep Hugh alive
just to spite her.

476
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:48,403
Would you mind...

477
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:53,501
Can I sit with him
just a few minutes?

478
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,603
No, I don't mind.

479
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,702
Sure.

480
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,903
Keep an eye on Bob.

481
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:15,700
- Do you want them to end this?
- I'm not meant to be here.

482
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,501
They're keeping me here.

483
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,502
Are you suffering?

484
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:21,701
I feel like a prisoner.

485
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:28,600
Well, did you tell Lisa that you
didn't want to be kept alive
if something happened?

486
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,403
Oh, my god.
She's got to know.

487
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:31,503
Know what?

488
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:34,002
She's got to know what she did.

489
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:35,600
What did she do?

490
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:37,801
I've got to talk to them.

491
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:41,700
- Well, I don't know if I can...
- No, please. You're my only chance.

492
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:43,302
I know, but...

493
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:44,403
is it really your business?

494
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, maybe you need to step
away from this one and just...

495
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,903
you know, just let it play out
between the families.

496
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,501
They have rights.

497
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,501
It's not up to us to step in
between and tell them what to do.

498
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:57,400
Us?

499
00:28:57,508 --> 00:28:59,702
All right, you.

500
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,003
I'm not telling them what to do.

501
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,203
It's...

502
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,702
I'm supposed to help the dead
with their unfinished business.

503
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:07,700
Yeah, but nobody's dead here.
Now, what's the problem?

504
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:10,601
No, but his spirit still came to me,
and he asked me for help.

505
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,103
I mean, that's what this
whole thing should be about,

506
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:14,203
not what his wife wants,
not what his parents want.

507
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:15,901
It should be what Hugh wants.

508
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,403
He's the one who's laying there,
wasting away.

509
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,601
You're absolutely sure
this is what he wants?

510
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,203
Yeah. I have no doubts.

511
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,200
Wouldn't you want the same thing?

512
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,203
Wait a minute.

513
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:30,402
Would you?

514
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:32,603
If I didn't think
I would ever recover?

515
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah. Absolutely.

516
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:40,000
But...

517
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:42,402
Can you ever really be sure?

518
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,801
Of course not.

519
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,503
No more sure than you can be
of what will happen

520
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,003
when you walk out our
front door tomorrow morning.

521
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:50,301
The only thing you can do is
take all the information you have

522
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:53,000
and give it your best shot.

523
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,402
I know that my best shot
is in the light,

524
00:29:55,507 --> 00:30:00,201
not with machines or tubes
or a hospital bed.

525
00:30:01,107 --> 00:30:03,201
You have insider information.
It's not fair.

526
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,602
So do you.

527
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,801
Yeah, I know.

528
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,202
It's just, you know...

529
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,301
if it came to you,

530
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:15,601
it wouldn't be easy for me,
that's all.

531
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,602
Yeah, but you'd do it
because you love me.

532
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,901
And you know I'd be ok.

533
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:23,800
Yeah. I would.

534
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,903
And you?

535
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,903
If you're still here,
hook me up.

536
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,501
I'll take the machines.

537
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,801
I'll take a beating heart,
if nothing else, just in case.

538
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:38,101
But if you go before me,

539
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:42,301
don't even bother plugging them in.

540
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:50,500
I don't want to interfere
in these people's lives.

541
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:53,803
And I don't want to get
between them. But...

542
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:58,903
Hugh Bristow doesn't have anybody
else to speak for him but me.

543
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,603
So I will.

544
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:04,702
So you should.

545
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:08,303
Don't let them do this!

546
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:09,100
Do what?

547
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:10,400
They're going to bring me back.

548
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:15,701
Please, I'm gone already!
Just tell them to let me go!

549
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:22,901
What just happened?

550
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:26,703
I think Hugh just died.

551
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:30,402
And they brought him back.

552
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:51,600
You got brass ones,
I'll give you that,

553
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:54,502
to come here after last time.

554
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:55,903
Just what is it you want?

555
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:58,503
I came here because
I need you to trust me.

556
00:31:58,607 --> 00:31:59,902
Why?

557
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:03,600
Because I'm going to ask you
to do something that isn't so easy.

558
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:05,701
Why do you care about any of this?

559
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,700
I'm just trying to help.

560
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,800
Do you believe the things
they say about me in the papers?

561
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:13,400
Should I?

562
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:18,000
Hugh and I met 2 years ago in a diner.

563
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,502
I was his waitress.

564
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,403
The papers love to play that up.

565
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:27,503
For me it was love at first sight.

566
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:33,202
As we got more serious,
Hugh told me he had A.L.S..

567
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:36,302
A death sentence.

568
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:44,701
Whatever time he had left,
I wanted to share it with him.

569
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:54,303
He wanted to get married, but he didn't
want to saddle me with his illness.

570
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:59,602
I loved him so much
nothing could have scared me away.

571
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:03,802
The wedding was so beautiful.

572
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:06,203
Not even his parents could ruin it.

573
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:09,101
And don't think they didn't try.

574
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:12,800
They were sure I was only after his money.

575
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:15,101
His disease progressed more
quickly than we expected,

576
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:19,500
so we went to a clinic in Switzerland.

577
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,703
Then he went into the coma.

578
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:24,103
Not the usual thing
that happens with A.L.S..

579
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:27,401
So that's my side of it.
Is that what you came here for?

580
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,402
No.

581
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,803
I didn't think so.

582
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,900
Well, whatever it is you're up to,

583
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:34,103
I hope you don't think
that you can hurt me.

584
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:36,702
Not any more than
they've hurt me already.

585
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:41,100
'Cause I'm pretty much
bulletproof now.

586
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:48,001
I came here because
I have a message from Hugh.

587
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,802
When did Hugh give you a message?

588
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,800
It's complicated,

589
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,700
but I need to tell you at the hospital
with Bill and Janet, all of you together.

590
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:58,601
No way. Uh...

591
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,003
I mean, even if I wanted to,
they would never...

592
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,200
It's something you're going to
want to hear.

593
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:07,301
Something everyone needs to hear.

594
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:12,201
You're going to be ok.
We're going to bring you through this.

595
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:15,201
But you have to keep fighting, Hugh.

596
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,700
You have to stay strong.

597
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,002
You've got to be kidding.

598
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,402
It's not your turn.
We have another hour.

599
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:30,100
- Why did you bring her here?
- I just want you all to listen.

600
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,001
Ok? Just listen.

601
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:34,400
I have a message from Hugh.

602
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,803
What are you talking about?

603
00:34:35,905 --> 00:34:37,901
His spirit is here with us right now.

604
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,003
What is this?

605
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:43,501
- What are you trying to pull?
- I'm not trying to pull anything,

606
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,303
and I'm not going to waste time
on explanations.

607
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:47,902
There are some things
that he wants you all to know.

608
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:52,802
I feel so much stronger
just being close to him.

609
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,601
Tell him I liked it
when he read to me.

610
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,903
I just liked hearing his voice.

611
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:01,703
He wants you to know
that he liked it when you read to him.

612
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,102
It meant a lot to hear your voice,
especially when you read Hemingway.

613
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,000
Ok, that's enough.

614
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:09,300
You can't do this to us.

615
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:13,101
What is wrong with you? Do you
not think we have suffered enough?

616
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:15,800
- Tell her I know what happened.
- He knows what happened.

617
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,002
And tell her it's all right.

618
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:21,901
- He's saying it's all right.
- What? What happened?

619
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:26,301
He's saying something about medication.
Did you give him pills?

620
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:30,402
No. This is some kind of a trick.

621
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,501
He's saying that it's all right
and he forgives you, and so will they.

622
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:37,602
I took care of my son.

623
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:41,702
I know how to take care of my son.

624
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:49,203
I was afraid that she had done
something to him in Switzerland.

625
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:52,802
Hugh went into a seizure.

626
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:57,703
So I gave him some muscle relaxants.

627
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,903
Which ones?

628
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:02,000
The ones I always gave him
when he seized.

629
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:03,800
The doctors took him off those.

630
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:07,700
They said they would interact
with his antidepressants.

631
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:10,301
How could you give them to him
without telling me?

632
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,600
He seized and I...

633
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:15,201
I had to do something.

634
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,103
That was when he went into the coma.

635
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:20,803
Wait. He doesn't want to blame anyone.
He just wants you all to stop this.

636
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,800
Bill, this is all my fault.

637
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:25,601
She's right.

638
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,301
Look what I've done...
I've killed him!

639
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:29,602
He's saying none of this matters now.

640
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:34,600
He just wants you all to stop
hating each other and let him go.

641
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,901
But if this is true,

642
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,603
if he really is here,

643
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:41,303
then he's aware...

644
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:45,603
aware of what's going on.
How can we end his life?

645
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,502
I am aware, mom.

646
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,900
I'm aware that I'm not coming back.

647
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,802
And I will continue to be trapped here
until these machines stop living for me.

648
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,802
He is aware.

649
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:58,803
He can see you and he can feel you,

650
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:00,500
but he knows that it's his time to go,

651
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:02,602
and he's not living.

652
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:04,402
These machines are doing it for him.

653
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:07,102
He's my son.

654
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,400
No.

655
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:12,500
I can't let him go.

656
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,801
Mom, you want me to stay here for you,

657
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:16,400
not for me.

658
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:20,002
He says that he thinks you're
wanting him to stay for your sake,

659
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,100
not for him.

660
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:27,901
And keeping him here,
it's only making it harder on everyone.

661
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:30,901
Mom...

662
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:34,103
I need you to heal.

663
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:38,003
I want you to love Lisa.

664
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,901
She's all alone now.

665
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,401
She needs you.

666
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:45,501
What's happening?

667
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:49,802
Tell Lisa I know that she loved me.

668
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:52,700
I knew it was for real.

669
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:55,800
I felt her tears on my shoulders

670
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,700
and on my back.

671
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,200
She didn't want me
to see her crying.

672
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:05,900
Tell her I know how hard
she fought for me.

673
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:12,002
He knows how much you loved him.

674
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:17,503
He was talking about the night
that he felt your tears...

675
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:08,001
- Jim?
- Shower.

676
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:12,303
Ooh. That's a good idea.
Is there room for me?

677
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:16,100
It can be arranged, I think.

678
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,602
Is it raining where you are?

679
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,802
Oh, professor Payne.

680
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:25,500
No, it's a shower.

681
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,701
You know what?
That's a lite too much information.

682
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,201
Uh, actually,
it's not enough information.

683
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:31,701
Well, that's all you're getting.

684
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:33,801
You're cruel, but you knew that,
didn't you?

685
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:37,102
No, cruel would be if I run out of
hot water. What can I do for you?

686
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:41,902
I know you may find this difficult to
believe, but I may have made an error.

687
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,600
I find it shocking
that you're admitting it.

688
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,101
What's your error?

689
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:50,000
That latin translation I gave you.
It seems my linguistics are a bit rusty.

690
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:52,500
Oh. Well, no worries.
It's all taken care of.

691
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:54,002
Game over for now.

692
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:57,003
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- What do you mean?

693
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,303
The phrase "mors dilecti"

694
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:04,101
it does not mean "body of the crime"
after all.

695
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,403
So what does it mean?

696
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,302
It means...

697
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:09,203
it means something entirely
different, Melinda.

698
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:11,003
What?

699
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,103
What does it mean?

700
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:17,102
It means "death of a loved one."

701
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:30,000
Honey, you coming or not?

702
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,103
