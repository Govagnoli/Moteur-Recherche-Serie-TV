00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,908
<i>My name
is Melinda Gordon.</i>

3
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,793
<i>I'm married,
I live in a small town,</i>

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,455
<i>and I own
an antique shop.</i>

5
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,447
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,868
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

7
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:28,034
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,941
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

9
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:33,252
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

10
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:41,330
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

11
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,349
Are you serious?
Tonight?

12
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:49,039
Yes, I've been dying
to see it.

13
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,942
Are you kidding me,
I would love to.

14
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,715
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll call you if the chest comes in.

15
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,109
Yeah. We haven't
been to a movie in like 6 years.

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,464
Oh, all right, maybe it's been
more like a month.

17
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:03,749
No, it's a great idea.
It is.

18
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,600
I'll close up early.

19
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,843
You know, I'm sorry to cut you short,
but I have a little bit of a situation here.

20
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:10,048
Yeah, I'll see you
at the house. Bye.

21
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,750
Hey, do you really think
that I can't see what you're doing?

22
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:16,456
First, no skates
in the store.

23
00:01:16,497 --> 00:01:18,680
They're heelys
not skates.

24
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:22,964
All right, no wheels on your
feet allowed and, no shoplifting.

25
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,109
I was gonna pay for it.

26
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:25,450
You just didn't give me
the chance.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,482
They're $275 a piece.

28
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,126
And the register is that way,
not out on the street.

29
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,060
Whatever.

30
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:33,382
- What's your phone number?
- Why?

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,456
I'm calling your parents.

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,556
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

33
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,510
Look, my mother's sick.

34
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,077
Real sick. And this
would really upset her.

35
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,380
Do you really think
that I'm that out of it?

36
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,984
Do you think that i am so un
hip that i would fall for that?

37
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:49,888
Yeah.

38
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,729
- What's your name?
- Ned.

39
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,204
Ned, give me
your phone number,

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,943
or I will take you and your
heelys down to the police station.

41
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,793
I am so sorry.

42
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:01,765
He has never done
anything like this before.

43
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:02,537
No, it's fine.

44
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:04,037
I just thought that you
would want to know.

45
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:04,960
I was gonna
pay for them.

46
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:09,442
Ned. It's not like he doesn't have
a ton of this stuff anyway.

47
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,007
He's got
signed guitar picks,

48
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,591
keith moon's drumsticks,
old ticket stubs.

49
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,696
None of it stolen,
by the way.

50
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:21,039
He will never come back in here
again, I can promise you that.

51
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,796
I'm gonna go
wait outside.

52
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,677
You don't have to
do that. He's welcome.

53
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,260
Just with shoes
minus wheels.

54
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,446
- You have kids?
- No.

55
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,881
- No, not yet.
- Well, they're great.

56
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,406
Until they become
teenagers.

57
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,019
And then you realize
you're just being

58
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,751
paid back double for all the rotten
things you did as a teenager.

59
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,204
He seems like a good kid.

60
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,276
He is. He is.

61
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,899
It's just been a little
tough lately, you know?

62
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:51,192
He's been so moody. He doesn't talk,
he hardly sleeps.

63
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:54,618
'S just like his whole life
is this big secret all of a sudden.

64
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,556
Anyway, you have
to get back to work, so do I.

65
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,343
I'm Delia Banks
by the way.

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,245
Oh, Melinda Gordon.
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:04,266
You look familiar.

68
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,690
I run the real estate office
on the other side of the square.

69
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,482
Oh, well, I'll see you
at village java.

70
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,075
Every chance I get.

71
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:13,748
Thank you.
And, uh...

72
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,993
I guess I'll see you
around campus.

73
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:09,347
you know, this was fun.
We should do this like once a week.

74
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,114
Yeah, just not
the same movie.

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,884
- I liked it.
- Hey, so did I.

76
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,140
I saw you sleeping.

77
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:17,449
I was burning
certain scenes into my memory.

78
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:18,573
Yeah, well, you're tired.

79
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:20,147
You worked your ass off
this weekend.

80
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,360
Hey, I had
a shoplifter today.

81
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,183
Shoplifting  is something I just don't
associate with antiques, you know?

82
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,416
I think I'm just
gonna take this

83
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,720
chippendale dresser
and stuff it into my jacket.

84
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,005
Yeah, right. It was grateful dead
backstage passes.

85
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,955
At least he had
good taste.

86
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,718
Yeah, he was a kid.
I called his mother.

87
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,899
Ooh, something no thief
worth his salt wants to have happen.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,492
Delia Banks. She's great.

89
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,354
She sells real estate
in town.

90
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:46,424
Um... yes?

91
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,780
I just thought
maybe I...

92
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:51,272
hit something
on my way here.

93
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,645
- An animal?
- No. More like someone

94
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,978
who used to be alive
and now isn'T.

95
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,591
Is that what we're
calling ghosts now?

96
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,885
Yeah, I got bored
of calling them ghosts.

97
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,136
Wait a minute,
you tell me about the shoplifter,

98
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,361
but you don't tell me
about the ex living person?

99
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,034
Well, there won't be
a lawsuit.

100
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:09,909
Sometimes I think a lawsuit would
be easier. What happened?

101
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,783
Do you really want me to tell you
about every single ghost I run across?

102
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,626
Or run over.
Absolutely not.

103
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,412
I prefer to be on
a need to know basis.

104
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,844
Good. Then you drive.

105
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,137
- Hey.
- I'm not a thief.

106
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,000
Glad to hear it.

107
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,475
Shouldn't you be in school?

108
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:50,296
What, are you gonna
call my mom again?

109
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,190
Can I ask you a question?

110
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,802
If you're not a thief,
then why did you steal

111
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,248
- ... those backstage passes?
- I don't know.

112
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,489
I just felt like
I should have them.

113
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:00,542
Not you.

114
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,674
Your mom says you have
a lot of that stuff. You collect it?

115
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,543
- What about your dad?
- What about him?

116
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,596
- Where is he?
- In the ground.

117
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:16,866
Oh, well, that,
that must be hard for you.

118
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:18,660
For your mom.

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,225
He liked old things.

120
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:25,098
- Look, if you want-
- I gotta go.

121
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:30,356
Want to check
my pockets?

122
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,141
Jim?

123
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,643
Jim?

124
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,652
What is it? What?
Come on.

125
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,292
Ok. It's need to know time.

126
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,551
29th doesn't mean anything?

127
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,604
No.  Other than the fact
that it's next friday.

128
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,153
A birthday.
A day somebody died.

129
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,547
Well,  it could be
any of those things.

130
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,817
But until this guy
talks to me, we can only guess.

131
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,602
What?

132
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,518
I don't know, it's just...
another...

133
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,943
another formally
alive person. In our house.

134
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,988
Why can't our home
be off limits?

135
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,755
I don't like it any more
than you do, trust me,

136
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,484
but maybe this guy
doesn't know where he is.

137
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,553
Or what's going on.

138
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,809
It's like he doesn't
actually want me to see him.

139
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,030
Like some kind of
hide and seek game he's playing.

140
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,330
Sometimes spirits
have a kind of amnesia,

141
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,561
and they need time
to figure things out.

142
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,750
Maybe he's hoping that this date
will spark something.

143
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,611
Well, it certainly
sparked something.

144
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,435
Is this because
I was in the shower?

145
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:07,618
- You're afraid that-
- No. It's just about boundaries.

146
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,155
They don't belong
in our home.

147
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,816
I'm sorry that I have to
burden you with this.

148
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,716
Hey, it's no burden.

149
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,626
I'm just used to
having andrea

150
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,513
to puzzle these things
out with.

151
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,295
Oh, babe...
I know. I know.

152
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:40,229
- Who are you?
- I'm not sure.

153
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,633
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

154
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,861
Do you know why
you came to me?

155
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:50,287
- You can help me.
- How?

156
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,975
How did you die?
Were you hit by a car?

157
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,454
I think so.

158
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,483
I don't remember
everything exactly.

159
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:07,565
What does
september 29th mean?

160
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,176
- Don't you know?
- No.

161
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,138
Then I don't either.

162
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:16,010
Do you have a family?

163
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,580
Does someone know
what happened to you?

164
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,899
I had a wife.
In eastwick.

165
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:25,268
- Maine?
- She may not know. Will you tell her?

166
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,651
Well, I'm sure you had
I.D. On you.

167
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,351
The police have probably
called her by now.

168
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:33,031
I was no good to her. I hurt her.
I have to say I'm sorry.

169
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,207
- Do you remember her name?
- Donna. Donna ellis.

170
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,713
And what's your name?

171
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,223
I think people
callede mac.

172
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, mac, eastwick is not
exactly around the corner,

173
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,745
- so I don't know that I-
- You have to find her.

174
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:48,195
- See her.
- Why?

175
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:50,608
It's important.

176
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:53,131
- Are you open?
- I'll be right with you.

177
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,737
I took a guess.
Mocha latte.

178
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:09,760
Oh, works for me.
That's so nice.

179
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:11,738
Consider it
a peace offering.

180
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,747
I think my son paid you
another visit the other day.

181
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,752
Oh... man, he's good.

182
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,564
We were talking
the whole time.

183
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,352
Yes. It makes a mother proud.

184
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,693
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of it.

185
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:28,992
No, no. I am so grateful
that you're not upset.

186
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,996
Honestly, I don't know
what his problem is.

187
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:37,092
He mentioned that his father
had passed away.

188
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:41,878
3 years ago. It has been really
hard on him.

189
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:43,677
For you, too.

190
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,719
The shoplifting
helps a lot.

191
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:52,430
- Good to know.
- I don't mean to pry but...

192
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:57,566
you lost your partner
recently, didn't you?

193
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,357
Yeah. She was like
a sister to me.

194
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,311
Well, I am right
across the square,

195
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,211
so if you ever need anything...

196
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:13,870
or you just want to grab
a cup of coffee.

197
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:16,087
Thanks for
bringing this back.

198
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,037
I tried to make ned do it,
but, you know.

199
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,500
I know.

200
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:27,335
Does he ever say that he can feel
his father's presence?

201
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:29,964
Presence?

202
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,730
Like he's around,
you know.

203
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,852
- Watching over him.
- He doesn't say it, but

204
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,242
I think he does.
Sometimes I do, too.

205
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:44,650
Or at least I wish for it so badly,
that I think I do.

206
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,207
I just wanted to thank you.

207
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,427
I know it sounds crazy,
but he asked me to go to maine.

208
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,604
Maine? As in new england?

209
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,234
Yeah, and you know
what's crazier?

210
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,470
I think I should do it.

211
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,214
You know, this is
one of the reasons why

212
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:06,932
mr. Alexander graham bell
was so excited

213
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,581
about his new invention
because you can just

214
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,788
pick one of these things up
and call people instead of-

215
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,979
you know what, it is hard enough
to do this in person.

216
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,428
Never mind on the phone.

217
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,808
How are you gonna find her?

218
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,531
Well, he gave me a name,
the town,

219
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,489
and there's that other
little invention, the internet.

220
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,581
I just think it's a long
way to go for a ghost,

221
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,554
a being who no longer
occupies the visual world.

222
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,305
Well, that's true,
but to be honest with you,

223
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:28,013
I kind of want to get
this guy crossed over.

224
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:29,401
There's something
off about him.

225
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:31,197
- Besides being dead?
- You are hilarious.

226
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:32,684
It's like he's holding
something back,

227
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,092
and you know what,
either I do this thing,

228
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,196
or I don't do this thing,
but I can't just say local calls only.

229
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:41,333
Well, I think there should be some
metaphysical frequent flyer miles involved.

230
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:44,311
****
It's pretty nice there this time of year.

231
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,936
Maybe yoshould
come with me. Change of scenery.

232
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:50,189
I'm back on sundays
starting tomorrow.

233
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:55,281
You should go.
You're right.

234
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,062
It'll do you good.

235
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,978
I'll call you
a million times.

236
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:15,123
Yes?

237
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,988
Oh,  um, sorry.

238
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,541
- Are you donna ellis?
- Yes.

239
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:23,761
I was hoping I could
talk to you for a minute.

240
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:25,998
Uh, sure. About what?

241
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:30,931
About your husband,
and please, accept my condolences.

242
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:33,380
Condolences?

243
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,851
I- I'm sorry.
What is this about?

244
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,453
Well, I assumed you knew.

245
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,884
- Knew what?
- Your husband.

246
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,654
That your husband
passed away.

247
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,767
What? What are
you talking about?

248
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:54,231
- You didn't know?
- How? When?

249
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:56,868
Um, he was hit by a car.

250
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:59,028
I'm so sorry.
I thought that-

251
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,179
where is he?
Where is he!?

252
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,710
Michael? Michael.
You're ok.

253
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:09,263
I'm fine.

254
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,177
Wait. That's your husband?

255
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,188
Yes. This woman came here
and just said that you,

256
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,269
she said that you
were dead.

257
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,376
That you had been hit
by a car.

258
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,545
No, I'm sorry.

259
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,746
Why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

260
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,354
It was a mistake.

261
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,362
I guess. I...
I don't know what to say.

262
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:36,526
I Just don't get it, I had the right name,
and I had the right address.

263
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,264
<i>Well, maybe he's confused.</i>

264
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,530
You said sometimes they don't know
what's happened.

265
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,544
No, I think this guy
knows exactly what's happening.

266
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:43,840
I think I'm just
being played.

267
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,328
Oh, conned by a ghost, huh?

268
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:48,198
That's not gonna look
very good on a resume.

269
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,449
Sure. Laugh at my misery,
but you should've been here.

270
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,607
It was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.

271
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:55,199
Why is this guy
manipulating me like this?

272
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:56,611
Look, just come home.

273
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:59,088
Come  home. I'll be off
by breakfast time.

274
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,676
No. It's getting late.

275
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,416
I'm too stressed
to drive.

276
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:09,003
I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to get
a room and start fresh in the morning.

277
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:13,497
Ok. Just call me before
you go to sleep.

278
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,915
Ok.

279
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,499
Excuse me.

280
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,026
Please leave me alone.

281
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:51,964
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about that.

282
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,472
It was
an honest mistake.

283
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,009
Ok, look, I don't know
who you are,

284
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:58,079
or what your problem is, but if you don't
leave me alone, I'm calling the police.

285
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:58,712
Understood?

286
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,596
Do you know a man
named mac?

287
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,296
- Do you mean my ex husband?
- Ex?

288
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,971
I thought
it was your husband.

289
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,730
Has something
happened to him?

290
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,420
Yes, I'm sorry.
He died.

291
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,171
He was hit by a car.
I came a long way to tell you that.

292
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,421
Why?

293
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,507
Because he wants you
to know.

294
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:26,506
He feels really bad about the way that
he treated you, and he wants to apologize.

295
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,064
You're speaking
in the present tense.

296
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,455
- Yes.
- But he's dead.

297
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:33,882
- Yes.
- Who the hell are you?

298
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:35,879
He wants to say
he's sorry.

299
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:39,157
It's what he needs to have closure
so that he can move on.

300
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:41,483
I can help you
talk to him if you'll just let me.

301
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,297
I need you
to stay away from me.

302
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,396
Even if I believed
any of this,

303
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:51,272
mac put me through hell
in our marriage,

304
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,978
and I have nothing
to say to him.

305
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:56,191
And I don't care what he
has to say to me.

306
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,824
Nobody's seen her
for 3 or 4 days.

307
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,494
She don't answer door,
she don't answer phone.

308
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,340
Nobody else is asking
around for her,

309
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:22,367
so I use key
just to check up.

310
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,437
She's gone.
1, 2 days probably.

311
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,729
Heart attack?

312
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:44,962
I think so.

313
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:47,858
You want to go downstairs and call this
in. I'll get going on the paperwork.

314
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,519
Yeah, ok.

315
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,590
Ve a nice trip.

316
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:20,278
She's mine.

317
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:22,889
Leave her.

318
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:32,409
Oh, come on.
Talk to me.

319
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:34,148
You think this is funny?

320
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:37,035
Making me tell that poor woman
that her husband is dead?

321
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:38,838
Let me in on the joke, pal.

322
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,212
This doesn't mean that i
believe any of this.

323
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:49,691
But just, by chance, if it's true, I
thought I should hear what you had to say.

324
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,561
I'm glad you came.
Come in.

325
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,171
Where the hell
have you been?

326
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:59,688
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

327
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:04,418
So how does this work?

328
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,175
Tell her
she looks good.

329
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,227
He says
you look good.

330
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,965
So he's here, like now?

331
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:14,850
All right, if he's here,
then...

332
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,228
why don't you ask him to tell you
what happened to our marriage.

333
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,875
Um, he said that you
were married 3 years ago.

334
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:26,338
That you moved
to this town together,

335
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,822
in the same house
that you live in now,

336
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,399
and then you
divorced him a year later.

337
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,714
Ask him why.

338
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,795
I don't remember.

339
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,210
He says he doesn't
remember.

340
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:37,096
Well, I remember. He was obsessed
with another woman.

341
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,726
- He cheated on you?
- No, not like that.

342
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:42,078
That would've almost
been easier.

343
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:45,858
Instead I had to compete
with the memory of his ex girlfriend.

344
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:48,463
He didn't realize
how hung up on her he was.

345
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:50,953
It was like he just
couldn't get her out of his mind.

346
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,813
He was constantly comparing me to her
and talking about her.

347
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:56,116
I tried to
make it work.

348
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:58,143
He said that he tried
to make it work.

349
00:23:58,154 --> 00:23:59,909
Oh, bull, you just went
through the motions, mac.

350
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:01,919
And sometimes not even that.

351
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:04,615
I don't even understand why
you wasted your time with me.

352
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,340
Do you know how he ended it?

353
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:10,779
I told him that, you know, maybe we
should take some time apart,

354
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:14,403
so that he could figure out
what, or who he really wanted.

355
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:19,719
And he just said, ok.
Let's get a divorce.

356
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:23,279
Just like that,
like it was nothing.

357
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,885
He should've just gone out
and found that girl

358
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:29,267
and just figured it out,
but instead, you used me,

359
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,525
and you made me feel like
I didn't count for anything.

360
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,455
I did find the girl.

361
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:34,822
What?

362
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,068
I did find the girl
I was in love with.

363
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:41,044
Who  I'm still in love with.

364
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,225
I should've never
let you go.

365
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:55,793
Kyle?
Kyle mccall?

366
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:04,333
Just call him kyle?
No one's called him that since college.

367
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,687
We all called him mac.

368
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:11,300
Tell her you know me. Tell her you're
the one I never got over after we broke up.

369
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,346
Why? What's he saying?

370
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,058
that he's sorry
for the way that he treated you,

371
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:21,561
and he hopes
that you can forgive him.

372
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,976
Right?
You can do that?

373
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:25,533
She's not really
the forgiving type.

374
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:26,769
I can't believe you.

375
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,237
Ok, this is just
too weird.

376
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,122
I gotta get out of here.

377
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:32,792
And if this is real,
which I highly doubt,

378
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:35,030
tell him that
I don't forgive him.

379
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:38,049
He was an idiot then,
and he's probably still an idiot now.

380
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,174
- You played me.
- You're mad.

381
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,851
I could never stand
to make you mad.

382
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:46,299
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

383
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:48,394
Why did you send me
to your ex wife?

384
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:51,192
Don't you know?
Can't you see it?

385
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,065
- See what?
- You just don't understand.

386
00:25:55,707 --> 00:26:00,160
No...
damn it.

387
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:01,799
Kyle mccall.

388
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,789
You told me about this guy.

389
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,515
You went out with him
in college.

390
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,411
- You said he hurt you.
- Yeah. That was an understatement.

391
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,747
Kyle was the first guy that I
thought I was really in love with.

392
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,722
Believe me, I did not
trust easily.

393
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:19,193
We were together
for a whole year in college.

394
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,824
He was complicated.

395
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:23,812
One of those tortured souls
you think you can save.

396
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:27,725
I thought if I opened myself up to him,
that if I took a risk and told him my secret,

397
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,382
it would show him how much
I believed in him.

398
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:31,750
In us.

399
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:35,300
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

400
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:36,601
You really believe
you can do this?

401
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,923
Kyle, I do it
all the time.

402
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:39,459
- See dead people.
- Yes.

403
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,046
- Talk to dead people.
- Don't say it like I'm crazy.

404
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:44,671
You're thinking it,
aren't you?

405
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:46,309
- What?
- That I'm crazy.

406
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,174
I didn't say that.

407
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,717
Well, I can see that
you're thinking it.

408
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:49,953
Well, what am I
supposed to think?

409
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:51,267
That I wouldn't
lie to you.

410
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,205
And that I'm not crazy.
Stuff like that.

411
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:55,982
Do you...
talk to ghosts a lot?

412
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:59,212
- More than I want to.
- Like every day, once a week?

413
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,587
Third tuesday of the month?

414
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:03,219
I try not to speak to them
unless they speak to me.

415
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:06,120
- And what do they talk about?
- All kinds of things.

416
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,864
Mostly they need help.

417
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:10,730
I have to help them
cross over into the light.

418
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,307
Yeah.

419
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:15,502
I knew it was too good
to be true.

420
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,711
- What?
- You.

421
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:21,991
Us... I thought I
met the perfect girl.

422
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:23,477
Kyle, wait, I know that you
don't believe me,

423
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:26,362
but please don't walk away.
Just talk to me.

424
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,553
Yeah. Maybe when I'm dead.

425
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:35,847
That was it.

426
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:40,712
Never called me, never came to
see me again after a year.

427
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,062
- Still hurts?
- I guess.

428
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:45,821
A little.
First cut and all that.

429
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,983
And now he wants
a second chance.

430
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:52,296
I guess that explains the talking corpse
I had to deal with last night.

431
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:56,008
I'm sorry, jim. I wish that you never
had to deal with any of this.

432
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,896
Keeps things fresh.

433
00:27:57,934 --> 00:27:59,802
You were my second chance.

434
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:01,627
I mean, you know that,
right?

435
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,855
I never thought that i was going to be
able to trust anyone again after kyle.

436
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,584
And then there was jim.

437
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,739
You're not gonna break into
song right now, are you?

438
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:10,708
I might.

439
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,091
Now what are we gonna do
about this guy though?

440
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:19,595
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my sense of humor.

441
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,099
I'll get him to cross over
and out of our lives, I promise.

442
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,214
All right, can you tell me
what the hell it is with these passes?

443
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:40,499
Dude, these are mine
from my collection.

444
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:44,269
Dude, I bought those
at a trade show in philadelphia.

445
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,259
I know. My mom,

446
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,403
she sold my whole collection
after I died,

447
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:52,525
and it got spread out all over the
place and this is the last of it.

448
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:54,899
You've been tracking
the whole collection?

449
00:28:54,953 --> 00:28:57,757
Each and every single
piece meant so much to me.

450
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,338
My mother,
she never got that.

451
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:00,847
So she sold them
to some guy,

452
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:04,413
and he sold it to another guy,
and... my collection.

453
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,488
- What's your name?
- Jamey barton.

454
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,846
- You heard of me?
- No.

455
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:10,723
why are you still here?

456
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:13,192
I gotta make sure this stuff gets
to the right people.

457
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:14,551
People who care,
people who know

458
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:15,796
what it means, you know?

459
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,121
Hmm. So that's why you
attached yourself to ned.

460
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,730
And here I thought the whole time that
it was his father who was haunting him.

461
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,093
Maybe I'm losing
my touch lately.

462
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,043
You see, I hang out
at concerts,

463
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:28,040
and I try to get, you know,
a feel for the kids.

464
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:30,870
And then I try to get
the right kid a piece of the collection.

465
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:34,634
Well, you'll be happy to know ned has been
a real trouper about getting these passes.

466
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,240
That's my boy.

467
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:38,165
You're making him
a thief.

468
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,680
It's not like I can just
slip him the cash, can I?

469
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,363
How did you get him
to do it?

470
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:47,217
Well, I wait till he falls asleep, and then I
whisper in his ear all freaking night long.

471
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:48,638
"Steal the passes,
dude.

472
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,815
Steal the passes, dude. "
It's how I used to rember lyrics.

473
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,636
Well, he's not gonna
steal the passes from me,

474
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,075
and you have to
leave him alone.

475
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:57,499
You're messing with his energy.
He doesn't even know why.

476
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,270
It's time for you to go
to the big arena in the sky.

477
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,929
No can do.

478
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,866
I mean, he's the one
for these passes.

479
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,296
He understands.

480
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:08,903
I can't go anywhere until the last
of my collection is in the right hands,

481
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,026
so whoa, 3 o'clock already.

482
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,858
Note to self.

483
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,894
I gotta keep better
track of time.

484
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:19,792
He's getting out of school
right now, and so, I gotta skate.

485
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:11,065
Come on, kyle.

486
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,114
We have to talk about this. I can't help
you if I don't know what you want.

487
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:18,243
You could've told me
how great it is to be dead.

488
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,490
Go anywhere I want.
No travel time.

489
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,922
No one can see me.
Well, almost no one.

490
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:28,527
I've had more fun being dead so far
than the entire time I was alive.

491
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:29,823
What do you want?

492
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,818
I was on my way
to see you, you know.

493
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,218
- The day I died.
- Why?

494
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,113
I saw you on the news.

495
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:43,508
<i>All I can say is that
people in this town are strong.</i>

496
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:46,532
<i>They're survivors,
and we'll be ok.</i>

497
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,056
What's with you
and this chick?

498
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,736
Melinda? It's like
you're obsessed with her.

499
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,273
I wanted to see how
things turned out for you.

500
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:58,944
Things turned out
pretty good for me.

501
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:00,805
I see that.

502
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,607
Not so much
for me though.

503
00:32:06,642 --> 00:32:08,914
And how is that
my problem, kyle?

504
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,636
Look, I made a big mistake
the day I let you go.

505
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,577
I didn't realize that
right away.

506
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,434
- Yeah, you moved on.
- But I didn'T.

507
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,970
- You married donna.
- Yeah, another mistake.

508
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,171
Donna looked like you,
I thought maybe somehow

509
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:21,559
I could turn her
into you.

510
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,075
It was a disaster.

511
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,071
That's why I wanted you
to meet her.

512
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:29,010
So you could see that I was
just trying to recreate you.

513
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:34,297
You affected
every part of my life.

514
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:37,645
You made me feel like a freak,
and that I didn't deserve to be loved.

515
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:39,180
I gave you everything.

516
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,735
Even the one secret
that I never wanted

517
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:43,887
anyone to know,
and you threw me away.

518
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:45,865
It was so easy for you.

519
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:48,593
You want to talk about
a ripple effect?

520
00:32:48,837 --> 00:32:50,363
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,474
I really am. I was stupid.

522
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:54,837
I had no idea
what I was throwing away.

523
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,426
But don't tell me you didn't
think about me once in awhile.

524
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,265
Remember how we used to
make fun of the space needle?

525
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,094
Remember that movie theatre
in queen anne?

526
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,963
- The uptown.
- The uptown, right.

527
00:33:14,011 --> 00:33:16,915
How many rainy afternoons
did we spend there?

528
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,579
Watching the worst
movies ever.

529
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:24,504
You used to hate that.
*****

530
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,865
You convinced me to stop
wearing socks.

531
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:32,264
You though my feet looked
sexy in sneakers without socks.

532
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:40,814
You remember
that book store?

533
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,134
In pioneer square.

534
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,081
None of that matters now.

535
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:53,539
But it does.
It should.

536
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,438
I remember the first day
I talked to you in class.

537
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:01,240
The way you looked at me.
Those eyes.

538
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:04,267
I remember thinking
to myself,

539
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:07,727
now I know what it's like
to really be looked at.

540
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,630
No one's ever looked at me
like that since.

541
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:14,951
It's over.
You made your choice.

542
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:17,129
There's no going back,
and I'm happy now.

543
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:20,859
I found a man that I love
more than I ever thought was possible.

544
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:22,201
But it's not over.

545
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,314
We can be together now.

546
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,309
Like it was
supposed to be.

547
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,236
Are you listening
to me, kyle?

548
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,334
I'm happily married.
And you're dead.

549
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:36,224
September 29th is the day
we broke up.

550
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:40,626
And september 29th is gonna be
the day we get back together.

551
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,552
Are you gonna belate tonight?

552
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:55,070
Uh, I don't know. Friday nights
can be a little heavy.

553
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,990
Well, tonight would be
a good night to be late.

554
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,856
Why?

555
00:34:58,086 --> 00:34:59,462
Because it's september 29th,

556
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,736
and he's got something planned,
I just don't know what.

557
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:05,728
Well...
I should be here.

558
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:08,413
- This guy feels like trouble.
- It's my deal, ok?

559
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,092
I have to solve it, and besides,
he's really not that bad of a guy.

560
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,264
He would never hurt me.

561
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:14,318
Mel, you and this guy,
is there...

562
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:17,692
I can't believe
I'm asking this about a ghost.

563
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:20,261
Is there still
something between you?

564
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,570
- What?
- I heard you last night.

565
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:23,701
Jim, he's dead.

566
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,254
There was a time
in my life when that

567
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:26,808
meant case closed,
but then I met you.

568
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,285
One or two laughs
with kyle mccall

569
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,083
dead or alive will never compare
to what we have.

570
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,604
There was more depth
on our first date

571
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,971
than I ever had with kyle,
the problem is he doesn't get that.

572
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:39,610
All right. Be careful.

573
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,842
- Call me if you need me.
- Yeah.

574
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,574
Ned, it's no big deal.

575
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,676
You've just got to go in there
and take those passes.

576
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,807
Technically, it's not
even really stealing

577
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,996
because those passes
are mine,

578
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:12,997
in the big picture,
we're like one, you know, so...

579
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:20,021
- that was harsh.
- They're yours.

580
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:23,829
- Righteous.
- Why?

581
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:25,941
Sometimes my job
is about making sure

582
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,563
that the right people
end up with the right things.

583
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,664
Something tells me
that whoever owned them

584
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,046
would want you
to have them.

585
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:33,795
Seriously?

586
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:35,126
They're not for free.

587
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,907
I need some help
at the store on saturdays,

588
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:42,659
- For let's say, a month.
- I don't know.

589
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:45,211
Is that like
minimum wage, or...

590
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:51,772
- all right. Don't push it.
- Ok. So... thanks.

591
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,916
Slickly done, I must say.
Slickly done.

592
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:02,396
Oh, thank you.
Whoa.

593
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:06,890
That is one bright light.

594
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:11,633
Yeah. The ultimate,
all access pass.

595
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:18,396
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

596
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,615
<i>Check, check,
check one, check two.</i>

597
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:25,062
Stop it!

598
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,043
Leave my husband's
stuff alone!

599
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:54,465
******

600
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:00,096
Kyle, you have to stop
doing this.

601
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:03,380
You cannot just erase jim by getting
rid of everything that he owns.

602
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:04,749
Obviously, one of us
has to go,

603
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:07,559
and it's not gonna be me.
Not this time.

604
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:11,091
- Jim is not going anywhere.
- I love you, Melinda.

605
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,972
You have no idea
what love is.

606
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,996
I'm here, and he isn't,
so that's a good start.

607
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:18,477
He's not here
because he loves me.

608
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:21,515
I asked him to give me some space,
and he gave it to me.

609
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:24,119
- How is that love?
- That's just part of it.

610
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,639
And it's not the greeting cards
and sunset and flowers part.

611
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:29,242
That's easy.
That's not real.

612
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,551
It's about doing the things that you
don't want to do.

613
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,384
The stuff that
makes you mad.

614
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,693
The stuff that you do
without even being asked.

615
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,555
It's about having a friend
and knowing when to shut up.

616
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,923
You know, I can't tell you
what love is.

617
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,594
I can only tell you
what it isn't, and this is not it.

618
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,145
No, but you're wrong, Melinda.

619
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:46,299
I will never forget
the look in your eyes

620
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,139
when you walked away
from me.

621
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:50,179
- What look?
- Relief.

622
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:51,729
You were relieved.

623
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:54,039
To not have to risk
being in an honest relationship.

624
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,460
To not have to give
anything up.

625
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,372
To be able to blame
somebody else so you could be safe.

626
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,522
That's a lie.

627
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,173
Your ex wife told me that you did
exactly the same thing to her.

628
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,996
The first time that she called you on
the way you treated her, you left.

629
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,366
Just like me.
You call that love?

630
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,249
Yeah, but I missed you
every day.

631
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:10,148
I knew I had made a mistake.

632
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:12,760
That's because you had
already thrown me away.

633
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:14,538
I could be imaginary.

634
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:19,081
Was I that forgettable?

635
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,395
I hated myself for it.

636
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:29,308
I wanted to call you
a hundred times.

637
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:31,056
It would've been too late.

638
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:35,007
You did what you did, I saw what I saw.
There was never any going back.

639
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,889
Now I'm starting to hate
being dead.

640
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:43,312
Why?

641
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:47,533
Because the answer
to everything is too late.

642
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:49,086
Too late to fix
the mistakes.

643
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:53,267
Too late to catch up
with the things you missed.

644
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:57,498
Too late to make things
right with the people you hurt.

645
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,400
Too late...

646
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,450
to love you the way
he does.

647
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:13,365
The beauty part
of my job is, kyle, it's never too late.

648
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:17,758
You wasted a trip.

649
00:41:17,994 --> 00:41:19,996
I have nothing to gain
by talking to him.

650
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,020
Look, maybe you don't
have anything to gain.

651
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,861
Maybe you just have
something to lose.

652
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:29,111
A little piece of anger
or bitterness, or disappointment.

653
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,883
He hurt me so much.

654
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,446
You know what,
he hurt me, too.

655
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,436
But you know
what happened, I got stronger.

656
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:40,797
I met the perfect
man for me.

657
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,717
Found a beautiful place to live,
and you, you're married again.

658
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,728
I saw how much
you loved your husband

659
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,688
when you thought
that he was dead,

660
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,612
and would you really
be this happy

661
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,600
if you were still
with kyle?

662
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:57,031
Would I?
Transformation.

663
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:01,674
Sometimes turns out to be
better than you could've imagined.

664
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,727
He just wants the chance
to say that he's sorry.

665
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:09,418
He's right behind you,
and he's ready to do that.

666
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:11,369
I screwed up, donna.

667
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,100
I was scared. I took
the easy way out.

668
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,302
I'm so sorry.

669
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:19,304
He knows
that he screwed up.

670
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:21,013
You son of a bitch, kyle.

671
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,904
Didn't you know...
how much I loved you?

672
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,118
What I would've
done for you?

673
00:42:31,754 --> 00:42:37,351
How could you...
how could you just throw that away?

674
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:40,442
I'm glad you're happy now.

675
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,063
You're better off
without me.

676
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:45,075
He's glad that
you're happy now.

677
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,675
You're better off.

678
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,096
Yeah, well...

679
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:53,047
I guess I'll never
really know.

680
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:59,401
- I know.
- He knows.

681
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:02,511
Can I go now?

682
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:13,897
Time to cross over.

683
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,389
You ever think I'll get
a second chance?

684
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,978
Come back here again
and do this right?

685
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:26,492
It's really nice
to think so.

686
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,871
You were never forgettable.
