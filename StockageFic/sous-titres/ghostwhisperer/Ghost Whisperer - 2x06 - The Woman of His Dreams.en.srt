00:00:01,255 --> 00:00:03,378
<i>My name
is Melinda Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:06,259
<i>I'm married,
I live in a small town,</i>

3
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:08,916
<i>and I own
an antique shop.</i>

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,005
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

5
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:15,523
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

6
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,681
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

7
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:22,583
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

8
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,891
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:32,960
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

10
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,091
- Is this the house?
- This is it.

11
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,914
- Great.
- Let me get that for you.

12
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,236
Thank you so much.

13
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:10,893
- Josie.
- Jeb.

14
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:12,970
*****

15
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,573
Cheer up.
It'll be over before you know it.

16
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,530
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you. Come on in.

17
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,170
I already startedsetting
up for you.

18
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,593
Fantastic. Thank you.

19
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:24,351
You are free to go
downstairs and build something now.

20
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,720
I've never felt the urge
to hammer something so much in my life.

21
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,381
Here. Take this.
Drink it. Relax. Go.

22
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:32,080
Take out your wallets.
The bast cosmetics repis here.

23
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,941
Hey, ladies.
How are ya?

24
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:36,081
All this fabolous
products here!

25
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,460
*****
melinda, can iborrow your husband?

26
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,933
*****
it'll just take a minute.

27
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,332
- Jim, right?
- Yeah. But, um...

28
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:44,662
just come sit down.

29
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:48,350
Now, jim here-
have a seat-

30
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:51,372
has combination skinas
anyone can see.

31
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:52,821
I have a very effective

32
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:54,543
line of oil-freemoisturizers for men

33
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:57,233
that will balance out
jim's ph brilliantly.

34
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,652
If I can just find it...

35
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:00,492
Ah, here it is.

36
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:03,651
Now, as you can see,
it doesn't take much.

37
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:07,361
I'm basically padding
the product on jim's t-zone-

38
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,711
here and here.

39
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:13,563
There.

40
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,281
I know.
Isn't it a great look?

41
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:19,162
Well, it was a pretty
good look before you put it on, too.

42
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:21,783
Well, that was fun.
Thank you.

43
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:23,132
But I should go plow
the north 40 now.

44
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,513
It's ok. Go.
You're a champ.

45
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:27,351
Josie, I know you have
reat stuff for all of us, too. Right?

46
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,502
Oh, right.
Let me show you...

47
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:30,530
I'm comfortable with my masculinity.

48
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,641
That would have put me into
therapy for a couple of years.

49
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,361
Honey, what's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

50
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,352
Really?
Here? Where?

51
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,991
Right in front of me.

52
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,590
I'm glad the party it's over.

53
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,361
How 'bout now?

54
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:24,682
Ahh, it's gone.

55
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:26,340
That was beyond creepy.

56
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah, skull where my face was
supposed to be. That's not good.

57
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:34,093
Is that some kind of
portent of doom?

58
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:37,391
No, no.
At least I don't think so.

59
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,402
All right.
What about ghosts?

60
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,060
Do you see any
right now?

61
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,581
No. Nothing.

62
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,310
Hey, what's wrong?

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,891
Let's just get out of the house
and go for a walk.

64
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:58,742
So, uh, have you heard
from your mother yet?

65
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:02,021
She said she will call me if they
can move the surgery up a day.

66
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,180
Her poor knee.

67
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:07,751
But the good news is josie did sell $350
worth of her stuff.

68
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,303
Guess what
the big seller was.

69
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,681
I don't think
I want to know.

70
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,160
Moisturizer for men.

71
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,840
Comforting to know
that if you do not

72
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:16,551
do well in the medical industry,
you could be a male model.

73
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,261
You know, you're killing me
right here.

74
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,332
You're killing me.

75
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:22,923
I think it's great that I have a
husband women find so attractive.

76
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,000
You  know, it's funny.

77
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,792
'Cause that feeling
doesn't cut both ways.

78
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,121
- Not for me.
- That's because you're ossessive.

79
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,122
Guys have the whole
caveman thing going on.

80
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:30,940
That's right!

81
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:34,803
- I want my woman for myself.
- Ooh. You got her.

82
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,132
All right.

83
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:45,521
Ahh, ohh! Hey, beautiful,
where did you come from?

84
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,972
- What do you see?
- A cat.

85
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,660
- A ghost cat?
- An exotic looking one.

86
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,841
- What happened?
- Kitty not as cute as I thought.

87
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:03,032
- Go away, kitty.
- Where is homer the dog when you need him?

88
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,391
Yeah. Where is homer?
I miss homer.

89
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,963
Not today's problem.

90
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:12,252
- Hey, do you hear that?
- No... I don'T.

91
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,841
- I don't hear anything.
- How weird is that.

92
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,692
Ok. That's
just a phone.

93
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:25,281
Mom.
Oh, well, that's great news!

94
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:28,413
Tuesday.
The sooner the better.

95
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,511
Stop it.
Ok. No, no. I'm sorry.

96
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:37,102
Yeah.
No, it's not a problem.

97
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:38,820
Ok, well,
I'll call you tomorrow.

98
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,341
- By Mrs. Gordon.
- Bye.

99
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,952
Stop it... Now, she says,
"it's just knee surgery.

100
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:48,193
There's no need to go
to so much trouble.

101
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,693
Mom?

102
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,223
Mom?!

103
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:41,113
Now what if your mother really doesn't
want anyone around her right now?

104
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:42,470
Well, that's too bad.

105
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,821
'Cause I'm not one
to ignore dreams.

106
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,092
Especially dreams
like that one.

107
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,590
Look, it was probably
a guilt trip.

108
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,450
Oh, well, thank you, Freud.

109
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:51,861
I'll call you
as soon as I get there.

110
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:57,992
Wait a minute.
Don't drive crazy.

111
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,031
I have to go.
I'll miss you.

112
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:02,032
It's my poker night any how.

113
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,372
Um, that's where you're supposed
to say I'll miss you, too, honey.

114
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,781
I always do.

116
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,543
Hey, have the game
at our house.

117
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:10,930
No, that never
really works out.

118
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,810
Why not? You guys
take turns don't you?

119
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,173
Yeah. It's been my turn
for a couple of weeks now.

120
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,773
And I keep trying to avoid it.

121
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:19,471
You know, unexpected visitors
and such.

122
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:22,633
Hey, I'm gone. The ghosts are gone.
Have the game at the house.

123
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:25,772
Huh. Right.
Call me.

124
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,110
Maybe. Bye.

125
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,783
- 3 queens.
- You've been playing queens all night.

126
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:42,843
Well, what can I say, guys?
The ladies love me tonight.

127
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,380
So, clancy,
game at your house?

128
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,240
Man that almost
never happens

129
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,343
He wants to keep us
away from melinda, doesn't trust us.

130
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:50,831
- Would you?
- Good point.

131
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,180
We played here
a few months ago.

132
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:53,730
Yeah, when his wife
was out of town.

133
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:55,182
Yeah, where is she now,
clancy?

134
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,283
-  Out of town.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,620
Jim clancy,
master electrician.

136
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,823
*****

137
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:09,303
- All around the horn.
- Uh, I'll go 2.

138
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,902
- You gotta good card, man.
- Now that's tension.

139
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,082
No, I didn't do anything.
I was holding them normal.

140
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,370
- Yeah, right.
- Do it again.

141
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,702
- Flaher, you ok?
- Flaher?

142
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:30,702
Flaher?!

143
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,571
Flaher? 1, 2, 3.

144
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:39,014
Got it? We got?

145
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,516
You in?

146
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,213
What? Am I in? What?

147
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:53,211
I almost just died
right in front of ya.

148
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,493
- Almost doesn't count.
- You're cold.

149
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:10,603
Hey, I'll tell you what.

150
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,461
It's gettin' a little
late. All right...

151
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,962
I gotta checivo.
My house next week.

152
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:19,423
Thanks
for coming, guys.

153
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,190
Who are you?

154
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,702
Yeah?

155
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,980
Hey, amarillo slim.
Did I wake you?

156
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:43,231
No. No. No.
No. Well, yeah. A little.

157
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,411
- How's your mother?
- Asleep.

158
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,090
<i>Right. Of course
she would be now.</i>

159
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,391
<i>She a little worried
about tomorrow?</i>

160
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:53,562
No, she's good.

161
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,662
We ordered in chinese
food and rented a movie.

162
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:57,791
It was nice, actually.

163
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:02,003
Ooh, can you do me a favor tomorrow
and just drop in on delia at the store?

164
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:04,280
I want to make sure
she doesn't get too overwhelmed.

165
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:09,942
- Delia, right. Ok.
- Are you... are you all right?

166
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,690
I was having
a really weird dream.

167
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:16,172
Uh. Well,
welcome to my world.

168
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,060
Mel, you know
I really love you.

169
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:24,331
- I really do.
- Jim, I love you, too.

170
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,130
Listen, just go
back to sleep.

171
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,060
Ok? Call me
in the morning.

172
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,340
Thanks so much
for coming in.

173
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,141
We're gonna be online
soon. So look us up.

174
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,643
Hey, jim. To what
do I owe this honor?

175
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:18,951
Oh, nothing, you know.

176
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,263
I just thought I'd drop by,
say hi before work.

177
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,570
See if everything's ok.

178
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,960
So melinda was worried
that I'd be overwhelmed?

179
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,063
Yeah. Exactly.

180
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,433
See? I'm getting
to know her like a book.

181
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,301
Hey, how's her mom?

182
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,613
Oh, her mom should be out of surgery
in a couple of minutes now.

183
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,651
What? What?
No, no. It's-

184
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,183
I'm  so sorry!
I just have this thing about bugs.

185
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:42,990
Apparently so do I.

186
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:47,032
- Friends of yours?
- Houseguests.

187
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,820
Some people have ants,
other people have termites.

188
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:53,170
- You have beetles?
- I don't know what I have.

189
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:54,760
Did you see
which way they went?

190
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,441
Somewhere where
I'll never see them again I hope.

191
00:12:57,448 --> 00:13:00,001
All right,
I gotta go.

192
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,933
I should go.
Look, you havemy cell, right?

193
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,671
And you can call me
in case anything goes wrong?

194
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:07,663
Yeah. Just as long
as the beetles don't form a gang

195
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:09,962
and come after me,
I think I'll be fine.

196
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:13,430
Ok. If they do,
call me.

197
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,823
Yeah, she sailed
through the operation.

198
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,823
I'll feel better
when I can see her.

199
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:28,421
I can't get that surgery dream
out of my head.

200
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,431
- How's your hangover?
- What hangover?

201
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,852
Oh, come on. You were on
a different planet last night.

202
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,332
I sensed the presence
of a 6-pack at least.

203
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,873
You sensed the presence of something
but it wasn't alcohol related.

204
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,661
Wait, you had a ghost
last night without me?

205
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:44,020
<i>Well, something strange
is going on.</i>

206
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:46,790
Last night there were
lights flickering, cards flying,

207
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:49,860
and there were bugs-beetles-
I saw them on the floor.

208
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,400
They were just swimming
in my shirt.

209
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:54,421
- Ooh, kinky.
- I'm serious. - Sorry.

210
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,472
- What kind of beetles?
- Shiny green things.

211
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,050
Kind of beautiful actually.

212
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:06,552
Look, mel, last night I had
this dream- this weird dream-

213
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,021
there was this girl
and she was on an operating table.

214
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,283
- Same dream as mine.
- Not exactly.

215
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:17,143
She had a cat, which reminds me, you
remember you saw this exotic ghost cat?

216
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:18,992
Why  would the cat
be in your dream?

217
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,780
You're  asking me
like I know the answer.

218
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,420
Sorry. Thinking out loud.

219
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,032
- Was there anything besides beetles?
- Scalpel.

220
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:27,490
- As in surgery?
- And sharp.

221
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:30,793
Ok, this has to be
about my mother.

222
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:34,140
I'm getting a little freaked out.
So I'm gonna go in and check on her.

223
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,451
Well, what do I do?

224
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,810
Well, we have to find out what the
connection is between the symbols.

225
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:41,120
Do you remember the guy I was
telling you about... professor payne?

226
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,800
Yeah. Yeah.
The guy at rock land U.

227
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,840
Go and see him. Ok?

228
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,360
He knows all about symbols
and the supernatural.

229
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:49,541
He'll be able to tell you
if there's a connection.

230
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:51,360
Wait. I just show up there?
I don't even know the guy.

231
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:52,970
No, it's ok.
He's a good guy.

232
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,690
He just doesn't know
about what I can do.

233
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,311
- So keep it all theoretical.
- Theoretical? - I gotta go.

234
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:59,870
- I love you, bye.
- Theoretical.

235
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:08,990
Hey, uh, sorry, man.

236
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:12,282
I'm looking for a professor,
a dr. Payne.

237
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,200
So are half the credit card
companies in the U.S.

238
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:19,170
- What can I do for you?
- You're payne?

239
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:24,491
- You are...?
- Sorry. I was expecting somebody older.

240
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:27,570
Why don't you come back
in 25 years?

241
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:30,581
Hey, I'm jim clancy.
I'm melinda gordon's husband.

242
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,751
You know, she comes by
for help sometimes.

243
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,432
You're melinda's husband.

244
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:37,613
Wow, this is really
very interesting.

245
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,841
Yeah. She's out of town.
But she sent me over-

246
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,000
- Your wife fascinates me.
- Me, too.

247
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,551
Look, some
times she says you help her.

248
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:45,841
And I'm working on this project,

249
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,582
and I was wondering
if you could give me a hand.

250
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:49,541
- What kind of project?
- Uh, I'm writing a book.

251
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,753
Everybody's doing it
these days.

252
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,810
Melinda told me
you were a paramedic.

253
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,151
Yeah. I am. Yeah.
See? It's a hobby.

254
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,213
- Saving lives is a hobby?
- No, writing.

255
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:02,032
- Oh, the writing's the hobby.
- Um, I'm a little lost right now.

256
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:04,301
I've been playing
with all this symbolism.

257
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:07,113
Cats, for instance.
And I...

258
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,872
Here you go, melinda's
husband. Take your pick.

259
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,901
- How about that one?
- Excellent. Abyssinian.

260
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:23,791
Egyptian. Very spooky
looking, huh?.

261
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,653
You know, the ancient egyptians,
they were crazy about cats, jim.

262
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,602
If you killed a cat,
you had to be killed.

263
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,942
If your cat died,
you went into mourning.

264
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,362
You had to shave off your
ebrows while in mourning.

265
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:38,473
That must-that must
have been a fantastic look.

266
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:39,741
Right.

267
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:44,921
Ok. What if in this story
I throw in some beetles,

268
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,590
what would that start
to signify?

269
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:49,031
- Well, that would depend.
- On what? - On the beetle.

270
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,401
I've always been
partial to george.

271
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,060
I'm joking. That's a joke.

272
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:57,391
Guess melinda hasn't
told you a lot about me.

273
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,043
Nope. No, no. She just said
you were a great guy.

274
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,283
Well, then you've been
sadly misinformed.

275
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:05,843
- What color are these beetles?
- Green. And they're shiny.

276
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:10,040
Green? Those are scarabs. There's a
lot of egyptian symbolismin your book.

277
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,391
Could be.

278
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:21,633
- Here you go... Dung beetles.
- That one.

279
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:23,270
Used a lot in
egyptian iconography,

280
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,121
usually symbolizing
regeneration and rebirth.

281
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:30,430
Right. So if I was-
uh, if my main character was seeing-

282
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:33,791
getting sent these symbols,
what do you think that would mean?

283
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:36,103
Could mean a lot of things.
It could mean beauty, egypt.

284
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:39,780
It could mean the goddess isis,
she's the most powerful, most popular.

285
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:42,213
But you have cats.
That's a powerful motif.

286
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:45,290
That would make me think
of the goddess bast.

287
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,790
Bast was the protector
of cats and women.

288
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:50,461
- Did you just say "bast?"
- Bast, yeah. Just now.

289
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,543
Bast cosmetics.
Do you know bast cosmetics?

290
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:57,891
Cosmetics? I'm not, um...
that's not my area of expertise.

291
00:17:57,895 --> 00:18:01,502
You know, doc, you helped me a lot.
I owe you one. Thanks.

292
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:05,240
You're leaving? Wait. Do-do you guys
do this all the time, the two of you?

293
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:07,503
- What?
- The whole I'm saying something,

294
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,562
but I'm not tell you what I mean.
I'm being wacky and evasive thing.

295
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,142
Do you both do it?

296
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,463
I don't know
what you're talking about.

297
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,571
Yea. Like that.
That's-that's good.

298
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,871
What do you want?

299
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:13,112
So the ghost is attached
to bast cosmetics?

300
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,321
Bast is all about beauty.
She was the protector of cats.

301
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:23,732
- And their logo is a beetle and a cat.
- So, this girl from your dream...

302
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,882
- what was she like?
- Scary.

303
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:31,063
- Was she beautiful?
- She wasn't exactly homely.

304
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,563
Ugh, jim, come on.
I can take it.

305
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:34,871
Spit it out.
Was she beautiful?

306
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:36,792
She's drop dead
gorgeous. She looks like a model.

307
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,833
A simple yes
would have done.

308
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,111
Hey, hey, you just said-

309
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:43,823
Look, how many times exactly have your
dream of this drop deadgorgeous model?

310
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:46,671
Mel, I want the dreams
to end just as much as you do.

311
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:50,511
Ok. Obiously your visions and dreams
have nothing to do with my mother.

312
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:53,130
So she must be connected to
bast cosmetics.

313
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,562
- Maybe she's a model.
- Was one of their models.

314
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,521
- Dead?
- Don't you think?

315
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,943
Well, then why
is she coming to me?

316
00:19:58,945 --> 00:19:59,732
I don't know.

317
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:02,001
Maybe she was attached to somebody
at the makeover party.

318
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,521
Oh, thank you.

319
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,751
Or maybe she's using you
to get to me.

320
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:09,332
All right, well,
how do we find her?

321
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:12,321
I don't know. Bast is a small company.
But they still advertise. So...

322
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,201
you'll have to go
to a newsstand, get some magazines,

323
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,671
and look for her picture.

324
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:17,821
I'll talk to you later.
Come back soon.

325
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,352
Bye.

326
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,171
There you are.

327
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:45,781
Do you have smithsonian?

328
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,973
Uh, yeah, it's over there
behind national geographic.

329
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,901
Excuse me. Sorry.
Ahh, you're...

330
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,643
- Jim.
- Jim-melinda's husband.

331
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,962
Right. And you're
dr. Payne, right?

332
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,610
Yes, I am.
How's the book coming?

333
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:00,512
Slowly.

334
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:04,312
Ok. That's one
les angelique, one fashion today,

335
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:08,622
one wardrobe plus,
one tween chique magazine.

336
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,702
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

337
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,991
- Melinda's still out of town?
- She's coming back soon.

338
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:21,652
$750?

339
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,212
I know it's a lot.
But it's totally worth it.

340
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,492
This woman will come
and do all your colors.

341
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,641
What you look best in.

342
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:30,162
What's you power color.
What's your calming color.

343
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,182
So what's your throw
away money color?

344
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:35,673
Wait-isn't that
melinda's husband?

345
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:36,671
Hmm. Nice sedway.

346
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:39,850
Hey, well, if it
isn't my guinea pig.

347
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:41,780
Hope you're using
that moisturizer.

348
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:44,631
Yeah. Yeah. All the guys in the firehouse
have noticed a big difference.

349
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,563
Jim, have you ever thought
about having your colors done?

350
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,763
- Sorry?
- Pay no attention.

351
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:52,153
Hey, guys, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

352
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,423
You probably know
more about this kind of stuff than I do.

353
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:58,860
- Do you know who she is?
- Oh, my god.

354
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:01,190
That's eva turner.

355
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,822
I- I'm sorry but that just
caught me by surprise.

356
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:07,950
- Eva-eva was a friend of mine.
- Was?

357
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:12,431
- Yeah, she died a couple of weeks ago.
- And why do you ask?

358
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,872
Uh, a friend of mine-

359
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:20,363
one of the guy sat the firehouse he's
he's really into models and especially her.

360
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:24,480
So, when I saw the bast cosmetics,
I thought maybe I could get an address.

361
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:27,532
He wanted to send
a fan letter. That kind of thing.

362
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,881
Hmm. Oh, well.
She used to live in my building.

363
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:33,863
She was the one that
got me into selling bast cosmetics.

364
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,132
- She was so nice.
- How did she die?

365
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:42,151
Ahh, that's the horrible thing. She went
in for an appendectomy, a routine.

366
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:45,631
Something went wrong
with the anesthesia, and she just died.

367
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:48,890
We're going to the memorial
tomorrow in the city.

368
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,791
- Oh, yeah. Where?
- All saints chapel.

369
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:54,720
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch.

370
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:57,231
And sorry about that.
See ya, delia.

371
00:22:57,237 --> 00:23:00,522
- Take care, jim.
- Died during surgery?

372
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:03,893
Well, that explains the hospital dreams
and the scalpel appearing.

373
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:07,460
Yeah, there's a memorial service
tomorrow in the city, at a chapel.

374
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:10,242
- And in your dreams?
- Exactly. People praying.

375
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,182
Well, she wants you
to go to that memorial.

376
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:16,270
There's something or someone there
you're suposed to see.

377
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,801
Don't you think it'll look little
strange, I mean, if I go?

378
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:21,891
Yeah, if you go alone,
so take somebody with you and blend in.

379
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:23,530
Who?

380
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,270
Dude, I'll tell you,
this is a little weird.

381
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:30,133
- I don't even know the deceased.
- I know.

382
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:32,571
Think of it as show of support.

383
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,202
That's  like something
from e! Channel.

384
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:40,373
- Are you-do you know these people?
- Not exactly.

385
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:55,350
- Lookin' for someone?
- Not really.

386
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,581
You have some parallel
life you haven't told me about?

387
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,712
I mean, are you an underwear
model by night or something?

388
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:09,010
Flaher, just go with me
on this one, ok?

389
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,592
Remember, I saved your life
the other night.

390
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:16,432
- Who-who's that?
- Who?

391
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:20,240
Other side of the aisle, purple.
Looks familiar.

392
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:25,223
That's delia. Delia banks.
She works with melinda at the store.

393
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,673
Linda's a beautiful woman.

394
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:40,601
- Funny, but I know her.
- Who?

395
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,802
That woman.

396
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:50,693
She lived in the town I grew up in.
I used to mow their lawn.

397
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:17,662
Eva. Eva, eva.

398
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,991
Eva kaminsky.

399
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:31,421
That's eva kaminsky.
I know this girl.

400
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:36,523
- Isn't that why we're here?
- Right.

401
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:44,572
It's just, I went to high school with
her and she was... really shy.

402
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:52,953
It's hard to imagine that... that girl
turned into that girl.

403
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:56,143
Please take your seats.

404
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:17,120
I am marybeth kaminsky,
eva's mother.

405
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:22,352
Thank you all so much for coming. Eva would be
very happy to know so many peoplecame for her.

406
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,691
A child shouldn't
ever die before their mother.

407
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:34,603
No one's child.
Eva was the light of our lives.

408
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:40,720
She was so beautiful, not just on the
outside, but on the inside, too.

409
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:43,962
I remember-

410
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,662
Surprised to see
you here, jim.

411
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:06,500
Look at you.
You grew up so nice!

412
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:07,630
- Thanks.
- How's your mother?

413
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:09,902
- She's good, thanks for asking.
- Oh, you're welcome.

414
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,611
She moved on up
a couple of years ago, I think.

415
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:12,993
Well, that's nice.

416
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:15,862
I cannot tell you
how sorry I am about eva.

417
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:19,002
I didn't even know
she was going into the hospital.

418
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:23,663
I mean, she was always so terrified
of doctors and hospitals and...

419
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:28,321
she probably just, uh, didn't
want us to be worried, so...

420
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:32,160
remember how she was always
obsessed with people's feelings?

421
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,963
I just remember her
being very shy.

422
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:40,521
But she made us so proud. I mean, to open
a magazine and seeher right in there.

423
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,320
So beautiful, so confident.

424
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:46,163
Just exactly the way
I wanted her to be.

425
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,223
I... I never thought
she'd go so far.

426
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:53,650
Linda.

427
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:56,940
Linda's the one
I thought would bein the spotlight.

428
00:27:56,947 --> 00:28:00,963
Jim clancy. Hi.
What a surprise.

429
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:04,252
Eva would so love
that you came.

430
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,331
You know, I don't think
she'd even remember me.

431
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,920
Oh, she would.
She talked about you.

432
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:11,250
She said you gave her
a great gift.

433
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,463
Well, listen, I really have to
get back to upton.

434
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:22,243
I don't like to come into the city very much
'cause it really makes me kinda nervous,

435
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:25,002
so... so good to see you.

436
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:28,190
- Bye. Please come visit us.
- I will.

437
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:35,882
Hey, can I ask you-
who's that woman?

438
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:38,522
Oh, that's diana lassiter.

439
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:42,223
She was eva's agent.
She's mine now, too.

440
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:46,741
- Ok, so, you'r real model, too?
- Soon, I hope.

441
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:48,840
I've got a lot
of head shots out there.

442
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:50,972
Did you get help
from your sister?

443
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:54,361
Everything. She had
the whole thing down.

444
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:57,883
- She was totally focused.
- That's good, I guess.

445
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:03,562
Yeah, she overcame a lot.
She, uh, fought really hard.

446
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:08,482
Mostly with herself, but...
she came out on top.

447
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:14,010
She gave herself that power, you know?
And then this happened.

448
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,631
I better get back
to my mother.

449
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:22,771
Thank you.
I hope you come see us soon.

450
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:24,100
Take care, linda.

451
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,992
- You're jim's friend.
- Yeah, tim flaherty.

452
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:44,093
- You're delia banks, right?
- That's right. Nice of you to come.

453
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,172
Yeah, well, I-

454
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:50,392
- You must bein hog heaven here.
- Come again?

455
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,112
I mean, with all the models.

456
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:54,492
Jim told me you had
a thing for models.

457
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:59,020
Oh, jim told ya. Nah.
Too skinny.

458
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:01,690
Really?

459
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,261
Yes, Mrs. Lassiter,
I'm from eva's hometown.

460
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,633
I've never met anyone
from eva's real life.

461
00:30:09,648 --> 00:30:11,213
I didn't really
know her.

462
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:14,510
I used to work for her parents when I was
young mowing lawns, things like that.

463
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:17,110
I hadn't actually seen her
since I moved away.

464
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:20,492
Oh. She was a friend
and a client for about 5 years.

465
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:23,773
Hey, uh, you represent
her-her sister linda, right?

466
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,862
Well, we'll see if she has
what it takes. She might.

467
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:28,303
She's certainly
beautiful.

468
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah, she's that,
but, um, it takes more than that.

469
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:34,110
- It takes a certain toughness.
- Did eva have that?

470
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,753
I mean, that toughness?

471
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:42,092
Look, I loved eva like a sister,
but... she was a bit of a wreck.

472
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,020
A wreck?

473
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,263
You know, I think she might have been
a little freaked out

474
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:47,020
that her sister was
gonna be a model.

475
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,453
You know, I think maybe eva thought
that she'd replace her.

476
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:53,620
How could she worry about
being old when she wasn't even 30?

477
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:57,221
She's practically a senior citizen
in this business, honey.

478
00:30:57,915 --> 00:31:00,040
There was something
more than that, though.

479
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:02,610
She was trying to prove
something to somebody,

480
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,281
and the more successful
she got,

481
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:06,561
the more she was afraid
of losing it.

482
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:10,353
- I've seen it happen.
- Thanks for your time.

483
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:14,651
- It was nice talking to you.
- And you. Take care.

484
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:31,310
Eva...

485
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,623
if you're here,
I wish I could help you.

486
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:38,751
I wish I knew
what you wanted...

487
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,993
what you needed.

488
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:50,361
I don't even know
why you remember me.

489
00:31:50,397 --> 00:31:51,740
You were just a kid.

490
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:57,070
You were too shy
to even say hello.

491
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,720
Hi.
I'm jim clancy.

492
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:01,990
You're the prettiest
girl here. Don't forget that.

493
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:10,923
Person who made me
feel pretty.

494
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,463
Jim, I'm home.

495
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,251
I didn't even remember it.

496
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,730
Well, obviously she did.

497
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:35,633
How can a ghost put some
thing like that in my head?

498
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,292
She has a strong connection
with you.

499
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:40,652
Sometimes we have no idea
the effect we can have on other people.

500
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:44,072
You know, it's things that we forget
are turning points for someone else.

501
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:47,020
You were a kind man,
even then.

502
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:52,503
All right, we know whys he's coming to me,
but we still don't know what she wants.

503
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:55,341
Well, what did
her mother say at the memorial?

504
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,773
Her mother didn't
even know she was in the hospital.

505
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,053
She thinks eva didn't
want her to worry.

506
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,803
So, maybe she just wants
to apologize to her mother.

507
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:06,030
I think it's
more than that.

508
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:08,412
In the chapel,
when her mother was speaking,

509
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:11,190
the doors blew open,
there was all this wind.

510
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:13,323
You know, it was
like she didn't want her to finish.

511
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:15,673
Hmm, that kind of wind
usually means that a ghost is mad,

512
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:19,120
so maybe she led you to her mother,
and not just to apologize.

513
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,203
Yeah, but what do we do?

514
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:22,333
It's your ghost,
what do you think?

515
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:26,993
go see her mother.

516
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:31,010
Good, all right. Hopefully eva will be there
and we'll get this whole thing sorted out.

517
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,653
Have I told you how glad
I am that you're back?

518
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,932
You can show me.

519
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,561
I'm very sorry for your loss.

520
00:34:42,528 --> 00:34:43,381
Oh, thank you.

521
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,621
You didn't have to come all
this way just to say that.

522
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:50,123
Actually, mary beth,
there's another reason we're here.

523
00:34:52,018 --> 00:35:00,293
This may sound strange or funny, even,
but I think... we think eva's still here.

524
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,570
Yes, I know. She'll-she'll
always be here with us.

525
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,450
Um, we mean literally.

526
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:14,951
Heh. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

527
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,241
Ask her to say all those
nice things about me again.

528
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:22,143
Uh, she's here.

529
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,740
Ok, look, if you guys
are trying to comfort me,

530
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:34,942
it's really not working, and, in fact,
I think it's really a little creepy, so-

531
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,512
she wants you to say
some more nice things about her.

532
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:39,320
- Yeah.
- What?

533
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:40,900
I want to hear more.

534
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,552
Except she did
leave a few things out.

535
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:46,281
She's talking
about the memorial.

536
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:49,191
She says that you left a few
things out when you talked about her.

537
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:52,422
Oh! This is ridiculous.
I have to go.

538
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,470
She didn't mention how she used to tell me
how I shouldn't expect too much from life

539
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:57,442
because homely girl shad it hard.

540
00:35:57,768 --> 00:36:00,393
She feels like you criticized her.

541
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,231
How are you doing this?

542
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:10,233
- What is this?
- Eva's here with us. Right now.

543
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,102
Why'd you do that
to me, mom?

544
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,850
Why'd you tell me my nose
looked too big in pictures?

545
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,341
Not that I'd ever beas beautiful as linda,
but so at least I could be presentable!

546
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:22,570
She feels like
you compared her to linda.

547
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:25,293
I never criticized her.

548
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:29,921
Yeah, I was hard on her, but look at
the career she had because I pushed her

549
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,850
never to be satisfied.

550
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:35,263
She's just tryingto tell you that
you made her feel bad about herself.

551
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,252
They were only words.

552
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:40,342
They might have just
been words, mom, but I believed

553
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:43,140
in every single one of them
because they came from you.

554
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:45,321
What the hell's
going on here?

555
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:49,870
Didn't you know I just wanted to
be seen as beautiful in your eyes?

556
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:53,993
I tried to change erything about
myself to please you until

557
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:56,782
there was nothing left
for you to criticize!

558
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:01,130
She can't hear you.

559
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:07,572
You said that you wanted
to change everything about yourself.

560
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:11,980
You didn't goin to the hospital
to have an appendectomy, did you?

561
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,302
Diana knows the truth.

562
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:19,233
She helped me.

563
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,991
I know you were friends
with eva back in the day,

564
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,933
but what you're asking for
is some very private information.

565
00:37:37,616 --> 00:37:39,112
All right, that's true, but...

566
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:43,083
it's important to me,
and to us, to her family.

567
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:48,661
We think we know what happened.
We just want you to confirm it.

568
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:52,050
- I don't know if it's even ethical.
- Your client's dead.

569
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:55,090
If you can shed some light on that,
or give her family some closure,

570
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:59,953
- how could that not be ethical?
- Did you know eva?

571
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,370
- I've met her.
- What do you think happened?

572
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,841
I think she went to a hospitalfor plastic
surgery and something went wrong.

573
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:10,421
How did you find out?

574
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,402
It's not important right now.

575
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:17,053
I tried to tell her not to do it,
that she didn't need it,

576
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:20,371
but she was never satisfied
with her looks, never.

577
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:23,560
All right, but what went
wrong in the surgery?

578
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,441
Eva was on diet pills.
She didn't tell the doctor.

579
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,920
She had a bad reaction
to the anesthetic.

580
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:37,122
Well, thank you
for being honest with us.

581
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:39,982
Diana, I know that
you're trying to protect eva,

582
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:41,702
but you have
to tell her family.

583
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:45,363
Oh, po-why keep that wound open?
Why not just let them heal?

584
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:48,521
The truth heals,
and they deserve to know.

585
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:54,383
- And there's one more thing.
- What?

586
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:57,342
We have to be with you
when you tell them.

587
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,860
I can't believe
she didn't tell us about this.

588
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:07,501
I'm sorry. I would have told you sooner,
but I wanted to respec ther privacy.

589
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:10,631
And then melinda and jim
thought you had a right to know.

590
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,111
I want diana to tell
my sister something.

591
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:16,080
Diana, eva wants you
to tell linda something.

592
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,521
What? I'm-I'm sorry?
What is this?

593
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,202
She's here with us.

594
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:23,230
What is she talking about?

595
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:26,183
She wants you to tell linda
about the pills.

596
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:27,831
Well, I-yeah,
I told you.

597
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,641
She was on diet pills,
and she forgot to tell-

598
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:32,132
she didn't tell the doctor.

599
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:34,602
And diana told men
ot to tell him.

600
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:37,793
She told me he wouldn't
do the surgery if he knew.

601
00:39:38,388 --> 00:39:40,790
You told her that the doctor
would refuse the operation

602
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,001
if he knew about the pills.

603
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,840
And it was the pills
and the anesthesia that killed her.

604
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,651
You also told her that
it would add 10 years to her career.

605
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,382
Excuse me, are you trying
to blame me for this?

606
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:54,243
She wanted that surgery.
She wanted it.

607
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:57,090
She's not trying
to blame anyone.

608
00:39:57,486 --> 00:40:00,182
I just don't
want my sister to buy into this.

609
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:02,510
I don't want her
to listen to diana.

610
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,490
She's worried about you.

611
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:08,182
She doesn't want you
to listen to diana or anyone.

612
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:11,530
Just... listen to yourself.

613
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,363
But I wanted
to be like eva.

614
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:17,771
That's all I was
trying to do.

615
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:20,183
She overcame everything.

616
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:22,450
I overcame nothing.

617
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,431
I never looked inside.

618
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:29,561
I turned myself into
what other people wanted me to be.

619
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:33,441
She's saying
that she hasn't overcome anything.

620
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:36,593
She just became
who other people wanted her to be.

621
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,090
No, that's not true.

622
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,733
When I realized
I was dead,

623
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:47,981
I didn't remember the money or the
magazines or even my own face.

624
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:56,072
I remembered that one sweet
moment at the high school dance.

625
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:06,210
And when she dies, I want her to leave
behind a life full of real things.

626
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,681
I want her to live
from the inside.

627
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:16,390
- Can you tell her that?
- I promise.

628
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:23,333
Is that where
I'm supposed to go?

629
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:26,211
She sees the light.

630
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:29,321
She's ready to cross over now.

631
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,792
She's here, I can feel her.

632
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:35,300
She's gonna be ok.

633
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:37,042
Yes, she is.

634
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:44,873
Eva, for whatever
its worth...

635
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:51,842
I spoke to your mother at the memorial
service and... I saw how much she loved you.

636
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:55,171
How proud she was
of you, I saw it in her eyes.

637
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:57,802
It was real.

638
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:03,660
Well, it's time to say good-bye.

639
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:08,441
Take care, eva.

640
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,202
Well...

641
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:37,392
I think that you and i should talk.

642
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:38,560
Please.

643
00:42:45,245 --> 00:42:50,160
You know, I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

644
00:42:51,086 --> 00:42:55,213
I don't know
how you do this on a daily basis.

645
00:42:55,368 --> 00:43:00,051
I feel like
I need to lie down for 6 weeks.

646
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:03,071
Yeah, well, my ghosts
aren't quite as fascinating as yours.

647
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:04,621
Oh, yeah, fascinating.

648
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:08,440
I'm sure am gonna
miss the beetles and the scalpels.

649
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,221
Oh, and the tearing off
of faces, I'll agree.

650
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,962
Oh, well. At least
she was easy on the eyes.

651
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:15,932
Yep. That she was.

652
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:26,073
But the most
beautiful woman in my world...

653
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:28,970
is right here.

654
00:43:30,198 --> 00:43:32,711
She's pretty
easy on the eyes.

655
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:36,833
Welcome home,
dream girl.

656
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:38,240
Come here.

657
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:42,243
