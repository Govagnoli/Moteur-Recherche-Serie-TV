1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,860
How many times have I told you,
your store is growing too quickly.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,700
You've never told me that.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,670
Your books are a mess.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,950
When have you ever seen my books?

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,210
I haven't seen your books,but I know you.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,040
Let's focus,please.

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,080
Look,my friend kylie's a financial whiz.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,430
She could really help you.

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,740
Her father was the dean of the
business school here before he died.

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,410
Before that,he was my economics department advisor.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,460
- You were an economics major?
- Yes,I was an economics major.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,470
I was this close to getting my undergrad,ok?

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,480
In economics?

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,500
Yes,I can add,melinda.I'm a big boy,ok?

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,000
Look,kylie lost her merit scholarship.

16
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,510
That's her loss,but it's your gain.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,690
Does she have the job or not?

18
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,590
Well,she might have,but she's a half an hour late,

19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,780
and it's my night to cook.

20
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,950
Well,I think I told her 7:30.

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,880
You cook?What do you cook?

22
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,480
Tell me about it.

23
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,100
Well,I make a great lasagna,you told her 7:00,

24
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,840
and I can't hire someone who's flaky.

25
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,080
She's not flaky.

26
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,490
She's not.She's just.

27
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,570
she's troubled.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,150
Why wouldn't you tell me that she's haunted?

29
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,780
'Cause I don't know if she's really haunted.

30
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,120
It could be anything.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,170
She's skittish,she's nervous,
she has a hard time focusing.

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,420
It could be any one of your college pitfalls.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,700
It could be sex,drugs,guitar hero.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,290
So you want me to give her a job just in case she has a ghost?

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,320
And if she doesn't,what do you want me to do then?

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,730
Clean her dorm room,do her laundry?

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,880
Melinda,this girl's father was my mentor.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,590
Please.I'm begging you.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,880
Hi!I'm sorry I'm late.

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,500
You're not late.

41
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,570
Late was 10 minutes ago.

42
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,460
You're in a different time zone,kylie!

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,890
I know,I know,I'm not sure what happened.

44
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,820
I said informal job interview.

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,360
I didn't mean that informal.

46
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,540
Oh,well,moving right along.

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,870
Kylie,melinda,melinda,kylie.

48
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,850
Hi.

49
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,900
It's just,it was really dark,
and I really thought that someone was.

50
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:55,990
whatever.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,850
You went out on a limb for me,
and I completely blew it.

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,570
I guess the,uh,the job is history.

54
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,680
No.No,not at all.

55
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,190
When do you want to start?

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,130
I knew you two kids would hit it off.

57
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,070
Can you see us?

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,890
Oh,please don't tell me those are
all this month's receipts.

62
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,590
No,actually,there's a bunch
from april and march,january.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,700
Hey,is that dry cleaning receipt I've been looking for.

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,990
Do you think they're still going to
have my coat after 6 months?

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
Well,it's worth giving it a try.

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,170
Hey,this student that you hired,what's her deal?

67
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,270
Uh,her name's kylie,her grades slipped,

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,820
and she's trying to get her scholarship reinstated.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm talking about her other deal.

70
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,520
What's the reason we hired her?

71
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,460
Well,I thought we weren't gonna talk about it.

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,890
You were just gonna do your thing,
I was gonna do my thing,yada yada.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,620
Yeah,except your thing kinda becomes my thing

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,030
when you bring it into the store.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,800
Well,is it really going to bother you that much
even if you don't believe it's real?

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,450
No,I was just,you know,trying to know
how I should act around her.

77
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,220
I don't want to step on any ghost toes.

78
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,640
Well,I really appreciate that.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,950
Um,she has a ghost.

80
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,040
That's pretty much all I know so far.

81
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,400
Ok.Hey,I just want to remind you
that I've got that appointment

82
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,100
with ned on thursday,so I won't be here all day.

83
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,690
I've got it.

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,910
It's on the calendar.

85
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,550
- Hi.Am I too early?
- No,not at all.

86
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,010
I was just getting things organized for you.

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,050
Ok.

88
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,580
- Um,you know,about that
- you can't start today?

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,420
You don't want the job?

90
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,220
No!No!I just.

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,060
I just want to make sure professor
payne didn't pressure you into this.

92
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,480
He has a way of pushing people.

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,710
Yeah,you noticed that,too?

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,480
Yeah.

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
So unless you,um,actually need my help,I...

96
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,690
trust me,when you see the books.we need it.

97
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,920
Um,I'm just gonna grab my laptop,
and then you can get to work.

98
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,490
Ok.

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,650
So,how do you and professor payne actually know each other?

100
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,950
Oh,we have some of the same.interests.

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,990
Oh,my god!

102
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,690
Oh!Oh,my god!

103
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,580
They're all over me!

104
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,040
What is this?!What is this?!What is this?!

105
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,140
Get them off of me!

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,700
Oh,my god!

107
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,670
Are you ok?

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,650
Oh,my god,melinda!

109
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,940
- Go get jim.
- Ok.

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,050
You're ok.

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,380
Finish it!

112
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,460
Finish it!

113
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,310
Delia: He was already on his way over.

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,270
Yeah,you could hear that crash
all the way across the square.

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,140
Hey there,hi.My name's jim.

116
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,800
All right,that's going to be sore for a little while.

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,720
You were very lucky that that's safety glass.

118
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,010
That could have been a lot worse.

119
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Assuming how the definition of luck changes
depending on how bad yours is.

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,990
Yeah,right,being attacked by a swarm of flies,not lucky.

121
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,260
These things happen to you a lot?

122
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,710
Daily,yeah.

123
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,130
What kind of things,for example?

124
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,910
Thanks,delia.

125
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,780
Melinda will be back any minute
with some more ice for your arm.

126
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,760
Um,you know what,actually,I'm fine.

127
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,630
I'll just ice it back at the dorm.

128
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,220
I think you should come to the station with me
and let me take a better look at that.

129
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,830
You know what,it's ok.

130
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,090
But thank you for everything.

131
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,980
At least let me drive you home.

132
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,690
No,I have a car.

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,040
It's ok.

134
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,310
Thank you.

135
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,330
So did you get a chance to debrief her?

136
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,370
No,she was gone before I got back.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,270
Jim said she couldn't have gotten out of here fast enough.

138
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,450
Now,you're thinking this has something do with her father,right?

139
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,950
That's the first thing I thought of,
and the second,frankly.

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,690
I mean,her father died 4 years ago.

141
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,290
That's right around the time kylie started
going to rockland university.

142
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,050
So why would he suddenly appear now?

143
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,810
Maybe he's disappointed in her studies.

144
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,680
I mean,she comes from a long line of academics.

145
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,660
Her grandfather founded the economics department.

146
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,620
Her father was a consultant for the world bank
before he retired to teach at rockland U.

147
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,670
Her brother just graduated summa cum laude from here.

148
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,090
The ghost said "finish it.

149
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,790
" I mean,I guess that could mean college.

150
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,150
Yeah,spoken just like ben,except for the plastic head part.

151
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,610
It makes me wonder,if it is her father,
why he wouldn't just talk to me directly.

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
And what's with all the weird hauntings?

153
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,480
I mean,the heavy breathing,the doll,the flies,
it's all gotta be a symbol of some kind.

154
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,440
Does it have anything to do with what he used to teach?

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,750
No,he was an economist,not an entomologist.

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,190
They're the ones that study bugs.

157
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,810
I'm aware of that.

158
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh,I'm sorry.

159
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,430
I'm always teaching,I can't help it.You know?

160
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,300
The fact of the matter is,economists,they never speak in metaphor.

161
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,190
That's probably why I never cut it as one.

162
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,550
You know,nobody ever knew what the heck I was talking about.

163
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,000
And that's different now in what way?

164
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,090
That's very funny.

165
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,140
Look,maybe we should just find out from kylie
if she knows anyone who died more recently.

166
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,780
Great.That would be thanatology,the study of the dead.

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,950
Look,I know that this is hard to talk about,
but when I met you,

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,030
I heard a really strange.breathing noise.

169
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,700
I really want to help you.

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,180
You heard it,too,didn't you?

171
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,820
What if I did,what does that mean?

172
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,870
I don't know,have you heard it before?

173
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,540
On occasion.

174
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,870
Since when?

175
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,380
Uh,a few months ago,when my scholarship got revoked.

176
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm assuming it has something to do with stress.

177
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,030
Why?

178
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,440
Because I can see ghosts,
and I think there's one haunting you.

179
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,040
Ok.

180
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,520
wow.

181
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,980
I don't want to sound rude,but,um,
you're saying you've seen a ghost around me?

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,430
I couldn't see his face,
but he was wearing a hat and a dark overcoat.

183
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,320
Does that sound familiar?

184
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,250
You saw a ghost in a hat and dark overcoat?

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
- Do you know what you sound like?- Yes.

186
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,430
Yes,I do,but if you could just go with me on it.

187
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,930
Flies.

188
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,020
the doll,um,weird breathing noise.

189
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,870
Does that mean anything to you?

190
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,330
I mean.the doll talked to you.

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,540
I know you saw it.

192
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,540
It was a talking doll.

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,710
No,it was a ghost.

194
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,680
talking to you,and it said,"finish it.

195
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,550
" What does that mean?

196
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,560
Finish what?

197
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,910
I think this conversation.

198
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,350
I have to go.

199
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,740
Kylie,I really want to help you.

200
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,310
Has anyone around you died recently?

201
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,450
No,not really,actually.

202
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,930
Could this have anything to do with your dad?

203
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,760
Could scaring you be his way of getting you to finish?

204
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,070
Stop it.Don't talk about my dad.

205
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,810
It's bad enough that I've lost him.

206
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
Don't make him into some freak ghost.

207
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,700
And by the way,about that job,I quit.

208
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,320
She's scared.

209
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,350
And she's hiding something,
but I'm never going to know what it is,

210
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,060
because I'm never going to see her again.

211
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,830
You're too hard on yourself.

212
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,590
I should have known just to back off,you know?

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,590
Even the word "ghost" was wigging her out.

214
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,400
This is not your fault,all right?

215
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,250
She was probably terrified by one of payne's lectures,right?

216
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,760
Nice try.Thanks.

217
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,500
Mel,what's wrong?

218
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,680
Wait a minute.

219
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,690
Wait a minute,it's just like that
scene from that japanese horror film!

220
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,960
What was?

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,400
The vision I just had!

222
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,830
Flies!

223
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,920
Amityville horror,or the fly!

224
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,090
The...the doll.

225
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,940
Puppet master,or chucky!

226
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,470
The overcoat.

227
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh,my god,the overcoat.

228
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,350
Just pick one.

229
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,350
I can't believe i r-neve-I can't believe I didn't see it!

230
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,110
See what?

231
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,670
The hauntings.

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,590
They're all scenes from hvir moorroes.

233
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,320
Let's narrow this down.

234
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,690
We need to find someone who's close to you
that died recently that was a horror film buff.

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,820
Anything?

236
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,290
Well,what do you expect?

237
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,450
I expect you to tell me the truth if you want help.

238
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,330
Look,if melinda says you have a ghost,hey,you have a ghost.

239
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,440
Ok,so what if I have one?

240
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,810
What...what's the deal?

241
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,970
What does that mean?

242
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,440
Well,ghosts,if they're here,
it's usually because they have unfinished business.

243
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,220
- Like what?
- Whatever.

244
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,590
It could be anything with a loved one.

245
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,510
It could be unresolved issues of guilt,anger,forgiveness.

246
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,190
Can.this ghost hurt me?

247
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,390
Actually,if they get angry,they can get pretty nasty.

248
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,380
What aren't you telling me,kylie?

249
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,760
There's something you're not telling me.

250
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,920
Did somebody close to you die?

251
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,010
I need to know.

252
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,390
No,I've known people to die,yeah,
but no one close or anything.

253
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,990
Hey,kylie.

254
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,750
Cram session.

255
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,820
Let's get a move on.

256
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,570
I have to go.

257
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,910
I don't want to be the first sloan to not graduate.

258
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,560
Are you at the film school yet?

259
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,820
Did you get any answers?

260
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,810
Rick: Yes,nothing happened,no one died.

261
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,780
I'm telling you,no faculty members,
no janitors,no students,nothing.

262
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,510
If something like that happened,
it would have been all over the campus.

263
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,760
It's not,uh,it's not like we drop
like flies around here,no pun intended.

264
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,440
Well,aren't there any students that are into the genre?

265
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,580
I mean,there is a class or a club or anything?

266
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm looking.

267
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,670
I'm at the bulletin board now.

268
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,870
There's a flyer up here for musical theater club.

269
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,280
That's spooky.

270
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,210
Keep looking.

271
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,990
What else do I have?I have a missing kitty.

272
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,170
All right,this is different.

273
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,930
"Scared sane... "we're holding auditions
for a new kind of horror film.

274
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,170
"Ever wonder why some movies terrify you?

275
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,270
"Are you brave enough to enter your own personal horror
"to see what lies within?

276
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,190
Enlightenment awaits.

277
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,560
" Sounds like a real horror buff.

278
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,210
Is there a name,phone number,anything?

279
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,800
Let's see,auditions are at
some downtown production facility.

280
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,250
There's a name,toby bates,
but as far as a number goes,you're out of luck.

281
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,660
It's a couple months old.

282
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,580
Well,fax it over and I'll check it out.

283
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,020
- Ok.
- Thanks.

284
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
Hangs up phone Toby.

285
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,460
Ringing Toby?

286
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,130
I'm looking for toby bates.

287
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,420
Hello?

288
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,970
Is anyone there?

289
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,880
Why do I always
get the scary stuff?

290
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,500
Who are you?

291
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,390
Oh, you want to play?

292
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,130
Is that it?

293
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,090
Ok.

294
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,100
So which one is this?

295
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,630
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn,

296
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
or the spaceship from alien?

297
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,100
What?

298
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,140
Who are you?

299
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,720
So what is this?

300
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,300
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn

301
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,460
or the spaceship
from alien? What?

302
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,750
Oh, you want to play?

303
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:48,150
Oh, you want to play?

304
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,670
Ok, here it is,
toby bates' obit.

305
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,010
"Guerilla filmmaker
falls to his death."

306
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,250
This happened 3 months ago.

307
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, that's right, when kylie
said the hauntings started.

308
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,630
She said no one
close to her died.

309
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,200
We should ask her if
she knew this kid toby.

310
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,640
It says he wasn't a student,
so that's not their connection.

311
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,430
He was just a kid
shooting a film.

312
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,540
Yeah, lots and lots
of film apparently.

313
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,620
There's massive amounts
of files on this computer.

314
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,120
Thank goodness you had the
mental fortitude to steal it.

315
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,690
Hey, I did not steal it.

316
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,210
This ghost wanted my help,
led me to that editing bay,

317
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,780
and in fact, probably
wanted me to take it.

318
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,440
What I still want to know is

319
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,840
what are we going to
do about skippy here.

320
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,160
I mean, what is he
good for except for

321
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,630
a free ride in
the carpool lane?

322
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,150
And what's he doing
in my good chair?

323
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,690
More importantly, why is
he wearing toby's clothes?

324
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,840
I mean, it's gotta be a prop
from one of his movies, right?

325
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,620
I hope so.

326
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,960
Oh, listen to his profile.

327
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,070
"I want to push classic horror
past the scare to enlightenment,

328
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,150
use the genre to dive into the
darkness of souls and set them free."

329
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,150
To think I was just watching
scary movies for fun.

330
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,260
Do you think
kylie was in one of

331
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,680
toby's movies and
that's how they met?

332
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,940
There's an audition
file in there.

333
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,830
I think we could look
to see if she's in it.

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,650
What horror movie
really scares you?

335
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,290
That movie where the arm
comes up out of the grave

336
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,610
and it like--ugh--
like, super creepy, yeah.

337
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,380
What--wait a minute.
I know this kid.

338
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,070
He's one of kylie's friends.

339
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,590
well, that's great. So
there's a connection at least.

340
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,420
I mean, you can talk to
this bruce guy tomorrow

341
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,810
and find out what
he'll tell us.

342
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,270
I mean, maybe he's
being haunted, too.

343
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,670
No, I'm not--I'm
not talking to him.

344
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,820
You do the talky talk.

345
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,590
That's your job.
It always has been.

346
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,710
Except that I have to be
at my other job tomorrow.

347
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,500
Delia's got the day off.
Look, you're gonna be great.

348
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,690
What are we gonna
do about her?

349
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,700
Yeah, I remember this.

350
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,760
Actually worked on this film.

351
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,000
Guy called it a "shockumentary,"
making you face your fears.

352
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,380
I call it sick.

353
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,590
Well, after you worked in it,

354
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,020
did you notice anything
strange or supernatural

355
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,030
that happened to you
in the last 3 months?

356
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,290
-I aced my bio quiz.
-Wow, that is spooky, my man.

357
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
I don't know how
you sleep at night.

358
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,710
Anything, for real?
Did you notice anything?

359
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,270
No, man, it was just a movie.

360
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,460
All right.

361
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,560
Well, what is a
shockumentary? What is that?

362
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,710
He would ask you what
classic horror movies

363
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,250
scared you the most,
and then, you know,

364
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,530
he'd put you in
the scariest scenes,

365
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,700
making you experience the
horror over and over again.

366
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,980
Guy was a psycho.

367
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,560
Now, I didn't know a
movie that's scared me,

368
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,240
so he put me in
somebody else's fear.

369
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,800
I play the priest
in the exorcist.

370
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,720
This guy just liked
scaring people,

371
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,930
or was there a
point to all of it?

372
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,180
I don't know. I didn't
stick around to find out.

373
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,190
Hey, brother, I
don't blame you.

374
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,980
I wasn't scared, I was pissed.

375
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,250
I ran into a friend that night
who had just wrapped her segment,

376
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,150
looked like she got
in a car accident.

377
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,690
She said her scariest movies
were blair witch and evil dead,

378
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,970
so toby left her alone in
the woods for a whole night.

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,210
Nearly lost her mind.

380
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,990
Was kylie in a movie?

381
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,520
No, she had no
interest in acting.

382
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,710
I didn't think so.

383
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,140
But she sure grilled toby
about what he was doing.

384
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,730
I didn't know she was
such a major horror buff.

385
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,310
Wait a minute, kylie
and toby, they met?

386
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,530
Yeah. I dragged
her along with me.

387
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,250
Toby even wanted her
to audition for it.

388
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,580
She said no, and
it got kinda nasty.

389
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,310
-What else happened?
-Oh, we left.

390
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,020
But you should have seen
the look on toby's face.

391
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,700
He was pissed.

392
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,610
So kylie was at the
audition, she did meet toby.

393
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,830
Yeah, turns out she's a
giant horror film buff.

394
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,260
She even insulted his work.

395
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,050
So why has she been
covering it with us?

396
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,830
Have I not been trying to figure
that out the entire ride over here?

397
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,200
I don't know, I
wasn't with you.

398
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,120
You're right, that was,
uh, skippy. I forget.

399
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,330
You guys look so much alike.

400
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,910
Well, we were
trying to figure out,

401
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,480
and we came up with
nothing, we were stymied.

402
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,850
So we called
kylie's cell phone

403
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,020
and it went right
to voicemail.

404
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,840
It's ok, she'll call back
when she gets scared enough

405
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,810
and it'll probably
be soon. Look at this.

406
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,280
I spent the last 3 hours looking
at more of toby's footage.

407
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,220
Ooh, I feel your pain.

408
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
You know, the big crime is
efthat bore this kid died,

409
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,980
he didn't set some
time aside to edit.

410
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,350
Well, actually, he did.

411
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,710
I found something that
looked like a movie

412
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,020
he was starting to
assemble. Brace yourself.

413
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,620
Oh, my gosh!

414
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,820
That person was
actually buried alive!

415
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,230
How is that therapy?

416
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,020
How could toby get away
with something like that?

417
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,550
Actors will pretty much do
anything to get themselves on film.

418
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,520
So this is a shockumentary.

419
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,810
Yeah, all the segments
are about 5 minutes long,

420
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,900
and he's put 6
together so far.

421
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,990
Let's see, you have cindy's
fear: Friday the 13th,

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,450
janet's fear: I know
what you did last summer.

423
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,020
-billy's fear...
-yeah, he cast on fear, not type.

424
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,110
I mean, it's pretty terrifying,
I had to turn it off.

425
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,230
Well, that's weird, melinda.

426
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,460
I mean, some of the date
stamps on these edits

427
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,500
are within the last month.

428
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,930
One of these is
from yesterday!

429
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,890
But one of us had the
computer the whole time.

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,950
-I mean, he couldn't have cut it, could he?
-Why couldn't he?

431
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,010
I mean, we've seen
him manipulate footage,

432
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,360
surveillance camera stuff.

433
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,100
I mean, it's not
that far of a leap.

434
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,390
He's making his
movie from the grave.

435
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,600
********I'm home.

436
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,970
Thank god you're home.

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,780
This movie's really
starting to freak me out.

438
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,040
What is it?

439
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,340
It's the movie that the ghost
was making, or is making.

440
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,990
And your favorite genre.

441
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,200
No, except this
one's different.

442
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,290
These are real people,
and they're really scared.

443
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,360
It's like freddy
krueger meets punk'D.

444
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,450
Apparently kylie tiedck
this guy off in an audition.

445
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,860
Well, I know he's a
ghost, so that's not good.

446
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,200
Yeah, I'm just trying to see
if there's any more to it.

447
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, if you're
actually sort of scared,

448
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,860
why don't you
turn the lights on?

449
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,720
Are you kidding me?
And ruin the fun?

450
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,370
I don't understand you people.

451
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,390
I'm gonna hit the shower.

452
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,100
Get me the hell out of here!

453
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,710
What are you afraid of?

454
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,560
I want out!

455
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
-I know you're...
-what are you afraid of?

456
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,370
Jim, stop it, seriously.

457
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,430
What are you afraid of?

458
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,070
All right, that's it!

459
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,270
Toby, stop it!
Do you hear me?!

460
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,130
It was bad enough
when you were alive.

461
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,110
I thought you wanted to play.

462
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,710
I thought you loved
those slasher movies.

463
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,870
You have to stop doing this.

464
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,450
Just let me try and
help you move on.

465
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,030
Not until she finishes it.

466
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,780
Who, kylie?

467
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,940
What is it that you
want her to finish?

468
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,170
Ask her. She knows.

469
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,660
Did you talk to kylie?

470
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,700
No, I called,
went by her dorm.

471
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,230
I think she's avoiding us, and
there's something you should see.

472
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah.

473
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,010
Was that a person?!

474
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,100
No. That was
skippy over there.

475
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,460
But I know why you're queasy.
Does any of that look familiar?

476
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,020
That's the place
where toby died.

477
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,720
I recognize the for rent
sign from his obituary.

478
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,240
He was doing a stunt.
That's how he died.

479
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,150
Wait a minute.

480
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,470
Shouldn't you buy
him a drink first?

481
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,020
Look, ok?

482
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,340
The movie that he was making
before he died, it was the exorcist.

483
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,650
I'm with you, I think.

484
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,770
The falling through the
glass, the heavy breathing,

485
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,670
the things that he was
haunting kylie with,

486
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,110
it's all things
from the movie,

487
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,530
so it has to mean
something to her.

488
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,170
Wait a minute, what was that?

489
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
I didn't see that before.

490
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,270
It's one of the soundtracks
attached to the raw footage.

491
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,030
They must have mixed it
down into logged clips.

492
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,650
-let's do one more.
-What?

493
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,350
Well, that's toby, but you
can hear someone else. Listen.

494
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,570
What? Why? We're not gonna
get a better take than that.

495
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,040
-It's kylie.
-Yeah.

496
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,680
She was working with him.

497
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,020
Just not in front
of the camera.

498
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,350
Hey, kylie, it's melinda.

499
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,050
If you're there,
please pick up.

500
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,240
I need to talk to you.

501
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,620
I know you were
working with toby.

502
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,000
What I don't understand
is why you didn't tell us.

503
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,070
I know you're scared, but
you need to let us help you

504
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,430
before this gets
even worse. Just--

505
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,440
Testing, testing.

506
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,900
Final death scene, take one.

507
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,100
Final death scene, take one.

508
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,240
Final death scene, take one.

509
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,710
Testing.Final death

510
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,510

00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:41,980
death scene, death
scene, death scene,

515
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,100
all right, I need you to tell
me the truth. What happened?

516
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,410
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene--

517
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,200
I killed him.

518
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,470
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene.

519
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,610
I.*********

520
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,990
I just didn't want
to believe you.

521
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,740
The thought of
toby haunting me is.

522
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,410
it's too awful.

523
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,150
Why don't you tell me exactly
what happened that night.

524
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,160
I was supposed to be there.

525
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,200
He had the shot all set up.

526
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,100
It was actually pretty cool.

527
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,210
This interior angle shot
of the priest falling.

528
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,800
Bruce quit, so toby
had to stand in.

529
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,610
It was a 2-person job.

530
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,220
And I guess he
tripped, and fell.

531
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,560
It's horrible.

532
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,950
That's what happened to toby.

533
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,450
But you weren't there.

534
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,480
It was an accident, so.

535
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,270
why do you think
it's your fault?

536
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,550
Because.

537
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
that's the day I
lost my scholarship.

538
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,710
I've just been so invested
in making this movie

539
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,930
that I've let my
course work slip.

540
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,430
I'm skipping deadlines,
I'm flunking tests.

541
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,600
You--you
can't quit.

542
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,390
This is our baby.

543
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
No, this is your baby.

544
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,680
And it's been fun, and we've
had our kicks, but it's over.

545
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,640
No, you don't understand.
I'm doing this for you.

546
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,450
-You need to face your fears.
-Please don'T.

547
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
I don't want to do this.

548
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,380
Yes, you do, and
that's what scares you.

549
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,280
I haven't even told my
friends about working with you.

550
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,910
What embarrasses you
more, me or making movies?

551
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,240
-It's just. it's not me.
-Yes, it is.

552
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,300
What is holding you
back? You can do this.

553
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,290
Why are you turning
your back on it?

554
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,510
You love making movies.

555
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,440
Why is what I do
so important to you?

556
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,500
Do you have something to say?

557
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,190
'Cause if you do, say it.

558
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,510
I want to hear it.

559
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,490
I do.

560
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,110
This isn't about me.

561
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,770
It's never about you.

562
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,920
You think hiding behind
a camera gives you a pass.

563
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,020
From our friendship and
from all human interaction.

564
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,350
No, that's the only
way that it works.

565
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,630
Ok, that's the only way
that I can get people

566
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,730
to be themselves on camera.

567
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,420
I have to be invisible.

568
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,230
I hope you and your camera
have a very happy life together.

569
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,270
I'm done.

570
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,660
I shouldn't have
walked away like that.

571
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,460
I don't think
toby's haunting you

572
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,140
because he thinks
you killed him.

573
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,360
Of course he does, why
else would he be doing this?

574
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,760
I think he wants you
to face your worst fear,

575
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,490
whatever it is
about that movie.

576
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,590
God.

577
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,610
I'm so tired of hearing that.

578
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,600
What do you mean?

579
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,960
I know why the
exorcist scares me.

580
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,300
The day my dad died, a priest
was reading his last rites.

581
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,040
It was horrible.

582
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,120
That's why I can't-- I
can't watch that movie.

583
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,910
I get it.

584
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,840
-Nowhw at?
-I don't know.

585
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,550
I don't understand
what he wants, then.

586
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,060
I want her to finish it.

587
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,560
If she's faced her fears,
I want her to finish it.

588
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,410
Finish what?

589
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,920
Is he here?

590
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,710
He was.

591
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,030
What did he say?

592
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,890
He said if you faced your
fears, he wants you to finish it.

593
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,310
Do you know what that means?

594
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,710
It means.

595
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,250
he's not gonna stop.

596
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,940
And this isn't gonna
end, and you can'T.

597
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,310
help me.

598
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
Yes, I can.

599
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,540
I promise.

600
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,490
You need to leave kylie alone.

601
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,880
That's funny.

602
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,810
I was going to say the same thing to you.

603
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,340
You're making it worse.

604
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,360
She needs to figure it out on her own.

605
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,680
Why is that important to you,
that she finishes the movie?

606
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,180
Why do you this to people?

607
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,190
Everyone has something that they're afraid of;

608
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,910
something that holds them back.

609
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,260
There's always a reason.

610
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,610
Like you,and those slasher films.

611
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,440
Let's look at that.

612
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,750
Give me a break.

613
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,140
Don't you ever wonder why those films
leave you feeling sick and exposed?

614
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,170
What deep,dark memory do they stir?

615
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,140
I don't need your help.

616
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,110
Those films are usually about abandonment.

617
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,280
Who abandoned you,melinda?

618
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,680
Who left you alone in the dark?

619
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,030
Your mother?

620
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,020
Your father?

621
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,230
That's it,isn't it?

622
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,660
- Was he a
- stop it.

623
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,430
I am all for self reflection,
but you're the earth-bound spirit.

624
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,390
You're the one who has issues.

625
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,630
Are you sure?

626
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,730
By the way,kylie's going to
finish what we started.

627
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,520
She has no choice.

628
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,090
Ok,toby,I'm here.

629
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,140
This is where we were going to shoot the last.

630
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,610
it's where you died.

631
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,900
Did you want to see me scared?

632
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,040
Did you want to see me...

633
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,440
...crack?

634
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,420
Well,it worked.

635
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,540
I'm terrified.

636
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,110
Now what do you want from me?

637
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,000
Is this it?

638
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,430
I don't get it.

639
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,340
I am trying,damn it!

640
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,060
I've done everything that you wanted!

641
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
I watched the movie a million times!

642
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,540
I don't know what I'm supposed to face!

643
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,020
I'm done living it!

644
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,380
Do I have to die,too?

645
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,280
Do I have to die,too?

646
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,110
Wow,you really know what you're doing.

647
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,030
Tell that to this machine.

648
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,330
What is wrong with this thing?!

649
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,870
What do you want from me?!

650
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,460
I shot your movie,I cut it!

651
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,940
It's finished. Just let me be done with it!

652
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,200
Kylie,everything's going to be ok.

653
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,320
No,it's not.

654
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,780
He won't let me lock the cut.

655
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,690
He won't let me finish.

656
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,510
Kylie,no one's here.

657
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,340
He's been here all night.

658
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,390
He's haunted me every step.

659
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,880
I beliyoeve U.

660
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,700
Why do you think he's doing that?

661
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,360
I don't know,I told you.

662
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,490
Tell me about the breathing.

663
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,910
What about it?

664
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,260
Toby seems to think it's the key,
and you're the only one who knows why.

665
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,330
The breathing.

666
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,970
is it about your father,the way he died?

667
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,240
The summer before I leorft f rockland,
I had,uh,I had an internship

668
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,940
at this investment firm in the city.

669
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:35,170
And every day I ate lunch at
the washington square park.

670
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,480
It's right by nyu.A lot of film
students hung out there,

671
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,750
and I would just.do wardrobe,
grip,camera,whatever they needed.

672
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,310
It was.

673
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,320
it was the best summer of my life.

674
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,550
But what I didn't know was that entire time.

675
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,990
my dad was dying.

676
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,940
Your family didn't tell you?

677
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,660
They didn't want to distract me,
I guess,from my work.

678
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,670
I would have taken any excuse to quit.

679
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,780
I didn't want to go into finance,
I wanted to make films.

680
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,620
And I was gonna tell him.

681
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,270
After the summer was over.

682
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,320
But then one morning,my mom called
and she said I'd better get home,and.

683
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,340
I couldn't believe.

684
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,450
how frail he looked. How weak he was.

685
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,910
He kept slipping in and out of consciousness,

686
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,210
and then finally,he smiled at me.

687
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,020
He told me to come close.

688
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,220
That's--that's probably why the
breathing was so hard for me,

689
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,170
that night.

690
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,430
And the last words he said to me,.

691
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,620
he could barely speak

692
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,680
And when I looked up,and I saw the priest,

693
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,370
I knew he was dying.

694
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,590
What things did he say to you?

695
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,790
He said I would always be his angel,

696
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,620
and that I was just so much like him.

697
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,210
What else?

698
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,470
Think.

699
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,900
I would do great things.

700
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,270
I would never let him down.

701
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,300
But I did let him down.

702
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,910
I lost my scholarship.

703
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,240
I've given up completely on everything
that he would have wanted for me,.

704
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,250
everything he cared about

705
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,850
Kylie.

706
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,150
he cared about you.

707
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,950
He wouldn't be proud of me making horror films!

708
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,290
Do you like making horror films?

709
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,170
More than anything.

710
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,700
Well,I'm pretty darn sure he'd be impressed
with you making horror films.

711
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,060
No,not dad. You knew him.He's...

712
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,570
yeah,I knew him.

713
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,960
Who do you think it was that convinced
me to write books about voodoo?

714
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,020
Not my father.

715
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,710
Yes,your father,my friend ben told me,

716
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,770
and I'm only mildly paraphrasing here,

717
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,820
he said,"rick,if I had half the passion
for numbers that you have for shrunken heads,

718
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,800
"I would run,I wouldn't walk,
to the nearest convention of the dead.

719
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,000
" And that's what I did,kylie.

720
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,040
That's what he meant that day.

721
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,720
That's what he was trying to say to you,

722
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,430
that if you find your passion,
you'll do great things.

723
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,850
Don't you see that?

724
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,840
It worked.

725
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,120
She did it.

726
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,280
She figured out what was holding her back.

727
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,840
Yeah.

728
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,120
Now how about you?

729
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,190
This was about kylie,
about her following her dream.

730
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,270
I'm--I'm done.

731
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,770
Is this.

732
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,350
is toby here?

733
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,580
Yes.

734
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,830
I think there's something he'd like to say to you.

735
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,260
Oh,no,there isn'T.

736
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,520
Is he hiding?

737
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,740
He doesn't like it when the camera's on him.

738
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,080
This could be your last
chance to ever talk to her.

739
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,160
Go for it.

740
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,900
Face your fears.

741
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,210
It's funny,because my whole life,

742
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,630
I tried to be invisible.

743
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,820
Now I'd give anything
for her to be able to see me.

744
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,780
He wishes that you could see him right now.

745
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,030
Tell him I can.

746
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,730
Really?

747
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,610
It's that angle 2 shot.

748
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,130
we did.

749
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,890
At the beach.

750
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,220
With the guy and the girl.

751
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,190
It's sunset,and they were so afraid
to tell each other how they felt.

752
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,440
And the world was coming to an end.

753
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,350
Tell her I remember.

754
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh,man.

755
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,110
Look at that.

756
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,140
He sees the light.

757
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,030
Tell her I'll save her a good seat.

758
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,690
Who are you?

759
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,470
What do you want?

760
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,220
Melinda!

761
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,210
Hey,what's up?

762
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,350
- What's going on?
- I just had the worst dream.

763
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,570
Are you ok? That's crazy

764
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,850
No,it was so real.

765
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,900
It's like it actually happened.

766
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,280
There was this strange man coming towards me,
and he had on a mask.

767
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,480
The guy in the horror flick.

768
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,750
No,this was real.

769
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,290
- Honey,it's just a dream.
- No.

770
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,060
This happened.

771
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,970
This was a memory.

772
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,070
When I was younger.

773
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,170
this happened to me.

774
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,180
Hey,come here.
