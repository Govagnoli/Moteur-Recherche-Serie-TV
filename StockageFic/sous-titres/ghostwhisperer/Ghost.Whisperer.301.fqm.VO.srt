1
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:03,721
-We're getting ready.
-For what?

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:04,782
For what's coming.

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,381
He's been planning this
for quite some time.

4
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,777
We're blocking
the light.

5
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:11,806
No, this is bigger
than just him.

6
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,648
It's time for you
to know who you are.

7
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,912
And to know
who your brother is.

8
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,890
He said i have a brother.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,265
Who said this? Who told
you you have a brother?

10
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,033
My father.

11
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:46,962
No, i don't think so.

12
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,630
Definitely a concussion.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,413
So she may feel confused
or a little dizzy.

14
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:55,253
We're talking about an injury that's
only a couple of days old, so...

15
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,433
Long-term?

16
00:00:56,433 --> 00:01:00,196
Barring any second impact,
she'll be fine. Really.

17
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,359
Look, just hang out,
you know,

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,508
until i make sure the pictures
are ok, then you can go.

19
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:05,631
Thanks, doc.

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,658
No problem.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,231
Are you ok?

22
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,665
Yeah, i'm just tired.

23
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:13,721
I almost lost you
up in that field.

24
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,575
If it wasn't for those kids...

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,794
I don't know if i could
ever thank them enough.

26
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,028
We gotta
talk about this.

27
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:27,360
What is there to talk about?

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,977
I told you everything
that i saw.

29
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,309
Yeah, but what
does it mean?

30
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:31,996
Do you really think
it was your father

31
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:32,588
in the light?

32
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:34,609
If he's dead, i have
to find out what happened.

33
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,444
And if he was
telling the truth...

34
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,381
That you have a brother.

35
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:40,223
What if it is gabriel?

36
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,256
Well, then
we'll deal with it.

37
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,739
He hasn't been
anywhere in grandview.

38
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,165
He's disappeared again.

39
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:50,762
Oh, melinda, jim, sorry.

40
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,181
We'll have to take
those x-rays again,

41
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,979
there was some kind
of exposure problem.

42
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,172
It'll just take a second.

43
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,334
So, john, let's just
reset and we'll do

44
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,571
that first series again.

45
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,327
Then start
with the next three.

46
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,719
I'll give you a hand.
ok.

~~The Underneath~~

49
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:55,519
That was
the best concert

50
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,396
i ever went to.

51
00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:59,342
Hi, mom, it's me.

52
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,366
Um, i just got back
from the doctor

53
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,574
and everything looks good.

54
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:05,007
I do need
to talk to you, though.

55
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,139
It's kind of important,
so call me. Bye.

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,508
Here, it's been in and out
of so many attics and basements.

57
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,823
I've lost track. I was gonna
just chuck it, but...

58
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,484
Oh, never chuck.
chucking is bad.

59
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,905
Look.

60
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,106
Well, there's a lot
of cool stuff, i guess.

61
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,565
Are you kidding?
this stuff is great.

62
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,753
Yeah. Yeah, it all
belonged to my father.

63
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,730
Are you sure that you
want to part with this?

64
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,361
I mean, it all looks
pretty personal.

65
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,985
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know,
my parents died when

66
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:32,705
i was pretty young,

67
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,470
so i didn't really know them.

68
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,696
I don't even know most of the
people in those pictures, so...

69
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,581
-Oh, i'm so sorry.
-oh, don't be.

70
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,730
Don't be. I don't spend
much time in the past.

71
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,548
I work in one direction,
and that's forward.

72
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:46,472
So how does this work?
like consignment?

73
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:48,730
Yeah, we'll
inventory everything,

74
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,693
get some prices,

75
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,351
figure out how
we want to present it,

76
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:53,243
and then we'll call you
when things start to move.

77
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:56,166
Great, that's awesome.
um, let me give you my number.

78
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,056
Oh, great.

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,331
Just ask
for jennifer billings.

80
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:00,778
Here you go.
thank you.

81
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:01,808
And talk to you soon?

82
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,951
Yeah, probably by the end
of next week.

83
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,701
-Great. Thank you.
-Thanks.

84
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,959
What's up with you?

85
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:13,593
Nothing.

86
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,515
Hey, why don't you
take the trunk downstairs,

87
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,594
and then i can do
the inventory on it later.

88
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,989
Ok, well, just let me
go through these returns

89
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:22,895
and then
i'll bring it down.

90
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,746
Yeah, why don't we just
get it out of the way,

91
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,653
you know?

92
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:30,346
Just bring it downstairs,

93
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:32,643
and that way no one will look
through it before we're ready.

94
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,619
Are you all right?

95
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:34,962
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

96
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm just trying to get
everything organized.

97
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,481
Surprise!

98
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,073
Come on!

99
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,325
In recognition
of your heroic acts,

100
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,257
which saved the lives
of many of grandview's children,

101
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:59,927
the town council presents
you with this plaque.

102
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,916
I don't know
what to say.

103
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,539
I don't really
want to say anything.

104
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,499
Thanks, everybody.
Melinda really

105
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,768
appreciates it.

106
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,073
Let's have
some cake, ok?

107
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,273
All right!

108
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,561
Ok, can i just, uh,
get one with everybody?

109
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,483
Can you get me
out of here?

110
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:13,552
I gotta go to work.

111
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:15,041
How about you?
Lunch?

112
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,040
If it's a lunch that
involves food, yeah, i'm in.

113
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:23,822
You know, that night
when i thought you died,

114
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:27,330
i mean, i...Thought you died
right in front of me.

115
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,714
Every feeling inside of me
just dropped.

116
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,826
All of them. All the things i
wish i could have said to you,

117
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,947
i was never going to be able
to say to you.

118
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:39,150
Did we get
the check?

119
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:43,071
Oh, good. That is mine. I asked you.

120
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,605
Ok, well, in that case,
i'm still hungry.

121
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,173
So what do you think
me seeing this door means?

122
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,201
I mean, it had, like,
a viewport

123
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,490
and i could hear strange
noises coming from behind it,

124
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,815
like, wood falling
and beams crashing.

125
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,749
Sounds like me
doing home repairs.

126
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,865
What could it symbolize?

127
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,502
Well, doors usually mean
endings or beginnings.

128
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:04,860
Certain mythologies believe
that the way to the truth

129
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,312
is by choosing the right door.

130
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:09,031
Or maybe that's a game show
i'm thinking of.

131
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,546
Something else weird
happened to me

132
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:12,524
at the doctor's.

133
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,921
There was a face
behind mine in the x-ray.

134
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,050
Do you think
it was your father?

135
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,093
I don't know.

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,891
Even your x-rays are haunted.

137
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,654
That's hardcore.

138
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,472
When was the last time
you saw your father?

139
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,750
When i was 11.

140
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,516
What about
gabriel?

141
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,756
Nowhere to be found.

142
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,279
Which proves
that this town

143
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,348
is too small for 2
people that see ghosts.

144
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:41,821
Right now i'm just gonna concentrate
on what happened to my dad.

145
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,037
How are you
going to do that?

146
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,656
Guess i have to talk
to my mother.

147
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,282
If she's calmed down enough
since the accident.

148
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:48,977
Well, don't you think
she would have told you

149
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,145
if she saw him?

150
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,136
Not necessarily.

151
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,070
My mom has spent
her whole life

152
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,739
trying to deny
that she could see spirits.

153
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,613
I just found out she
could see them 2 years ago.

154
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:57,834
She hates talking
about my father,

155
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,471
and she hates talking
about anything

156
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,861
that has to do
with her real feelings.

157
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,101
So it should be
a productive visit,

158
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:02,652
all in all.

159
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,715
-Some kind of family, huh?
-you should see mine.

160
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:05,914
All they want to do
is talk about

161
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,156
their feelings. And 
they were the happy ones.

162
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:10,129
I guess we all have
our haunted x-rays,

163
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,239
one way
or the other.

164
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,167
What?

165
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,807
Do you see that?

166
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,002
I don't see anything.

167
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:21,864
What-- what is it?

168
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,244
I'm not sure.

169
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,864
Uh, i gotta go.

170
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:38,857
Yeah, i'll call you later.

171
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:39,851
Ok.

172
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,512
I'm just asking, when is
the last time you saw dad?

173
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,116
I don't remember.

174
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,227
Mom, come on.

175
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,761
I'm serious.

176
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,594
I barely think of him
if i can help it.

177
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:00,974
I know, but this
is important.

178
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:01,621
Why?

179
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,822
Would you know if
anything happened to him?

180
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,483
What are you talking about?

181
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:06,796
I think dad's dead.

182
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,659
How do you know that?

183
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,438
Because i saw him.

184
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:18,899
When i was...

185
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,239
When i died on the field.

186
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,786
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

187
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:26,012
I'm telling you now.

188
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,036
And he said
i have a brother.

189
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,704
Melinda...

190
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,715
This is the second
serious head injury

191
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:34,360
you have had.

192
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,688
No, don't you do that!

193
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,338
I am sorry, i'm just
saying that it is possible

194
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,136
that your mind
is creating all of this.

195
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:41,601
Mom, would you
please stop it?

196
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,325
I know what i saw
and what i heard.

197
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,431
Now, i am being haunted
by someone or something

198
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,245
and i think it has
something to do with him,

199
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,097
because he's trying
to tell me something.

200
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,238
Tell you what?

201
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:50,980
I don't know.

202
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,132
But i-- i think it has to
do with the underground.

203
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,792
I don't know
what you want from me.

204
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,100
I want you
to talk to me.

205
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,483
Ok? Do you think
that's he dead?

206
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,602
Do i have a brother?

207
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,923
If you're asking me
did i have a second child, no.

208
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:10,447
And far as your father goes,
how would i know?

209
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,566
He walked out on us
years ago.

210
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,578
It's not exactly like
he kept in touch.

211
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,599
Have you seen him?

212
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:19,968
His spirit?

213
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,245
No.

214
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,319
Mom, is there something
that you're not telling

215
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,442
me that could help?

216
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:29,665
Do you know
where he was living?

217
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:31,599
What's the last thing
that you rember about him?

218
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:36,133
The last thing
i remember about him

219
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,436
is how hard you cried
when he left...

220
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:41,037
For days.

221
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:44,456
Don't romanticize him,
melinda.

222
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:46,517
He doesn't deserve it.

223
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:42,322
Hey, what's this?

224
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:45,134
I had a customer today
who's looking to sell

225
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,247
a trunk of old stuff.

226
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,415
It made me think
of my old stuff.

227
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,276
Maybe there's a clue in here,
something i missed.

228
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,117
How'd it go
with your mother?

229
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:52,881
Full metal lockdown,
as expected.

230
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:55,821
Look at you.

231
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:58,713
Oh, how beautiful.
those eyes.

232
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:01,327
I just
keep looking at him,

233
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,189
thinking, "what is
underneath that smile?"

234
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,710
what does he know, and if
he's trying to tell me

235
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,656
something right now, then why 
doesn't he just come to me and tell me?

236
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:09,628
Am i being obsessive?

237
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,158
Yeah, but
with good reason.

238
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:13,766
Your father dying's
a big deal, no matter

239
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,916
how you felt about him.

240
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,069
My dad was always
this villain in my life,

241
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,600
and now, all of a sudden,
he's gone,

242
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,856
or at least physically gone,

243
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,947
and, i don't know,

244
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:24,629
i just feel like
there's this big hole.

245
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,057
You didn't really think
he was gonna come back, did you?

246
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:29,067
I used to fantasize about it
when i was a kid.

247
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,357
You know, that he'd show up
one day after school

248
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,467
and have this explanation
of why he'd left.

249
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,866
You know, like he'd been
kidnapped by spies

250
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,300
and they'd burned all the
letters he was gonna send to me

251
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,616
and then he'd finally escape
and fought his way back to me.

252
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:42,808
Hmm. That's funny.

253
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,780
Your mom thought you
might romanticize him.

254
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:49,171
You know, it's hard
to deal with the truth

255
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:49,948
about our parents.

256
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:53,084
That moment you discover
that they're just people,

257
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,411
flawed people,
it's painful.

258
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:58,874
Flawed is a kind description
of my dad.

259
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,899
But, still, if he would have
just come back...

260
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,612
I would have believed
anything he said to me.

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,246
And i could have forgiven him
for anything, you know?

262
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:15,318
I just...I wanted my dad.

263
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,732
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,649
I'm sorry he hurt you
so much, but...

265
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,814
Think about it
this way--

266
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,764
you have this
beautiful heart,

267
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,850
and he couldn't do
anything to change that.

268
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:35,086
Wow. That was kind of heavy.

269
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,066
Yeah, i'm kind of
exhausted now.

270
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,763
Are you gonna
come to bed?

271
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:41,768
Yeah, soon.

272
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:36,176
It was you!

273
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,841
It was you!

274
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,749
Mel?

275
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,759
It's all right.

276
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,428
You're ok.
there's nothing there.

277
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,145
Jim saw this, too?

278
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,967
No, he heard me yelling,

279
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,268
and by the time
he came out,

280
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,811
everything was back
to normal again.

281
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,334
What?

282
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,693
Nothing.

283
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:07,331
Do you think
i'm making this up?

284
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:09,624
No, i do not think
you're making this up.

285
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,690
I'm trying to wrap
my mind around it.

286
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,589
It's just...You know--

287
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:14,542
hard to believe.

288
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,113
A little, i guess.

289
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,389
Well, at least you're
honest. Gotta love that.

290
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,868
Ok, so you think your dad

291
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,580
is connected
to all this somehow.

292
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,971
Mmm, i'm not sure, but i won't
know until i figure out how he died.

293
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,067
And your mom was no help?

294
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,129
That would be a no.

295
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,349
And every time i go online,
i get thousands of hits.

296
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,100
Apparently, tom gordon
is a very popular name.

297
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,926
Is there anything i can do?

298
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:39,877
You're doing it.

299
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,870
Thanks for listening
to the rantings

300
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,507
of your very weird
and haunted friend.

301
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,995
Not to cut short
said rantings.

302
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:50,127
Um, do you mind if i go
meet ned at the dentist?

303
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,582
No, go ahead.
thanks.

304
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,092
Hey, you want anything?

305
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:53,938
Ooh, a muffin.

306
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,684
Oh, healthy or disgusting?

307
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,312
Mild disgust.

308
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,944
Mmm! That's my girl.

309
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,888
Oh, hello.
feel free to browse.

310
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,381
Let me know if i can
help you with anything.

311
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,389
You don't remember me?

312
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,325
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

313
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,550
I was the one taking
pictures the other day

314
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,769
when you got
your little plaque.

315
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:16,772
Right. What were
the pictures for?

316
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:19,001
-And shame the devil.
-I'm sorry?

317
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,257
And shame the devil,
the blog.

318
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,128
Oh, right, yeah.

319
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,970
All the dirt
on driscoll county.

320
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,833
My husband loves that
blog. You write for it?

321
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,564
-I'm it.
-Shame the devil?

322
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:28,810
Yeah, it's like
from an old proverb.

323
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,679
You know, "tell the truth
and shame the devil."

324
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,880
Right. Shakespeare.
Henry IV.

325
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,584
Um, yeah. Anyways, i have
something i want to show you.

326
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,780
These are the pictures
i took the other day.

327
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,225
Now, i rember
everybody who was there.

328
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,867
I got a quote about you
from each person.

329
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:49,255
But this dude...This dude
i do not rember,

330
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,708
and he only shows up
for like a second,

331
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,949
and he's not in
any other shots.

332
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,652
Well, maybe it's a--
it's a reflection

333
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:57,987
from somebody
walking by outside.

334
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:00,806
A reflection?
Are you serious?

335
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,774
Ok, a light ray
on a reflective surface

336
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,067
is always reflected at angle
equal to the incident angle.

337
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,582
And the angle of incidence

338
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,634
is totly equal
to the angle of reflection.

339
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,008
And if, and only if--

340
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,314
Ok, you know what,
moving on from the whole

341
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,141
reflection idea,

342
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,710
maybe it's just somebody
that we didn't see.

343
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,286
-Yeah, but it gets weirder.
-Really?

344
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,159
Yeah, i enhanced these
and turned then into negatives

345
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,372
to get a better contrast.

346
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:24,359
Check this out.

347
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,983
Would you
send me these?

348
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,740
Are you sure
this isn't a reflection?

349
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,948
Yeah, i can say that i'm reasonably
sure that is not a reflection.

350
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,539
Maybe it was someone
that was there but you

351
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,414
forgot they were there--

352
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:47,661
Ok, it's a ghost,
get over it.

353
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,331
Sweet! I mean,
that's great.

354
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,661
That's photographic
evidence.

355
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,304
But, wait, why didn't
you see this on the day?

356
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,092
I don't know.

357
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,426
Why is he so dirty?

358
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,861
Whoa. What,
you think?

359
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:04,864
I don't know what to think.

360
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,704
I mean, the height
and weight, i guess,

361
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:07,816
is sort of similar.

362
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,749
Maybe. I mean, would
your father have a reason

363
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:10,824
for being
this dirty?

364
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,156
Was he secretly
a chimney sweep?

365
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,256
All right, i just...

366
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:15,682
All i know is that
all these hauntings

367
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,282
have something to do
with things underground.

368
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,835
You know, like, spirits
rising from the depths.

369
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:22,571
Oh, i hate spirits
rising from the depths.

370
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:23,605
Don't get me started!

371
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,617
What'd you tell the
blogger kid about this?

372
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,867
I just played dumb,
but i don't really think

373
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:28,746
he's gonna let it go.

374
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,556
Especially after
he showed me this.

375
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:37,676
What do you think it is?

376
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:40,731
A straight, serious
answer, please.

377
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,339
I got nothin'.

378
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,672
All of these creepy things
around my head, this,

379
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,563
the man's face
in my x-ray...

380
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:48,471
Hold on a minute.

381
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,515
Is that shadowy thing
on your face all the time?

382
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:52,946
Or...

383
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,223
Were they just there
on the day

384
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,526
that it happened?

385
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,499
I don't know.

386
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,405
Ay, ok. Look, i'm going
to, uh, get a shot of you,

387
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,153
and then i'll add the same enhancements

388
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:05,416
that the blogger
kid did,

389
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,827
then we'll see if
that stuff is still

390
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,714
on your face, ok?

391
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:08,978
-Ok.
-All right.

392
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,832
Say, "spirit rising
from the depths."

393
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:18,490
Have a good night.

394
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,517
Good-night.
see you tomorrow.

395
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,302
You killed her.

396
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,914
You killed her!

397
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,202
Wait, so now you're saying
it's not your father

398
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:40,924
haunting you?

399
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,454
I saw the ghost,
and it's definitely

400
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:43,442
not my father.

401
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,143
And i saw the trunk in
the haunting last night.

402
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,846
How can that be?
it's a solid object.

403
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,293
It hasn't moved since i went through it.

404
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:50,114
I don't really worry
about the physics of it.

405
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,407
I just see
what they show me.

406
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:54,107
Which means the ghost
is attached to this trunk.

407
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:01,416
Here.

408
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,284
This is the ghost
that's been haunting me,

409
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:06,121
and it's not my father.

410
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:08,562
It's jennifer billings'
father.

411
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:10,167
But why?

412
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,305
I think he's got me confused
with someone else.

413
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,760
Who?

414
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:25,296
Don't tell me you sold it
already and now you want more.

415
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,273
Oh, i would love more,
although we haven't even

416
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,247
put it on display yet.
Sometime this week.

417
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:31,471
I still can't believe
that you're willing

418
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,585
to part with it all.

419
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,236
Yeah, well,
like i said,

420
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:36,533
it just feels like
it's somebody else's life, you know?

421
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,185
You know, i was looking
through the pictures,

422
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:39,699
and i saw your father.

423
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,598
Or at least, i'm assuming
he was your father?

424
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:43,938
Yeah. Yeah, he was
a handsome dude.

425
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:47,743
The thing is, i think it's
possible that i've met him.

426
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh, no.

427
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,733
No, he, uh, died in 1982.

428
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:53,149
Oh. Sorry.

429
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:55,210
Do you mind
if i ask how?

430
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:57,299
Why?

431
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,490
Well, i don't mean to pry,

432
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,558
it's just when i was
looking at the photos,

433
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:01,957
there was something
familiar to me,

434
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,680
that maybe i'd, you know,
known him somehow.

435
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,573
Well, it was a work.
there was an accident.

436
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,268
I was 5, so i don't
really rember much.

437
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:11,737
What about your mother?

438
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,275
She died the same day.

439
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,428
I was an instant orphan.

440
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:22,000
Just add water
and new parents.

441
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:24,894
The state took me,
but i was really lucky.

442
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:26,242
I was adopted
right away.

443
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,916
Dimples or something,
i don't know.

444
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,706
He really loved you.

445
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:34,482
What?

446
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,660
Your father. I could see it
in the pictures.

447
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,173
How could they
have loved me?

448
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,514
They-- they really
didn't even get

449
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:41,558
a chance to know me.

450
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:42,647
The way he was smiling.

451
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,758
And the way he was
holding your hand.

452
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,977
Beaming, really.

453
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:56,116
Why are you doing this?

454
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,690
I'm sorry, i didn't--

455
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,696
um, fred,

456
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:00,850
could you just take
the counter

457
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,772
for a second?

458
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:02,766
I'm on it.

459
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,987
Hey, jennifer!

460
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:08,311
Jennifer, i am so sorry.

461
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,729
No, no, no,
it's just, god,

462
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,420
welcome to my pity party,
you know?

463
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,839
Oh, i just hate crying.

464
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,123
It's hard to get through
life without a few tears.

465
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:23,105
Well, let's just say
i frontloaded all of mine.

466
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:25,328
Have you always
had the trunk?

467
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,797
I got it when i was 18.

468
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:32,014
They put it in a trust for me,
even a little bit of money.

469
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:35,020
It's funny. I can remember
their voices so clearly.

470
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,382
I can remember lying in bed
at night and listening to them

471
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,302
and feeling just so safe,

472
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:43,965
but i couldn't, um, i
couldn't rember their faces.

473
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:46,657
But you saw the pictures
in the trunk.

474
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,131
Yeah, yeah. I just...

475
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,848
I never found one
of my mother.

476
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:55,812
There's the one of me and
my father, that one picture,

477
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:58,426
that one where
his big, beefy hand

478
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,512
is holding mine
like a fragile little twig.

479
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,740
And this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

480
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,528
Sometimes i swear
i can feel that.

481
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:12,444
You know? I can feel his hand
take mine like, out of nowhere.

482
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,977
Doesn't sound crazy.

483
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:16,684
Not really.

484
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,900
Look, i just
need to know...

485
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:23,447
Did your dad
die underground?

486
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,257
He worked for the gas company.

487
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,734
He died in the street cave-in
down on the town square.

488
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,148
Cave-in?

489
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,799
I-- i've gotta go.

490
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,692
No, please, is there
anything else that you rember?

491
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:38,426
I remember his voice
the night before he died.

492
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,483
He was talking to my mom in the kitchen,

493
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:42,414
and he was telling her
how much he hated it

494
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,307
down there.

495
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,901
He said he thought
it was haunted.

496
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,323
Hi. What can i do for you?

497
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,472
Uh, i was just looking
for some information

498
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:26,142
about something.

499
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:29,724
Information on what?
I go on lunch in 5 minutes.

500
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,964
Yeah, he's always like that.
don't let him intimidate you.

501
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,740
Uh, it's actually about
something that happened

502
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,919
25 years ago.

503
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,705
And?

504
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,835
And i was told
to come here.

505
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,556
Look, this isn't a library.

506
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,552
We're still trying
to get things computerized.

507
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:52,207
Put your request in writing,
give me 2 to 3 weeks,

508
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,329
i'll see what i can do.

509
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,781
It's unbelievable.
this guy is just

510
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:57,012
the laziest son of
a bitch on the planet.

511
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,617
I mean, if i were
still working here--

512
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,822
You're not.
Um, this is actually

513
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,516
a specific event.

514
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:04,125
Like, 1982.

515
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,997
I can go
and find it if--

516
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:10,047
Name, address, date you're
looking for, phone number--

517
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:11,679
See you in 2
to 3 weeks.

518
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,969
-Yeah.
-Right.

519
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,019
I knew i liked you.

520
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,281
He's going to lunch.

521
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:35,210
You have to help me
find something.

522
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,442
Yeah, well, good luck finding
anything in this place.

523
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:39,890
Why is it such a mess?

524
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,284
Ah, it's not like
they don't try.

525
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:42,550
Even the lazy guy.

526
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,398
But somehow, things just end
up getting messed up anyways.

527
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,307
Of course, no one knows
this archive like me.

528
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,052
What are you gonna do?

529
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:52,250
Yeah, whatever. I just
have to find anything

530
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,934
that i can

531
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,907
on the street collapse
of 1982.

532
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,505
You think
that's how it works?

533
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:01,084
You just snap your fingers
and we do your bidding?

534
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,464
What?

535
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:05,258
They told me that you
might come around here...

536
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:07,336
Asking questions.

537
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:09,737
Who told you?

538
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:13,839
You are so...
over your head.

539
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:22,537
If i were you,
i would leave. Now.

540
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,953
And i really
wouldn't come back.

541
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,933
Ever.

542
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,698
Daddy!

543
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:35,983
Why did you leave?

544
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:38,576
I had to go, honey.

545
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:41,821
It didn't mean
i wanted to.

546
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,233
I missed you so much.

547
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:47,488
Did you miss me?

548
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,706
Every day.

549
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:51,679
I knew it.

550
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,130
I knew it.

551
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,206
Why did you leave us?

552
00:28:56,206 --> 00:28:58,253
You'll understand someday.

553
00:28:58,253 --> 00:28:59,922
Why won't you
help me now?

554
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,308
Because you have
to find out for yourself.

555
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,213
You always used
to give me a hint.

556
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:07,056
With every riddle,
you'd give me

557
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,271
one hint.

558
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:10,070
Please.

559
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:14,065
Ok. But just one.

560
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,170
*** Age 15. ***

561
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,825
What does that mean?

562
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,692
You already know.

563
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,215
I have to go now.

564
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:26,849
No! Dad, wait.

565
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:27,813
Don't go.

566
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,306
Oh, damn it!

567
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:15,115
Come on!

568
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,303
You were told to stay away, weren't you?

569
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,660
I don't take orders
from ghosts!

570
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,018
Oh, but...He is
very angry with you,

571
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:35,770
this one.

572
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,421
He wants to take you down with him.

573
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,187
I think
i'll let him.

574
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:42,460
You know, there are
a lot of very angry

575
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,940
people down here.

576
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,709
I think it's time
i let you meet them.

577
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,284
I'm not afraid of you.

578
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,885
I am not afraid of you!

579
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,177
You will be.

580
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,659
GAS EXPLOSIONS
RIP GRANDVIEW

581
00:31:37,168 --> 00:31:38,915
Mom, i asked you
point blank

582
00:31:38,915 --> 00:31:40,707
if there was anything
you were holding back from me,

583
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:41,479
and you said no.

584
00:31:41,514 --> 00:31:45,152
How could i possibly
know that that one incident

585
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,260
would mean anything
to you?

586
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,693
How about the fact
that you lived in grandview?

587
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:50,450
Did you think that that was
going to mean anything to me?

588
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,841
It was a long time ago.
It didn't matter.

589
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,908
Of course it matters.

590
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,840
I've been in grandview
for, like, 3 years

591
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,310
and you never told me
that you and dad lived there!

592
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,445
I mean, what else
are you hiding?

593
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:01,365
Nothing.

594
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:03,769
How did you get this?

595
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,357
I was led to it.

596
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,912
-By who?
-By dad.

597
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,314
Somehow he's been helping me.

598
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,502
Ok, i see.

599
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:14,124
So he gets
to be the hero,

600
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,626
and i am
the evil mother.

601
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:16,804
Well, at least somebody
is pointing me

602
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:17,948
towards the truth.

603
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:21,759
It was a very
painful time in my life.

604
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,846
Is that what
you want to hear?

605
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:24,318
Is that the truth
you want to know?

606
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,749
You were only
a few years old.

607
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,930
We had been there
less then a year.

608
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,670
I got out.

609
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,923
I never wanted to think about it again.

610
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:32,733
Why not?

611
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,171
What other secrets
are you hiding?

612
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,787
Nothing.

613
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,168
You have to talk to me.

614
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,031
Ok, you were with this guy
the day that he died.

615
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:43,425
What else do you know
about him?

616
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:46,334
Why is he haunting me,
and why is he accusing me

617
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:47,977
of letting someone die?

618
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:56,279
He still thinks
it's 1982.

619
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:01,279
He thinks you're me.

620
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,210
What?

621
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,501
I killed his wife.

622
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:19,448
Mom. Hat the hell
are you talking about?

623
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,159
Your father and i had
just moved to grandview.

624
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,645
I knew that i had this
ability to do this thing.

625
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,672
I was trying to avoid it,
block it--

626
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,690
ok, mom, stop.

627
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:32,833
Tell me what happened.

628
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:39,099
I was running errands.

629
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:42,726
I was still trying
to get to know the town,

630
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:44,944
to get to know the people.

631
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:47,129
There was a gas line break.

632
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:50,318
It happened
deep under the ground.

633
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:34,055
Somebody help!

634
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:38,498
Everybody's dead down there!

635
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,547
Help! Please!

636
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:43,530
Mary!

637
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm ok,
i'm right here!

638
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:47,593
Mary!

639
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:58,780
You see me?

640
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,366
You hear me?

641
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,351
No, i can't. Please.

642
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,405
Am i dead?

643
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,189
Please, please...

644
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,473
Talk to my wife for me.

645
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:15,334
She can't hear me. Please!
i have to talk to her!

646
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,413
Excuse me...

647
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:24,223
Just tell her i'm right here.

648
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,954
Your husband--

649
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:31,402
My-- my husband?
you've seen my husband?

650
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,383
-I'm right here.
-Yes, he's--

651
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:34,837
I just couldn't
tell her her husband

652
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:35,728
was a ghost.

653
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:36,634
He's right here.

654
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,654
She thought i'd meant
he had made it out

655
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:39,375
of the explosion.

656
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,366
Is he all right?

657
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,779
Jennifer, stay here.

658
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:44,681
-Ray! Ray!
-She ran towards the hole.

659
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,165
I-- i should have
stopped her.

660
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,856
She got too close.

661
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,578
Mom, there's no way
you could have known.

662
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,655
I've never learned
to deal with them.

663
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,771
Not the way
your grandmother could,

664
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,918
the way you do.

665
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:20,276
I just can't stand
to feel their pain.

666
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:22,368
It stops me cold.

667
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:27,442
You feel their pain,
and you help them anyway.

668
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:29,901
Is that why
you left grandview?

669
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,599
There were a lot
of reasons.

670
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,853
I can make this
right for you.

671
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,041
Just leave it alone.

672
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:42,598
Just leave me alone.

673
00:36:55,615 --> 00:36:56,608
Professor payne?

674
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,922
Who wants to know?

675
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:01,772
Um, i'm justin yates.
I'm in the emerging

676
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:02,823
technologies program.

677
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,269
I was actually--
actually, i've been

678
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:05,160
to some of your lectures
on the paranormal--

679
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,284
All right.
You had me at "um."

680
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:10,210
What can i do for you,
justin yates?

681
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,313
I, uh, i run
and shame the devil.

682
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,375
The blog?

683
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,532
Yeah. Ok, cool,
so you know it.

684
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,633
Yeah. You have that
rate your professor page.

685
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:19,028
Whoa. Um...

686
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:22,952
Yeah. Scattered
and distracted.

687
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,286
That's what i remember
reading about me.

688
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,849
Ok, uh, i'll make this
quick, then.

689
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,972
I just, uh, wanted
to show you this image

690
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:32,487
i took the other day.

691
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,065
What do you think?

692
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,750
Ahem. I think i look
scattered and distracted. Darn.

693
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,473
No, um, i mean--
i mean this.

694
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,408
Dude, he's like not there
in every other picture,

695
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,161
and he just randomly
appears in these two!

696
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,771
Justin, i'm not one
to stand on ceremony,

697
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,273
but if you
call me "dude" again,

698
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:50,350
i'm gonna have to bounce your
head off of one of these walls.

699
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,475
Sorry. You don't think
this picture means anything?

700
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,792
No. I don't.

701
00:37:57,531 --> 00:38:00,074
You know, uh,
i've been asking around

702
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:01,835
about that antique
chick, melinda.

703
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:04,385
People say a lot of weird
stuff happens in that store.

704
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:04,926
Well...

705
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:08,388
Weird stuff happens
all the time. Everywhere.

706
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,149
Doesn't it? Maybe you have
to get your nose

707
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:11,549
out of the computer screen
to learn that.

708
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:13,565
I have a book for you.

709
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:16,877
I'll tell you what,
justin...

710
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:19,987
I'm gonna do you
a big favor today.

711
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,050
I don't know how much
reading you do

712
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,045
without scrolling,

713
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:27,925
but they did at one time
print words on a page.

714
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:31,443
Here you go.

715
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,217
This book's gonna
change your life.

716
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,431
DEBUNKING OTHERWORLDLY
ACTIVITY

717
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,351
Awesome.

718
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,900
When you die, it's like
time stops moving for you.

719
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,220
Especially when there's
a lot of anger.

720
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,866
It's like you're caught
in some kind of loop.

721
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,084
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

722
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,826
To her,
to my daughter.

723
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,465
Why couldn't
your mother,

724
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:04,791
why couldn't she
do that for me?

725
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,504
She doesn't really accept
what she can do.

726
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,039
But she didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

727
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:12,132
Your wife was frantic
looking for you.

728
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,188
I keep wondering
if she suffered.

729
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,967
What she felt.

730
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,300
What her last
thought was.

731
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,189
I'm sure it was you.

732
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:26,072
Why can't i find her?

733
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,901
Well, if you didn't see her
right away after she died,

734
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,429
she probably crossed over.

735
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,784
And that's a good thing.
She went into the light.

736
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:35,682
I didn't see any light
down there.

737
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:38,572
What did you see?
Your daughter's--

738
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:41,224
I saw things.
I heard things.

739
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,266
It's terrible there
underneath.

740
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:44,533
I don't ever want
to go there again.

741
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:45,756
Yeah, but what did you see?

742
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:46,441
Wait.

743
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,887
My daughter.

744
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,584
She...25 years...

745
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:55,151
She's a grown woman now.

746
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:57,700
You can feel her. That's
probably why you came back

747
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,850
from the underground.

748
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,971
There's only one thing left
for you to do.

749
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,754
He wants you
to know your history,

750
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:10,077
where you came from.

751
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,625
Who the people
in these pictures are.

752
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,544
He wants you
to know your family.

753
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,916
That's when
she was 4.

754
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,766
It was taken
at mt. Kisco.

755
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:23,043
Her mom loved it there.

756
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:26,115
This was taken
at mt. Kisco.

757
00:40:26,115 --> 00:40:27,854
It's one of your mother's
favorite places.

758
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:30,628
Oh.
And that's her uncle jerry.

759
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,004
He used to come home
from florida once a year,

760
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:34,975
and he'd always bring her
those funny sunglasses.

761
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:35,917
This is your uncle jerry.

762
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,876
He lived in florida,
but he would come visit

763
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:38,824
once a year,

764
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:40,915
and he gave you those
funny sunglasses.

765
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:45,609
How could you know this?

766
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,043
How do you know?

767
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:49,074
It's a long story.

768
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,744
Let's finish this first.

769
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,085
Tell her to go to the
last page of that album.

770
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,664
He wants you to go to the
last page of this album.

771
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,407
It folds out.

772
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,127
You were 3 months old
in that picture.

773
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,807
Your mom couldn't
keep her eyes off of you.

774
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:59,749
Um, you were 3 months old
in this picture.

775
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:03,519
And your mother could not
take her eyes off you.

776
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,658
Ray billings
crossed over.

777
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:43,799
He understands
what happened.

778
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,230
He doesn't
blame you anymore.

779
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:49,809
I know what
you think of me.

780
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,414
That i'm wrong to try
and shut this out.

781
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:54,657
I don't judge you, mom.

782
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:57,341
I just want the truth
from you.

783
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,613
It's the only thing
you owe me,

784
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,301
that we owe each other.

785
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,035
You want the truth?

786
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:08,931
You need to leave
grandview.

787
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,113
What? Why?

788
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,715
It'll hurt you.

789
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,578
It's not a good place
for people like

790
00:43:15,578 --> 00:43:16,600
you and me.

791
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,016
No, mom.

792
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:21,500
I'm not running away,
not from what i can do

793
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,265
and not from where
i make my life.

794
00:43:29,078 --> 00:43:30,716
I knew you wouldn't.
