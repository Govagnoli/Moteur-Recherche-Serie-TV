00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,719
<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

3
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:15,226
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

4
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:17,318
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:21,404
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

6
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:25,374
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,277
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

8
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:30,801
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

9
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:39,037
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

10
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,172
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted one.

11
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,897
It's very southern gothic.
I love it.

12
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,733
- Can I borrow this, too?
- Good luck lifting it.

13
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:54,223
Just kidding.
These lamps'll be fine.

14
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:59,131
I'm showing a house this afternoon,
and it's decorated like a monastery,

15
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:01,642
so I just wanna add
a little color. Oop.

16
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,861
- Careful.
- Got it. Ah.

17
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,442
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

18
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,843
Melinda, this is amy and jordan.
They're the couple I told you about.

19
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:13,412
They just bought
the house on gardner.

20
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,213
They're in the process of decorating,
so I told them about your store.

21
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:18,481
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,593
You don't sell
plumbing supplies, do you?

23
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:23,961
I have some 19th century faucets,
but that's about it.

24
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:26,612
- Why?
- The plumbing in that house is nuts.

25
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,610
I- it's like the water
pressure's schizophrenic.

26
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,161
Yeah. Sometimes water just comes gushing
out, even when we haven't got the faucet on.

27
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:38,213
- Make them leave.
- Well, it's not just that.

28
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:40,211
The lights just flicker
for no reason.

29
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,513
Look, I'll come out there, and I'll
bring a plumber and an electrician.

30
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:45,643
Go away.

31
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,772
Hey, maybe I can help.

32
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:55,842
My husband and i had some troubles when
we first moved in, and he's pretty handy.

33
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:58,331
Why don't I come by tomorrow, and
I will take care of everything.

34
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,803
Yeah, I'll come with you,
and I can help you decorate.

35
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:05,843
I'd love that. And delia was right.
I love your place. It's gorgeous...

36
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,620
Seems to be working
perfectly.

37
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,631
Yesterday there was
water pouring out everywhere,

38
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,270
and neither of us
had turned it on.

39
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,231
Let me show you what's going on with the
tub upstairs. It hasn't stopped dripping.

40
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,790
You know, I knew this
was gonna happen.

41
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,263
As soon as she gets here,
everything works great.

42
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:21,730
- You wanna go sit outside?
- Sure.

43
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:29,130
- How did you end up in grandview?
- Well, we were living

44
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,813
in a tiny apartment in the city, and
last christmas, we drove up to hamilton

45
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,542
to see jordan's parents,
and we passed through here,

46
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,223
and I just fell in love
with the town.

47
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:41,521
You know, jordan's a music producer,
so he can pretty much work from anywhere.

48
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,880
What are you gonna do
with all this space?

49
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,990
I'm ready to start a family.
I love kids.

50
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,501
Jim, my husband, he loves them, too,
but I don't know if I'm ready.

51
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:57,773
Ohh. There is something
wrong with this pump.

52
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,430
I'd hate to tell jordan
there's a problem.

53
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:28,833
- Why?
- 'Cause he'll try to fix it.

54
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,601
He's great
with music, lousy with tools.

55
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:35,173
Just, I love this house, and I'm
so glad to be here.

56
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,173
I'm glad
that you're here, too.

57
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,601
Hey, how about you guys
being our first dinner guests?

58
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:41,850
- Sure. When?
- Tonight.

59
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,113
Nothing big. Just some pasta
and some wine.

60
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:47,592
Oh. Um, that sounds great.
I'll ask jim.

61
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,101
All right.
Well, cheers to that.

62
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,090
Well,
what do you think?

63
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,690
I think you
look beautiful

64
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,663
But for the record, you looked beautiful
in the first 2 dresses.

65
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,363
The earrings are too much,
aren't they?

66
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:16,050
No, no. They're fine.

67
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,721
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, it's no big deal

68
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:21,393
It's just I really like this couple,
and I wanna make a good impression.

69
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:24,253
Besides, we don't get to go out
with other people much anymore.

70
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,821
No, not since andrea.

71
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:31,003
- Did you wrap the cake?
- I have wrapped the cake,

72
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:34,662
and, you know, I solved the global
warming thing while I was waiting.

73
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,060
All right, I'm ready.
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,540
No, you're right.
We should go out more,

75
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:43,191
socialize more. Looking forward
to meeting new friends.

76
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:46,962
- Did I tell you that there's a ghost, too?
- No. You didn't mention that.

77
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:51,520
Yeah. She's just a child, 6 or 7.
I saw her standing by the pool.

78
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:55,701
Ok, are you more excited about meeting
new friends or a new ghost?

79
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:59,721
That's not funny.
She really needs my help.

80
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:05,220
The earrings are too much.

81
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:17,591
- Jordan!, come and join us.
- I will, as soon I can.

82
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:21,753
Wait until you taste jordan's cooking. He
literally could open up his own restaurant.

83
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:25,833
I fully support that.
Lento's on the square, we're over.

84
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:30,813
Right, honey?

85
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:34,190
What? Oh, uh, yes. Grandview is not
exactly the gourmet capital of the world.

86
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:38,861
- Oh, what kind of music do you guys
like to listen to? - You choose.

87
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:46,010
This is one of jordan's artists. I want to
listen to it and let me know what you think.

88
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:52,212
Turn it off!

89
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:57,312
Um, could you... could you turn
it down just a little bit?

90
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:58,931
Sure. Of course.

91
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,113
You see, this is what happens
when delia's not around.

92
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,370
- What's going on out there?!
- Be quiet!

93
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,682
- Jordan!?
- Come here!

94
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:21,502
- This is insane. It won't shut off.
- Got a flashlight?

95
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,990
Maybe we can turn off
the main water supply.

96
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,291
Um, it's in the basement to the left
of the stairs in the entryway.

97
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:27,992
I see what I can do.

98
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,322
- Where'd the little girl go?
- I'm looking.

99
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:39,071
Gonna go find the
main circuit breaker.

100
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,431
Go away!

101
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:47,021
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Who are you?

102
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,281
- My name is melinda.
- Please be quiet.

103
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,050
My mother's upstairs sleeping.

104
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,030
- She's not upstairs. There's no one up there.
- Yes, she is.

105
00:07:57,068 --> 00:08:01,143
- She's been up there all day.
- It's just you here, but I can help you.

106
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,520
- Found it.
- Melinda, jim, where are you?

107
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,580
Uh, we're in here.

108
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:16,290
- That was freaky. I am so sorry.
- Well, at least now we have witnesses.

109
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:18,291
Tell delia we're not
completely insane.

110
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,510
Who the hell is that?

111
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:31,922
- Hey. Come back here!
- Baby, let him go.

112
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,962
How come we can
all see him?

113
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,292
That one's not a ghost.

114
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:53,371
It's just so hard not to tell them that
they have a ghost in their house.

115
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,370
Maybe you should.

116
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,841
Oh, but they like us so much.
If I tell them what I can do,

117
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:02,113
it'll change everything. They'll never look at me the
same, and I definitely don't want delia to know.

118
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,930
Worry about it tomorrow.
Just relax now.

119
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,732
I just keep thinking about that little girl
not wanting the music to wake up her mom.

120
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:12,290
It's like she's reliving
the day she died.

121
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,462
There's nothing you can
do about it now.

122
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:17,263
Let it go.

123
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:22,131
- Go to your quiet place.
- Shut up.

124
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:25,163
- That does feel nice.
- Aw, you're telling me.

125
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,723
- Why don't you come in with me?
- Because I'm enjoying

126
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,710
the view fine from right here.

127
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:33,861
Where are you going?

128
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:36,500
You're out of vino.

129
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,411
- I'll be right back.
- Stay. - 2 minutes.

130
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:55,773
Make them leave.
They're going to wake my mother.

131
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,850
What happened?

132
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:05,862
My quiet place just
become a little bit noisy.

133
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:19,011
Emily morrison, a 6-year-old girl who
died in her family pool.

134
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,840
- How did you find that?
- I ran a news search on the address.

135
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,832
I don't know how a family ever recovers
from something like that.

136
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,531
Yeah. Neither do I.

137
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,540
But the mother and the older brother
were both in the house when it happened.

138
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,401
You think the older brother's
the kid from last night.

139
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,222
He'd be about the right age.

140
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:38,220
What happened that day?
I mean, why was no one watching her?

141
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,382
Well, we know that the mother
was sleeping upstairs,

142
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,031
which is strange, because the girl
died in the late afternoon.

143
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,882
- Maybe her mom was sick.
- Maybe, but that doesn't

144
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,789
- ... account for the brother.
- Morgan, they need a plumber

145
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:49,513
- ... relatively young.
- Delia.

146
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:57,193
There can't possibly be that many stopped-
up toilets between now and thursday.

147
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:01,231
All right, call me, please,
if anything opens up. Thank you.

148
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:03,650
I think every plumber
in the entire united states

149
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:08,342
is actually independently wealthy and they
only take the job just to play with our minds.

150
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:12,340
Thank you so much for the lamps.
They made the house look beautiful.

151
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,842
- You must be jim.
- Hi. You're delia.

152
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,611
You're still looking for a plumber
for amy and jordan?

153
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:21,762
Yes, one who specializes in imaginary
drips and phantom spurting faucets.

154
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:23,722
Got news for you.
It's not imaginary.

155
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,961
Yeah. They had us over
to dinner last night.

156
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,290
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say

157
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,730
it was a very damp
evening overall.

158
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:34,833
- Who did the plumbing at your house?
- Jim actually did most of it.

159
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:36,820
- I fixed a few leaks.
- Oh, he's being modest.

160
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,742
He basically overhauled
the whole system.

161
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:41,873
- Do you want him to take a look?
- Oh, that would be great.

162
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,442
- I really have to get back to work.
- But he'll be off at 4:00.

163
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:47,962
Really? You are saving my life, jim.
Thank you so much.

164
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:51,230
- No problem. I'll see you later.
- Anytime.

165
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:54,191
Whatever happened to,
"you'll never touch another pipe

166
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,170
in our house again?"

167
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:58,192
I'm sorry. I needed an excuse to get us
back in that house.

168
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,191
Yeah, but what if the pipes are
really damaged?

169
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,611
Well, then we'll jump off that bridge
when we get to it, and there won't be.

170
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:05,372
This is about ghosts,
not about clogged-up drains.

171
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,783
Lucy, you got some
'splaining to do.

172
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,362
It's gonna be fine.
I promise. I love you.

173
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,310
Are you sure I can't get you
guys something to drink?

174
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,610
- Yeah, sure. I'll, uh-
- No. We're fine. Thank you.

175
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,170
Oh, that's jordan. I have to take it.
The water main's down that way.

176
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,262
Thanks. No problem.

177
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:28,400
- I was a little thirsty.
- Just-

178
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:55,591
- hello, emily.
- How come you know my name?

179
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,601
Do you remember mine?
It's melinda.

180
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,952
Don't talk so loud.
You'll wake my mom.

181
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,652
- She's not here.
- Yes, she is.

182
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,902
- When was the last time that you saw her?
- I don't know.

183
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,152
She's not here anymore.
Look, I'll show you.

184
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:12,643
- Where are you going? No!
- To the bedroom.

185
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,721
She's going to be angry. Jake
says she doesn't want to be bothered.

186
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:20,811
- Who's jake? Is he your brother?
- Stop.

187
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,752
I'm just trying
to help you.

188
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:33,792
If you wake her up,
then I'll get the blame.

189
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:37,873
- There's no one in there.
- Don't go in there.

190
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,681
Melinda?

191
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,511
What are you doing?

192
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:51,052
Uh, jim wanted me to check the water
pressure in your bathroom. I hope that's ok.

193
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:54,493
Oh, sure. And when you're done, come join
me in the kitchen. I'm making some coffee.

194
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:57,083
- Perfect.
- Ok.

195
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:05,703
- Thank you so much, you guys.
- Sorry I couldn't find much wrong.

196
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,663
Well, I really appreciate you trying.
Maybe it's a good sign.

197
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,061
Well, if you need anything else, give
us a call, and thanks for the coffee.

198
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:12,071
- Bye now.
- Bye. - Take care.

199
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,682
And just for the record, that was the
best plumbing job I've ever seen.

200
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,013
Copper piping, top-of-the-line fixtures.
Did you find the little girl?

201
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:22,681
Yeah, but she doesn't know that she's
dead, and it's like she's scared of her mom.

202
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,422
- Did you tell amy about this?
- No, but I did get the name and the number

203
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:26,423
of the previous owner. I told her it
would help us with the service people.

204
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:32,500
You should work for the CIA... Angela
Morrison... What good does that do us?

205
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,352
That's the mom, you know,
and i have to talk to her.

206
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:37,730
She's gonna know what
happened that day. Bye.

207
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,262
- Oh, hi. Can I help you?
- I hope so.

208
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:10,341
Some friends of mine moved in
to your old house on gardner.

209
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:14,462
Oh, amy and jordan. Nice people.
So, are they settling in ok?

210
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:18,841
Actually, they're having some weird problems
with the plumbing and electrical system.

211
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,930
Really? 'Cause we just
put in all brand-new-

212
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,772
yeah. Copper pipes. I know.

213
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,012
Um, that's not really
what I'm here to talk about.

214
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,023
Sorry?

215
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:31,321
When you lived there,
did you feel a presence?

216
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:37,611
- What sort of a presence?
- Like a spirit.

217
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,243
What are you
talking about?

218
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:44,071
I know that you lost your
daughter, and I'm so sorry.

219
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:49,273
Are you trying to tell me
that the new owners

220
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:52,970
think that my daughter
is haunting their house?

221
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,622
No. I don't think
they know what happened.

222
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,972
But you do.

223
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,321
I know that there was
an accident in the pool.

224
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,313
My daughter died,

225
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:11,340
and it was a terrible time, and I've
worked very, very hard

226
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,373
to put it behind me
and to move on.

227
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:18,771
It wasn't easy, but I'm at peace with
it now, and when I think of her,

228
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,901
I know that she's in a better place.

229
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,693
She may not be
in a better place.

230
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,623
I don't really understand
what you want.

231
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:31,420
I don't want anything.

232
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:36,501
I just want you to consider the possibility
that maybe your daughter hasn't moved on,

233
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,851
that there might be
something keeping her here.

234
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,762
She was a very happy
little girl.

235
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:45,421
We lived a very good life
until that day.

236
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:50,722
- Look, I have a lot of work to do, so...
- Of course.

237
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,430
J ake?

238
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,141
I guess you can
tell my mother's a little nuts.

239
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,142
No, I don't think she's nuts. I think she
just believes in what makes her feel better.

240
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,711
How come you're
so interested in my family?

241
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:10,540
I don't like to know
that people are hurting.

242
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,942
I saw you the other night
at the house.

243
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:17,161
I know. Thanks for
not ratting me out.

244
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,803
You're welcome.

245
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:23,792
I know what you mean, when you
were talking about a presence.

246
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,771
I think she's
still there, too... Emily.

247
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:34,022
- Why would you say that?
- I saw her.

248
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,953
Emily!

249
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,111
Take it easy, honey.

250
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:01,980
- I know.
- But she's right there.

251
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,370
I know it sounds crazy, but...

252
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,820
I saw her.

253
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,752
I know you did.

254
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:17,753
You do?

255
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:22,971
Yeah, lots of kids see spirits,
kind of grow out of it over time.

256
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:26,110
Sometimes I thought
I was crazy.

257
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:30,180
- Yeah. I know the feeling.
- You see ghosts?

258
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,690
- Yes.
- You've seen my sister?

259
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:37,063
- Yes.
- So is she all right?

260
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,590
She's stuck here, jake.

261
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:47,322
I don't think she knows that she's dead, but
we have to make this our little secret, ok?

262
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,930
Can you tell me
where your father is now?

263
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,085
He got married again.

264
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:56,583
He has new kids and everything.
He moved out of grandview.

265
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,772
You've had it tough,
haven't you?

266
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,130
Can I talk to my sister?

267
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,450
I have to tell her
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,461
Sorry about what?

269
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,483
Sorry.

270
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:29,053
Do you hear that?

271
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:34,330
- What?
- That. It sounds like an animal.

272
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,980
Jordan, come here.

273
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,312
That's strange.

274
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,893
What the hell?

275
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,100
I have a little
emergency on my hands.

276
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,280
Do you have scented candles
or bubble bath?

277
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,520
I do. Are you planning
a romantic evening?

278
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:43,172
With who, tivo? No, I have to get
a gift for amy and jordan.

279
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,680
They're staying
at the grandview regent.

280
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:47,681
- What? Why?
- You know, I didn't get the whole story.

281
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:49,771
It's something
about the pool now.

282
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:52,603
Anyway, it'd be great if you could
just make up a little gift basket.

283
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,542
Wow, you really take
care of your clients.

284
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,673
But I'm gonna sort
the whole thing out.

285
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:03,721
- You're not gonna get rich that way.
- Yeah, but I sleep good at night.

286
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,991
- Do you have some time?
- Maybe.

287
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:11,480
I need to run across the street.
Would you mind watching the store?

288
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,773
Are you kidding?
I would love to.

289
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:17,551
W- wait. Wh-what if
somebody comes in?

290
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,072
Sell them the birdbath.

291
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,170
What are you doing here?

292
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:31,242
I want you to take me
to my sister.

293
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,500
I thought all the keys had to be
returned to the real-estate person.

294
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,111
- Nobody ever asked me for mine.
- That would be breaking in.

295
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:42,013
If you're not gonna take me,
I can go by myself.

296
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,872
Jake, stop.

297
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:47,983
You have to tell me what happened
that day, the day that she died.

298
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,601
Then will you take me?

299
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:53,642
I can't promise,
but you have to trust me.

300
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:02,562
My dad was at work.

301
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:05,743
He asked me to watch
emily after school.

302
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:10,611
She asked me if I wanted to play, but
I was in the middle of a video game.

303
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:13,322
I told her to wait
until I was finished.

304
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,503
She said she was gonna
complain to my mom.

305
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:19,713
I told her mom was asleep and she'd
be angry if emily bothered her.

306
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:25,312
- Your mom was sleeping in the afternoon?
- She slept a lot.

307
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:28,001
My parents were
having problems.

308
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:32,031
The night before, my mom asked
my father to move out.

309
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:37,150
She was afraid to tell emily.
Emily was really close to my father.

310
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:40,223
Anyway...

311
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:44,943
I finished my video game, and when
I looked up. My sister was gone.

312
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:50,223
I has this really bad feeling,
like my insides were cold.

313
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:57,842
Emily! Emily!
Mom! Mom! I need you!

314
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:01,020
Come on! Emily!
I just- I lost it.

315
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:06,322
I'm so sorry! Please come back!
Please, emily! I'm so sorry!

316
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:11,350
And what happened
after that?

317
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,780
I don't remember.

318
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:21,050
Now will you please
take me there?

319
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:35,302
Jake!
Jake, you came to see me.

320
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:37,423
I thought
you were mad at me.

321
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:40,613
- Jake, your sister's here.
- What?

322
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:45,243
- Where?
- Right here. Why won't you look at me?

323
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:49,361
- Jake! Jake!
- Wait. What's going on?

324
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:54,380
- Why won't he talk to me?
- Emily, he can't see you.

325
00:23:57,568 --> 00:24:00,562
Why not?
What's wrong with him?

326
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:02,822
- Do you know what happened to you?
- When?

327
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:05,523
The day that you
asked jake to play.

328
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:10,213
He wouldn't come,
so I went to play by myself.

329
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,572
- You fell in?
- Yeah.

330
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,912
Then what happened?

331
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:27,673
I went to sleep
under the water.

332
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,462
Do you remember
waking up?

333
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,590
The truth is
you never woke up.

334
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:43,340
You died that day, and that's why
no one can see you or hear you.

335
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:47,671
- But you do. Did you die, too?
- No.

336
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:50,291
No. I can see you
so that I can help you...

337
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:53,191
go to another place
where you'll be very happy.

338
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:57,310
But I'm happy here with my mom
and dad. He's coming home soon.

339
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:01,581
- No, sweetie, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

340
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:06,583
Emily, your daddy doesn't live here
anymore. Neither does your mommy.

341
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:11,591
Tell her, jake. Daddy's coming home,
and he's gonna read me

342
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:15,772
goodnight moon and tuck
me in, me first, then you.

343
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:20,380
- Tell her.
- That's what I've been waiting for.

344
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:38,381
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. This is jake morrison.

345
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,461
He used to live here with his family
before you bought the house.

346
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:44,641
- How did you get in?
- Because he still has a key,

347
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:48,601
and he wanted to return it,
just see the place again,

348
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:51,660
and I hoped that
you wouldn't mind.

349
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:03,460
- Awkward.
- Slightly

350
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:07,170
- Is my sister really there?
- Yes, jake.

351
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:10,541
She's waiting for your father
to come home, to read to her,

352
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:12,493
and he has to finish that story.

353
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:16,473
"Goodnight moon"
He used to read it to me, too.

354
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:19,803
Do you think we can get him
to come and see her?

355
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:24,351
- Mm, I don't think so.
- Well, can't you call him?

356
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:28,431
Well, he works a lot,
and he's working on

357
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:34,140
a big house on route 59, and he's
in charge, so he's really busy.

358
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:38,851
Well, this is kind of important... I
mean, don't you think he'll understand?

359
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,661
He has a new family.
I don't see him too much.

360
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:47,131
- But don't you at least speak?
- Not too much.

361
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:57,323
Look, jake, um, my father
left when I was very young,

362
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:02,883
and I didn't know why,
but I was heartbroken.

363
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:08,551
And then out of the blue, he'd come back,
maybe for a day, maybe for a week.

364
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:11,751
Sometimes he'd
bring gifts for me.

365
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,473
Then he'd be gone again.

366
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,840
I didn't know which was worse,
hardly ever getting to see him

367
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:22,212
or having to say good-bye
to him over and over again.

368
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:26,581
And I never wore the gifts he gave me,
'cause I knew it would make my mom really mad.

369
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,801
She didn't want me
to see him or talk to him.

370
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:34,230
I was too young to
understand, so...

371
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,633
I wondered if all
of this was my fault,

372
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:40,342
did I do something
to make him leave,

373
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:44,820
you know, was there something then I
could have done to have made him stay.

374
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:48,901
- What happened?
- He came by less and less, and...

375
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,960
finally I never
saw him again.

376
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:58,930
It was really unfair, because I thought
that I had the power to keep him there,

377
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:02,042
- ... if only I knew how.
- Did you?

378
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:07,971
- Did you have the power?
- No, I didn'T.

379
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:12,763
- And neither do you.
- If I had saved emily...

380
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,800
he would've come back.

381
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,570
But I didn'T.

382
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:25,633
Jake, you don't think that your
father blames that on you, do you?

383
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:29,403
- Yeah.
- Oh, why would you say that?

384
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:31,762
I gotta go.

385
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,110
My mom's probably wondering
where I am, anyway.

386
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:46,471
- You did what?
- I'll admit it. I took a chance.

387
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,882
I thought amy
would be at the hotel.

388
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:52,381
- Mel... - I know. It's just
there's so much at stake for this kid.

389
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,692
He's in so much pain,
Jim, seems so alone.

390
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:59,783
And he's a great kid,
really smart.

391
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:02,191
I just don't understand
why his father would ignore him.

392
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,972
You know, parents are
supposed to be there for their kids.

393
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,260
I've never seen that.
It's pretty.

394
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:11,402
It's been in my
jewelry box forever.

395
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,003
Well, you have a huge heart.
That's why I love you.

396
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,010
But you're not a social worker.
You've done everything you could.

397
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:25,321
Not everything.

398
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:01,133
I know that your family business is
private and none of my concern.

399
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:02,703
Then why did
you come here?

400
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:04,902
Because I've gotten to
know jake a little bit.

401
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:08,771
He's a special kid, and he's having
a really hard time right now.

402
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,951
What do you mean?

403
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:15,730
He thinks that his sister's spirit
is still in the house on gardner.

404
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,881
- Do you believe him?
- That's not important.

405
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,420
What is important
is that he believes it.

406
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,120
Yeah, well, kids find
different ways of coping.

407
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:31,223
I'm sorry.
Uh, who are you again?

408
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:35,823
Look, I'm just trying to help, but I think
that jake feels like he can't talk to you.

409
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,193
So you're an expert
on my son's feelings.

410
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:42,533
No, but I do know what it feels like
to be abandoned by a parent.

411
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,622
He feels like you replaced him
with a new family.

412
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,890
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

413
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:50,381
Do you know that he thinks that you
blame him for what happened to emily?

414
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:54,350
Look, I don't know who you are coming
here and... have you ever lost a child?

415
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,341
- No.
- Do you even have children?

416
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:59,440
- No.
- I didn't think so.

417
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,273
Look, jake and me,
we had a code.

418
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:06,220
When his mother
asked me to leave,

419
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:12,182
I told him that if
he ever needed me,

420
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:12,212
if there ever was a problem, that he should
page me with a 911 text, and I'd be there.

421
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,862
And did he do it
when emily drowned?

422
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:16,862
No.

423
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:21,400
- Do you blame him?
- I-I never said anything like that to him.

424
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,731
You don't have to.
He feels it.

425
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:27,032
Well, I don't want him
to feel that.

426
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:32,790
I don't wanna feel that.

427
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:38,710
She was my little girl.

428
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:41,622
She was perfect.

429
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:46,533
And jake, he was a rock-solid kid.
He was a championship swimmer,

430
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,832
he was right there, and...

431
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:58,200
Angela found her way of moving
on, and, uh, I found mine, ok?

432
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:02,483
I love jake, and he
knows that deep down.

433
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:07,451
A- and you were right the first time.
This is none of your business.

434
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,021
Melinda!

435
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:37,730
I never got to apologize for leaving
you in the store so long yesterday.

436
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:39,893
Oh, don't worry about it.
I had a ball.

437
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:44,822
So was there some kind of weird parallel
universe thing going on yesterday?

438
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,622
- What do you mean?
- Well, I take over the store,

439
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:51,362
and you show a house
to a 12-year-old.

440
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah. Look, I'm-
I'm so sorry about that.

441
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:57,663
Melinda, what were you thinking
letting that kid into amy's house?

442
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:00,083
She was all over me
about it last night.

443
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:02,101
I'm sorry. He used
to live there, and-

444
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,510
anyway, it doesn't matter.
They're selling.

445
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,153
- They are?
- Yeah. It's a big mess.

446
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,831
They think the house
I sold them was haunted.

447
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,700
Is that the most brain-dead
thing you ever heard or what?

448
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:15,850
Just about... Um, could
you just hold them off?

449
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:18,190
'Cause maybe if I can get the
family that used to live there

450
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,690
to just come back for a few hours,
we could fix the things that aren't working.

451
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:23,811
- How would they do that?
- Just trust me.

452
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:27,822
If you could get amy's permission, maybe
I can get this whole thing cleared up.

453
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:30,990
- Ok. I'll try to get the key.
- Thanks.

454
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:34,491
- Aren't you opening the store?
- Oh, um, later.

455
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:38,841
I have a quick errand to run.
Bye.

456
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,851
That is one sweet job.

457
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,651
- You have some nerve coming here.
- Sorry?

458
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:14,942
Did you actually tell my son that
you could see his sister's ghost

459
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:18,052
and that she's living
in my old house?

460
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,830
- Yes, I did tell him that.
- Why would you do that?

461
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:24,441
- He's just a little boy.
- Because it's true.

462
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:27,432
My daughter is gone.

463
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:30,441
She's in a better place.
She's at peace.

464
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:34,872
No, she's not. She needs to see her
father, and you have to help her do that.

465
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,280
Her father, the man
who cheated on me.

466
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:40,501
This is not about what your husband
did or didn't do to you.

467
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,530
It's about
your daughter's needs.

468
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:44,532
Mom.

469
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,252
She's telling the truth..

470
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:50,671
I felt emily.
She's in that house.

471
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,852
Please, jake, I don't
wanna hear this anymore.

472
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:56,601
And I want you to stop
telling my son lies,

473
00:34:56,647 --> 00:35:00,700
and I want you to stop defiling
the memory of my little angel

474
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,350
Stop it!

475
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:06,290
She is not a little angel.
She's not in a better place.

476
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:09,843
- She's still in that house. I know it.
- Come here.

477
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:58,502
- How you doing, jake?
- Ok, dad.

478
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,741
You?

479
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:07,961
- Good to see you, angela.
- Right.

480
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,240
Well, let's all go inside.

481
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,753
Brings back
lots of memories.

482
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:27,831
Some good ones, I hope.

483
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:30,100
I really don't understand
what we're doing here.

484
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,112
Just listen, mom.

485
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:36,600
- What was that?
- Your daughter.

486
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:39,843
Daddy, you're home!

487
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,491
Daddy, I'm right
down here!

488
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:47,113
Sweetie, remember that he can't
see you and he can't hear you.

489
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:49,152
Only I can, but I'll tell him
whatever you wanna say.

490
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:51,420
I- I don't know what kind
of parlor trick you're pulling,

491
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,762
but y-you can't be
talking to emily. You just can't be.

492
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,082
- Dad!
- Why is he calling me emily?

493
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:59,510
She wants to know why
you're calling her emily.

494
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:03,062
You always called her
little bunny.

495
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,782
- You told her that.
- Didn't tell her anything, I swear.

496
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:17,760
Tell her I'm sorry.
Tell her I'm sorry I didn't save her.

497
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,123
You tried hard, jake.

498
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:24,441
- She says that you tried to save her.
- What?

499
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:29,491
I remember now.

500
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:39,561
I couldn't breathe.
I was just falling and falling.

501
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:41,861
Then I saw jake.

502
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:46,523
He was trying to drag me up,
but I was so scared.

503
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:51,982
I was holding on too tight.
I was dragging him down with me.

504
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:54,310
He tried so hard.

505
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:04,252
You would drown, too,
if you tried any harder.

506
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,202
You tried so hard...

507
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:12,153
But you would have drowned, too,
if you had tried any harder.

508
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:16,733
- I tried to save her?
- You did.

509
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,022
Is that true, jake?

510
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:24,852
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't remember.

511
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,862
He was in shock.

512
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,103
Tell daddy he shouldn't
be mad at jake anymore.

513
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:35,063
She doesn't want you to be mad
at jake anymore.

514
00:38:35,068 --> 00:38:38,682
I- I'm not mad at your brother, bunny.
I never was. Tell her.

515
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:41,111
She's with us.
She can hear you.

516
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,490
I was mad at myself.

517
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:48,112
I wasn't there for you,

518
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:51,372
for either of you.

519
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:55,122
I was doing things
that I, uh, shouldn't have been doing,

520
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:57,652
and I hurt your mom,

521
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:00,502
and I hurt our family.

522
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:04,112
I hurt us, too.

523
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:10,182
I let your father take the blame,
but it was my fault, too.

524
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,890
I should have
been watching you.

525
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:15,772
I should have pulled it together and
not locked myself up in my bedroom.

526
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:24,731
The important thing is is that
you know this wasn't your fault.

527
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:32,921
I just couldn't stand the loss, and
I never meant for you to feel it, too.

528
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:36,043
That's why I felt that you were
better off without me.

529
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:40,860
Both of you.

530
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:43,901
I lost my family
because of what I did,

531
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:46,831
not because of
what anybody else did.

532
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:50,901
Tell daddy he didn't
lose his family.

533
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:57,183
Jake is your family.
He needs you. He always will.

534
00:39:57,757 --> 00:40:00,140
She says that you didn't
lose your family...

535
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:04,322
Jake needs you,
and he always will.

536
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,213
I'm so sorry, jake.

537
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:19,381
I'll never let you go again.
I promise you, ok?

538
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:33,100
I'm sorry I hurt you.

539
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:40,092
I want daddy
to finish the story now.

540
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:44,291
She wants to know if you'll finish
reading "goodnight moon"

541
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:47,423
She's waited
a long time.

542
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:07,403
- He was up to, "goodnight stars. "
- You were up to, "goodnight stars. "

543
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:14,840
"Goodnight stars. "
"Goodnight air. "

544
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:23,630
"Goodnight noises everywhere. "

545
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:35,092
- Hi, nana.
- Uh, wait.

546
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,890
- Ok, I will.
- She wants me to come with her.

547
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:42,790
She's ready to go now.

548
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:47,152
Tell mommy and daddy
I'm gonna like it there.

549
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:51,572
Nana says so.
Tell them I love them.

550
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,763
I will.

551
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:59,761
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I didn't mean it.

552
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:16,502
Goodnight, little bunny.

553
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:23,880
I can feel her.

554
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:27,091
She's happy now.

555
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:37,212
Oh, sweetie.

556
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,220
I don't know
how to thank you.

557
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:46,053
You already have.

558
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:57,802
