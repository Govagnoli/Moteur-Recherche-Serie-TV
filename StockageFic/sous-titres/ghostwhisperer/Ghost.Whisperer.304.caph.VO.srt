1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,500
Oh, it's just so sad.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,290
I know, it's killin' me.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,600
Sorry, but the movie
really gets to me.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,520
After the eighth time?

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,980
Yes, after the eighth time.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,770
I don't even know why
I'm crying over a movie.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,760
I should be crying over about
overwhelmed I am at the store right now.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,150
You need more help?

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,340
Besides delia? No way.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,190
No, she's just... preoccupied.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,990
Getting ned into that private
school proved to be a full-time job.

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,470
Right, at the busiest
time of your year.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,720
Pretty much. Yeah.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,540
But the leaves have stopped changing,
so soon, the tourists will go home.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,700
Look, you need to take a
break now, so hear me out, ok?

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,520
My mother is gonna have
another one of her procedures.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,410
Ha ha.

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,730
Tuck or lift?

19
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,110
I don't ask.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,250
But, look, she's gonna be in the
recovery center for at least a few days.

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,140
You and I can use her
apartment in the city.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Sounds great.

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Good.

24
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,670
- Ghost in the house?
- Hi, um, are you ok?

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,720
No, just a drunk guy.

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,070
Hey, somebody get
some water, please.

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,010
Call 9-1-1,
please.

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,270
Are you all right, there?

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,570
My name's jim, you
feeling anything?

30
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,490
I'm sorry, jim.

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,140
Oh, it's all right.
Put your hand down.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Do you feel anything here?

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,640
All right, good.

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,620
we really need an ambulance.

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,310
He needs to know...

36
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,050
I'll always be with him.

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,670
You're worried about him?

38
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,150
I can help you talk to him.

39
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,120
Can you give him one of those?

40
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,360
Then he'd know.

41
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,670
Yeah, I could do that.

42
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,020
I should probably
tell him who it's from.

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,400
What's your name?

44
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,470
God, what an idiot I am.

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,310
The entire rockland U.Rugby team,

46
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,580
and I pass out on their
table like a drunken fool.

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,780
It's all right. The good news is,

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,670
you can hide in here
until your cab comes.

49
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,510
Thanks.

50
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,360
I owe you.

51
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,270
Water?

52
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,030
No, thank you.

53
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,090
But if you ever need
a lawyer, I'm your-

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,080
that's a pretty serious sedative.

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,640
You're taking these tonight?

56
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,380
Yeah, I've been, uh, I've been
going through a rough patch.

57
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,660
Rougenh ough to want
to kill yourself?

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,530
Because you mix these with alcohol,
that's what's going to happen.

59
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,340
I know.

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,660
Just lately,
I, uh- - what?

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,630
Huh, feel like I'm going crazy.

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,410
Like, uh...

63
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,520
well, ha ha, like I'm being watched, and
that's nuts, and this-this makes it better.

64
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,080
Yeah, maybe you need to
get some different help.

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,440
I actually might know someone
who- - right, you're right.

66
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,380
You know what, thank you,
and tomorrow I'm gonna-

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,340
this is for you.

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,310
Who? Who told you to do that?

69
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,370
Colleen.

70
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,850
Colleen, but she'S...

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,940
holy...

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,140
that woman was my worst nightmare.

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,620
This can't be happening.

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,770
Because that girl, colleen...

75
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,170
she died, so, um, how
could you talk to her?

76
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,170
Just take a minute.

77
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,410
Sober up before you
have any conversations-

78
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,580
if she wasn't your
girlfriend, then who was she?

79
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,400
Colleen, um, heh...

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,790
oh, we, uh...

81
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,410
we went out a couple times.

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,500
She was an intern at my
firm for about 2 years.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,950
She was cute, smart, but...

84
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,100
oh, god, this...

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,940
this is messed up.

86
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah, it is.

87
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,250
You see, everybody thought
she was so great, you know?

88
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,300
But when we went out, I
saw something, you know?

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,470
She was-she was...

90
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,670
off.

91
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,400
And she fell for you?

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
I don't know exactly what happened,

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,420
but when I didn't ask her out
anymore, she, uh, she flipped.

94
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,530
Just became...

95
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,470
obsessed with me.

96
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,700
How, like stalker obsessed?

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,910
Yeah.

98
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,970
I mean, pretty much.

99
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,120
Look who's still up studying the...

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,150
5 classifications of stalkers.

101
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,560
A little light night reading.

102
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,310
It's a real grimm's fairy tale.

103
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,090
It starts off creepy and
then goes to terrifying.

104
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,780
What are you still doing up?

105
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,640
I was getting a little lone
wlyaiting for you to come to bed.

106
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop
thinking about that poor guy.

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,640
That's all right.

108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,610
I'll substitute food for love.

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,460
You want a P.B.And j?

110
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,230
No, thanks.

111
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,700
Hey, did you know that most
stalkers actually believe

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,550
they're in a relationship with
the person they're stalking?

113
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait, so colleen really
thinks shane is her boyfriend?

114
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,120
Yeah, and they're
usually mentally ill.

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,500
But colleen, she
has this kind of...

116
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,760
tic.

117
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,800
Huh, you know, that makes me wonder,
because, uh, sometimes muscle twitches

118
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,890
or tics can be a side effect
of anti-psychotic drugs.

119
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,850
That's interesting, but I think
she is more of an intimacy seeker.

120
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,390
Wants to be loved by her victim.

121
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,410
Usually sending flowers,
love notes, rarely violent.

122
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,860
So you think, uh, shane doesn't have to worry
about bringing in the pet rabbit just yet?

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,310
No, the fatal attraction stalker is
actually called the predatory stalker.

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,200
They like to isolate or
control their victims.

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,270
Well, pretty much any stalker
ghost would be creepy to me,

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,640
so I could kind of understand
shane was on a bender.

127
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,550
You kn,ow in some twisted way, colleen
actually believes she cares about shane,

128
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,760
which means I have to convince her that the
best thing for him is for her to move on.

129
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,110
Well, if she really is a stalker,
you know where to find her.

130
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,860
And, uh, you know where to find me.

131
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,620
I know you are not about to take
that peanut butter up into my bed.

132
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,380
Uh, no, no.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,270
I was gonna take this
peanut butter up into my bed.

134
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,820
Colleen calling...

135
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,770
Stop it!

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,890
Every monday...

137
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,590
an orange rose.

138
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,500
Don't forget.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
Colleen, I think
you've got it wrong.

140
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,700
You're confused.

141
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Shane is not your boyfriend.

142
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,510
You have to send them every monday.

143
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,320
You know, the best thing that you could
do for shane is to go into the light.

144
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,870
No.

145
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,210
He needs to know how i felt.

146
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,360
Well, I admit the night
is pretty fuzzy, in fact,

147
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,970
I'd kinda chalked it all
up to being a drunken idiot,

148
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,870
but I guess that's
wishful thinking, isn't it?

149
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,970
Yeah.

150
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm just gonna cut
right to the chase.

151
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,890
I see spirits, earthbound spirits,

152
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,790
and I've seen colleen.

153
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,890
So...

154
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,720
you're telling me you see ghosts?

155
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,500
I know that it's hard to believe.

156
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,690
This is wild, but, um...

157
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,330
well, I kinda knew it.

158
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,860
Yeah, don't ask me how-

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,650
hold on, wait, is
she here right now?

160
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,470
No.

161
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,390
No, she was downstairs.

162
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,490
She
- like the phone and the door?

163
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,590
Wow, ok.

164
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,990
At first I was little bit relieved,
but now I'm kind of freaking out.

165
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,290
You see, colleen, she was crazy.

166
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,420
Ok, I don't think
she wants to hurt you.

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
If that helps you at all.

168
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,950
she just needs to cross over into
the light, and I can help her do that.

169
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,090
Ok...

170
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,900
uh, what I do until then?

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
Once I get her to trust me, I
might need you to talk to her.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,850
No, see, I don't
- I don't want to talk to her.

173
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,300
She's warped.

174
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,030
No, she had this big
fantasy of us together.

175
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,890
Couldn't let it go.

176
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,040
She'd make up these insane stories,
like trips we had supposedly been on,

177
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,640
romantic dinners, even
arguments we'd never had.

178
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,160
Did you ever feel threatened?

179
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,850
Well, it never quite got to where she
was leaving dead rats on my doorstep,

180
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,100
but, yeah, she was- you
know, she was sick, mentally-

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey, my lunch canceled,
do you want to-oh.

182
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,550
Excuse me.

183
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,150
I see you've already
made other plans.

184
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,570
Uh, no, no, no, richard
vaughn, this is melinda gordon.

185
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,410
I met melinda and her
husband last night.

186
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,950
Oh, ha.

187
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,250
My mistake.

188
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,000
Just when I see a pretty woman
in shane's office, I just assume.

189
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,630
He's our resident heartbreaker.

190
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,370
So I've heard.

191
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,420
Uh, we had a mutual
friend-colleen.

192
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,890
Colleen?

193
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,630
Oh, right, pretty intern.

194
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,970
She was very nice, very nice.

195
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,920
She had quite a thing for shane.

196
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,860
Wasn't she the one that quit
because he couldn't date interns?

197
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
You're romanticizing again.

198
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,150
She actually
- I think she just found a better gig.

199
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,410
It was a pleasure meeting you.

200
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,780
Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,170
Ok, that was
completely embarrassing.

202
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,940
The fact is, I rarely go out.

203
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm up for partner, so
I pretty much live here.

204
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,080
Do you know how colleen died?

205
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,830
I heard it was some kind of
accident, but I'm not really sure.

206
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,500
Well, what about friends?

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,140
Family, an address,
anything, even a last name?

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,390
Finn.

209
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,590
Colleen finn.

210
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,730
But that really is
pretty much all I've got.

211
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,790
I mean, I can check to see if
the firm kept any records on her.

212
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,430
Ok.

213
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,600
Well, if you come up with
anything, um, please call me.

214
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,410
Definitely.

215
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,560
Look...

216
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,470
whatever's going on here,
I really need it to stop.

217
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,940
Promise.

218
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,890
Hey, what a nice surprise.

219
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,450
Hi there.

220
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,430
Somebody call for a handyman?

221
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,220
I thought I'd check that
circuit problem, being that,

222
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,960
uh, delia might be minding the
store on her own this weekend.

223
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,400
That's right, your mom
goes into surgery on friday.

224
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,110
Tell me I can live in hope and tell her to
leave us the keys to her apartment, right?

225
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,920
It's doable.

226
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,520
It would just be more doable if I
could talk to someone who knew colleen.

227
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,630
I can't even find out where she
lived or worked, for that matter.

228
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,690
Didn't you say she was an intern?

229
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,600
Have you checked all the
law firms in the area?

230
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,330
Yeah, that and every florist
within a 10 mile radius.

231
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,550
I mean, she obviously paid cash for those
flowers 'cause there was no record of her.

232
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,640
I really am stumped.

233
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,300
I've pretty much used up my quote of favors
at the police station looking for your dad.

234
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,390
Yeah, I know, but colleen has got
to be on a police radar somehow.

235
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,030
I mean, she was
stalking someone, so...

236
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,070
ask.

237
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,620
I mean, if it, you know, means
a weekend away, like this one.

238
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,430
It does. I promise.

239
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,650
Oh, hey, battery?

240
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,750
- Yep.
- Ok.

241
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,600
- Talk to you later. Love you.
- Bye.

242
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,480
It's paid to the end of the month.

243
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,790
How'd you know it'd be vacant?

244
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,240
I knew colleen.

245
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,750
Oh.

246
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,170
Maybe you'd know how to get
in touch with her family, then?

247
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,020
No one has come for her stuff.

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,220
Actually, I was
hoping you knew them.

249
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,710
I'd like to talk to them, too.

250
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,270
Well, it's weird, that whole who to
contact section of her lease was blank.

251
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,470
So you think maybe she
didn't have any family?

252
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,830
Seems that way.

253
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,430
She'd only been here
a couple of months.

254
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,710
Kept to herself.

255
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,080
Wouldn't even take the elevator, afraid
she might have to ride with someone.

256
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,480
Turns out, it would
have been safer.

257
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,770
What do you mean?

258
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,120
She fell down the stairway.

259
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,210
Didn't you know?

260
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,950
And broke her neck?

261
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,140
Yeah, that's how she died.

262
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,650
You're not really here
for a rental, are you?

263
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,790
No.

264
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,930
Actually, I'm here to understand
more about colleen's death.

265
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,300
Do you mind if I just
take a moment, alone?

266
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,810
I got ya. No problem.

267
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,650
Thanks.

268
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,890
Colleen?

269
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,970
Colleen: He needs to know...

270
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,170
how I felt.

271
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,670
He was stalking you, wasn't he?

272
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,150
Colleen, you don't
have to do this anymore.

273
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,220
Ok? He can't hurt you.

274
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,540
You're safe now.

275
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,090
There is no safe place.

276
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,990
Yes, there is.

277
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,750
In the light. I can help you.

278
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,710
No.

279
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,790
He's everywhere.

280
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,500
You'll see.

281
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,850
You are my desiny. Love, shane.

282
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,550
Thank you.

283
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh, my god.

284
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,840
Colleen, look, I know how upset
you must be, and how angry.

285
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,770
I'm gona ruin his life.

286
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,940
I know that what he did was
awful, and that you want revenge,

287
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,420
but you were meant to
move on, to move past this.

288
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,730
Well, everything that you're
doing, hiding in the shadows and...

289
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,550
following people,
that's him, not you.

290
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,950
Do you remember where you died?

291
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,920
I remember running.

292
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,930
Was shane there?

293
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,680
I don't know.

294
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
That's ok.

295
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,660
I'm sure you had friends, family,
or someone we could talk to.

296
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,960
No.

297
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,180
He made them all go away.

298
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,610
Just campbell.

299
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,620
Campbell never left me.

300
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,050
Campbell...

301
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,320
who is that? Is that your boyfriend?

302
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,500
Give me a minute, will you?

303
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,940
This creep isn't
stalking you now, is he?

304
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,350
No, he's not.

305
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,120
I just know that he really tormented colleen
and you were the detective on the case, right?

306
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,770
I didn't know anything
about stalking,

307
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,110
but this guy made me an expert.

308
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,710
So why isn't he in jail?

309
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,590
He's a lawyer.

310
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,630
Knows his way around
anti-stalking laws.

311
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,270
And he's smart.

312
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,580
He'll go right up to the
line, but he won't cross it.

313
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,290
He seems like such a solid guy.

314
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,920
You know, he's on the fast track at
his job, I mean, everyone likes him.

315
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,650
A lot of these guys
have high power careers.

316
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,260
But a real relationship would
get in the way of their work.

317
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,670
So they create an imaginary
one that they can control.

318
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,610
Oh, I think shane carson really believes
he was colleen's prince charming, you know?

319
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,320
See, carson is what you
call a sociopathic predator.

320
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,870
He isolated her, pushed away everyone so
that he would be the only one she had left.

321
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,630
Then how could some creep
make all of her friends leave?

322
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,050
By making it so that she wasn't
worth the trouble of knowing.

323
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,290
He'd harass these people
like you wouldn't believe.

324
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,040
He'd make up lies,
manipulate them, you name it.

325
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,690
He wanted her all to himself.

326
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,910
Do you think he had anything
to do with her death?

327
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,280
It was my first thought.

328
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,110
But we went through
all the evidence.

329
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,130
I couldn't tie him to it.

330
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,420
I can't tell you what it feels like to
be a cop, and you can't help someone.

331
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,330
I just wanted to see the
light in her eyes again.

332
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,220
You tried.

333
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,930
And you keep trying, and I
know that meant a lot to her.

334
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm not gonna rest until this son
of a bitch is where he belongs.

335
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,630
Be careful.

336
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,030
Is that all you got?

337
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,840
I really loved you, colleen.

338
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,220
We were good together.

339
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,200
Oh, but you never did appreciate
all of the things I did for you.

340
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,050
Even when you cheated on me...

341
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,770
I forgave you.

342
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,550
Like with that
C.P.A.You remember him?

343
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,600
I knew he wasn't right for you,

344
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,470
but I let it play out.

345
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,350
You hacked into his
client's records.

346
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,390
You know, I never
told you this, but...

347
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,850
I was there that
night you broke up.

348
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,170
Yeah, ha ha, I saw how that creep left
you standing alone outside that restaurant.

349
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,480
You canceled his credit card.

350
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,450
The waiter wouldn't let him leave.

351
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,050
And who was there for
you through your tears?

352
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,650
No, you, uh...

353
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,700
you broke my heart, colleen.

354
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,040
But you'll never hurt me again.

355
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,650
You're alone!

356
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,690
And desperate!

357
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,170
- It's over.
- Losing your mind!

358
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,150
- We're through.
- No!

359
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,310
I really think you need
to move on, colleen.

360
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,390
I have.

361
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,780
She needs me.

362
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,390
Were you there when she said that?

363
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,930
Didn't hit me till
later what she meant.

364
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,850
I don't think she even
knew what she meant.

365
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,530
Love's funny that way.

366
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,550
No, she asked me to call
her, but I don't know.

367
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,770
It's always a delicate
thing when someone'S...

368
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,060
discovering their feelings.

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,930
Oh, she might appreciate
something more personal.

370
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,860
Yes, thank you and I was wondering

371
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,280
if our pd attrition never faxed
over those medical forms that-

372
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,310
yeah sure i'll hold. I'll
be right with your guys

373
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
morgon price academy

374
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,730
that's a good school

375
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
do you son go there?

376
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,790
not yet, but we're hoping

377
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,070
can i help you with something?

378
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,060
actruly i m looking for
Melinda. I know she's here

379
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,950
what are you doing here?

380
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,450
Bringing you...

381
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,120
this.

382
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,850
Look, I know who you are.

383
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,530
And what you did to colleen.

384
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,210
Hey, look, I
understand how you feel.

385
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,560
Ok, I do.

386
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,380
You've only heard her side of it.

387
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,540
Of course you think I'm a bad guy.

388
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,730
But I'm not.

389
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,220
And you know that.

390
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,820
Deep down.

391
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,810
We need just to sort all this out.

392
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,720
And it so happens I know this great
little folk art dealer upstate.

393
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Yeah, not even an hour away.

394
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,990
Shane, I'm married.

395
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,170
To a guy who has
lots of cop buddies.

396
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,730
Look...

397
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,710
I'm sorry colleen mislead you, ok?

398
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,190
But she mislead me, too.

399
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,920
I know you want to hear me out.

400
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,910
Shane, I am onto you.

401
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,020
Ok? This is not going
to work with me.

402
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,310
Melinda? Are you ok?

403
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,650
I think it's time for you to leave.

404
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,980
And don't bring her into this.

405
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,560
Oops, is this a- is
this-is this a bad time?

406
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,280
Yeah, it looks like it is.

407
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,700
We want you to stay
the hell away from me.

408
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,840
Oh, got it.

409
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,300
Can't talk now.

410
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,900
Ok, well, cool.

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,870
I'll be back later.

412
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh, and a real friend...

413
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,920
a real friend doesn't tell someone
whom they can and can't be with.

414
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,060
It's happening again.

415
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,310
No, it's not. He-he
can't hurt you.

416
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,220
But he can hurt you.

417
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,820
Melinda, are you there?

418
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,730
Delia?

419
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,150
What's wrong?

420
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,230
I was driving home, and I got
a phone call from the academy.

421
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,980
They told me that ned's school counselor
called to inquire about special ed resources,

422
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,560
like psychotherapy,
remedial studies, for ned!

423
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,930
Shane.

424
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,910
Of course.

425
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,090
This is how he works, he's
trying to push you away from me.

426
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,800
Well, now it looks like I lied on ned's
application, and they will never let him in!

427
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,610
It's started.

428
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,980
What eles?

429
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,800
He'll destroy everything...

430
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,500
you love until
there's no one but him.

431
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,140
Till there is no safe place.

432
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,170
I need to know if there's
any way I can stop this guy.

433
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,530
He's stalking you now, isn't he?

434
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,370
Yeah, I think so, and I don't
want to end up like colleen,

435
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,130
so I need you to do
something to trip him up.

436
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,310
Carson probably latched onto you
'cause you're one of colleen's friends.

437
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,310
You know, you gotta consider that everybody
in your life may be at risk right now.

438
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,420
Yeah, he already tried some
stunt with my friend delia.

439
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
How is he getting this information?

440
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,530
He's annoyingly charming.

441
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,620
And he's gotta know his
way around computers.

442
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,800
I mean, to do the things he did,
you'd need access to socials,

443
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,530
uh, passwords,
mother's maiden names-

444
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,150
yeah, but it's illegal.

445
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah, only I'd need a subpoena to
get the computer to prove he did it,

446
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,440
and for that, I'd need
evidence of wrongdoing.

447
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,580
Plus, he works for a law firm.

448
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,530
Exactly.

449
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,010
Our only hope to nail this guy
is to get a hold of those records.

450
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,540
And so far, shane's been way
too careful to let that happen.

451
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,480
So other than that, there's absolutely nothing
I can do to defend myself against shane?

452
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,680
Why do you think
I hate him so much?

453
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,660
Hello?

454
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,980
Ok.

455
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,310
You know, I tried calling you,
but my phone wasn't working.

456
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,340
You really went all out.

457
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,350
Jim?

458
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,690
No, this is not happening!

459
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,030
Get the hell out of here!

460
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,570
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

461
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,230
My husband is going to
be home any second now!

462
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,620
I don't think so.

463
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,090
What does that mean?

464
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,660
That surgical procedure
his mother had to go in for,

465
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,360
ha ha, some kind of complication.

466
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,530
Yeah, he had to rush down there.

467
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,270
Won't be back for a while.

468
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,750
Hello?

469
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,930
Anybody-hi.

470
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,290
Hey, I'm here to see
my mom, faith clancy.

471
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,960
Willows medical spa, please hold.

472
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,040
Oh, this can't be happening!

473
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,920
No service

474
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,350
Clancy?

475
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,100
Yeah, she checked
in a couple days ago.

476
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,720
She is...

477
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,550
Looks like she checked out already.

478
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,240
Wait a minute, there's
- there's gotta be some kind of mistake.

479
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,050
Her doctor called me, dr. Litvack.

480
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,940
Told me there was some kind of
complications, told me to come down.

481
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,000
Can you-can you
check one more time?

482
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,520
Clancy. Yeah, says right here dr. Litvack
released her at 11:00 this morning?

483
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,310
You sure?

484
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,750
I'm sorry. You should
have called first.

485
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,870
Yeah, right. My cell phone's dead.

486
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,280
The service is cut out for...

487
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,580
- thank you for holding
- some reason.

488
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,130
Shane, you son of a
- hey.

489
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm really, really sorry
about this, it's an emergency.

490
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,730
Come on, honey.

491
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,840
Sorry.

492
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,730
- He's here.
- Yeah, I know,

493
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,820
he's in my front yard.

494
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,700
No.

495
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,170
He's going around back.

496
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,270
Ok, please remember if he
pushed you down the stairs.

497
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,320
I can'T.

498
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,010
Can you tell me where he is now?

499
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,690
I don't see him.

500
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,380
What?

501
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,610
He's gotta be out there!

502
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,610
Maybe he's gone.

503
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,910
- Oh, no! Melinda!

504
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,100
Where is he?

505
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,070
He's outside, out the window!

506
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,500
Hey!

507
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,530
Colleen?

508
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,140
Colleen?

509
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,990
He's gone.

510
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,950
He jumped the fence. I saw a
car, but I couldn't get a plate.

511
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm gonna call the cops.

512
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,080
No.

513
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,280
He cut the phone lines.

514
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,840
Bastard.

515
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,160
Honey...

516
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,720
hey, hey, hey, hey, it's ok.

517
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm gonna go next
door and call the cops.

518
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm right there, I'm right there.

519
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,640
Colleen?

520
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,030
Colleen?

521
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,580
Colleen?

522
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,820
I thought I could stop him.

523
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,180
But I led him to you.

524
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,040
He'll take your life now, too.

525
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,510
No.

526
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,200
No, that's not ever
going to happen.

527
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,470
I was wrong, and you were right.

528
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,060
It is time for you
to get your payback.

529
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,430
What do you mean?

530
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,710
We're gonna nail shane.

531
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,640
We're gonna make sure he can
never do anything like this again.

532
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,720
How?

533
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,790
Ok, shane was careful.

534
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,440
But...

535
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,860
there's gotta be something he
thought no one would ever see...

536
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,510
except a ghost.

537
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,320
I need you to tell me everything you've
seen since you've been stalking him.

538
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,220
He really had files
eonveryone in your life?

539
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,510
Pretty much.

540
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,120
From my apartment manager
to detective campbell.

541
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,440
Where does he keep the files?

542
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,970
On his computer.

543
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,070
He was looking at
one when I was there.

544
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,500
He...

545
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,720
he was checking
detective campbell's file.

546
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,710
So he's probably keeping everyone's
personal information in those files,

547
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,490
like socials, I.D.Numbers.

548
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,270
Did you see anything like that?

549
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,660
I think there were numbers.

550
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,910
I just remember thinking
how strange it was.

551
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,210
He had the date when david...

552
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,690
detective campbell
started smoking again.

553
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,930
It's funny.

554
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,680
I remember that, too.

555
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,130
I gave him such greif
about it, but now...

556
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,800
I wish I hadn'T.

557
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,400
Sounds like detective
campbell meant a lot to you.

558
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,730
He was the one person
shane couldn't push away.

559
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,110
He was too strong.

560
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,920
He made me feel safe.

561
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,650
You think we really can stop him?

562
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,440
Or are you just trying
to get me into the light?

563
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,920
A little of both.

564
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,270
Remember, shane's in court on
the bergman case all morning.

565
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,970
Assistant's name is francis.

566
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,680
She thinks you're seeing shane.

567
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,760
That's how he explained
your last visit.

568
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,890
Ok.

569
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,150
That could actually help us.

570
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,790
Oh, francis, nice to see you again.

571
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,840
Yes.

572
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,360
- Melinda, right?
- Right.

573
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,630
Um, I know that this
is gonna sound silly,

574
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,850
'cause, well, shane
is in court, but,

575
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,430
um, he worked really
late last night,

576
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,470
and I think I left
something behind.

577
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,030
Oh.

578
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,640
- I'll just go in-
- ooh, it's awkward.

579
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,160
And I know that shane
and i would appreciate it

580
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,820
if I could just go in and get
it myself, seeing as how...

581
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,550
I know what I left behind.

582
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,790
Right.

583
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,710
Go ahead.

584
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,810
Thank you.

585
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,430
Not that one.

586
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,240
It's on his personal laptop.

587
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,140
Nope.

588
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,170
Ok, which one of these is
gonna get me into the program?

589
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,910
The first one.

590
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,000
The other one gets
you into the file.

591
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Ok.

592
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,450
That's it.

593
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,460
Great.

594
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,620
Go, check.

595
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,930
She's coming!

596
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,250
What?

597
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,470
So embarrassing.

598
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,130
He must have moved it.

599
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,780
What's that?

600
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,530
Wait a minute...

601
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,130
that's my shoe.

602
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,980
That's me.

603
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,950
I couldn't seen if he was

604
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,790
and i paliced

605
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,620
i ran out to the back

606
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,490
on,god

607
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,640
These are all of me.

608
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,260
is there any way
you guys were wrong,

609
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,330
could shane have pushed
her down those stairs?

610
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,910
No.

611
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,990
There was a security
surveillance tape.

612
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,270
Colleen was alone in the
stairwell when she tripped.

613
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,870
It was an accident.

614
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,820
And I checked out carson's
alibi, it was solid.

615
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,420
Then how did shane
take those photos?

616
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,160
Maybe he didn'T.

617
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,670
You should see something.

618
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,600
That's a crime scene photo.

619
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,390
Got it from the cop
on colleen's case.

620
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,030
It's a little gruesome, isn't it?

621
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,410
I'm just wondering how you got it, and
why you would hang it in your office.

622
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,050
I'm gonna have my
hands full with you.

623
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,480
I'm a lawyer.

624
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,140
I have friends in law enforcement.

625
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,510
You framed a photos
of colleen's dead body.

626
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,280
That's a little
strange, don't you think?

627
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,210
It's my way of remembering her.

628
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,190
Tell him how happy that makes me.

629
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,670
Colleen is happy that
you want to remember her.

630
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,660
Well, I hope it
brings her some peace.

631
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,060
It does.

632
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,210
Especially now that everyone's
going to remember me.

633
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,480
It does.

634
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,030
She's especially happy now that she knows the
whole firm will have something to remember her by.

635
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,230
We sent copies to all the partners, along with
a note explaining the artwork in your office.

636
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,680
We also made a disk of all
the files you kept on colleen.

637
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,850
We sent emails to your clients,
but that part was just for fun.

638
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,530
You hacked my computer?

639
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,110
Imagine that.

640
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,450
Yeah, they have a paper trail showing how you destroyed
colleen's life and everything that you did to her.

641
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,250
News flash, nancy drew!

642
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,110
You're just some
nut I talked to once,

643
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,450
and now you're all over me.

644
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,640
These things you're accusing me of?

645
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,410
No one cares.

646
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,880
Yes, they do.

647
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,020
Because you're a lawyer, remember?

648
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,870
And you broke the law.

649
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,710
She had 10 restraining
orders against you.

650
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,510
You stalked her, you harassed her,

651
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,100
you stole her life long before
she ever fell down those stairs,

652
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,600
and your chances of making partner
right now, by the way, zero.

653
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,130
He's sweating.

654
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,270
Don't stop.

655
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,990
You're a pariah now.

656
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,780
Now you have everything
that you wished for colleen-

657
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,890
no friends, no fans, and
if there's justice, no job.

658
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,180
It's over.

659
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,190
If you wanted to break up, you
- you should have said something.

660
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,070
We just did.

661
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,690
So, I think we're gonna get him
on identity theft, of all things.

662
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,070
Off the files I gave you?

663
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,520
Not exactly.

664
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,130
And I don't even wanna
know where you got those.

665
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:16,170
The photographs, along with colleen's police
reports gave us enough to seize the laptop.

666
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,620
I only wish she was here to see it.

667
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,940
I think she knows.

668
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,010
Anyway, I, uh.

669
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,520
Appreciate all you did.

670
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,550
This is enough to put carson away,

671
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,810
and he won't be practicing law
anymore, so his life's pretty much over.

672
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,840
Feels really good to
finally get this guy.

673
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,260
So thanks.

674
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,680
No.

675
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,800
I may never see him again,
I need to tell him...

676
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,430
um, detective...

677
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,760
yes?

678
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,140
Colleen, uh, you should just
know how much you meant to her.

679
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,810
What do you mean?

680
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,580
She wasn't as alone
as you thought she was.

681
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,070
She had you.

682
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,640
And you never stopped
caring about her.

683
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,750
Something tells me that, uh,
that wasn't because of your job.

684
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,180
That obvious, huh?

685
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,960
Remind him of the time he
walked me home from the station.

686
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,710
He was telling me about his
first arrest when he was a rookie.

687
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,920
Do you remember the night
that you walked her home?

688
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,540
You were telling her
about your first arrest.

689
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,630
She told you that?

690
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,250
It was just a purss natcher.

691
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,030
I chased him into this lake and
collared him about chest-deep in water.

692
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,270
And for 2 weeks after that,
you had flippers in your locker

693
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,610
and wet wings on your desk.

694
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,150
She laughed so hard.

695
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,720
I hadn't seen her smile
like that in a long time.

696
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,870
I just remember wanting
to freeze that moment.

697
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,430
And then you got to her house?

698
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,650
I was standing so close...

699
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,160
and I just remember this-

700
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,100
a strand of her
hair fell on my face.

701
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,370
I just didn't want to move.

702
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,520
I just wanted to kiss her so bad.

703
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,260
Took everything I had not to.

704
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,530
She trusted me, so...

705
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,370
I couldn'T.

706
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,570
Did colleen really
tell you all that?

707
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,540
Yeah.

708
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,210
She also told me that she
wished you had kissed her.

709
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,090
hey, wait.

710
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,860
What just happened?

711
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,140
Well, believe it or not...

712
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,640
hey, what's up?

713
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,920
I thought you had the day off.

714
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,920
I just wanted to drop by
and tell you the good news.

715
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,310
Ned's application got
accepted at the academy.

716
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,310
So how did you undo all the
damage that shane caused?

717
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,160
It wasn't easy, but we had
his real school counselor call

718
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,920
and just tell them it was a prank.

719
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,180
I am so sorry that you
got caught up in all this.

720
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,730
What happened to that creep?

721
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,010
Well, he got fired from his job,
the county is pressing charges,

722
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,040
he's out on bail, my guess
is he's somewhere laying low,

723
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,190
and jim is walking me
home from work every night.

724
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,830
That is so crazy.

725
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,080
Well, I will see you tomorrow.

726
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,210
I have more errands to run.

727
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,040
You know what, I didn't
bring those sconces up,

728
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,780
because that basement
is dead to me.

729
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,550
All those lights just
shorted out again.

730
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,310
Ok.

731
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,410
Bye.

732
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,460
Jim just fixed that!

733
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,890
Yeah, I'm looking for it right now.

734
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,290
Ugh, I'll call you back, delia.

735
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,050
Miss me?

736
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,590
This is my husband.

737
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,330
Like I care.

738
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,570
Jim: Melinda, you're not
gonna believe this, but-

739
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,480
shane's dead, right?

740
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,880
Yeah, oded. Pills, booze.

741
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,860
We just got the call.
How did you know?

742
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,430
Because he's right here.

743
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,340
Mel, get away from him, now!

744
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,590
Melinda?

745
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,330
Melinda!

746
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,800
This worked out
the best all around.

747
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,720
Don't you think?

748
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,350
Now we can be together.

749
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,451
Forever.
