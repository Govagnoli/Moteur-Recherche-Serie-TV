00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,520
My name is melinda gordon.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,970
I just got married,

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,640
just moved to a small town,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,690
just opened up an antiques shop.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,910
I might be just like you...

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,580
except from the time that I was a little girl,

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,180
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,130
It's all right,honey.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,140
"Earthbound spirits," my grandmother called them,

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,020
the ones who have not crossed over yet

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,090
because they have unfinished business with the living,

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,350
and they come to me for help.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,440
To tell you my story,

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,030
I have to tell you theirs.

16
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,810
I'm so sorry.

17
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,620
What are you doing?

18
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,330
I just can't do this anymore.

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,220
No. No!

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,060
Stop! Don't!

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,610
You guys,honestly,it's getting so old. I'm serious.

22
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,030
Gwen,please! Gwen,please!Think about what are you doing.

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,500
Part like throuth,Gwen please,

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,930
Gwen stop it!

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,510
Don't!This isn't right

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,300
Please stop it!

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,900
I swear I could hear someone yelling up there.

28
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,260
I'm telling you,sometimes I think the walls in thisbuilding are made of tracing paper.

29
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,340
Ooh!

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,300
We gotta get up there.

31
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,960
She lives alone. I haven't seen her all day. Hello?

32
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,280
Can you hear me? Hello!

33
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,270
Break it down. Break it down.

34
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh,my god!

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,570
she took pills.

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,770
What kind?

37
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,300
A lot of aticar,proxytin,others,I think.

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,110
Jim,she took pills-- aticar,proxytin,maybe more.

39
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,280
--Call 9-1-1.
--Ok,ok.

40
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,830
Ma'am? Ma'am?

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,240
Hi. I have a woman,

42
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,710
and she's unconscious.

43
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,440
259 west main street.

44
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,170
I'm not getting a pulse. Tell them that.

45
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,650
He says she doesn't have a pulse.

46
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,140
He's doing cpr.

47
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
I'm losin' her.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,240
no. Gwen,not like this. It isn't right.

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
I just wanted to be with you.

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,320
Take me with you.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
You can see me!

52
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,070
Not,no.Go away.

53
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,610
I'm looking for my doctor.

54
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,480
Where is he?

55
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm sure he's here.

56
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,650
--Go away. 
--Tall.

57
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,460
You know what? It's really not a good time.

58
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,740
Hey,we got her stabilized.

59
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,860
She should be all right.

60
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,060
What's gonna happen to her?

61
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,730
Well,all they can do is hold her for a few days.

62
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,810
The hospital psych team will evaluate her.

63
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,780
If they feel like she's not a threat to herself of anybody else

64
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,490
they gotta let her go.

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,660
Let's get out of here.

66
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,640
You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead,and I'll catch up.

67
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,250
All right.

68
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,920
How come you're the only one who can see me?

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,400
I've been asking myself that question for years.

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Who are you?

71
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm conor donovan.

72
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,940
Um...I'm her fiance.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,720
You mean were her fiance.

74
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,700
Semantics.

75
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,000
Has she tried this before?

76
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,410
No.

77
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,300
Well,she's been depressed since...

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,220
since I left.

79
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,300
--Can I ask how.. 
--how I left?

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,700
It was,um,a year ago.

81
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,210
My third triathlon.

82
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,480
I was kicking ass--

83
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,460
a 2 1/2 mile swim,a 112-mile bike.

84
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,720
I was just getting ready to start the 26-mile run.

85
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,010
I was heading for my best time ever.

86
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,400
Nothing was gonna stop me. Nothing...

87
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,700
except a little kid on a speedster 8500.

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,240
I remember thinking how much I envied that kid.

89
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,090
My father gave me that same bike when I was about his age,

90
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,780
and I just wanted to talk to him all about it,you know?

91
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,410
I wanted to ride that bike again so bad,

92
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,920
but then,just like that,

93
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,850
no more conor donovan.

94
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,510
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,310
I didn't even know what sorry was until I saw gwen get the news.

96
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,150
To see the life just...

97
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,810
go right out of their eyes.

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,360
That was a year ago,

99
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,560
and you're still here.

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,700
--Why?
--Look at her.

101
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,890
How can I leave?

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,340
She's got no family. She's all alone.

103
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,140
--I have to take care of her.
--You can't.

104
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,910
You're not really...

105
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,770
present with her.

106
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,640
Semantics again.

107
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,010
--There is something else.
--What?

108
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,350
We have to move her now,ma'am.

109
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,640
Did you stop by the hospital?

110
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,420
On my way in.

111
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,930
She kept asking for you.

112
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,270
I've known her for a year,but she asked for you?

113
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,620
I mean,how could she even know you?

114
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,500
She was unconscious the entire time.

115
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,310
She saw me.

116
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,900
When?

117
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,550
She had an out-of-body experience before jim brought her back.

118
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,110
Oh. I should have known it was something simple like that.

119
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,910
She also saw her dead fiance.

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,700
He's haunting her,just fyi.

121
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,520
That's how you knew about the pills.

122
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,080
He was at the hospital with her,too.

123
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,280
Oh. That is so...creepy.

124
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,480
Wait a minute.

125
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,980
--This can't be.
--What?

126
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,260
The county tax bill.

127
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,730
$15,000?

128
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,020
Small business assessment?

129
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,730
This is like 3 times what I thought it was gonna be.

130
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,370
If this is right,it's gonna totally blow through my savings.

131
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,460
I saw him.

132
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,960
I saw conor... at the apartment.

133
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,780
--I knew he was there all along.
--I know.

134
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,940
I saw you,too.

135
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,100
I saw you talking to him. How did you do that?

136
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,680
Tell her I'm here now.

137
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,630
Tell her.

138
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,680
I know that this is gonna sound strange,and it's..

139
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,650
not your medication messing with your head.

140
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,410
Um...I can see spirits.

141
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,670
Earthbound spirits who haven't crossed over.

142
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,830
You mean like ghosts?

143
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,200
I don't know if they actually told you,but you...

144
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,140
you died,only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you.

145
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,220
He's a paramedic and...

146
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,500
that's when you saw me...

147
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,690
and conor.

148
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,440
You can talk to ghosts?

149
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,050
And hear them?

150
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
How?

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,970
It's a long story.

152
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Is he here now?

153
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,660
Yes,baby,I'm right here.

154
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,490
I've always been here.

155
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,200
He's here.

156
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,830
--Where? 
--Right next to you.

157
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,190
On your left.

158
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,870
Conor,you didn't leave me.

159
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,610
No,baby,I told you I'd never leave you.

160
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,220
--Can he hear me? Can he hear us? 
--Yeah.

161
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,390
I just I wanted to see you so badly.

162
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,210
Tell her how much I miss her.

163
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,860
I miss talking to her.

164
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,280
He wants you to know that he misses you.

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,450
Oh,conor,I miss you,too.

166
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,650
I feel you everywhere.It's like...

167
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,640
my skin hurts and the inside of my bones hurt and it's just..

168
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,840
it's so deep I can't grab ahold of it.

169
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,360
--I know,I know.
--I can't even touch it.It's like I..

170
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,780
baby,I feel it,too.

171
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,190
Tell her I'm furious at her.

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,150
Don't ever try that again!

173
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,120
He's mad at you

174
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,680
for what you did,and he doesn't want you to ever..

175
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,340
no,I won'T. I won'T.

176
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,190
That's enough for tonight.

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,170
--Don't go. 
--I won't.

178
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,770
Baby,don't worry.

179
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,820
Hey,we'll see you soon,ok?

180
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,800
Get some rest.

181
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,390
Ok.

182
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,350
See what I mean? She's the..

183
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,360
She's the same now as she was the day I died.

184
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
You said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go.

185
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,310
what is it?

186
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,800
It might sound kind of morbid.

187
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,180
Hello. I'm talking to a dead person.

188
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,600
I was an organ donor and...

189
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,020
the day I died,they took my heart.

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,430
I need to see who has it.

191
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,390
Why?

192
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,510
I'v...I've...I've got to see what kind of person is..

193
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,180
I need to know that they're taking good care of it.

194
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,060
Like waxing and cleaning it?

195
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,190
No. I just want to be sure they--

196
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,180
you know,that it went to somebody...

197
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,190
worthy.

198
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,140
And if you find that person,

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,970
if you see them,will you...

201
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,440
cross over,move on?

202
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,310
What if I am happy here?

203
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,280
This isn't the place for you anymore.

204
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,030
If gwen gets better,

205
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,180
if I feel she is taken care of...

206
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,910
then you'll go?

207
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,790
Yes.

208
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,060
We're surrounded

209
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,280
by a world of things

210
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,670
but it's never enough

211
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,000
to give us what we want

212
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,640
but if we all stop

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,110
with our self-distraction

214
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,150
we'll start a world reaction...

215
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,050
he was the kindest man.

216
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,290
He was always trying to make somebody else's job easier.

217
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,910
We would be at a restaurant

218
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,030
and he would brush the crumbs off the table,

219
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,230
sweep them into his palm and just hold them

220
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,870
until he could throw them out.

221
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,850
And he would grin at me and wink,

222
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,070
like it was our little secret.

223
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,360
That's the thing about being with conor.

224
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,890
It felt like he was letting you in on this big secret,

225
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,230
something just for the two of us.

226
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,640
Ask her if she remembers the time we got lost in boston.

227
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,430
He's here.

228
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,460
I knew it. I thought I felt him touch me.

229
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,990
Well,kind of,anyway.

230
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,360
It was like a feather against my arm.

231
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,970
Sometimes spirits can let you feel their energy.

232
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,100
It's no more than like a little rush of air.

233
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,720
Yeah,right. I feel that a lot.

234
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,200
Does he dim the lights sometimes,too?

235
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,880
They can also use their energy to affect electricity

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,270
if they try really hard.

237
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,300
How do you know all this?

238
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,170
Gwen,the thing that I do... my job,

239
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,610
I guess you could say,is to help people get closure,

240
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,680
make peace with death,

241
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,160
sometimes get important messages across.

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,310
But it's all so that people can move on,

243
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,410
people who die,people who are left behind.

244
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,600
The idea is to move on.

245
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,390
It's time for him to go.

246
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,580
Did I tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?

247
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,450
There will never be anybody else like him,not for me.

248
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,260
--I know it seems that way. 
--No,it is that way.

249
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,160
Everything happens for a reason,

250
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,000
and that is why conor is still here.

251
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,920
That's fate,and there's nothing that you can do about it.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,440
Ok.

253
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,140
I want to talk about boston.

254
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,870
How come a ghost would know where his heart went?

255
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,210
Probably because he went straight to gwen when he died.

256
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,250
Oh. I'm not sure it's such a great idea.

257
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,040
Why not?

258
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,550
Well,maybe a recipient doesn't want to know

259
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,400
where his organ came from

260
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,180
especially a heart.

261
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,460
And that's a hard enough ordeal to go through.

262
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,140
They're asking you to meet the person who gave you your heart

263
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,540
and by the way,that person's dead.

264
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,810
It's been a year. Maybe he's curious.

265
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,450
Besides,it's the only way I'm gonna get this guy to cross over

266
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,400
so just tell me where to start.

267
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,580
Well,if he died at mercy,they've got a helipad,

268
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,230
so his organs would have been harvested immediately and choppered right out.

269
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,360
But you are gonna need somebody at the hospital

270
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,010
whose willing to bend the rules a little bit.

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,730
We never give out that kind of information.

272
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,820
Yeah,I know,but the thing is,

273
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,950
I'm not trying to get you in any trouble.

274
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,720
It's just,the information is for someone very...

275
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,550
are you family?

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,080
Well,in the family of man sense,I guess.

277
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,410
Sorry. No way. Anything else?

278
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,270
Can you at least give me cities and initials?

279
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,170
This isn't jeopardy!. Bye,now.

280
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,430
Aw,damn.

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,150
The second generator didn't kick in.

282
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,820
Please wait here till the lights come back.

283
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,070
Can you help me?

284
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,830
Donor's name...

285
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,180
date of death...

286
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,890
and the code r-w-h-o-D.

287
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,350
Hurry.

288
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,710
Ok. Got it. Thank you.

289
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,030
Can I do anything for you?

290
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,550
Rain check.

291
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,080
Everything ok?

292
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,420
You can go now,if that's what you mean?

293
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,980
Damn.

294
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,280
anyway,coming these past few weeks,

295
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,530
listening,watching...

296
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,420
it was my doctor's idea,not mine.

297
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,020
He's always telling me to try--

298
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,020
we usually begin our talks with the introduction.

299
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,270
Oh,yeah. Ok.

300
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,700
My name is cliff aimes,

301
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,370
and it's been a year since my surgery.

302
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,950
Please tell everyone what kind of surgery.

303
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,220
Transplant.

304
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,340
Congratulations on your "surgiversary."

305
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,700
Yeah,but the thing is,

306
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,030
I've had a bad heart my whole life.

307
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,320
I always felt like I had one foot in the grave

308
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,580
and the other one on a banana peel.

309
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,570
Ow.It's a tough room.

310
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,020
I mean,it's not like I'm not grateful for the heart I got. I am.

311
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,580
I just... I feel even more afraid now,like...

312
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,670
maybe I don't even deserve to have it.

313
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,730
Maybe someone else should talk.

314
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,730
I really liked what you had to say.

315
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,830
Why?

316
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,120
It sounded like the truth.

317
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,370
--Melinda gordon. --Cliff aimes.

318
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,280
Don't tell me you're a heart patient.

319
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,730
No. No,I'm more like a student.

320
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,320
Studying what?

321
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,670
The impact on people with things like this.

322
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,370
--Things like? 
--Transplants.

323
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,420
The emotional impact...

324
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,910
you know,what it's like to get a second chance.

325
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,430
I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with the first chance.

326
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,360
Maybe you could help me.

327
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,670
I don't think so.

328
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,040
I'm just curious.

329
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,540
You may have noticed,I don't excel at talking to groups.

330
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,630
I'm not too good at talking one-on-one either,so...

331
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,740
it was nice to meet you.

332
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,870
Do you ever find yourself thinking about the donor?

333
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,740
Why would you ask me that?

334
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,790
I mean,it's a natural thing to...

335
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,630
what else do you want to ask me?

336
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,880
If I get hungry for things I never liked before?

337
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,630
If I smell things so freakin' familiar

338
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,090
I just can't figure out what they are?

339
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,900
Do you?

340
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,610
Ask me if I feel guilty because some guy I didn't know is dead

341
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,100
and I'm here,talking to you about it.

342
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,330
Well,what did you expect?

343
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,480
I expected somebody filled with joy

344
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,720
about having a new lease on life.

345
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,800
And you got andy rooney.

346
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,410
Hey,how's gwen?

347
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,760
Feeling better.

348
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,420
Is her fiance still making things go bump in the night?

349
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,550
Sometimes I don't know who's holding who back...

350
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,740
but every time I see them together,

351
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,610
the only thing that I can think of is how lucky we are...

352
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,710
and what they'd give to have what we have.

353
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,670
Let's not ever take that for granted,ok?

354
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,750
Deal.

355
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,460
Even so,if something ever happened to me

356
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,570
and you were alone,I would want you to be happy.

357
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,290
No. I'd want you to find someone and find love again.

358
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,210
I mean,wouldn't you want the same thing for me

359
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,850
if something happened to you?

360
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,540
--No. --No?! You wouldn't want me to be happy?

361
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,960
Fine. Sure I would,ok?

362
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,990
Make friends,go out and make money,be happy,

363
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,090
--but no other guy. --Ok.

364
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Out of the question.

365
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,860
How did I snag such a sensitive,modern man?

366
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,140
Guess you can just call me lucky.

367
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,560
hey,look at this.

368
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,110
It says that my tax bill was paid in full.

369
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,390
Who could have done this?

370
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,360
Wow! I don't know.

371
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,530
Maybe somebody you helped or something?

372
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,170
Who? I don't know anybody who has this kind of money

373
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,780
and how would they know?

374
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,350
I'm gonna call the tax board and find out.

375
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,220
Anyway,I decided that we should get gwen out of her apartment.

376
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,970
Right? I mean,she really needs a girls' night out.

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
That's a great idea.

378
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,360
Cool. So saturday night,lento's on the square?

379
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,460
--No karaoke? 
--Cross my heart.

380
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,430
I'll be there.

381
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,670
Aren't you haunting the wrong girl?

382
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,730
Is that him?

383
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,960
Hi.

384
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,260
What are you doing here?

385
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,990
Um...take my picture?

386
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,470
You don't meet the height requirement.

387
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,010
Excuse me. I have to develop these.

388
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,480
Develop?Thought everyone uses digital now.

389
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,470
Everyone does. I don'T.

390
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,400
Listen,can I talk to you?

391
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,470
Digital is electronic. It's cold.

392
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,130
Film is chemical.

393
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,870
It's emotional.

394
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,780
There's no comparison.

395
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,470
Did you take these?

396
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,350
You have a wonderful eye.

397
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,980
You should put them out,let people see them.

398
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,050
Yeah. They'd just remind me of something else I never became.

399
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,050
No!

400
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,210
Does he have any idea what he is doing to my heart?

401
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,000
--Do you smell that? 
--What?

402
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,790
Like flowers?

403
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,110
Gardenias.

404
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,260
No.

405
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,640
Now it's gone.

406
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,370
That drives me crazy!

407
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,920
Weren't you happy to get a new heart?

408
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,230
What? You don't think I'm grateful?

409
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,790
You don't think I wake up at night and hear it beating

410
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,530
and just not understand

411
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,320
why I should be so lucky?

412
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,640
Sometimes I think they just wasted this on me.

413
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,910
He thinks too much.

414
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,630
Maybe I just don't know how to use it.

415
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,320
I know you've been sick your whole life,

416
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,370
and maybe you've just been sick for so long,

417
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,710
you don't know how to be well.

418
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,030
Look,there's no reason for you to listen to me

419
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,900
and there's no reason for you to trust me. I'm just...

420
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,700
there's someone I'd like you to meet,

421
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,410
someone I think you'd have something...

422
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,860
profound in common with.

423
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,570
I think you'd both get a lot out of it.

424
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,070
You have to have an open mind,though.

425
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,880
Who?

426
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,970
Cliff aimes,I'd like you to meet gwen alexander.

427
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,660
Sorry. You just look so familiar.

428
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,110
Hi.

429
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,770
Well,um... we have a table all ready,so...

430
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,630
well,why don't you two go on ahead,

431
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,460
and we'll be in in a minute.

432
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,980
We will? I'm starving.

433
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,930
Then why don't you show them the table

434
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,210
and come back out and talk to me for a minute?

435
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,100
All right.

436
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,540
What are you doing?

437
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,240
You were supposed to introduce him to me.

438
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,170
Semantics. You said you wanted to see him.

439
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,990
You said nothing about meeting him.

440
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,570
He's not her type.

441
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,540
Look,we'll talk about this later.

442
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,960
Lucy,you have some's plaining to do.

443
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,480
I just want give them a few minute alone,let them talk

444
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,570
Maybe we should order.

445
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,110
Yeah.

446
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,820
You said that I looked familiar.

447
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,980
What did you mean?

448
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,850
Like I've seen you somewhere before.

449
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,990
I get like this a lot lately.

450
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,650
Do you smell that?

451
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,360
The bread?

452
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,830
No. Uh,sweet...

453
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,890
like gardenia?

454
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,060
Oh,that's my perfume.

455
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,680
It's too much,maybe.

456
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,160
No. No,I--

457
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,030
I've been smelling it for such a long time,

458
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,540
I just--I can never figure out where it's coming from.

459
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,410
Excuse me. There's a couple over there in the corner,breaking up.

460
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,680
I think they need you more than we do right now.

461
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,370
Thank you.

462
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,910
Play a happy song,at least.

463
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,270
What sort of work do you do?

464
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,190
I'm a teacher,fourth grade.

465
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,700
I haven't felt much like working since...

466
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,000
I love kids.

467
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,910
They're the only original thinkers in the world.

468
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,090
Really?

469
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,620
Do you have any kids?

470
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,460
No. Hell,no.

471
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,120
I've had a lot of health problems lately,

472
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,870
so I figured I'd never be around long enough to..

473
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,890
have them.

474
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,130
Sorry. Did I say something?

475
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,040
No. I'm sorry. I do this a lot lately.

476
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,430
Me,too.

477
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,750
You cry?

478
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,300
Especially lately.

479
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,440
I don't know why.

480
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,810
I just...

481
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,410
I'll see something--

482
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,800
the look on someone's face or...

483
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,070
Or the way a dog watches me...

484
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,280
and all of a sudden,I just...

485
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,780
can't stop crying.

486
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,990
Are you ok?

487
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,010
I'm sorry. I have to go.

488
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,860
Excuse me.

489
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,060
Was that a date?

490
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,250
Did it feel like one?

491
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,520
Considering she left before we even ordered food,

492
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,350
I'd say,roughly,yes. That's my usual date.

493
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,230
But what did you think of her?

494
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:27,130
I feel like ...I know her.

495
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,460
How weird is that?

496
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,400
I felt...

497
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,770
ah,forget it.

498
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,800
Ooh. Forget it.

499
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,070
No. She's someone worth knowing.

500
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,720
Take a chance.

501
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Why?

502
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,880
Look,you're all about avoiding. I get it.

503
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,140
But just ask yourself this:

504
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,730
Why did you accept that heart?

505
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,490
Was it to avoid death,or was it to choose life?

506
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,170
I think you owe me an explanation.

507
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,780
Ok,it seemed to me like cliff and gwen might have some things in common.

508
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,740
Me.

509
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,560
She doesn't need this.

510
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,090
Can't you see how much pain she's in?

511
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,540
We had a deal.

512
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,710
You promised you would cross over.

513
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,500
Gwen's not ready.

514
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,370
Conor,let me me honest.

515
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,780
It's not gwen that has the problem here. It's you.

516
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,430
And it's not like she doesn't want to move on,

517
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,770
it's that you won't let her.

518
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,180
That is ridiculous.

519
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,090
I don't interfere in any way.

520
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,840
She feels your presence.

521
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,880
She know you're there,

522
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,020
and you're holding her back by staying in her life,

523
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,460
and this thing with cliff--

524
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,100
it's not about him.

525
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
It's about her taking a step.

526
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,580
It's about her moving forward

527
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,750
and you letting go.

528
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,230
She loves me.

529
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,830
I know that,conor

530
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,220
and I know that you love her,too.

531
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,670
But she can't love a dead man

532
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,810
not the way that you want her to,

533
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,960
and you can't love her the way that she wants you to

534
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,160
the way that she needs you to,

535
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,040
and it's not right to expect it.

536
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,710
Everything all right?

537
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,340
Yeah. Sorry if we woke you.

538
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,130
This one's having a bit of a boundary problem.

539
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,240
Don't they all?

540
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,050
Ok. Let's have gwen decide.

541
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
What?

542
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,380
Tomorrow.

543
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,860
We'll ask gwen straight out what she wants,

544
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,630
and I'll respect her wishes

545
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,300
but if she says that she wants me to stay with her...

546
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,380
I want you to leave us both alone.

547
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,750
It was a very intereresting conversation.

548
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,150
I asked the tax board who paid my bill,

549
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,040
and they said it was one andrea moreno.

550
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,650
--I didn't want you to know. 
--Obviously.

551
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,790
How do you have this kind of money?

552
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,690
I have a little nest egg put away.

553
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,930
And it's fine,ok? So don't worry.

554
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,620
I--I'M... stunned.

555
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,850
And...

556
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,450
I can't-- I can't accept it.

557
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,700
It's just too much.

558
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,930
Look,just pay me back when you can afford it,ok?

559
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,140
--Or,better yet,um... --What?

560
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,590
you could accept the $15,000 as a down payment.

561
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,590
For what?

562
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,050
For... making me your partner.

563
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,210
Andrea,I already consider you my partner.

564
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,320
Melinda,I love it here.

565
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,360
You know,I love the people,

566
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,900
and I love this place,

567
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,750
and I have a little bit of money put away,

568
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,120
and I could pay you something really fair,

569
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,730
and we could grow this place together.

570
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,800
I don't know what to say.

571
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,280
Well...say,"yes." I mean...

572
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,580
"yes," is all you have to say. You could say,"yes."

573
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,660
Yes.

574
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,500
--Yeah? Yes? 
--Yes,I would love for you to be my partner.

575
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,330
Oh,thank you so much. You don't know how much this means to me.

576
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,170
--I'm so happy. 
--Partner,partner

577
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,050
My life just got much easier

578
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,220
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the whole manwoman thing

579
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,810
and why I've never been too good at it.

580
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,520
Maybe it's because

581
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,470
I would always hide inside my illness.

582
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,750
I never had to give too much.

583
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,350
I never had to take too much.

584
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,350
After all,I had other things to worry about,

585
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,710
like "would I be alive next week?"

586
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,450
And after a while,I...

587
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,890
I stopped thinking about it,

588
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,460
and it got easier to be alone,

589
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,540
didn't have to take any chances,

590
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,280
the joys of a risk-free life.

591
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,900
And now...

592
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,060
I have this...

593
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,940
strong,new heart...

594
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,090
and I can feel it beating inside my chest,

595
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,190
like it wants to come out,

596
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,760
like it's saying,"give me more."

597
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,130
And...I don't want to...

598
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,510
stop this feeling,but...

599
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,320
I wanna fill it.

600
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,670
Like I,uh...

601
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,580
I have to fill it.

602
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,060
And I don't even know if I know...how,exactly.

603
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,740
But I'm gonna try.

604
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,800
Can he be talking about gwen?

605
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,740
You never told me what you thought of cliff.

606
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,580
Is conor here?

607
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,710
You can speak freely.

608
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,940
I did like cliff. I did.

609
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,940
He was funny.

610
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,360
I feel like I'm being unfaithful.

611
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,720
It's like conor is my guardian angel.

612
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,500
It's so comfortable when he's here,so familiar.

613
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,480
So safe?

614
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,820
Being with cliff,even for a few minutes last night,it was... fun.

615
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,540
I feel like I knew him.

616
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,260
We talked about kids for a second,

617
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,700
and it made me want to go back to work.

618
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,980
But I crave conor so much.

619
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,200
Conor.

620
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,250
I love you so much.

621
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,880
All I want is to be with you every day and every night.

622
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,100
Just like it used to be.

623
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,530
Will you--will you tell her that,please?

624
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,420
He's telling you that he loves you,

625
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,850
that he wants to be with you all the time.

626
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,990
I love you,too,conor.

627
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,000
But I don't want you to live a risk-free life.

628
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,290
You shouldn't waste your heart on a dead man.

629
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,590
He's letting you go,gwen.

630
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,460
No. No,conor.

631
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,570
No. I didn't mean what I said before.

632
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,660
I want you.

633
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,040
Don'T...let me go.

634
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,320
I can't do this without you.

635
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,750
That's why I have to go.

636
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,890
What is he saying? What...

637
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,510
he's leaving. Gwen,

638
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,760
he's crossing over.

639
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,040
Wait until after I go,and then tell her

640
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,250
when she thinks of all the things we did...

641
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,820
it'll remind her that love is possible.

642
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,850
Conor...what?

643
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,960
She'll find it again.

644
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,440
I will.

645
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,840
What? What...what is he saying?

646
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,580
I love you.

647
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,500
He's gone.

648
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,840
He's gone.

649
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,690
I have been dying to do this since we moved here.

650
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,660
"Saturday night,grandview players." High drama.

651
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,450
I just hope the theater isn't haunted.

652
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,040
Be nice to sit through the entire play.

653
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,600
Hey. You know,cliff and gwen saw this last week,and they loved it.

654
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,910
What do you think's gonna happen with those two?

655
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,160
Who knows?

656
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,930
It almost doesn't matter.

657
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,630
You know,they're good for each other right now.That's all that counts.

658
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,230
Right now... is all that counts.

659
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,140
Mm. You think so?

660
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,150
As in,"why don't you and i sneak out right now?"

661
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,280
Don't you have a life to save--or two?

662
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,440
Probably. Whatever.

663
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah. I should get back to work,too.

664
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,050
Oh,look,I'll lose these.

665
