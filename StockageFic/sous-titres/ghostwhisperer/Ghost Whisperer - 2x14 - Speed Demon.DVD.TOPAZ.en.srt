1
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:10,657
my name is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:12,578
i'm married...

3
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:14,044
i live in a small town...

4
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,582
and i own an antique shop.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,410
i might be just like you...

6
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:20,772
except that from the time
i was a little girl,

7
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:22,557
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

8
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:24,705
woman: it's
all right, honey.

9
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:26,604
"earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:28,815
they're stuck here

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,293
because they have unfinished
business with the living

12
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:31,937
and they come to me for help.

13
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:37,351
in order to tell
you my story

14
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,129
i have to tell y

15
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,755
melinda: well, it was
definitely worth the trip.

16
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:52,819
i mean, they want to do
the estate sale so fast,

17
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:54,777
there was very
minimal haggle.

18
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,479
jim: the haggle factor's
very important.

19
00:00:57,877 --> 00:00:59,177
[giggling]
yeah, i'm going to
have to hire a truck

20
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:00,679
to go up there next week.

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,857
damn. this road is
really dark.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,540
hey, be careful.

23
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:07,562
how far out are you?

24
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:08,692
i have no idea.

25
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,314
you've got to get a gps.

26
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:14,715
hey! grandview--
19 miles. whoo-hoo.

27
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
hmm. oh, and other signs
of civilization.

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,246
hey, an old fruit stand.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,643
you know what?

30
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:25,331
yeah.

31
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:26,923
[chuckling]
and, um...

32
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,931
well, a car, sort of.

33
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,706
well, that's weird.

34
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:37,275
mel?

35
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:39,792
i think i just went
in a circle.

36
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:41,131
mel?

37
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:42,430
jim?

38
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:43,645
mel.
[static]

39
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,248
jim! oh!

40
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,099
redial, redial,
redial.

41
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:53,621
ooh.

42
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,762
great.

43
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:01,834
great.

44
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:18,278
ok.

45
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,573
i'm talking to the police
right now, and they're going
to be here any minute.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,960
are you ok in there?

47
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,869
oh. yeah.

48
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,514
yeah, i'm ok.

49
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,070
sorry if i scared you.

50
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,321
you stuck?

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,820
yeah, it died.

52
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,029
pop the hood.

53
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:12,934
ok.

54
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,092
are you looking
for it, too?

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,433
i am looking for what?

56
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,808
someone's going
to die.
oh.

57
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:32,692
try it now.

58
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,812
huh? oh. ok.

59
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,225
oh! you're
a miracle worker.
how did you do that?

60
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:40,879
you need anything else?

61
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:43,715
how do i make it
back to route 47?

62
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,062
you're all turned around.
just hang a u-ie,

63
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:49,607
look for signs for 86 south,
and then 47 should be
about a mile after that.

64
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:51,573
ok, thank you.

65
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:52,782
bye.

66
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,690
bye.

sync:frm@¹ûº£îà</font>

69
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,559
i just don't remember
you ever being haunted by an actual skeleton
before.

70
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,776
oh, it was a ghost,
believe me.

71
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:46,931
don't they usually look
the way they did

72
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,667
when they died
the first time
they come to you?

73
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,570
yeah, so let's not
even think about what
happened to this guy.

74
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:53,678
how about let's
stay off that road

75
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,697
so we don't ever run
into halloween man
again, huh?

76
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,971
i love the jim clancy
simple approach.

77
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,472
avoidance--it's worked
for guys for centuries.

78
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,300
he said that someone
was going to die.

79
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:05,735
that doesn't exactly
lend itself to avoidance.

80
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,133
all right.
what does it mean?

81
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,603
i don't know. i'll try
and figure it out.

82
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,030
how?
don't know.

83
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:12,808
see you for lunch.

84
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,830
same time?
same bench?

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,154
yeah.
all right.

86
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,699
wow. what a haul!

87
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:48,897
melinda: straight sale,
no consignment.

88
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,232
yeah, well, the problem is
i want to buy most
of it for myself.

89
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,212
and you are
my best customer.

90
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,271
yeah, i need to find a
way out of that cycle.

91
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:57,963
what are you doing?

92
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,842
oh, just trying to avoid
the physical labor
i know must come.

93
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,594
hey, is ned coming by?

94
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:05,143
no, he is doing
a study group with
3 kids from school.

95
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:07,202
they take turns
at each other's houses.

96
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,196
oh, that sounds
like a good way
to make friends.

97
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,575
well, i keep
volunteering my house
for all his sessions,

98
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:14,396
so i can basically sit
in the middle of the
floor and stare at them.

99
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:15,981
just as a precaution.

100
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,179
yeah. is that
too much to ask?

101
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,928
but, you know, of course
they didn't bite.

102
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,446
mmm, i sense an issue.

103
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,273
it's all starting
to be about his friends.

104
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:23,584
that's what
he calls them.

105
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,589
"they're my friends,
mom." no names.

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,260
[giggling]
sounds like he's turning out
to be a very normal kid.

107
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:31,017
i guess so.

108
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,600
hey. you know, you never
told me what happened
on your date with tim.

109
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,465
well, there would have
actually had to have
been a date

110
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,399
in order for me
to tell you about it.

111
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,451
what happened?

112
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:44,059
he didn't show.

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
what?

114
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:47,228
it's no big deal.

115
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:55,671
melinda--

116
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,131
melinda?

117
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,363
melinda?

118
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:06,405
sorry.

119
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,550
i'd really
appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell jim.

120
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:11,310
right.

121
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:13,839
are you ok?

122
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,701
i'm fine.

123
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,890
you're the one
who looks like she
just saw a ghost.

124
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,506
melinda: why is it
harder when you're
trying to get lost?

125
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,704
jim: you're doing great.
i have no idea where we are.

126
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,698
didn't we used to have
a map in here?

127
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:34,038
hey, thanks
for doing this.

128
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,210
do you think i'd let you
come back out on this road
again by yourself?

129
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:39,601
aha! map.

130
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,875
hey, do these mean
anything to you?

131
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:43,958
19026?

132
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,905
what's left
on our mortgage?
no.

133
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,830
last plumber's bill?
no again.

134
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,612
i have no idea.

135
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:54,744
oh!

136
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:55,831
what was...

137
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,147
gas?

138
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:05,637
no, i have half
a tank.

139
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:10,192
hmm.

140
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,123
do you see that?

141
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,059
what does that mean?

142
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,037
i was hoping
you'd tell me.

143
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:22,537
it was in--i wasn't
here the last time.

144
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:30,135
uh, got the brake.

145
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:31,580
it won't move!

146
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,072
your feet off
the gas?

147
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,452
both feet are on
the brakes!

148
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,713
oh, damn it!

149
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,976
it's going to be all right.
it's going to be ok.

150
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,124
ok, ok, ok.

151
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,913
i'll pop it into neutral.

152
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,673
ok.

153
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:45,385
keep your feet down.

154
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,354
i'm trying!

155
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:48,643
turn it,
turn it.

156
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,062
oh!

157
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,405
all right.

158
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,231
what?

159
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:15,732
looking for
the midnight circle?

160
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,606
what?

161
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,053
someone's going to die--

162
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,793
see, now i know we're
going the wrong way.

163
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,663
we're all the way on
the other side of town.

164
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,759
well, if i can just get
the adrenaline that's
still coursing

165
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,960
through my veins
to slow down, i might
figure it out.

166
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:33,998
sorry.

167
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,744
why can't we just go
home at night

168
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,590
and watch dvds
like normal couples?

169
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,984
hey, look, we can stop
and ask for directions.

170
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:41,907
i don't need directions.
i got it figured out.

171
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:43,409
i just need to find
this one road.

172
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:44,726
wait a minute.

173
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:48,157
that's the girl who helped me
on the road last night.

174
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:58,179
engine seems fine.

175
00:09:58,368 --> 00:09:59,968
just running
a little hot, i think.

176
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,883
anyway, if you want
to leave it here,
i can run some diagnostics.

177
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,397
oh, no. i don't think
there's anything wrong
with the car.

178
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,272
wow. that's cool.
do you mind?

179
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,622
it's got the roll bar
and the magnesium wheels,
4-inch exhaust, right?

180
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,799
your husband knows
cars. cool.

181
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,585
while he's distracted,
will you please tell me

182
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:16,994
how to get back
to route 47?

183
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:18,535
oh, yeah, let me
write it down here.

184
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,037
thank you.

185
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,246
so, how long
have you worked here?

186
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,425
i own it.

187
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:25,217
seriously?
mm-hmm.

188
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:27,248
i--i mean,
not that that's--
no, it's ok.

189
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,930
my father, he loved cars
and he didn't have a son;

190
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,328
fast forward, here i am,
or something like that.

191
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,608
wow. i'm in awe.
ha ha!

192
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,514
i don't know
the first thing
about cars.

193
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,865
well, we don't deal too much
with everyday car staff.

194
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,521
most of our clients
are serious racers,
real car people.

195
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,524
the road that you found
me on last night--

196
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,875
do you know if
there have been
any accidents there?

197
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,539
you know, like serious
people dying accidents?

198
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:52,911
not that i know of.

199
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,075
any other weird things?

200
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:55,995
weird like how?

201
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,870
i don't know, weird like
cars going haywire,

202
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,904
seeing strange things
on the road.

203
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:04,072
sorry. other than
the odd roadkill,

204
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,616
not much goes on out there.

205
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:06,892
anyway, here's
the directions,

206
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,597
and my number's on
there if you have
any more car trouble.

207
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:09,883
thank you so much.

208
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,554
have you ever heard of
the midnight circle?

209
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,126
what's that?

210
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:15,844
i don't know.

211
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:17,093
me neither.

212
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:19,798
ok, joe. it's ready.

213
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,425
time to unpeel
your husband away
from my cars.

214
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,936
honey, honey.

215
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,515
can we just move in
here for, like, a week?

216
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:28,744
what do you think?

217
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,950
oh. business, huh?

218
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:33,779
directions.

219
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,018
the midnight what?

220
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:37,534
the midnight circle.

221
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,726
is that a name,
a place, a thing?

222
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,281
none of the above.
all of the above.

223
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:42,846
oh. well, did you
check the phone book?

224
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:44,048
yeah, there was
no listing.

225
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,521
huh. thank you.
i'll see you next time.

226
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:52,214
hey, mom.

227
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:53,993
hey, hey! how was school?

228
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:55,452
i need $10.

229
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:56,798
oh. for school?

230
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:57,725
no.

231
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:59,109
well, then, for what?

232
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,235
i don't know.
with my friends.

233
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:01,655
in case we stop for
pizza or something.

234
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,564
are there children at
this midnight circle,

235
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,784
because if not, please,
take me there now.

236
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,257
hey, do you know
what it is, ned?

237
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:12,509
the midnight circle?

238
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,427
um, no.

239
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,125
never heard of it.

240
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,280
so, jim is working tonight,

241
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,109
and i am starving.

242
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,675
you want to go to lento's
and grab a bite?

243
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,095
oh, i would love to,

244
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,572
but i really have to
make sure that ned's
doing his homework.

245
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:38,817
can i get a raincheck?

246
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,429
yeah, no problem.
good night.

247
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,633
ok. good night.

248
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,099
aah!

249
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,808
you don't belong.

250
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,430
they were just
giving me a ride home.

251
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,435
i don't want you in a car
with people i don't know.

252
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,206
those kids are
too old for you, ned.

253
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,905
they like me.
they're my friends.

254
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,077
wait. that's
your study group?

255
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:48,281
what's the big deal?

256
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:49,754
the big deal is
i'm your mother.

257
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,778
i want to know who you're
with and where you are.

258
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,782
you want to control
everything i do.

259
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:55,414
most of it, yes.
that's my job.

260
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:57,832
you are not an adult yet, ned,

261
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,489
as much as you think you are.

262
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,660
and don't blame melinda.

263
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,200
she told me because
she cares about you,

264
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,156
not because she wanted
to get you in trouble.

265
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:08,767
i could tell things,
too.

266
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:17,785
hey, where are you going?

267
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,356
home to prison.

268
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,093
melinda: ned!

269
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,997
i keep your secrets.

270
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,870
hey, that's not
what this is about.

271
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,053
who were those guys?

272
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,458
they go to my school.
they help me study.

273
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,175
now i look totally lame.

274
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,859
look, there was
a bumper sticker
with numbers on it.

275
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:37,211
what does it mean?

276
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:38,350
hey.

277
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,630
i know when i talked about
the midnight circle yesterday

278
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,881
that you knew what it was.

279
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:43,640
i don't.

280
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,990
i'm not playing around, ned.

281
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,636
there is a ghost
attached to your friends,

282
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,522
or the midnight circle,
whatever it is--

283
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,419
a dangerous ghost.
you have to tell me.

284
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:54,202
i don't know anything.

285
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:10,839
hi. i'm...

286
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,007
melinda gordon. yes.
i know all about you.

287
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,266
i'm kate payne.

288
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,734
i'm so glad to meet
you finally.

289
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:21,127
are you?

290
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:23,928
well, yes. ha ha.

291
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:25,353
man: get on there.

292
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,512
get on there.

293
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,130
i'm telling you
to get on there.

294
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,688
maybe i chose
a bad time.

295
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,447
no. he's in a bit
of a bad mood,

296
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,899
but don't let it
bother you.

297
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:37,825
it was lovely to meet you.

298
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:39,434
get on there.

299
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:41,877
just do me
the favor and
just get on there.

300
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,227
get on there.

301
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,836
you do realize that
that's an inanimate object

302
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,521
that can't understand you?

303
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,804
oh, it understands me.
they all do.

304
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,297
they understand
every word i'm saying.

305
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:52,289
who?

306
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,040
who? who? the nail,
the picture frame,
the hammer.

307
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:55,448
the hammer
understands me.

308
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,199
the bastards have the
whole thing planned out.

309
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,883
i was warned you were
in a bad mood.

310
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,267
yeah, i'm in a bad mood
because some people

311
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,076
really know how to get
under my skin, ok?

312
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:03,777
now, where's my hammer?

313
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,927
i don't even have
my hammer now.

314
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:05,986
i had my hammer
right here.

315
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,036
i'm losing my mind.

316
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:09,054
looking for this?

317
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:11,013
yes, i am.
and you know what?

318
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,455
i've had just about
as much aggravation

319
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:14,023
as i can stand for
one day, thank you.

320
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,939
ok, sorry. bad timing.

321
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:17,749
and i don't want to
talk about it, ok?

322
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:18,916
so, please don't try
to drag it out of me?

323
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,601
ok, no problem.
i'll see ya.

324
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,417
it's about my wife,
if you must know.

325
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,527
well, i don't must know,

326
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,277
so if you'd rather
not talk about it...

327
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:27,879
thank you.
i feel so much better.

328
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,570
now, what can i do for
you, melinda gordon?

329
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,523
do you have any idea
what these numbers mean?

330
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,966
1 9 0 2 0 6.

331
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:39,049
map coordinates?

332
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,259
checked it already.
doesn't add up.

333
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:42,683
well, it adds up
in numerology to...

334
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:43,902
9.

335
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:44,585
meaning?

336
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,827
meaning 9.
9 is the divine number,

337
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:48,621
the number
of completion,
the eternal number.

338
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,770
the chinese considered
it the celestial number.

339
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:53,063
and there's the famous
9 course meal

340
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:55,123
at my favorite
vietnamese restaurant,
beef or fish.

341
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:56,823
is any of this
helping you?

342
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:57,866
not really.

343
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:58,491
of course not.

344
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,207
because none of this
has anything to do
with numerology.

345
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:01,450
it doesn't?

346
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:02,317
no, it doesn't.

347
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:03,876
but that doesn't stop me
from going on and on

348
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,569
with all the minutiae
i know, does it?

349
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:12,938
it's a date!

350
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:13,747
it's a date.

351
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,605
challenge me next time
you come in here, won't you?

352
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,631
19th of february, 2006.

353
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,699
that's a year ago
next monday.

354
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,192
it's a significant date.

355
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,041
february 19, 1945 was
the battle of iwo jima.

356
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,535
the phonograph was
invented in 1878.

357
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,228

"sounds of silence"

358
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,536
1964, february 19.

359
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,129
big makeout song for me.

360
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:36,230
how do you know all that?

361
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:37,781
well, while the other
kids were out
playing baseball--

362
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:38,824
you were studying.

363
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:40,831
no. i was chasing girls.
i never had to study.

364
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,792
studying i never did
because knowledge
came so easy to me.

365
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,451
girls, not so much.

366
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,435
ok. have you ever heard
of the midnight circle?

367
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:49,327
knitting club
for insomniacs?

368
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,886
you're hilarious.
yes or no?

369
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,112
no.

370
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:54,646
no? that's it?

371
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,114
wait, there's no medieval
significance or minutiae?

372
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,565
uh, oh! no.

373
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:01,874
i don't know
anything about it.

374
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,724
ok, then.

375
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:03,750
i have a picture
to hang.

376
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:04,634
great.

377
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,170
you know, if you do
ever want to talk,

378
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:16,505
i'm a really good listener.

379
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:19,998
ah...

380
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,965
i don't know
if i have any
training for that.

381
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,241
yeah, i didn't think so.

382
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:26,509
keep it in mind.

383
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:53,233
i can't believe
you lied to me.

384
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:54,758
it was a secret.

385
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,060
i had to promise
i wouldn't tell.

386
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,262
and that was the
midnight circle?

387
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:58,146
there's nothing else?

388
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,411
'cause no more
games, ned.

389
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,946
it's a race, a couple
of times a month.

390
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:05,629
they race for money,
pink slips, stuff like that.

391
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:07,774
and there aren't any rules.

392
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,703
where does your mom
think you are?

393
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,433
in bed.

394
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:14,364
i climbed out the window.

395
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:15,182
ohh...

396
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,877
you have
no idea how much
trouble you're in.

397
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:21,362
delia was furious.

398
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:22,641
i mean, she was
so embarrassed.

399
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:25,026
here she is thinking
that her son is asleep
in his bedroom.

400
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:26,592
i thought you said
you weren't going

401
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,234
to go out on that road
again without me.

402
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:30,294
i had to go when
i had the chance.

403
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,903
is that where
you saw the ghost?

404
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,509
yeah. he was in the car
that crashed.

405
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:37,163
you think he caused it?

406
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:38,677
i don't know what
to think.

407
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,920
i mean, i know that
the ghost is attached
to this world,

408
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:42,524
but it's all so secret.

409
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:45,582
you should have seen
the way they all scattered
when they heard the sirens.

410
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,794
you think he's trying
to hurt the racers?

411
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:49,706
yeah. and i'm really
worried about cindy,

412
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,680
because he said that
somebody's going to die.

413
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:54,748
maybe that's the way
he died--in a crash.

414
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,510
i keep checking online,

415
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,018
but i don't have
a lot to go on.

416
00:23:58,441 --> 00:23:59,008
i don't know his name.

417
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:00,022
i don't know what
he looked like.

418
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:01,149
i don't know when he died.

419
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:01,850
hmm.

420
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,242
i'll check
the records at work,
ask around.

421
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,813
look, no offense.

422
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:08,111
it's just not something
we talk about.

423
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,060
yeah, i understand,
but people may get hurt.

424
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,534
that's half the thrill
of the whole thing.
for some people.

425
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,855
ok, you almost got
killed last night.

426
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,422
last night?
i don't think so.

427
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,199
i was at home in bed
last night.

428
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:19,455
i don't know what
you're talking about.

429
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:21,411
sorry. um, melissa,
is it?

430
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:23,546
melinda.

431
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,348
yeah, well,
i got to run.

432
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:27,050
there's coffee
and pastry in
the break room.

433
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,919
help yourself.
thanks for coming by.

434
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:31,525
yeah.

435
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,881
he died in an illegal
street race 19th of
february last year

436
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,361
in the same spot where
my car first broke down.

437
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,630
yeah. it says he owned
pike custom owners.

438
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,379
he was racing a guy
named ray peters.

439
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,597
there were no charges filed.
there's nothing else.

440
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:07,972
look at the bottom.

441
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:11,695
survived by his fiancee
cindy brown.

442
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:13,704
cindy cindy.

443
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:14,582
exactly.

444
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,537
now i know who
the ghost is and who
he's attached to.

445
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:18,189
what's he trying to do?

446
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,527
protect her?
i don't know.

447
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,523
maybe he's going to wipe
out all the people who
race against her?

448
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:23,961
sounds like
a true romantic.

449
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:26,180
all right, what are
you going to do?

450
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,185
i've got to find
this ghost tonight.

451
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,987
you doing anything?

452
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,332
cool.

453
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,756
just, uh, stay in the beam
of the headlight.

454
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:43,936
yeah. i'll wave
if i need you.

455
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:57,269
i know your name.

456
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,691
gordon pike.

457
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,565
i know that you died
in a car race.

458
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:05,859
i can help.

459
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,285
i think i know
what's going on.

460
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,639
this has to do with
cindy, doesn't it?

461
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,536
yeah, it's about cindy.

462
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,777
well, i can help you
talk to her if you want,

463
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,191
if it'll help you cross over,

464
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,036
but you can't stay here.

465
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:32,142
you just can't.

466
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
i trained her,
taught her to race.

467
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:37,353
everything she knows
is because of me.

468
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:40,021
yeah, but that doesn't mean
you can protect her forever.

469
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:41,768
i don't want
to protect her.

470
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,925
i'm going to kill her.

471
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:51,923
she thought she was
as good as me.

472
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:53,774
she wanted to prove
she was better.

473
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,343
i don't understand.

474
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,719
i thought you two
were a couple.

475
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:57,752
weren't you engaged?

476
00:26:57,936 --> 00:26:58,870
i was her first love.

477
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:00,538
she thought i was
a rock star.

478
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,372
most people were
afraid of me because
i wanted to race.

479
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:05,508
not her.

480
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:07,642
i've never
had anybody look at
me that way before.

481
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:10,068
ok, so what went wrong?

482
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
i let her drive my car.

483
00:27:14,904 --> 00:27:15,638
what?

484
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:17,140
i taught her to race.

485
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:18,756
i showed her
everything i know.

486
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,301
she was good, too.
a natural.

487
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:24,002
then she didn't
need me anymore.

488
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,363
she wanted to prove she
was faster and smarter.

489
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:29,215
was she?

490
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:30,881
smarter, maybe.

491
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,026
she really knew how
to mess with my head
before a race.

492
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:36,703
it started with
just kid stuff.

493
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,396
????

494
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:39,956
then she had to keep
pushing it.

495
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,123
like, sometimes she'd
mess with my nitrous.

496
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:44,141
nitrous?

497
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,892
you inject it into the
manifold when you need
a last-second boost.

498
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:48,535
come

499
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:50,528
or she'd mess with
my fuel mixture.
little things.

500
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:52,212
but then i started
losing,

501
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:53,880
and it wasn't
funny anymore.

502
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,233
the night i died was
a big race between me
and ray peters,

503
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,327
a 15k payday.

504
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,045
and she warned me she
wasn't going to let me
get paid that night.

505
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:04,697
so, what happened?

506
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:08,448
i came out of the turn,
hit the nitrous button.

507
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:10,091
next thing i know...

508
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:11,825
boom!

509
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,638
i'm floating above my
car watching it burn.

510
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:23,308
and i see my body
just laying there,

511
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,385
all the skin burned off.

512
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:31,271
do you really think
that cindy could do
something like that?

513
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:33,872
maybe, maybe not.
same result.

514
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,309
she took things too far.

515
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:38,727
did you cause the crash
the other night?

516
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,453
i was just having some
fun, making jimmy bash
her around a little.

517
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:49,483
i'm saving the real
thing for monday.

518
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,503
the 19th of february.

519
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:54,628
the day you died, a year ago.

520
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:00,677
well, i'm sorry.
i don't mean to make fun.

521
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:01,572
no, it's ok.

522
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,472
i'm used to people
being in tears
right about now.

523
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:04,577
ha ha!

524
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:06,311
i can just picture
gordon running around
like a ghost,

525
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:07,848
still trying to win races.

526
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,017
what a funny idea.

527
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:11,214
you know
i'm not kidding.

528
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,031
oh, no. you seem like
you really believe it.

529
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,495
he told me that he made
jimmy run into your car.

530
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:19,244
what do you want?

531
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:21,021
i think gordon's
trying to hurt you.

532
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:22,832
well, he couldn't do that
anymore than he already has.

533
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,789
he told me that he
taught you everything
about racing.

534
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:29,076
he did. but once i got
the hang of it,

535
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:30,896
i could make a car do
any damn thing i wanted.

536
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,167
my very first race
i won.

537
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,513
then i won the next one
and the one after that.

538
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,334
it was crazy.
right away, people
started to know my name.

539
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,110
gordon got so jealous.

540
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,821
he still thought he
was better than me,

541
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,474
and he never let
me forget it.

542
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,144
he even got a car
straight from japan

543
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:55,630
with raght-hand drive--
anything to get attention.

544
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:59,253
so, naturally,
i'd challenge him,

545
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,459
and i'd beat him.

546
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:03,363
over and over again.

547
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:06,207
i wasn't just gordon pike's
girlfriend anymore.

548
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,463
he was cindy brown's
boyfriend.

549
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:11,317
he said he was
your first love.

550
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:12,945
oh, he was. ha ha.

551
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:14,973
he was everything
i thought a man
was supposed to be.

552
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:16,619
and then he showed

553
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,012
he showed me what
was possible.

554
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,648
i mean, i never
thought i had any
kind of talent,

555
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,435
let alone this kind.

556
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:23,397
just one problem.

557
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:24,341
what?

558
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,153
once he saw
how good i was,

559
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:27,996
he wanted to put
the genie back
in the bottle.

560
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:29,884
like how?

561
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:31,836
he'd do anything to keep
guys from racing me.

562
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,483
what happened
the night he died?

563
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:38,021
gordon was pissed.
ray peters had never
been beaten before.

564
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,201
he had to wait in line
to race him.

565
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,535
me and you, finally.
man, i'm shaki

566
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:47,381
yeah, you will be.

567
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:50,770
you're the one i should be
racing, not your old man.

568
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:53,290
you're the one to beat,
from what i hear.

569
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:56,504
yeah, well, you have
to get past him first.

570
00:30:58,411 --> 00:30:59,144
done deal.

571
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,986
he was out of control
after that, and i guess ????

572
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:09,036
what do you mean?

573
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:10,413
i liked it.

574
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,191
i liked that ray
said what he said.

575
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,169
hell, it was more
of a compliment than
i ever got from gordon.

576
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:19,993
he thinks that you did
something to his car to
cause the crash that night.

577
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,151
i had nothing to do with
what happened to gordon.

578
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:24,696
ray peters ran him
off the track.

579
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:25,648
everyone knows that.

580
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,100
so, ray peters
caused the accident?

581
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:28,620
the king of
dirty tricks?

582
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:30,672
he probably did it just
coming out of the turn
where no one could see.

583
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:32,334
yeah, but gordon's
car blew up.

584
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:33,387
look!

585
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,735
i did love gordon,
even when i hated him.

586
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,240
you understand?

587
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:42,185
not really, no.

588
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:44,104
i would never have done
anything to hurt gordon.

589
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:45,483
not like that.

590
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:50,071
and if he is really
here like you say he is,

591
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:51,802
he knows it.

592
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:56,772
i feel like i've gone
from "west side story"

593
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:58,406
to "who's afraid
of virginia woolf."

594
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,467
it's just so weird.

595
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,001
two people who start out
loving each other

596
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:02,230
end up hating
each other.

597
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,125
how does that happen?

598
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,200
the question you gotta
ask is why do they keep
making it happen.

599
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:06,630
what do you mean?

600
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,843
well, i mean, everybody's
got a storeroom, right?

601
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,303
resentment, grudges, anger?

602
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:12,970
most people, they open
up that storeroom

603
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:14,087
and they let
a few of them out.

604
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,098
you know,
they deal with them.

605
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:15,943
they get rid of them.

606
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:19,244
something tells me that
your storeroom would be
standing room only.

607
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:22,788
yeah, sometimes i
gotta knock down the wall
into the next storeroom,

608
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,474
but the point is,

609
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,017
you
know, a couple, two people,

610
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:27,740
they start using those bad
things from that storeroom

611
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,486
against each other,
why stay?

612
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:31,153
why not move on?

613
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:32,563
maybe they're
getting something
out of it.

614
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:34,402
yeah. they need
to be miserable.

615
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:37,031
for some people, that's as
strong as the need to breathe.

616
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,055
it's like they're
feeding off each other,

617
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:40,528
like they're trying
to convince each other

618
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:42,044
that they don't
deserve to be happy.

619
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:43,710
mmm.

620
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,406
makes me glad i'm
basically a simpleton.

621
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:48,761
ha! far from it.

622
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:52,508
you gotta keep these
two people away from
each other for good.

623
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:54,369
how are you going
to do that?

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,830
i'm going to a guy
named ray peters.

625
00:32:58,247 --> 00:32:59,680
now you want me
to hang out with racers?

626
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:01,658
what i want is for you
to introduce me
to ray peters.

627
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,947
it's important.

628
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:04,205
ghost related?

629
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,576
yeah, if you must know.

630
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,510
i like to be kept a
little more in the loop.

631
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:09,116
you're unbelievable.

632
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,489
you could just think of me
as a sounding board.

633
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,762
look, are you going
to introduce me to
ray peters or not?

634
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,567
are you going to save me
from my mother hanging
me by my ankles?

635
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:17,547
you're lucky to have
a mother who cares
so much about you,

636
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:19,691
and we are not going
anywhere near cars.

637
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,518
do you know where
ray peters works?

638
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:37,677
so, the much feared
ray peters delivers pizza?

639
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:41,135
yeah.
very, very fast.

640
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:42,882
ok.

641
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,559
why is she asking me
so many questions, ned?

642
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:47,364
look, she's cool.
she's with me.

643
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,125
ok, i got it, ned.
thanks.

644
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,629
i want to talk about
that night.

645
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:51,997
do you remember
anything?

646
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,167
like i could forget it.

647
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:55,287
am i happy gordon
kissed the blue wave?

648
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:57,598
no. am i happy
it wasn't me? yes.

649
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:58,886
ok, about
the accident.

650
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,621
people say that
you ran gordon
off the track.

651
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,192
people can say whatever
they want to say.

652
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:03,269
ok, but did you,

653
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,438
'cause cindy
thinks you did.

654
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:05,565
what if i did?

655
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:06,483
i want to know.

656
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:08,469
not because
i want to cause
you any trouble,

657
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:09,864
but because
it's important.

658
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,041
whatever happened that night
is between me and gordon,

659
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:13,605
and gordon's dead.

660
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:15,448
so, i guess you will
really never know.

661
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:23,322
will i see you tonight?

662
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:25,134
um...

663
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,337
wait you're racing tonight?

664
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:27,810
you bet your ass.

665
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,278
i'm racing cindy brown,
finally.

666
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:34,292
in memory of gordon.

667
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,334
now you know why i like
to hang out with these guys.

668
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:46,430
you, in the store,
right now.

669
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:50,444
gordon: if it was ray peters,
how come i don't remember?

670
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,163
you said yourself you
didn't remember exactly
what happened.

671
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:54,862
cindy was always
messing with my car.

672
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:56,605
that's the only thing that
coul

673
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,172
not ray forcing me
off the track.

674
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,973
i don't think she'd do
anything on purpose.

675
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,340
i think she still
has feelings for you.

676
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:03,932
you think?

677
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:04,924
yeah, i do.

678
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,434
i don't
think she would ever
try to kill you.

679
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:10,968
look, make your peace,
gordon.

680
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:13,236
cross over.
be done with it.

681
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,411
there's only one thing
i need to cross over.

682
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:19,154
what?

683
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,289
and that's for her
to cross over with me.

684
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:23,415
and i'm going to make sure
that that happens.

685
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:26,023
come with me to
the garage and let me
help you talk to her.

686
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:28,899
you go.
tell her i said hello.

687
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:38,782
man: if you do this,
then you can forget
about turning pro.

688
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:40,614
cindy: this is more
important than turning pro.

689
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,124
what, revenge?

690
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:43,461
how about justice?

691
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:45,601
nobody ever did anything
about how gordon died.

692
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,484
they all just let it go.
and they think i don't care.

693
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:48,955
well, now they're going
to learn different.

694
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,430
i waited a year to do this.
poetic justice.

695
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,782
that's what gordon
would have liked.

696
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:53,893
people are going
to see you do it.

697
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,212
i've just got to force him
up into the wall,

698
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,646
and there's a good chance
he'll roll and he'll get
exactly what he deserves.

699
00:36:00,037 --> 00:36:01,103
[sigh] ray peters
killed gordon.

700
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,893
tonight i'm going
to return the favor.

701
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:30,405
cindy couldn't hurt
me if she tried.

702
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,756
i wouldn't
underestimate her.

703
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,640
why? because she thinks
i made gordon crash?

704
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,926
no, because she thinks
you made gordon die.

705
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,737
she can give me
her best shot.

706
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:44,556
look, you want to know
who killed gordon pike?

707
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:45,974
you really want to know?

708
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:46,549
yes.

709
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:48,415
gordon pike killed
gordon pike. that's it.

710
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:49,660
what are you
talking about?

711
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,309
he was trying to run me
off the track.

712
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:52,369
but i knew his move,

713
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:53,835
saw him do it
a hundred times.

714
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,011
i braked on him.

715
00:36:55,153 --> 00:36:57,720
he shot off my fender
and went into a bad
spin, rolled over.

716
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,573
i think he ruptured his
fuel tank, i don't know.

717
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,048
but when he hit the
ditch, his car blew.

718
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:06,077
he died because he
was trying to screw me
and it backfired.

719
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:07,895
is he right?

720
00:37:09,454 --> 00:37:10,321
gordon:
he was ready for me.

721
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,505
he knew what
i was going to do.

722
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,949
he used my own momentum
to put me into a spin.

723
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,175
what

724
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,016
i hit the nitrous to try
to power out of it.

725
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,302
everything went white.

726
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:23,404
who the hell
are you talking to?

727
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:24,471
come lets do it

728
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,232
????

729
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,400
i loosened the bolt on
her steering column.

730
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,102
what?

731
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:37,145
you're nuts.

732
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:05,387
stop the car!
stop the car!

733
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:18,712
????

734
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,921
??

735
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,198
???

736
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,692
????

737
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:31,167
???

738
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,040
no

739
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:48,144
watch out! watch out!
get out of the way!

740
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:50,604
let me in. watch out!

741
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:51,881
give her some room.
give her some room!

742
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:52,898
i'm ok! i'm ok.

743
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:53,764
what happened?

744
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:55,824
i don't know.
the steering went out.

745
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,768
i swear, i checked it,
cindy. it was tight.

746
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:00,285
it was him, wasn't it?

747
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:02,536
tell me. it was him!

748
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,463
ok, cindy, please.
he knows what happened,

749
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,456
how it wasn't you
and it wasn't ray.

750
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:08,449
it was his own mistake.

751
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,474
well, he just
tried to kill me!

752
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:10,592
no, he saved you.

753
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:13,002
he knew that
something was wrong,
and he saved you.

754
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:15,395
tell her i'm sorry.

755
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:16,953
he's here.

756
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,456
you felt him.

757
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:21,340
you could feel him
in that car with you.

758
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,908
i did.
i did feel him.

759
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,776
ok. he can hear you.

760
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:31,728
gordon?

761
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,722
do you really hate me
enough to want to kill me?

762
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:36,990
you want to be
better than me.

763
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,683
he knows that you wanted
to be better than him.

764
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,159
so, you turned on me?

765
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,185
you made me feel like i
was doing something wrong,

766
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:44,762
just because i got so good?

767
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:46,604
i thought it would take
you away from me. i...

768
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:49,382
he was afraid that
he would lose you.

769
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,500
the more he wanted
to stop me,

770
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,176
the more i wanted to
hurt him.

771
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,695
i'm sorry.

772
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:03,520
i'm sorry that you thought
i could do something

773
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:06,540
that horrible to you
that night, but...

774
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:11,395
i guess i would've
thought the same thing.

775
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:15,688
what does that say
about us, huh?

776
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,315
wait. is this it?
is that light for me?

777
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,067
it means you're ready
to cross over.

778
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:24,226
what?

779
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,963
can you tell her
that i needed her more
than i ever wanted to.

780
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:32,663
and that's why i pushed
her away and that's why
i held her so close.

781
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:37,025
and tell her
if she's smart,

782
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:38,384
she's going to
forget all about me.

783
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,694
she's never going
to forget you.

784
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,087
gordon!

785
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,079
no, i don't want
to forget about you.

786
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:44,863
you changed my life.

787
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:47,965
i--you made a difference.

788
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,342
just couldn't handle it.

789
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,418
i was screwed up.

790
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:01,540
if i had one more chance...

791
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,627
tell her to take
my chance for me.

792
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,010
hey.

793
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:24,838
what just happened?

794
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:27,238
he's gone.

795
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,240
gone for good?

796
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,907
it's up to you.

797
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,860
you can make a place
for him and he will
always be there.

798
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:37,336
hey...

799
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,097
there are some other
things he wanted me
to mention.

800
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:42,998
ok.

801
