1
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:19,823
Sit next to this man, Melinda.
We're gonna help him.

2
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:04,790
- Grandma...
- It's alright, honey.

3
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,170
You and your grandmother are
the only ones here who could see me.

4
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:20,555
Will you help me?

5
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,496
That's my wife.

6
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,106
We've been together for 26 years.

7
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:28,411
Then I had to go.

8
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:32,108
I had to go so quickly, I didn't
have time to say goodbye to her.

9
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:36,148
Didn't have enough time
to tell her how much I love her.

10
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,833
And she really needs to hear it now.

11
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,484
Will you give her that message for me?

12
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:45,345
How will she know it's from you?

13
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:55,762
Tell her I want her to keep having a
glass of champagne every Friday night.

14
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:59,763
I want her to light the fire
like we always did.

15
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,729
And make our secret toast
to the moon and stars

16
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,423
like we always did.

17
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:11,360
And tell her to never feel alone.

18
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,288
And then she'll know.

19
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,838
I don't understand.

20
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:13,041
I know honey. But you will.

21
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:53,195
Can't we sneak out?
They'll never miss us.

22
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,065
We haven't collected
all of our gifts yet. / Oh, true.

23
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,890
Besides, your Uncle Benny might fall into
the band stand and we can't miss that.

24
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:11,225
I think he was dancing with Ann,
that's what happened.

25
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:28,124
She kicked him with her boots.
Now, that may be the perfect couple.

26
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,195
Don't tell me you see something.

27
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,673
No...

28
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,270
- No, no, no way. It's nothing.
- That's good, that's good.

29
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:37,832
Because it'll be nice to keep
the celebration, you know?

30
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,553
- Among the living.
- The night is young.

31
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,615
Hey.

32
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,214
Don't tell me, I scared you.

33
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,943
Very funny. I just didn't know
if you were gonna make it.

34
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:00,456
You kidding? Finally get to see
my only brother settled down.

35
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:03,680
You guys look pretty delirious to me.

36
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:06,579
We're happy. We are, it's just...

37
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,409
Jim is struggling with the job a bit.

38
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:11,829
The only paramedic
who hates the sign of blood.

39
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,274
Someone died on him last week.

40
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,915
First time, he's just having
a hard time dealing with it.

41
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:20,234
One time I took a head off a roof in college.

42
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,917
Don't ask me what I was doing on the roof.

43
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:25,566
Broke damn more bones than I knew I had.

44
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:27,820
He was right there though.

45
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,262
I was scared to death.

46
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:32,656
- But the way he talked to me¡¦
- Yeah, I know.

47
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,895
The thing about Jim is,

48
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,064
he can take away your fear.

49
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,645
He makes more of a
difference than he knows.

50
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,663
He would so love to hear that from you.

51
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,412
I'm giving it to you.

52
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:49,204
Save it for when he's really
ready to throw in the towels.

53
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,921
You'll know.

54
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,347
Hey, Andrea.

55
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:18,782
Boss, no way.
You can not be here today.

56
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,035
It's just for the afternoon.

57
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,481
Jim's got some big surprise going
he wants me to stay away from.

58
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:25,758
And this is the only place
you can think of to come?

59
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:28,091
That is unbelievably sad for you.

60
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,301
Speak and Understand Latin.

61
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,477
A Conversation in Latin.

62
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,144
Latin for dummies.

63
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,635
Please not another hobby.

64
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,190
It is not a hobby.

65
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,069
I'm trying to improve my mind.

66
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:42,445
I thought you were teaching yourself
how to play the guitar. / I was.

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,994
Wicked blisters though.

68
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,459
Hey, you know. No one
actually speaks Latin anymore.

69
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,857
That is exactly what
appealed to me about it.

70
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,624
So, what does Jim have planned?

71
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,717
I don't know. He's ubssesed with
making up for no honeymoon.

72
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:56,376
As well he should be.

73
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:59,956
Well, let's see. Two weeks
in Bermuda or Andrea's salary?

74
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,256
Honeymoons are totally overrated.

75
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,308
What's this?

76
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,297
I don't know. I thought you brought it in.

77
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,124
Well, I've seen it before.

78
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,804
Or something like it.

79
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,556
I shouldn't have that
second bottle of wine.

80
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:36,165
You know, you only have to do this
for the doorway not the whole street.

81
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,670
Well now she tells me.

82
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,811
Alright, here we are. Final turn.

83
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,918
Our first night in our new home.

84
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,453
Let me make a note of that.

85
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,146
Alright, step one.
Move blind fold.

86
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,325
Thank you.

87
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,470
Step two...

88
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,265
Close one eye.

89
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,855
So, you'll only see the part
of it that's almost finished.

90
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,950
Damn, wrong eye.

91
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,865
I love it.

92
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,372
I love it, you must have
worked like a month of nights.

93
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,421
Yeah, don't be too impressed.
The inside still looks like Lego Land.

94
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:17,275
I don't care.

95
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,095
It's our home.

96
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,865
Our home.

97
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,518
Bad one?

98
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,185
The usual.

99
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:50,443
Have anything to do with what
you saw while we were dancing?

100
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:55,302
I thought you were
trying to give this a rest.

101
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:59,365
Yeah, when you find the remote
that turns it off, you let me know.

102
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,532
I'm just worrying about you, that's all.

103
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:06,287
- You're looking out for me, huh?
- No, I'm looking out for me.

104
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,874
You punch pretty hard
during those damn dreams.

105
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,427
Yeah, maybe I was
faking those bad dreams.

106
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,426
Just think you're backing a lot of pain.

107
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:18,850
Other people's pain, not mine.

108
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,183
Becomes yours.

109
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,772
Look who's talking, Mr. Paramedics.

110
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,697
- It's hard to get used to.
- What?

111
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,653
Being cared about so much.

112
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,245
I know my business

113
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,878
I'm taking it, I'm taking it, boss.

114
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,065
Help me.

115
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,727
In your house?

116
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,826
Yeah, it never happened before.

117
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,947
As we say in Latin.

118
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:11,106
What did Jim say?

119
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:14,459
You know I made an executive decision
not to spoil the moment.

120
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,147
Good call.

121
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,894
So, is there a difference between

122
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,728
a ghost that come right by your house
and the ones you see on the street?

123
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,185
No, they're all earth-bound spirits.

124
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,047
Just some of them are stuck heremore than the others.

125
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,666
Are there spirits here?
Right now?

126
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,192
- Only two.
- Right...

127
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:34,032
Here in this shop?
Where?

128
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,988
Well, there's an older woman sitting
next to that guy with the lap top.

129
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,088
Probably his mother.

130
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,270
What do they look like?

131
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,789
Well, if they have trouble coming
through they look pretty scary

132
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,700
but once they realize
where they really are

133
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:50,247
they start to look like you and me.

134
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:52,416
Go talk to her.

135
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,697
And the espresso guy?

136
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,463
There's an older guy standing right
behind him talking to him in Spanish.

137
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:01,481
He doesn't understand
why his son can't hear him.

138
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,322
Okay, you are really freaking me out.

139
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:05,633
Are you saying that
Village Drava is haunted?

140
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,551
No, places aren't haunted.

141
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,028
People are haunted.

142
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:11,476
So, then why is this guy haunting you?

143
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,080
He's lost.

144
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:44,435
Jim?

145
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,270
Hey?

146
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,691
What are you doing?

147
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:10,641
The wind.

148
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:14,595
Threw the top off of things.
I'm just trying it back on.

149
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,932
Go back in bed.
I'll be there in a minute.

150
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,234
The window just came off
in my hands.

151
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,555
That?

152
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,300
I meant for that to happen.

153
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,239
Be careful.

154
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,672
I don't know where I am.

155
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:48,881
I need you to help me.

156
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,688
They told me you could.

157
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,525
Who told you?

158
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,328
I don't know.

159
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,536
You're not supposed
to be in my home.

160
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:01,713
This is not how this works.

161
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:04,856
Please, I have to go home.

162
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,253
My wife is pregnant.

163
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,216
She doesn't know where I am.

164
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:13,144
What do you see around you?

165
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,557
I'm in a valley.

166
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,946
A low valley.

167
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,418
It's dark.

168
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,835
Please help me.

169
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,259
I don't know if I can.

170
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,863
What's your name?

171
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:32,461
Paul Adams.

172
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:37,243
I'm a sergeant from Fort Driscol.

173
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,449
Sorry, I know I said I'd be there at ten.
I'm on my way.

174
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,443
Na, it's okay.

175
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:54,454
There aren't many customers anyway.

176
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,431
Oh, stop trying to cheer me up.

177
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,546
Oh!

178
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,672
What? What?
Are you okay?

179
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,823
- Melinda?
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,997
I almost hit a dog.

181
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,644
I may just be just a few more minutes.

182
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,412
Vietnam War

183
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:46,031
Sgt Paul Adams, Jun 1972, MIA

184
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,359
I'm sorry about the mess.

185
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:08,995
We had a meeting last night that
unfortunately erupted into fibster cups.

186
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,801
- Politics?
- Baseball.

187
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:13,673
So, your boy there, Paul Adams.
He's from the village?

188
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,849
Yeah, I think so.

189
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:16,775
I'm trying to get the
family's information on him.

190
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,024
He was listed MIA in 1972

191
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,928
and my husband told me
that I should come and see you.

192
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:23,494
Cause if anyone should know,
you would.

193
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,026
I'm flattered above all the recognition.

194
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,688
Okay, so how can I be at service?

195
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:29,994
I don't really know.

196
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,778
Draft records, Enlistment records

197
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,613
anything that might trace his
whereabouts the year he went missing.

198
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:37,658
I know that he was
stationed at Fort Driscol.

199
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:41,114
Let me check on the computer
at the back and see what comes up.

200
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,373
I don't want to put you out.

201
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,445
Oh, yeah. I much rather
be sweeping up this day breed

202
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,482
than helping a beautiful
young thing such as yourself.

203
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,334
You can see me, can't you?

204
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,150
Oh, come on.

205
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:04,774
You can to, see me.
I'm not blind.

206
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,328
Alright, yes, yes, I can see you.

207
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:09,226
But you know what?
It's really not a good time.

208
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,577
It's a small thing.

209
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:13,153
You have to tell Joe
the key to the safe deposit box

210
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:15,298
is in the pocket of my blue rain coat.

211
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,286
I left it there the last time
I had it and

212
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:19,239
there's so many papersand insurance things...

213
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:20,865
How can I tell him something like that?

214
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,983
I mean, what's he gonna think?

215
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,359
Excuse me...

216
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,153
I am the one who's been
hanging around here for

217
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,407
who knows how long trying
to find someone to let him know.

218
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,493
So, who has the bigger problem?
You or me?

219
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:33,760
I came up with the same
last name but only a first initial.

220
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,984
Now there is an address
but who knows?

221
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,139
It could be a condo
or a mall by now.

222
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,758
Well, it's a good start.
And I really appreciate it.

223
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:41,900
Don't mention it.

224
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:46,989
Anytime you want to come by for a little
more skin related conversation, please do.

225
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,233
Umm.. you know.

226
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,192
You know what I really
have a bad habit of doing?

227
00:18:54,227 --> 00:19:00,993
Sometimes I leave really
important things in my coat pockets.

228
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,142
I forget about them.

229
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,595
What the hell
are you talking about?

230
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,049
Will you just tell him?

231
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,675
Okay, I know how
this is gonna sound

232
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,477
but I have a message
from your wife.

233
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:19,478
She wants you to know that the safe
deposit box key is in her blue raincoat.

234
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,113
Goodbye.

235
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,198
Yes!

236
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,201
Sorry, to bother you.

237
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:18,244
Do you know if a family named
Adams ever lived here?

238
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,416
Still do. Want to buy?

239
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,507
Tempting, especially cause
it's already built and all.

240
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,447
How long has it been in your family?

241
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:26,813
And you are?

242
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,109
Melinda Gordon.

243
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,506
I live on the other side of the village.

244
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,800
Michael Adams.

245
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:34,663
My parents used to live here.
When my mother died, I took it over.

246
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:36,659
Are you Paul Adam's son?

247
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,839
Why?

248
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:40,026
He served in Vietnam.

249
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,179
How do you know that?

250
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:43,322
Sorry.

251
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:46,219
I'm collecting information
on some local Vietnam vets.

252
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:49,764
And I found your father's name
at the VFW post.

253
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,751
I'm sorry,
I can't really tell you much.

254
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:55,582
But your father is listed MIA
did the army ever give you any...

255
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,888
No, they just said that he was MIA.

256
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,692
Presumed dead three months
before I was born.

257
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:03,127
There's a mark at the cemetery.

258
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,599
Nobody ever found him.

259
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,388
I'm so sorry.

260
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:11,946
Do you know what unit he was in?

261
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,434
Yeah, 5th infantry.
Red Diamonds.

262
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,120
He had a brown star
and a purple heart.

263
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,632
He was an expert marksman.

264
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,074
He was funny and reliable.

265
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:25,420
That's at least what my mom said.

266
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:28,696
He had very neat handwriting.

267
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:31,281
And you said
you couldn't tell me much.

268
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:35,319
My mom used to tell me
stories about him every night.

269
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,512
She wanted me to know him.

270
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,502
She wanted me to know
that he was a hero.

271
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,841
Please, tell me if you find out
anything about my dad...

272
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,328
Anything.

273
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:52,031
It's amazing how much you can
miss somebody you've never met.

274
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,927
I will.

275
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,895
But I don't want to keep you.

276
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,007
Thanks for talking with me
and I'll be in touch.

277
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,698
Oh, my god.

278
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:18,373
You must be dying to tell him.

279
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:22,276
Tell him what? That his dead father was
dripping mud in my living room last week?

280
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:24,200
Point taken. Probably not the best move.

281
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,766
Did he look like his father?

282
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:29,198
- Yeah, a little.
- Around the eyes.

283
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:32,561
- Was he single by any chance?
- No.

284
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:36,150
But the thing is, his wife is like,
9 months pregnant.

285
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,385
It made me realize something.

286
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,966
Paul told me that his wife was pregnant.

287
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:39,882
But what he doesn't realize

288
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,384
is that it's his son's wife
that's about to have a baby.

289
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:43,767
Not his wife.

290
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,711
You know, it really explains a lot.

291
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:48,406
Right, although not to me.

292
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:51,143
Whenever there's a
big change in a family

293
00:22:51,178 --> 00:22:52,694
like a child is about to be born.

294
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,905
It sends a ripple effect
to the spirit world.

295
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,476
It wakes up a spirit someone close.
That is why Paul's here.

296
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,340
Just really doesn't understand why yet.

297
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,101
- You're gonna have to tell him.
- I know.

298
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:06,827
Just have to wait
until he finds me again.

299
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,926
Who told you that I could help you?

300
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,124
Melinda!

301
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:00,514
Hey, hey, it's okay.

302
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:01,893
Just a dream.

303
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:04,932
- Sorry.
- Alright.

304
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,431
You're helping someone, aren't you?

305
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:12,092
I know I said I'd give it
a rest but I can't...

306
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,309
I can't help it.
He's a solider and...

307
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,654
You don't have to explain it to me.

308
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,437
Well, come just ask me
to keep it at arms length.

309
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,903
Remember the magic word.

310
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,621
Balance.

311
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:38,918
Vietnam June 1972

312
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:44,377
Vietnam June 1972

313
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,741
Lo Valley

314
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,406
Follow me.

315
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,011
Paul, you told me that you
were in a low valley of some kind.

316
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:23,376
I think you might have actually been
in the place called the Lo Valley.

317
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:25,874
L- O and...

318
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:29,046
I just need for you
to remember your last day there.

319
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,899
Remember what happened?

320
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:34,780
Sometimes, I see bits and pieces.

321
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,390
I remember being in a helicopter.

322
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:42,360
I could see tracers coming up
at us from the tree tops.

323
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,355
I could feel the chopper slipping.

324
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,957
I could hear the pain
and bullets off the hallway.

325
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:51,071
And I knew we were hit.

326
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:53,116
We were going down.

327
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,370
I remember seeing a waterfall
as we went down.

328
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,640
I remember thinking
how beautiful it was

329
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:02,506
and I was glad that the last thing
I was gonna see was pretty.

330
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,798
And I remember crying.

331
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,637
Because I was never
gonna see my baby.

332
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:24,049
In memoriam Paul Adams Vietnam Sgt
5th Infantry Division June 1972, MIA

333
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,081
Husband, Father, Hero
Gone but never forgotten.

334
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,118
It can't be.

335
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:37,922
My wife, she's pregnant.

336
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:42,233
She had a son, three months
after you were reported missing.

337
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:46,509
He's 33 now with a wife and
a baby of his own on the way.

338
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,837
I missed it all?

339
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,800
It's like I just woke up and...

340
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:58,019
now it's all over.

341
00:26:58,054 --> 00:27:00,532
You have a son
who is very proud of you.

342
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:03,284
He has all of your medals and

343
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,173
he knows everything about you.

344
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:07,937
My wife...

345
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:09,929
is she alright?

346
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,414
I'm so sorry.

347
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,766
He mentioned that
she died a while ago I think.

348
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,347
What's his name?

349
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,349
My son?

350
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:38,189
Michael.

351
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,815
That was my father's name.

352
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:48,746
That's what I wanted.

353
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:51,247
I just can't believe it.

354
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:55,151
I loved my life so much.

355
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,796
I was just getting started.

356
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,203
Can you...

357
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,643
Can you talk to my wife?

358
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:14,040
Can you let me see her?

359
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:16,133
I wish I could.

360
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:19,445
But I can only see spirits
who haven't crossed over yet.

361
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,063
Cross over where?

362
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,334
Into the light.

363
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:29,527
Does my son know how I died?

364
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:32,407
Just that you were reported MIA.

365
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,797
Will you...

366
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:40,502
Will you tell him?

367
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:49,856
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

368
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,881
You asked me to tell you if I got
any new information about your father.

369
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,250
And?

370
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,887
Your father died in a helicopter crash

371
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,276
above a place called Lo Valley.

372
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:06,655
I don't know much about the place except
it's pretty remote near a waterfall.

373
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,656
Maybe you can take
that information to the Pentagon

374
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:11,070
and see if they can
come up with anything.

375
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:13,197
How do you know this?

376
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,402
You should also know
that his last moments...

377
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:20,629
he was thinking of you.

378
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:24,045
He was heart broken that
he would never see his child.

379
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,682
What?

380
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,081
How could you know that?

381
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,053
Your father came to me for help.

382
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:31,921
I don't understand
what you're trying to say. Just tell me...

383
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:34,576
Look the thing is
I have a gift.

384
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:37,880
Your father is dead.
But his spirit is still here.

385
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:39,265
He just hasn't crossed over yet.

386
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,426
And he wants you to know
where he is and what happened.

387
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:47,553
I'm so sorry, I'm really
not explaining this very well.

388
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:54,071
I guess I didn't realize
how transparent I am.

389
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:59,204
There's been this giant hole in my life
as long as I can remember.

390
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:04,116
Even now, I feel lost.

391
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:07,333
I never got used
to him not being around.

392
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:13,215
It takes somebody like you to see that
and take advantage of it?

393
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,588
Get out of my house!

394
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:20,176
Look, I think this was your fathers.

395
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:22,317
And I know he'll want you to have it.

396
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:24,423
What kind of person would do this?

397
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,394
What kind of scam is this?

398
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:27,574
What's next?

399
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,809
Give you a hundred dollars and
send him a message for me?

400
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,145
You come into my house

401
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,363
you dishonor his memory
with this con job!

402
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:39,232
Get out!

403
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,535
Get! Out!

404
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,760
I didn't ask you for anything.

405
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:44,916
I don't want anything from you.

406
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:48,216
Just please call the Pentagon and ask!

407
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,080
Must be great having
supernatural powers.

408
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:55,088
Not really!

409
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:14,198
Jim?

410
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:17,183
Hope we have some wine.

411
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:18,820
Right here.

412
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:26,171
Did we forget to pay the light bill?

413
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:28,479
No, I have a headache.

414
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:31,859
And I crossed to wires in the basement.

415
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:33,730
Blew circuits.

416
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:36,794
That's why you're a paramedic
and not an electrician.

417
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,999
What's up?

418
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,191
Does it ever seem weird to you that
we're both kind of in the death business?

419
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:47,929
What?

420
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:50,799
You know, I used to think
in a funny kind of way...

421
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:53,849
I could keep them from you.

422
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,394
You know...

423
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,661
Lighten your load.

424
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,274
Stupid.

425
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:03,240
Hey.

426
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,331
What happened?

427
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:11,210
I almost lost another one today.

428
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:14,069
A 55 year old guy
just collapsed on the street.

429
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,893
You know, he was blue
before we even reached him.

430
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:19,741
I worked on this guy 20 minutes.

431
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:22,853
And the only thing
I can think the whole time

432
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:25,896
was 'I am not gonna let him
get to you. I swear'

433
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,154
I felt like I was gonna die
myself if this guy died.

434
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:30,894
Did he?

435
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,564
No.

436
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,192
I brought him back.

437
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:36,813
That's great.

438
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:40,876
Honey, I can not stand
both of us being this way.

439
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:45,776
You know, both of us dealing with...
who stays, who goes.

440
00:32:45,811 --> 00:32:47,504
I got to do something different.

441
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,290
You know, someday
I'm gonna make a mistake

442
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,385
and the next guy...

443
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,715
He's not gonna come back.

444
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:59,176
At least he's not
gonna come back to me.

445
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,352
What are you thinking?

446
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,067
I'm thinking about your brother.

447
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:14,917
What he said to me.

448
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,431
To you?

449
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,650
He died before we even met.
And it was a Summer after...

450
00:33:25,855 --> 00:33:27,998
He was at our wedding.

451
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:39,550
He was?

452
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,046
He's been with you all along.

453
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:44,507
Had to see you settle down.

454
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:48,270
Had to see you happy.

455
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,683
What did he say?

456
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:59,479
He talked about falling off the roof
and how you held him.

457
00:33:59,514 --> 00:34:01,868
- How you talked to him...
- I couldn't save him.

458
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:03,104
I was too late.

459
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,705
Hey.

460
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,898
No one could have saved him.

461
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,363
It was just his time. That's all.

462
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:13,529
But he wanted me to tell you something.

463
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:18,111
And he wanted me to wait till you
were really ready to throw in the towel.

464
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:20,664
He said, 'The thing about Jim is...

465
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:24,347
He knows how to take all your fear away.

466
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:26,588
People feel it.

467
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:30,046
He makes more of a
difference than he knows. '

468
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,695
He wouldn't want you to give up.

469
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,925
Look, if there is one thing that I know...

470
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:42,111
It's that what happens to these people
and their last moments, it really matters.

471
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,043
And you do great work.
No matter what.

472
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:53,576
We're in the life business.

473
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,948
Death is just a part of it.

474
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:56,015
Hi.

475
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,439
Hi.

476
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,148
My wife made me call the Pentagon.

477
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:05,478
Given the information
that you gave me?

478
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,685
They narrowed it down to
this place they believed

479
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,540
my father was assigned to.

480
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:13,326
In a chopper,
in June of 72.

481
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:14,911
They're working with
the Vietnamese government

482
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:18,758
to send a search team to see if...
they can find anything.

483
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:22,125
Where did you get this information?

484
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,207
How did you get this?

485
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,219
I told you the truth.

486
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:30,640
And I know it's really hard to believe
but I got my information from him.

487
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:36,184
Is this real?

488
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:39,838
I mean...

489
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:42,535
Can you really talk to my father?

490
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:52,496
Ask him if he still has the
last lighter I sent to his mother.

491
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,198
The one where I told her to put
beside a picture of me facing his crib.

492
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,363
Your father wants to know
if you have the last lighter

493
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:03,282
- he sent to your mother...
- Is he here?

494
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:05,844
Yeah, right here with us.

495
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:09,097
Yes, tell him yes.

496
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:12,041
Tell him, he grew up real good.

497
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,855
Tell him I'm proud of him.

498
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,463
He said you grew up really well.

499
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,541
And he's proud of you.

500
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:22,902
Did it hurt?

501
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:27,004
Was he in pain?

502
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:31,186
He doesn't really remember any of it.

503
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,501
He just remembers thinking of you

504
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,747
and your mother and he misses her...

505
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:40,987
Tell him... / He can hear you.
He's right next to me.

506
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:44,744
She...

507
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,957
She never forgot about you.

508
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:51,215
She told me storiesabout you every night.

509
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:55,513
Mostly happy ones
but sometimes sad ones.

510
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:58,927
She made you alive to me but...

511
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:02,272
just made me miss you more.

512
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:05,098
I mean, did you see me growing up?

513
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,670
Tell him, I've been lost.

514
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:10,202
But now I can.

515
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:12,664
I see his wife

516
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,906
and I'll see my grandchild.

517
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:19,232
I'll always be close by.

518
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,544
Always be watching.

519
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:23,682
He said he was lost

520
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:25,751
but now he can.

521
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:29,514
And he'll always be close by
He will always be watching.

522
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:34,199
We'll find you.

523
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:37,311
If I have to go there myself
and find you, I will.

524
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:39,678
I'll bring you back, I will.

525
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:43,930
Tell him, he has to go home.
Go home to his wife, she needs him.

526
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:46,240
It's all that matters now.

527
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:49,422
When that baby comes into his life.

528
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,570
Man, don't miss a second of it.

529
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:54,494
Not one second.

530
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,123
Nothing waits for you.

531
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:02,220
That's one thing that
he's got to remember.

532
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:06,326
He wants you to go
to your wife, she needs you.

533
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,791
I don't want to leave.

534
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:12,441
I mean, there's so much I want to know.
So many questions.

535
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,712
He wants you to...

536
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:20,307
He wants you to know that
everything you need is inside of you.

537
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:22,928
And if you get lost, you just...

538
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:26,560
You look at that compass
cause it got him home.

539
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:33,390
Tell him, I'll walk with him.

540
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,358
He wants to walk with you.

541
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:42,890
Thank you.

542
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,676
Dad?

543
00:39:56,707 --> 00:39:59,226
Are you there?

544
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,705
Oh, man. It's cold.

545
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:30,478
Do you have your keys?

546
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:33,706
I do / You always forget your keys.
Okay.

547
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,424
Hey, are you sure you
don't want me to go with you?

548
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,975
Go to work, I'll be fine.

549
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:46,844
You better miss me.

550
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,653
I do already.

551
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:07,367
Present arms.

552
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:18,829
Aim. Fire!

553
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:37,254
What do you think of your grandson?

554
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:40,636
It's funny. I look at him...

555
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:43,984
and I feel I can go now.

556
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,325
Can I?

557
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:51,921
Feels like it's time.

558
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,891
If you're ready, you should...

559
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,942
See something.

560
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,959
Or someone.

561
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,418
Is that what that is?

562
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:05,505
That light?

563
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,522
I don't know.

564
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:09,723
You're the only one that kind see it.

565
00:42:09,758 --> 00:42:11,969
I do see it.

566
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:14,309
Right over by that tree.

567
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:22,613
What? What do you see?

568
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,414
My wife.

569
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,117
She's standing right there.

570
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:32,375
She's telling me to come.

571
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:39,608
She looks as
beautiful as the day I left.

572
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:42,976
Can you see us?
