1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm married,

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,500
I live in a small town,

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,400
and I own an antique shop.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I might be just like you.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,900
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's all right, honey.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

10
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,900
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

11
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,704
and they come to me for help.

12
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:40,605
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:47,709
Anyway so the great thing about antiques
is their connection with the past

14
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,700
and all the stories behind them.

15
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:54,600
Um, vintage is really hot right now.

16
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:58,601
And I sell tons of these
1930s bed jackets.

17
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:02,903
This one actually belonged to the Thelma Sedgwick estate.

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:08,803
But most importantly, ladies,
it looks hot with a pair of jeans.

19
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:12,601
You.

20
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,903
So, like, how much money do you make?

21
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:26,403
You know what? Actually,
that's a great question.

22
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,902
- Thank god that is over!
- Ah, come on. That was fun.

23
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,701
If I didn't have to work nights
all week, I'd come back tomorrow.

24
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,503
Ooh, listen to you,
mr. Big man on campus.

25
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,002
I'd rather poke myself in the eye
than have to go back in there.

26
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,103
Ha ha. It sounds like
you had a rough crowd.

27
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:45,500
No. It's just i don't think
they got the concept, you know?

28
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,402
Antique to them is an mp3 player
with no video screen.

29
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:52,701
So how did your real estate talk do?

30
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:56,901
Great. I just hooked them with "you can
make $1 million before you're 30" line.

31
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,701
It worked.

32
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:02,101
Oh, isn't that, uh--oh, shoot.
I forgot her name.

33
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:06,502
- The new girl.
- Right. Village java.

34
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:11,402
- You have a little mocha right there.
- That's her lipstick, stupid.

35
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,203
Oh, my bad.

36
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:19,701
See, that's how I pictured you in high school.

37
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,401
Not quite.

38
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,602
Do it.

39
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:50,802
They did it to you.

40
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:22,702
Episode 2x15
"Mean Ghost"

41
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,503
It can't be broken.

42
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:34,101
We're already down two girls,
and semifinals are days away.

43
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:35,201
Tell him!

44
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:37,400
Ok, let's not panic until we get an x-ray.

45
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,502
- It might just be sprained.
- This is your fault. You pushed me!

46
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,902
- Ok, I don't think anyone--
- I wasn't even close to you.

47
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,803
Did you see what happened?

48
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:48,003
Yeah. Kind of.
It looked like an accident.

49
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,803
Didn't I see you in the cafeteria
this morning?

50
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,802
I'm here for career week.
Melinda Gordon.

51
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:54,603
Jackie Boyd.
I coach cheerleading.

52
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,301
- You think she's out?
- Well, it's not just her.

53
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:59,202
We've had two other accidents
these last two weeks.

54
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:00,901
Three girls down now.

55
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:05,201
Makes for kind of a lopsided pyramid.

56
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:11,200
Ok, people, you all have better
things to do, so go do them.

57
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:17,903
- There you go. One dry half-caf.
- Thanks.

58
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:23,501
- Uh, what was your name?
- Oh. Madison, Maddy. Either one.

59
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,201
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, the coffee was hot.

60
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:31,301
Oh. Sorry.

61
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:34,102
Oh, jeez. Voodoo girl's working.

62
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,902
What about that accident
with the cheerleader?

63
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,102
That was kind of freaky, huh?

64
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,401
Screw it. I've got chem lab.
I need my buzz.

65
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,302
Um, no, not really.

66
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,902
I mean, that's why there's seat belt laws.

67
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:54,302
Two non-fat capps, please.
And could you maybe make those better

68
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:58,001
than that piss water
you gave me yesterday?

69
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:01,701
Sure. I'd be delighted to.

70
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,002
Ok. Talk about a walking
fashion faux pas.

71
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,903
I mean, that nose thing.
Fine, we can deal with that.

72
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm so-- so sorry.

73
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:15,001
- I don't know how that happened.
- Do you know how much this costs?

74
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:19,402
Oh, my god.
You are gonna pay for that.

75
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,902
Hi! How's your cheerleader?

76
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,501
Which  one? The one that fell out
of the moving car

77
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,500
or the one that fell
10 feet off the bleachers?

78
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,501
Well, I was gonna see if I could
come by your practice,

79
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,101
but maybe now is not a good time.

80
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,603
No. Maybe you should.

81
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:38,801
It might be good for the girls
to have an audience.

82
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:12,502
Watch out!

83
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:23,903
Why are you doing this?
I can help you.

84
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:27,102
They did it to me.

85
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,801
You are so dead.

86
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,703
Hey, I didn't do anything, except for
stand here, watching you being lame.

87
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,602
Go, team. Rah, rah.

88
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:40,401
Look, maddy. Whatever creepy mojo
you're into, it's not gonna work.

89
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:44,001
I don't care how many lizard heads you
bite off. We're going to regionals.

90
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:45,803
Just let it go. Don't stress.

91
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,301
You're right Curt. We wouldn't want
her to stress. She might mess her hair.

92
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:54,901
You ever think all this bad luck
is just karma for you bagging
your dead friend's guy?

93
00:06:55,007 --> 00:07:01,300
You know what? She is so noxious.
Ok? She's not worth it. She never was.

94
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,503
You had a cheerleader die recently.

95
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:12,802
Yeah. Tais.

96
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:15,402
Just about this time last year.
It was an accident.

97
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:19,503
- A cheerleading accident?
- No, it was really a freak thing.

98
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,503
She got locked in the boiler room.
She died trying to get out.

99
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,502
Do you know why she was down there?

100
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,801
I'm not sure,
but it's kind of a hangout.

101
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,201
Well, it was.

102
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:33,301
Since the accident, no one goes
down there. Why are you asking?

103
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:38,300
It's just that grief can
come out in such weird ways.

104
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,002
I'm sure that all of this
has really thrown the team.

105
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,700
I know a little bit about grief, too.

106
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:47,901
And sometimes the best thing we do
is to just keep focused

107
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:49,301
and work your butt off.

108
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,702
Get through it.

109
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,802
That's what I try to teach
these girls anyway.

110
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,500
- Maybe they need another outlet.
- Look, they've had counseling.

111
00:07:55,606 --> 00:08:00,902
They've had time off.
All they need to do is focus now.

112
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:05,101
Hey, you know, it was intense,

113
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,901
what happened with Rana and Maddy.
What's up?

114
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,502
I give up trying to figure out
these girls' social lives,

115
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:14,600
but clearly, maddy's one
that just doesn't fit in.

116
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:25,402
Melinda, I heard about
what happened today.

117
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:26,403
You did?

118
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,402
You can tell me.
Is it true?

119
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,700
Is what true?

120
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:33,400
That you're a total freak!

121
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,301
Freak!

122
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:38,203
Freak.

123
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:41,100
A total freak.

124
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,402
Freak! 

125
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,602
Hey, open up!

126
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:05,603
Tais, what happened down here?

127
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,601
Please. I wanna help you.

128
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,601
I want justice!

129
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,503
Sorry. That was my fault.

130
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,401
No. It's fine.

131
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:30,101
Hey, uh, you're that
antique chick, right?

132
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:31,902
Yeah. It pretty much feels that way.

133
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:35,000
Way to keep going, even though
nobody was listening.

134
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,802
A wesome.

135
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:40,203
Um, can I ask you a question?

136
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,100
Ok.

137
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,702
Well, according to Maddy,
you were Tais' boyfriend.

138
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:48,802
So why do you think all these
accidents are happening?

139
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:51,402
Uh, I don't know.

140
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:55,500
I guess everybody's still a little
freaked out, especially Rana.

141
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:56,903
Especially?

142
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,703
Yeah. They were, like, best friends.
You know, really tight.

143
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,200
And now you're going out with Rana?

144
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:08,104
- Well, yeah. But it wasn't like--
- I didn't mean it that way.

145
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:11,605
Is  that a yearbook?

146
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,709
Yeah.

147
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,000
Can I borrow it?

148
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,201
Sure. What for?

149
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,103
Well, because, you know, I'm asking,

150
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:21,800
and you're a nice guy who wants
to help out the antique chick.

151
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:26,300
Cool.

152
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,103
Rana.

153
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,101
Do it.

154
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,900
- What's happening?
- Do it!

155
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,903
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

156
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,303
Who are you talking to?

157
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,803
Do it to them.
They did it to you.

158
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:09,402
"Do it to them. They did it to you"?
What does that mean?

159
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:12,602
Ok. Why are you doing
our justice cheer?

160
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,502
Do it. Do it.

161
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,503
That'll get you some air.
Come on! Let's get out of here.

162
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,701
Don't touch me!
You're a freak.

163
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:33,100
What the hell is this?

164
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,902
No one else was in there.

165
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,700
I'm sorry about all this.

166
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,703
I'll figure it out, ok?

167
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,801
See you tomorrow.

168
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,602
She's a little freaked out.

169
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,201
Yeah. I imagine she would be.

170
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,103
How did you get to be
in the locker room?

171
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,202
I was in the gym,
and I heard her screaming.

172
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,801
What were you doing in the gym?

173
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,103
Wait a minute.

174
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,303
- You're not thinking...
- I don't know what I'm thinking.

175
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,203
Rana said you were talking to someone,
but there was no one else there.

176
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,000
It may have appeared that way, but--

177
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,503
Look, Melinda,

178
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,302
I appreciate it if you're trying to help.

179
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:15,203
But how about you just
stick to career week, ok?

180
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,703
Sorry.

181
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,301
Jackie...

182
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,600
what's the justice cheer?

183
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,803
Why?

184
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,500
Rana was saying it before.

185
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,701
She was upset so i thought
maybe it made her feel better.

186
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:32,102
It's a football cheer,
when we're losing.

187
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:38,700
"Push it, push it, push it on through.
Do it to them like they did it to you."

188
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:42,200
Curt said that Tais and Rana were best
friends. Why is Tais attacking her?

189
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,100
You said Curt's going out
with Rana now. Case closed.

190
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:48,500
I don't think so. Otherwise she'd be
going after curt, too. And she isn't.

191
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:50,000
But there is the goth girl--Maddy.

192
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,403
And Rana accused her of being into
some kind of creepy mojo stuff.

193
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:57,001
You know, maybe Maddy is into
some kind of witchcraft.

194
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,001
What, do we believe in witchcraft now?

195
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,102
Who am I not to believe in anything?

196
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,001
Besides, it would explain why Tais is
hanging out with the social outcasts

197
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:05,700
and attacking her best friend.

198
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:09,003
Ah, high school. It makes Washington
politics look like preschool.

199
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:11,302
There's not much else I can do
at the high school.

200
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:14,201
You should have seen the way the coach
looked at me, like I was a total freak.

201
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,403
And that's how I felt,
you know, like a total freak.

202
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:19,601
I was right back in
my old high school,

203
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,201
and everybody was looking at me
like I have two heads.

204
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:23,602
I've seen your high school pictures.

205
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:28,202
In fact, I've looked
at them quite a lot.

206
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:31,503
You were never a freak.

207
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,503
A big nerd maybe, but not a freak.

208
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,902
- You're really good at comforting me.
- Anytime.

209
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:39,401
You want some more tea?

210
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,001
Please, you gotta help me.

211
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:45,200
Peggy will fail science
if I don't get it turned in.

212
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:46,502
Ok, not now.

213
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:50,002
You know, she's a nice girl, and she's
not very science-minded, but, oh, man.

214
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:56,200
She's cute! No, it's in my locker right
there. Right there. It's in my locker.

215
00:15:56,306 --> 00:16:00,400
She needs it right now. 5-22-10!
Say it. 5-22-10.

216
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:02,801
Ok, I am not your errand girl, all right?

217
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,301
Now, go into that light.

218
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:07,502
There are some very nice
non-science-minded girls in there.

219
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:09,701
So just shoo, please.

220
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:13,702
Melinda?
Who are you talking to?

221
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:27,401
You ok?

222
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,401
Yeah, sorry. I just drifted for a minute.

223
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:35,801
- All right. I'm going to go up.
- Ok. I'll be up soon.

224
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:47,001
I just don't know how
this is any of your business.

225
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:51,300
You know what? It's not.
But I'm asking anyway.

226
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,001
Jackie told me that you and Tais
were friends.

227
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:57,400
So? I was stupid once.

228
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,701
- You think I locked her in
the boiler room? - Did you?

229
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,800
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Killed her dead.

230
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,700
Good riddance, too.

231
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:12,302
Wow. You know, I am impressed
by how tough you are.

232
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:17,301
But I am just trying to find out
what happened before Tais died

233
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:22,102
and if it has anything to do
with what's happening now.

234
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,400
I thought we were friends.

235
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,003
I was wrong.

236
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:28,003
So why did you join the team?

237
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,601
I was into dance.

238
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:33,402
Modern stuff, my own choreography.

239
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:36,503
I was doing a piece one day on the field.

240
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:40,000
It was my second week,
when nobody even talked to me.

241
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:44,402
But  Tais, she saw what I was doing and

242
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,603
asked me to be on the team
just like that.

243
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,200
Is that when you became friends?

244
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:55,201
Tais was the only one who never
treated me like I was a freak.

245
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,901
And if you're cool with Tais,
then you're in.

246
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,202
Everyone liked my house the best 
because my dad let us stay up late

247
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:05,003
and eat junk food.

248
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:06,602
It was the best when it was
just the three of us.

249
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:10,701
We'd read out of our journals
and talk about everything--

250
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:15,603
what boys we liked, school,
problems with our families,

251
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:19,403
our deepest, darkest secrets.

252
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:23,101
Man, I really trusted them.

253
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:27,900
I was popular.
I had friends.

254
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:32,502
And I was really good at something.

255
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:37,603
And  then I woke up.
And it was all just a dream.

256
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:40,200
The end.

257
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:45,100
So what happened?

258
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,300
Why'd you wake up?

259
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,703
You ask too many questions.

260
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:53,001
Bye.

261
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:36,002
Fire, water, moon, and sun.
We come to you all as one.

262
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:41,902
The wrath and ire that she creates
return to her a crueler fate.

263
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:51,500
Fire, water, moon, and sun.
We come to you all as one.

264
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:57,400
The wrath and ire that she creates
return to her a crueler fate.

265
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:31,202
They left me to die.

266
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,400
You have no idea which of those girls
was burned in effigy last night?

267
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:48,200
Whoever it is is Maddy's next target.

268
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:54,300
All right, so a group of outcasts get
together to put hexes on cheerleaders.

269
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:57,602
You know, if word gets out, this
could be a pretty popular teen sport.

270
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,303
Except these girls are clueless,

271
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:02,901
because it's not spells that are
bringing down cheerleaders. Tais is.

272
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,200
- But why would Tais want to
hurt her friends? - I don't know.

273
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:10,403
Maybe she thinks they're
responsible for her death.

274
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:13,401
You think those herbal pouches
they found in the boiler room

275
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,800
- have something to do with it?
- Doubt it.

276
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:17,903
Maddy didn't want Tais
to be a part of her ritual.

277
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,702
In fact, she didn't even know
that she was there.

278
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,301
But she did mean to hurt cheerleaders.

279
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,903
Right. So maybe her coven's angry
energy is influencing Tais somehow.

280
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,901
Look, if they were down there
in the boiler room with those herbs,

281
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:30,701
maybe Tais attached herself
to them there.

282
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,100
So the justice that Tais is looking for
is about Maddy and her friends, not her.

283
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:38,202
That's because she didn't read
the first rule of the Wiccan faith--

284
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:39,601
"do no harm to others."

285
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:45,101
Ok, well, maybe this is
the teen angst version of Wicca.

286
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:47,903
Oh, my god.

287
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,401
Come on. I'm fine.

288
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:12,101
Drop it. You're not working out on that leg.

289
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,201
Jackie!

290
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:41,800
Jackie, what happened?

291
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,501
A girl fell in practice.

292
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:46,200
She was out for a few minutes,
but they think she'll be ok.

293
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,803
I'm so sorry.

294
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:50,403
I should have canceled the season
before it got this bad.

295
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:53,003
I don't think that would've helped.

296
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:55,801
You know, you said something to me before

297
00:23:55,906 --> 00:24:00,102
that you know something about grief.

298
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:05,501
I lost my little brother 5 years ago.

299
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:09,203
He was only 9. And I never
let myself stop to think about it.

300
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,803
Never.

301
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:14,101
I took this job,
tried to make a difference.

302
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,702
I kept busy.

303
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,700
And I thought the same thing should
happen with these girls, you know,

304
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:24,002
that they'd get over it quicker
if they just kept moving forward.

305
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:28,801
Jackie, everybody has to feel their
feelings, no matter how much it hurts.

306
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:32,201
I feel them, all right.
I just don't talk about them.

307
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,303
And I guess I expected
the same thing with these girls,

308
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,600
you know, for them to just
suck it up and go on.

309
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:40,502
I told them Tais was the heart
of the team and they were the soul.

310
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:43,200
Well, you were right about that.

311
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:45,102
And you did get these girls
to the semi-finals.

312
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:47,002
So there is something good
in all of this.

313
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,901
Yeah, beat up, demoralized,

314
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,402
and wondering who's gonna
fall on their ass next.

315
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:52,903
"Way to go, Jackie."

316
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:55,400
You know what?
This is not your fault.

317
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:58,703
Ok? Maybe there is just some
bad energy around the team.

318
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,602
Not for long.

319
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:24,302
Cut the crap.
I know what you're doing.

320
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm a dabbler in the
spirit world myself.

321
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:29,900
Oh. You wiccan?
I don't think so.

322
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:34,200
Except I skipped witchcraft and
went straight to seeing dead people.

323
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:36,802
I saw Tais' spirit in your fire.

324
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:40,203
Oh, see, now I know you're full of it,
because if Tais was here,

325
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,503
we'd be the last people
she'd hang with.

326
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:46,102
It's not your hexes that are
hurting cheerleaders. Tais is.

327
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,601
Well, if that is true,
that is, like, really beautiful.

328
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,401
That is like the ultimate
poetic justice.

329
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:54,602
Your negative energy
is like a drug to Tais.

330
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,600
And I'm asking you to stop
until I can cross her over.

331
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,003
Why should I help Tais?

332
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,602
Because if you don't,
you're no better than them.

333
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:03,400
That girl turned on me
and all the others.

334
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:07,202
Maddy, please don't do this.

335
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:11,900
Try and stop me.

336
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:22,103
Jackie told me that you
didn't really want to talk to me.

337
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,600
Are you serious?

338
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:26,201
In the locker room, you were,
like, totally talking to yourself.

339
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:28,501
Then you went all Rambo
and broke that window.

340
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,003
What do you think is going on, Rana?

341
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:34,403
- Do you think Maddy's doing something?
- Maddy is like the devil, ok?

342
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,601
She was totally normal one day,
and then she's out of, like,

343
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,901
- a Tim Burton movie the next.
- Right. After you guys turned on her.

344
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,801
Yeah. How good a move was that!

345
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,202
It was like I saw the
writing on the tea leaves.

346
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:46,701
I think you mean the
writing on the wall.

347
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,903
What are you, my english teacher now?

348
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:53,100
Whatever. I just know that we speak,
Maddy's probably sticking some big pin

349
00:26:53,206 --> 00:26:55,100
into a doll with my name on it.

350
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:59,400
What happened with you and Maddy,
with everybody and Maddy?

351
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,800
You mean, why did we 
kick her off the team?

352
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:04,302
Well, I got the feeling that she quit.

353
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:08,001
In her dreams. We totally exited Maddy
because of what an enormous liar

354
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:11,302
she turned out to be.

355
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:13,503
We'd just found out
that we'd made the semifinals.

356
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:16,100
Maddy was supposed to fly out
to France for the break,

357
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:19,902
but we were so psyched that we wanted
to tell her, catch her beforehand.

358
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:24,802
We were totally floored
by what happened next.

359
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:28,102
Mr.  Strom?

360
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:31,201
Dad! That was mrs. Frawley.
She wants you to send the car...

361
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:34,202
to the airport.

362
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:39,402
The place wasn't even theirs. Her dad
was like jeeves the butler or whatever.

363
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:42,403
You know, it was just some
rich family's summer house.

364
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,800
I totally lost all respect
for her after that.

365
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:46,201
Because she wasn't rich?

366
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:50,502
No. Well, yeah,
but, I mean, come on.

367
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,401
She was poor, but I could
have gotten over that.

368
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,802
You know, I'm not a total bitch.

369
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:57,301
So what was it really?

370
00:27:57,405 --> 00:28:01,603
I mean, I trusted her. I told her
everything. And she lied to my face.

371
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,402
Our entire friendship
was just a big fake-out.

372
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:06,903
I couldn't be friends
with her after that.

373
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:09,003
Neither could Tais.

374
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:13,303
Must be nice to be
so sure about everything.

375
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,101
Not always.

376
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:21,603
It just got me.

377
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:23,801
Ok, I know it's wrong that Maddy lied,

378
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:27,202
but I don't think those girls would
have been friends with her if she hadn't.

379
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,401
And if those girls just cared more
about who people were and less about

380
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:32,301
what they look like
or how much money they had

381
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:37,303
or if they made fools
of themselves in a hallway.

382
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:39,803
I'm sorry. They're just so cavalier.

383
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:42,200
They have no idea how much
pain they inflict,

384
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:45,700
you know, when you're already
at your most vulnerable in life.

385
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,300
You know, I wish I had
known you back then.

386
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:51,001
I'd have kicked some ass
and taken names.

387
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:53,301
You would have, wouldn't you?

388
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:56,003
Hey, tell me what you're doing
before I have to go.

389
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,802
Remember those herb pouches
that I found at the boiler room?

390
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:02,103
Well, I did a search on all
the witchcraft and spell sites,

391
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:04,502
because I thought maybe it was a curse,
but nothing was coming up.

392
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:08,503
So then I did a broader search.

393
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:12,900
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

394
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:16,002
Or maybe it does.

395
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:28,800
Look, I don't have anything else
to say to you.

396
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:34,900
I found this in the boiler room, and
I thought maybe you had put it there.

397
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,402
Good going, Sherlock.

398
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:39,502
I didn't really know why
until I looked up what it meant--

399
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:41,503
a spell for forgiveness.

400
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:44,000
Rana told me about the lie
you tried to pull off with them.

401
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:47,301
Is that what you needed forgiveness for,
or was it something else?

402
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:49,301
Did you do something to Tais?

403
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:53,200
Look, I didn't ask to be in their
stupid clique. They invited me.

404
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,201
What did you do to Tais?

405
00:29:55,308 --> 00:30:00,203
What did you need forgiveness
for down in that boiler room?

406
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:04,303
Tais sent me a note before she died.

407
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:07,801
She said that she wanted
to meet up and talk,

408
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:13,501
that our friendship was too important
to lose over something so petty.

409
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,400
So what happened?

410
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:18,303
I never went.

411
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:22,702
I was too mad or ashamed or

412
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:26,502
just messed up.

413
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:31,800
I never went, and Tais died
down there waiting for me.

414
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:35,200
So you didn't actually
do anything to Tais.

415
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:38,502
No. And, you know, I don't care
if you believe me or not.

416
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:43,001
I'm just really sick
of the whole thing.

417
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:50,900
I'm not going back out there. I'm done
with the spells. I've made my point.

418
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:56,200
If you want Tais to move on,
tell her to move on, ok?

419
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:43,301
All right. That's it.
I want to talk to you this instant!

420
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:47,301
- Wow. You sound like my mom.
- You can stop now, ok?

421
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:50,202
Maddy broke up the coven.
She's really over it.

422
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:52,802
And you may still be feeling
negative energy, but it'll wear off.

423
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:54,300
That is so random.

424
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:56,301
Like Maddy has anything to do
with why I'm here.

425
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:58,400
You're feeding off of her energy.

426
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:01,100
All of the goth girls, their anger
is giving you strength.

427
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:02,703
Yeah. Right.

428
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:04,803
Why would you go after them?

429
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:08,301
- I mean, they were your friends,
your own kind. - No.

430
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:12,101
I hate them.
I hate them all.

431
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,602
Rana, come on.

432
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:16,100
Rana, don't.

433
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,500
Wait!

434
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:26,501
Hey! Rana!

435
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,801
Rana! Rana, help!

436
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,802
They left me in there to die.

437
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:04,103
They didn't care,
especially not Rana.

438
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:08,000
Took my boyfriend, the team...

439
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:12,403
Maddy was the only one who cared.

440
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,801
I felt badly about
how I treated Maddy.

441
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:32,403
Ok, so all you have to
do now is tell Maddy that.

442
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:35,403
She'll be really happy, believe me.
She feels like she's responsible.

443
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,702
I know who's responsible.

444
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,503
And Rana knows.

445
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,301
And all those pretty cheerleaders,

446
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:43,700
they're never going to be
champions without me.

447
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,700
Is that what this is about?

448
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:48,002
You didn't get your chance,
so they don't have theirs?

449
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,202
This is about justice.

450
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:55,103
And I'm just doing to them
what they did to me.

451
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:06,602
This better be good.

452
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:08,803
- I don't get up this early
for anybody. - It's important.

453
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,400
I don't want one of your girls
to get hurt before the semi-finals.

454
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:13,702
Is that what you think, that
the girls are caving under pressure?

455
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:16,803
Yeah. Something like that. I need you
to get a hold of Rana and Maddy.

456
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:19,003
- They'll be here in 30 minutes.
- Ok. And I need you to tell them

457
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:23,602
to meet us in the boiler room.
And I need you to have a little faith.

458
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,503
Ok. No one else is getting hurt.
It's time to solve this. Rana,

459
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,802
I need you to tell me what went wrong
between you and Tais.

460
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,700
- You think I had something to do with--
- Rana, this is not "judge Judy."

461
00:34:34,805 --> 00:34:38,400
Just tell the girl
what she wants to know.

462
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,702
We had a fight.
So what?

463
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:44,000
Fine. I don't need you guys.
You want to be that way, I'm out.

464
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:46,000
- I don't need you.
- Good riddance.

465
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:48,102
The last thing we need
is a fake we can't trust.

466
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:51,601
It's true, Maddy. I like you,
but the trust isn't there.

467
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,403
When we fly into the air, we need to
know someone will be there to catch us.

468
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:56,203
That's bull!

469
00:34:56,306 --> 00:35:00,001
When you guys thought I was rich,
you didn't worry about me catching you.

470
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,603
You're kicking me off the team
because I'm not like you.

471
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:05,502
And I am so glad.

472
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:08,503
Screw you both.

473
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:15,001
We weren't too hard on her, were we?

474
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:16,700
Maddy, what happened next?

475
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:21,602
I, um, I got a note from Tais
to meet her here.

476
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,402
But I didn't go.

477
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,903
But Rana did.

478
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:36,302
I sent them both notes. They were both
supposed to meet me there, just like now.

479
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,601
You got a letter, too, didn't you?

480
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:41,202
How did you know?

481
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,103
Remember what I told to you,
you were gonna have to have some faith?

482
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:46,403
Ok.

483
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:51,403
Tais is here with us right now in spirit.

484
00:35:57,105 --> 00:36:00,903
You freak!
You brought her ghost back.

485
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,503
Stop it.

486
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:05,501
Tais is here,
but not because of Maddy.

487
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:08,400
Ask her to tell what happened next.

488
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:14,501
She wants you to tell us all
what happened after you got the note.

489
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:18,801
I figured Tais wanted to give me
a pep talk before the competition.

490
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:21,403
But it wasn't a pep talk.
It was worse.

491
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:23,703
I think we need to let
Maddy back on the team.

492
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,800
- Are you bent? Why?
- We need her, for one thing.

493
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:30,002
- Look at the moves she gave us.
- She is a loser, Tais. She lied to us!

494
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,602
Because she knew we wouldn't even
talk to her if we knew the truth.

495
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:34,803
Oh, so now you're, like,
taking her side?

496
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:37,300
It's not about sides, Rana.
I liked her.

497
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:41,701
She was kind of cool.
She's different.

498
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:46,401
So Tais liked me because
I was different?

499
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:51,602
You were special,
not like the other girls.

500
00:36:51,706 --> 00:36:53,802
You were smart and quirky.

501
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:56,701
She's saying that you were unique.

502
00:36:56,806 --> 00:37:00,101
There was no one else like you,
and she missed you.

503
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:03,903
Ok, I'm sorry.
You lost me at "Tais is here."

504
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:08,202
I'll try and explain it later.
Just go with me.

505
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:10,902
It's true.

506
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,000
She is here.

507
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,600
I--I can feel her.

508
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:20,200
She's not angry anymore.
That's why you can feel her.

509
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,701
Tais...

510
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,603
we were friends for so long.

511
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:29,700
I just--I wanted you all to myself.

512
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:32,301
I wanted to be your best friend.

513
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:34,502
No way! I am not letting her back in!

514
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:35,601
She's our friend.

515
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,201
You better figure out who your
real friends really are, Tais.

516
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,803
Rana, come on.

517
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:43,502
Rana, don't.

518
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,603
Wait.

519
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:49,600
I didn't know that the door
would lock behind me.

520
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:52,702
I didn't know...

521
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:56,901
until they told me they found her.

522
00:37:57,006 --> 00:38:00,801
I didn't tell the police
because I was so messed up.

523
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:04,101
It was all my fault.

524
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,902
It was an accident?

525
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes.

526
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:14,700
Just a stupid accident.

527
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,900
What have I been doing?

528
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:18,200
It's not your fault.

529
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:24,903
You were stuck in the middle of something
that never should've even happened.

530
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,101
It's not their fault either.

531
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:34,103
Please tell them that...

532
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:37,301
I don't blame them.

533
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:41,302
She's saying that she doesn't
blame either one of you.

534
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,700
She knows it was an accident.

535
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:48,802
All I wanted was for us
to be like before.

536
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,701
I could never have
as good a friend as Rana.

537
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,701
She just wanted everything
to be the way it was.

538
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:58,800
She could have never
replaced you as her friend.

539
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:02,400
Tell Maddy that I loved who she was,

540
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,302
how her mind worked.

541
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:09,903
When we talked about stuff,
I felt smart.

542
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:16,300
And she really liked who you were,
not who you were trying to be.

543
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,702
Tais, I...

544
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:27,200
I thought you were so special, and I...

545
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:30,303
I just miss you.

546
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:36,400
When we were friends,
I felt like I could do anything.

547
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:39,400
You can.

548
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:46,701
It's so awesome.

549
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,003
She sees a light.
She's ready to cross over now.

550
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:53,001
No!

551
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:55,602
No, she can't go yet.

552
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:59,100
I need to say that I'm sorry.
And I was stupid and lame.

553
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:04,101
- And if I could take it all back,
I swear. - Tell her it's ok.

554
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:09,401
Tell her she's a really good person and it's ok to let others see it.

555
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,900
I will.

556
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:16,103
- What?
- There's a little boy here.

557
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,002
A little boy?

558
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:21,801
He says his name is Sean.

559
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:24,200
Sean.

560
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:29,302
Do either one of you know a Sean?

561
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:36,201
My brother-- my baby brother.

562
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:41,001
He wants me to tell his sister
that he loves her and he's happy.

563
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:43,100
And he wants her to be happy, too.

564
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,601
He says he loves you...

565
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:50,103
and that he knows that you're sad
but that you don't have to be,

566
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:53,202
because he isn't.

567
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:57,702
- You--you see my brother?
- I don't.

568
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,401
Tais does.
He's in the light.

569
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:05,101
That's where he should be.

570
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:29,101
I'd like to introduce the reigning
state champion cheerleading team--

571
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:30,402
The Grandview Tigers--

572
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:35,303
with an assist in choreography
by Maddy Strom!
