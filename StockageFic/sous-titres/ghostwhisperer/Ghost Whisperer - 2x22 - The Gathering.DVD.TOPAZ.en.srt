1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,980
Previously on Ghost Whisperer:

2
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,293
There were 5 signs this past year:

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:11,599
the dead dove, the bee, the dead will
walk, the return of the forgotten.

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:17,309
The only thing that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

5
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:20,832
She's gonna be all right.

6
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:23,436
Are you trying to tell me
something about my friend?

7
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:25,844
All eyes will be on you.

8
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:29,852
There's a better place for you.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Gabriel...

10
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:38,887
what are you saying?

11
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,997
We're blocking the light...

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,301
and soon, no one's gonna get through.

13
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:58,548
You have something I want.

14
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:06,368
Do you know what it's like
to be obsessed, miss Gordon?

15
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,774
So that you can't think,
you can't eat?

16
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,082
I do.

17
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:12,286
And these children do.
And I think soon, you will, too.

18
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:13,792
Why am I here?

19
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,399
Sorry about the drama,
my assistant called you.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,007
But I had to know that you'd
be willing to come to me.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,912
Meaning?

22
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:24,414
Meaning that since the very mention of
the words May the 11th on the telephone
brought you here,

23
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:27,630
I know we're both interested
in the same thing.

24
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm not gonna play word games
with you, mr...

25
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:31,749
Clark.

26
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,052
Ethan Clark.
Happy to meet you.

27
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:36,259
Yeah. You obviously already
know my name.

28
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:39,066
A byproduct of the aforementioned obsession.

29
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:41,173
I don't want to play games
with you, either.

30
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:42,481
Honestly.

31
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,882
I just want to find out what you know
and tell you what I know.

32
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,100
May the 11th, 2005.

33
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:55,110
A ferry capsized in the Irish Sea.

34
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:59,022
Young mr. Liam Fletcher
was on that ferry.

35
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:01,833
He survived.

36
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:08,946
The reason I'm so aware
of this accident is because my
wife Dana was also on that ferry.

37
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,062
She did not survive.

38
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:14,669
In fact, no one else did.

39
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:18,382
A year later, May the 11th, 2006,

40
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:21,193
I came down to my morning paper
and read about a plane crash

41
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,302
just outside a little town of Grandview.

42
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,111
Sent me thinking about May the 11th.

43
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:29,519
And I started looking
at other May the 11ths.

44
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,425
Maybe you have, too.

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,433
May 11,2004...

46
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,047
Subway tunnel caved in in Moscow.

47
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:43,956
Miraculously survived by Elena Petrova.

48
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:47,170
May the 11th, 2003.

49
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:51,080
Bridge collapsed in Italy.

50
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:02,014
Sole survivor, Stefano Donato.

51
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:05,222
How'd you know about these accidents?

52
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,834
It's complicated.

53
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,637
Yes, it is.

54
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,557
What does all of this
have to do with me?

55
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:15,659
I don't know.

56
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,666
But what I do know is that everything
leads back to you, Melinda.

57
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,175
- May I call you Melinda?
- Not yet.

58
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,982
Right.

59
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:26,688
I've spent the last year traveling
the world researching the accidents

60
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:29,197
and finding these children.

61
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:33,103
Each one of them, working on
a little part of this puzzle.

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,317
Each one of them obsessed with you.

63
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:37,628
Why?

64
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:40,229
Well, that's where it gets interesting.

65
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,338
Karen, would you bring in Stefano?

66
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,352
Stefano...

67
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,873
One day...

68
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,878
I died.

69
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,784
And I saw you.

70
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:07,514
I need to know what the hell
is going on here.

71
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,719
They don't seem like
accidents, do they?

72
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,726
4 events, same date, a year apart.

73
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,035
What's the pattern?
What are they a part of?

74
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,245
I've been trying to figure that out, too.

75
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,054
If there's something bigger going on,

76
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,756
I want to know what.

77
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,765
I mean, I've been led to you
for a reason, don't you think?

78
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,371
We should work together.

79
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:27,978
How?

80
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:31,281
There's one child survivor
I haven't been able to locate.

81
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,693
The little girl who was
in the plane crash.

82
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,801
Kristen Filbert.

83
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,823
She was pulled from a car
that got crushed under the plane.

84
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,136
Her mom died trying to protect her.

85
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,744
Well, I think somewhere she's making
something or drawing something.

86
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,757
I mean, maybe the picture
isn't complete.

87
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,861
Maybe she has the answer.

88
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:01,870
Do you think you could find her?

89
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,969
EPISODE 2x22
"The Gathering"

90
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,085
This guy is filthy rich.

91
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:39,289
He actually owns the ferry company
from the accident,

92
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,897
but that's just a part of it.
He owns an airline, a shipping company

93
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,806
and 3 quarters of a soccer team.

94
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:46,010
What, he couldn't afford
the other quarter?

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,218
You should have seen those kids' faces.

96
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,222
They looked at me like
they already knew me.

97
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,030
I don't get this guy.

98
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,736
I mean, I don't know
what his endgame is.

99
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:56,644
- Does he know what you can do?
- I didn't tell him,

100
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,049
and I don't know if I will.

101
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,353
He lost his wife on that ferry,
and I think researching the stuff

102
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,962
just makes him feel
connected to her somehow.

103
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,775
Yeah, but can you trust him?

104
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,878
I don't know that, either.

105
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,986
But, look, he brought these kids here.
I mean,

106
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:14,592
I owe it to them to find out what
it is they're going through and why.

107
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,401
This doesn't make sense to me,
and I don't think it makes sense
to you, either,

108
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:19,110
and it's starting to give me the creeps,

109
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,316
so, will you please let me
take you away from here?

110
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,127
At least till after the 11th?

111
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,334
I would love that.

112
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:31,239
But if this is about me, then it's
gonna follow me wherever I go.

113
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,353
And I need to see it through here.

114
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,861
How can I help you?

115
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:37,668
Be careful.

116
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,374
Be aware of everything around you.

117
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,479
And we'll get through it.

118
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,888
And, call me...

119
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:47,291
like a million times.

120
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,903
I will.

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,185
What is this?

122
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,891
We used to be strong and many.

123
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,298
Now we're few.

124
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,106
There are more dark spirits now.

125
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,213
They get stronger, we get weaker.

126
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:10,039
You have to protect
the ones who are left.

127
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,249
You fail, we fail.

128
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,288
So do you think is means
that Gabriel is back?

129
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,193
I don't know who else
she could be talking about.

130
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,997
Well, it doesn't necessarily
mean Grandview, right?

131
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,003
I mean, this ghost could have been in
Zimbabwe yesterday, for all we know.

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,212
No, I'm pretty sure that this ghost
has been making the same rounds
since she died.

133
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,124
Where is your desk and stuff?

134
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:40,431
Oh, well, it seems that I failed
to inform the supply manager

135
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,143
that I postponed my sabbatical.

136
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,647
So they took all your furniture?

137
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,751
An oversight. Heads will roll.

138
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,757
What I'd really like to know is
where have you been?

139
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:48,965
Why haven't you called me sooner?

140
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,868
I mean, we have children with
near-death experiences,

141
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:54,072
psychic visions, you have a prophet
ghost with the candle brigade.

142
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,281
Is your dialing finger broken?

143
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,285
Sorry. Things have been
happening very fast.

144
00:08:57,394 --> 00:09:01,197
Well, you'll be very happy to know
that the lack of a desk or a chair
with wheels hasn't stopped me

145
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:05,007
from trying to figure out
what is going to happen on May 11th.

146
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:08,323
See, it all has to do with
a world out of balance,

147
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,026
a world where chaos rules,

148
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,235
which is what prophet ghost
keeps telling us,

149
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,639
and what we know Gabriel wants.

150
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,544
From the fall of the Roman Empire
to the Civil War,

151
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,453
it all starts with a single,
individual trigger.

152
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,362
Well, I don't think that the prophet
ghost is talking about an apocalypse.

153
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,872
I think she's talking about these kids.
They've been touched by the light,

154
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:27,883
their changed.

155
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,983
Well, that's my point exactly.
All these giant events start

156
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,689
with a single, individual trigger.

157
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:34,995
I mean, the assassination of Julius
Caesar caused 15 years of Civil War

158
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:36,807
and the eventual fall of Rome.

159
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:39,011
The election of Abraham Lincoln
split this country in two.

160
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,818
That's something we're still not over.

161
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,922
All these giant disasters can be
traced back to the smallest fuse.

162
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,936
So the fifth accident that you and I
think is gonna happen on May 11th

163
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,948
may actually be disguised
as something small?

164
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,652
But it will have a huge effect
on the world.

165
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:56,257
It might be a misfortune suffered
by a few very special children,

166
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:57,970
children that are a threat
to the dark side.

167
00:09:58,078 --> 00:09:59,475
Well, there's still one out there.

168
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,679
The little girl that Jim pulled
from the plane crash.

169
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,387
Well, we have to find her
if she has a piece of this puzzle.

170
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,893
We have to figure out what's going to happen on May 11th.

171
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,100
We have less than one week to find her.

172
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:13,807
If I had a desk,
I'd pound it for emphasis.

173
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,124
Something I can help you with?

174
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:30,941
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for someone.

175
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,267
Don't like to see people
messing around with the mailboxes.

176
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:35,899
Neither do I.

177
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,815
I was just looking for a man,
Charlie Filbert.

178
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:42,652
This... it was the last address
I had for him, so...

179
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,281
Long gone.

180
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,998
- Excuse me?
- About 6 months ago.

181
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,815
Her and her dad just moved out.

182
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,041
Well, did they leave
a forwarding address?

183
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,763
I wouldn't know about that.

184
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:01,346
I hope I'll see you again.

185
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,661
You're a lot nicer than the other one.

186
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,084
What other one?

187
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:10,699
- Gotta finish my rounds.
- No, wait, was his name Gabriel?

188
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,797
Now you know everything.

189
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:19,112
You've been given 5 signs,
and they're all pointing

190
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,336
to something happening on May 11th?

191
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,066
There's this sign that
I keep getting warned about.

192
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,893
It's the only thing that hasn't
happened yet, death of a loved one.

193
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,821
But the warning keeps getting stronger.

194
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:33,849
And you still think this has
something to do with me?

195
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,877
I don't know. It may be you,
it may be Jim,

196
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,997
but it's definitely something
I have to pay attention to, and

197
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,427
now you really think I'm insane.

198
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:43,753
I think you're my friend.

199
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,976
And people come into each
other's lives for a reason.

200
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,008
Maybe I'm supposed to learn something.

201
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:51,125
Maybe you are.

202
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,045
But whatever it is, I...

203
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,573
I am here for you.

204
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:00,898
I can't tell you how much
that means to me.

205
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,842
And, uh...

206
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,860
you are a little insane.

207
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,691
But that is what I love about you.

208
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,508
Thanks. I think.

209
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,936
So, how can I help?

210
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,958
I'm looking for Kristen Filbert,

211
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,778
the little girl who survived
the plane crash.

212
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,694
She and her father moved away a few
months ago, and I don't know where.

213
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:22,126
Did you check her middle school?

214
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:22,949
No.

215
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:25,157
Just because somebody moves
doesn't mean they change schools.

216
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:26,979
And even if they did,
maybe they'll be willing

217
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,896
to tell you where they sent the records.

218
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,434
I miss Kristen.

219
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,246
She was a smart kid,
always did her work,

220
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,565
got along with everyone.

221
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,587
Can you tell me
where you sent her records?

222
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,906
Oh, well, we didn't.
We just gave them to her dad.

223
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,129
He said he wanted to home school her,

224
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,352
that he had just found a little
house up in Sunset Park.

225
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:48,675
Do you know why?
I mean, why he took her away?

226
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,406
She just never really came back
all the way after she lost her mother.

227
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,843
She was withdrawn, she barely spoke.

228
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:57,464
- Did she draw a lot?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:01,490
She was always working on something,
but she wouldn't show anyone.

230
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:06,830
Did she leave anything behind,
like a drawing or anything?

231
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,784
You know, there was one thing.

232
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,627
There was an english assignment I gave,

233
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:16,848
I asked them to write down
the first thing they thought of
when they woke up in the morning,

234
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:21,580
and the last thought they had
before they went to sleep.

235
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:27,225
I haven't been able to get
Kristen's answer out of my mind.

236
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,296
Melinda...

237
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,345
Melinda...

238
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,618
Melinda...

239
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,694
Hi, grandma!

240
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:25,310
It is so good to see you!

241
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:28,348
- Am I dreaming?
- Sure.

242
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,776
That's the only way
I can come to you now.

243
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,717
I always liked watching you
hang the laundry.

244
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,246
I know.

245
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,260
Made you feel safe.

246
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:42,080
What is it like
where you are, grandma?

247
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,210
Well, that doesn't matter right now.

248
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,439
There are things that you have
to do here, honey, important things.

249
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:55,082
You have to be ready for what's coming,
and you can't doubt yourself.

250
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:59,837
I want to be ready, but...
I don't know how.

251
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,387
They're gonna come for you, honey.

252
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:06,014
You may not even recognize them.

253
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:11,240
Well, they may come as something
as normal as the weather.

254
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:14,092
Just don't be afraid.

255
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:18,319
If you are, you'll lose everything.

256
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:22,968
You must protect the balance.

257
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,076
Grandma?

258
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:53,365
I'm really sorry to barge in on you
like this. I know it's been a while.

259
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,601
It isn't that I'm not happy
to see you, I am.

260
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:59,022
It's just, you know, I'm trying
to get Grandview out of my head.

261
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,555
And Kristen's...

262
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,472
She's had a rough time, hasn't she?

263
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,288
Well, she was ok until
she got back from the hospital,

264
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,117
started having dreams.

265
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:12,243
Didn't want to talk about it.
She started crying at night,
crying for her mother.

266
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:18,687
You know, I try and comfort her,
and sometimes I lose it, too, you know?

267
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,456
Well, yeah, we both just...
we just miss her a lot.

268
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,494
Did moving help?

269
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,703
Oh, no. Not really.

270
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:30,340
Not yet, anyhow.

271
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:33,859
Now, you said there were other kids
who were going through the same thing?

272
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:39,296
Kids who have survived disasters
and near-death experiences.

273
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:41,249
I want her to come to Grandview.

274
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,266
I really feel like it would help everyone
if she could just meet these kids.

275
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,597
No way. I'm sorry.

276
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,920
I know how you feel.

277
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:52,033
Ok? I really do, but I wouldn't ask
unless I thought it was really important.

278
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,373
Why is it important?

279
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,812
I think this could be a part
of something much bigger.

280
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:05,149
And I feel like she and these kids
should be together right now.

281
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:11,226
It's just not a good time.

283
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,857
Well, thanks for thinking
about it anyway.

284
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:17,807
call me,

285
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:23,122
you know, if you change your mind
or if you just want to talk.

286
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,975
Her teacher said that she was drawing
a lot and didn't to show anyone.

287
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:30,513
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:37,157
She started doing these right after
she came home from the hospital.

289
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,809
Could I keep this one?

290
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,926
There are a couple hundred
just like it upstairs.

291
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:44,449
I guess I can spare one.

292
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:48,986
I think I've seen this before.

293
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,353
Ok, this is what Kristen drew.

294
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:17,082
And this...

295
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:19,397
is the composite

296
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:23,521
that Liam, Stefano and Elena did.

297
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,165
Ok? Now, watch this.

298
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,007
Ok. Follow me.

299
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,703
It was right under our noses
the whole time.

300
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:05,724
Dedication and midnight lantern walk
on may 11th to honor the 230 victims

301
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,670
of the crash of flight 395.

302
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:10,890
I don't exactly understand.
What does this tell us?

303
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:15,522
Kristen's painting is almost an exact
match to the new memorial
at the plane crash site.

304
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:19,167
It also matches the drawings
that the other kids have been doing.

305
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:20,504
Means whatever's going to happen,

306
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,317
it's probably going to happen
at the crash site.

307
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:25,232
That's what the kids have been trying
to tell us without them realizing it.

308
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:29,562
But when you say "whatever's going
to happen", what do you mean?

309
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,002
We've been tracking this
for quite some time,

310
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:36,227
and Melinda and both feel that the
number five plays heavily into this.

311
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:39,668
We believe that the fifth accident
is going to happen this May 11th.

312
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:41,801
- In 4 days?
- Yes.

313
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,022
Here in Grandview?

314
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,035
Well, so it seems.

315
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:49,154
But it's not as important where as to
whom, and right now it's about Melinda.

316
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,593
Ok, there is something that you need
to know about me.

317
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,236
Melinda...

318
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,353
can see ghosts.

319
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:02,275
She talks to ghosts,
she hangs out with ghosts.

320
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:06,923
All right.

321
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:09,972
So all this is real?

322
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:11,596
Pretty much.

323
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,013
How do you do it?

324
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,526
I've been shown visions from a spirit,
and told certain things.

325
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,962
What's really important is that
we focus on this dedication.

326
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:21,593
But how are the kids involved?

327
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:23,011
Let's not find out.

328
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,023
I'm gonna talk to somebody
about cancelling the ceremony,

329
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:29,743
or at least postponing it
until we can find out more.

330
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:32,972
This ability you have,
do you see spirits clearly?

331
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:37,189
- Can you tell one from the other?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,115
Are there any around me?

333
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,824
You mean your wife?

334
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,742
No. No, there's no one around you.

335
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,356
But that probably means
she crossed over.

336
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:50,266
So that's a really good thing.

337
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:54,194
There's something that you're
not telling me about her...

338
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,709
about how she died.

339
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,825
I laughed at her.

340
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:04,448
She believed she was psychic
ever since she was a little girl.

341
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,767
And did you believe that she was?

342
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,580
No. I didn't believe any of that.

343
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:14,399
I enjoy teasing her,
perhaps little too much.

344
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:21,042
We planned to go to Dublin
on the ferry.

345
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,061
A night before she said
she had a bad feeling.

346
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,680
She said she had a vision,
and she ask me to cancel the trip.

347
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:32,204
Again I laughed at her.

348
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:36,825
Our plan was to meet on the ferry.
I was delayed on the conference call.

349
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,150
I didn't notice.

350
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,863
She got on the ferry,
I didn't,

351
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,778
and as it turns out,

352
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,089
she was right to have had
a bad feeling.

353
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,902
She was right to have asked me
to cancel.

354
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,923
And I lost her.

355
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,111
It's not a good time.

356
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,522
Are you the one that can help me?

357
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:13,129
Yes. But it is really
not a good time, ok?

358
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:16,768
I'm scared.

359
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,876
- I don't know what to do.
- Ok, look, just hang in there,

360
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:23,294
all right? And I'll...

361
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,265
Oh, Alex!

362
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:35,974
Please, don't call me Alex in public.

363
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,486
Sorry, mayor Milio,
can I have a minute?

364
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,400
Bad day.

365
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:41,204
My town council meeting ran late.

366
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,215
I have a school vote and a clean up
committee rally.

367
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,824
Look, I really need you to cancel
the dedication ceremony.

368
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:46,640
Why?

369
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,544
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

370
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,454
But I just get this feeling that
something bad may happen there.

371
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,870
Look, can you just postpone it
until I can get all this figured out?

372
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:55,084
Get what figured out?

373
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:59,191
Well, I don't exactly know yet, but
I do know there could be some danger.

374
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,617
Look,

375
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,624
we're going to have plenty of security.

376
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:06,133
Everything will be fine.

377
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:28,659
Delia!

378
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,416
Delia!

379
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,935
Delia, are you here?

380
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,049
Hey. I was just gonna call you.

381
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,259
Are you all right?

382
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,565
It's been a day. A week.

383
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:23,680
These streets are dangerous.

384
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,192
There was someone who just...

385
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:29,404
You have a visitor.

386
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,755
Kristen, what are you...

387
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,972
How did you get here?

388
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,885
I took a bus.

389
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,395
Please don't tell my dad.

390
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,504
Sweetie, I have to tell your dad, ok?

391
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:49,121
He must be crazy looking for you.

392
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,835
Why did you come here?

393
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:55,044
I heard you say that there are
other kids. Just like me.

394
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,768
I want to meet them.

395
00:24:56,884 --> 00:24:58,578
I feel like I have to.

396
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:00,088
Why?

397
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:02,698
I don't know.

398
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:05,711
I don't want to see
the things that I see.

399
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,629
What do you see?

400
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,145
I don't want to say it.

401
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:16,068
It's too awful.

402
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,895
Ok, well...

403
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:25,109
I'll take you to see the others,
but only if your dad says that it's ok.

404
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:29,136
It's a crazy thing that you did
by coming here, Kristen.

405
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:32,962
But I'm really glad you did.

406
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,908
Thank you, Charlie.

407
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,622
She's ok.

408
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,230
Just let her spend the day, ok?

409
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:48,047
I think it could really help her.

410
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,069
Yes, I will bring her back myself.

411
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,483
Ok.

412
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:55,693
I'll call you later.

413
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:58,812
Melinda Gordon...

414
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,837
Grazi.

415
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,774
That's the only thing I know in Italian besides bene.

416
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,897
Just going to the kitchen.

417
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:15,507
Come on.

418
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:20,137
Why does it feel like
we all know each other?

419
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:25,346
Well, maybe because you've all
been through the same things.

420
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,279
Look, I know that this
is hard for all of you.

421
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,493
You're in a strange place
and you're scared.

422
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:33,110
I see things.

423
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,220
Things that haven't happened.

424
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,734
We all do.

425
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:40,646
People who have been through
what you've been through,

426
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:44,363
people who die, even for
a short time and see the light,

427
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:46,986
they always come back changed.

428
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,701
They know things that
they didn't know before.

429
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,016
And they can see things.

430
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:53,626
I don't want to.

431
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:56,038
I just want to be the way I was before.

432
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,352
Me, too.

433
00:26:57,463 --> 00:27:00,056
I just want things to be
like it used to be.

434
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:01,572
I know.

435
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,280
You and I have both lost someone
we loved to that plane crash.

436
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:12,002
And I wish all the time that things
could be as exactly as they were before.

437
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:16,649
Look, I know what it's like
to be different...

438
00:27:16,772 --> 00:27:22,466
and to have people make you feel
like you're not quite right.

439
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,802
But you just have to know that all
the things that make you different,

440
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,922
all the things you've seen,

441
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,635
all the things you feel,

442
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:34,850
those are all things
that make you special.

443
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:38,970
No matter what anybody else thinks.

444
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:41,491
You may have been given a gift.

445
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:46,807
A gift to be able to help
others, maybe even help you.

446
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:51,336
Even if it doesn't always
feel like it's a gift.

447
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:53,564
I showed them the drawing
of the memorial.

448
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,976
They all feel as if
they've been there before,

449
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:58,290
and they all feel as
if they'll be there again.

450
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,503
Oh, I can't let this happen. I mean,
they're sensitives now, you know?

451
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:03,720
They have some psychic ability,

452
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:07,833
and that could make them a target, too.
We just can't take any chances.

453
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:12,157
Well, it's good they're all together.

454
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:17,382
- Was this your wife?
- Yes. That's Dana.

455
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:29,048
I don't know why I haven't seen you
around your husband.

456
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,075
Why are you ignoring him?

457
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:35,392
I want to see Ethan.

458
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,112
But I can't yet.

459
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,422
Why?

460
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,334
- I'm only here to help you.
- So then help me.

461
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,356
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

462
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,790
Is Ethan all right?

463
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,813
He feels a lot of guilt

464
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:59,327
about not believing
that you were psychic,

465
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:03,146
letting you get on that ferry
and not canceling it.

466
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,965
I think that's a big part
of why he's here.

467
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:09,581
He has nothing to feel guilty about.

468
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,502
Everything happened as it should.

469
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:16,424
I know that now.

470
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:19,640
Watch out for him.

471
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,862
Don't let him lose himself.

472
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:24,372
Tell him...

473
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,885
I'll find my way to him.

474
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,412
I will.

475
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:40,651
Hey, Ethan, it's Melinda.
Please call me, it's really important.

476
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,577
I've left 2 messages at his house,

477
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:45,089
and I don't even know how many
messages on his cell phone.

478
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,705
Are you sure you should tell him
that his wife's...

479
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:49,118
ghost is here?

480
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,726
How can I not tell him?

481
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,137
Because he can't talk to her, right?

482
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:56,750
I mean, what's worse?
Thinking someone you love is not there,

483
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:01,968
or knowing that they are,
and you can't interact with them?

484
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:04,099
I don't even know
if that's my call to make.

485
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:07,012
But I can at least tell him that she's
ok and that she's thinking about him.

486
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,826
Ok, I get that.

487
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,536
But what if it makes him...

488
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,563
What?

489
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,002
Are you sure it was him?
It was Gabriel?

490
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:24,210
Believe me, it was him. What the hell
was he doing with Ethan?

491
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,722
- How do they even know each other?
- You know, I never trusted that Ethan.

492
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:28,740
- You only met him once.
- I know, but he's got that accent,

493
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:30,351
- and he's handsome.
- Yeah, and?

494
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,460
Well, that pretty much that covers it.

495
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,677
So, still haven't found your furniture?

496
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,887
That's a sore subject with me.
Let's not bring it up.

497
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:40,401
I know a place that has
a sale on lawn chairs.

498
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,014
Look, we know that Ethan
is interested in these accidents,

499
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,628
- and what follows, right?
- Right.

500
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:47,437
Ok, we know that Gabriel wants
to take souls to the dark side

501
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:49,054
to make the dark side stronger, right?

502
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,865
Yes.

503
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,769
Ok. So how does what Gabriel want
intersect with what Ethan wants?

504
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,791
First, we have to assume that these accidents,

505
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:59,000
like the plane crash, are being
caused by the dark spirits,

506
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,019
'cause we know that
they're getting stronger and

507
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:03,332
want to cause pain and grief
whenever they can.

508
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:05,244
Well, what would the light spirit's
answer to that be?

509
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,757
- Survivors.
- Survivors?

510
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,763
Every accident had one survivor.

511
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:09,975
Kids.

512
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:11,682
Purity, innocence.

513
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,793
Yeah. Yeah, these kids had
near-death experiences.

514
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,908
They're special. They're light
spirits in their own right.

515
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:20,522
And they're powerful ones. And maybe
they're more powerful in groups of four.

516
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:23,140
My grandmother told me that I have to
protect the balance.

517
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,157
I thought your grandmother died.

518
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,867
Right, sorry, I forget
that doesn't matter in your world.

519
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:32,182
Look, no one was meant to survive
these accidents, yet these 4 kids did.

520
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:34,806
And they were touched by the light,
so they're a threat to Gabriel

521
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,420
and whoever controls him.

522
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:40,129
That's why Gabriel's here.

523
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,451
Where are the kids?

524
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:10,432
Hello?!

525
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:11,635
I need to see Ethan.

526
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,835
He's not here.

527
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,237
Where are the kids?

528
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:19,037
Ethan and his friend left
with them an hour ago.

529
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,739
Where did he take those kids?

530
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:23,441
Grandview.

531
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,942
Stop! There he is.

532
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,947
No, just wait here.

533
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,851
He promised you that you'd be able
to talk to your wife again, didn't he?

534
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,052
You never told me she was still here.
Gabriel did.

535
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:48,255
Look, I was trying, ok?
I left you a message.

536
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,854
Did you let him take those kids?

537
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:52,455
- They're fine.
- Where are the kids?

538
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:53,857
- I'm not telling you.
- Why not?

539
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:56,057
Because he told me not to help you.

540
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:59,059
How the hell did Gabriel find you,
or did you find him?

541
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:02,058
He came to me. I don't know
how he knew about me or the kids.

542
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:05,461
He told me he could see the dead,
and that my wife was here.

543
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,864
He told me that she could come here,

544
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,566
but that you'd make her go away.

545
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:11,865
I can't make her do anything.

546
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,965
He told me she could come back forever,

547
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:15,967
that I could talk to her,

548
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:17,869
that she'd come right here,

549
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:20,069
but if I helped you,

550
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:21,570
you wouldn't let her come.

551
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,370
Ethan, I've seen Dana.

552
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:26,575
Ok? I didn't know who she was at first,
but she kept coming to me.

553
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,674
She showed me the accident, she helped
me understand what's going on.

554
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,478
Those kids are in danger.

555
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:34,476
He told me I shouldn't believe you.

556
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,879
Tell him he has to help you.

557
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:39,680
She's here.

558
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,882
Dana...

559
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,482
She wants you to help me.

560
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,985
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

561
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:55,987
Ask him if he remembers what he said to
me the day he asked me to marry him.

562
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:59,190
Do you remember what you said to her
the day that you proposed?

563
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,993
Of course I do.

564
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:03,593
He said if I married him,

565
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:06,293
I'd never spend another lonely minute.

566
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:11,596
You told her she'd never
spend another lonely minute.

567
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:17,098
I miss you so much.

568
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,302
You made me try so hard.

569
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,603
All I wanted was to be the man
you thought I was.

570
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:27,006
Now it's too late.

571
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,307
Nothing matters anymore.

572
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,507
It's not too late.

573
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,510
Tell him...

574
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,809
this is all meant to happen.

575
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,911
Everything happened for a reason.

576
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,814
She said it's never too late,

577
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:43,713
and that everything has happened
for a reason.

578
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,614
She wants you to help me, Ethan.

579
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,316
Ok, that's what means
something right now.

580
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:51,015
Now please tell me where
Gabriel took those kids.

581
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,320
The dedication.

582
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,820
He wanted them to be
part of the lantern walk.

583
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,222
He said it would be good for them
if they were part of something.

584
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,622
I mean, you didn't tell me
she was here!

585
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:05,325
I'm sorry!

586
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:10,728
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,735
I love you.

588
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:41,042
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention, please...

589
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:45,045
you all know me, I'm mayor Milio,
and I'd like to say to you,

590
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,245
today marks the anniversary
of a very tragic event.

591
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:51,452
Mel, hey.

592
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:52,851
Jim, it's me.

593
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:55,453
I need you to find Kristen
and the other kids.

594
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,654
Mel, there's no signal up here.
I can't here you.

595
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,853
No, hello?

596
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:01,254
Mel?

597
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:03,855
Oh, Jim?!

598
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,960
Can you go any faster?

599
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:14,560
We are people from different
parts of the county,

600
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:16,561
different parts of the state,

601
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:18,364
and we're all here this evening

602
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:22,066
in order to honor these poor souls.

603
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:27,968
The children of Grandview have joined
together for a lantern procession.

604
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:29,471
Ladies and gentlemen,

605
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:32,370
our children.

606
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,334
It's ok, sweetie.

607
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,833
You're safe.

608
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:34,433
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,335
This is what I saw.

610
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,035
What?

611
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:41,138
What did you see?

612
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:54,846
Mel!

613
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:04,349
Give me a B.V.F.
And an airway! Now!

614
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,660
The fifth sign.

615
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:25,861
Death of loved one.

616
00:39:42,177 --> 00:39:43,271
No!

617
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,473
No, I'm not ready.

618
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,573
You are ready.

619
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:50,476
But not for the light.

620
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:52,475
For what's inside you.

621
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:57,377
The darkness that's always
been there, waiting.

622
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:24,292
It's time for you to know who you are.

623
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:28,895
And to know who your brother is.

624
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:59,211
No!

625
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,118
Hey, can you hear me?

626
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:16,920
It wasn't about me protecting them.

627
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:23,824
It was about them protecting me.

628
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,725
What happened?

629
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:31,126
I think I have a brother.

630
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:33,431
What?

631
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,730
I think I have a brother.

632
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:40,430
All right, Mel,
what are you talking about?

633
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:46,037
He said I have a brother.

634
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,638
Who said this?
Who told you you have a brother?

635
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,239
My father.
