00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,002
<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

3
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:17,518
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,630
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

5
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,723
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,712
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

7
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,626
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

8
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,159
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

9
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:41,415
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

10
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,584
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted one.

11
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,320
It's very southern gothic.
I love it.

12
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,165
- Can I borrow this, too?
- Good luck lifting it.

13
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,665
Just kidding.
These lamps'll be fine.

14
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:01,585
I'm showing a house this afternoon,
and it's decorated like a monastery,

15
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:04,111
so I just wanna add
a little color. Oop.

16
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,339
- Careful.
- Got it. Ah.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,937
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

18
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:14,345
Melinda, this is amy and jordan.
They're the couple I told you about.

19
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:15,926
They just bought
the house on gardner.

20
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,733
They're in the process of decorating,
so I told them about your store.

21
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,011
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:23,131
You don't sell
plumbing supplies, do you?

23
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,507
I have some 19th century faucets,
but that's about it.

24
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:29,171
- Why?
- The plumbing in that house is nuts.

25
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:31,177
I- it's like the water
pressure's schizophrenic.

26
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:36,736
Yeah. Sometimes water just comes gushing
out, even when we haven't got the faucet on.

27
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,811
- Make them leave.
- Well, it's not just that.

28
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:42,820
The lights just flicker
for no reason.

29
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,129
Look, I'll come out there, and I'll
bring a plumber and an electrician.

30
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:48,267
Go away.

31
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,419
Hey, maybe I can help.

32
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:58,496
My husband and i had some troubles when
we first moved in, and he's pretty handy.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,003
Why don't I come by tomorrow, and
I will take care of everything.

34
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,484
Yeah, I'll come with you,
and I can help you decorate.

35
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:08,533
I'd love that. And delia was right.
I love your place. It's gorgeous...

36
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,523
Seems to be working
perfectly.

37
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:08,542
Yesterday there was
water pouring out everywhere,

38
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,192
and neither of us
had turned it on.

39
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:14,159
Let me show you what's going on with the
tub upstairs. It hasn't stopped dripping.

40
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,742
You know, I knew this
was gonna happen.

41
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:21,222
As soon as she gets here,
everything works great.

42
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,702
- You wanna go sit outside?
- Sure.

43
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:32,129
- How did you end up in grandview?
- Well, we were living

44
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:35,820
in a tiny apartment in the city, and
last christmas, we drove up to hamilton

45
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:38,562
to see jordan's parents,
and we passed through here,

46
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:41,252
and I just fell in love
with the town.

47
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:44,560
You know, jordan's a music producer,
so he can pretty much work from anywhere.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,932
What are you gonna do
with all this space?

49
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:50,049
I'm ready to start a family.
I love kids.

50
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,573
Jim, my husband, he loves them, too,
but I don't know if I'm ready.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,867
Ohh. There is something
wrong with this pump.

52
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:28,626
I'd hate to tell jordan
there's a problem.

53
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:32,044
- Why?
- 'Cause he'll try to fix it.

54
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,821
He's great
with music, lousy with tools.

55
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,404
Just, I love this house, and I'm
so glad to be here.

56
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,416
I'm glad
that you're here, too.

57
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,851
Hey, how about you guys
being our first dinner guests?

58
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,109
- Sure. When?
- Tonight.

59
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,380
Nothing big. Just some pasta
and some wine.

60
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,871
Oh. Um, that sounds great.
I'll ask jim.

61
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:53,389
All right.
Well, cheers to that.

62
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:07,429
Well,
what do you think?

63
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,042
I think you
look beautiful

64
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:14,023
But for the record, you looked beautiful
in the first 2 dresses.

65
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,734
The earrings are too much,
aren't they?

66
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,436
No, no. They're fine.

67
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,111
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, it's no big deal

68
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:24,789
It's just I really like this couple,
and I wanna make a good impression.

69
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,662
Besides, we don't get to go out
with other people much anymore.

70
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,241
No, not since andrea.

71
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:34,434
- Did you wrap the cake?
- I have wrapped the cake,

72
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:38,105
and, you know, I solved the global
warming thing while I was waiting.

73
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,516
All right, I'm ready.
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:43,005
No, you're right.
We should go out more,

75
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,665
socialize more. Looking forward
to meeting new friends.

76
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:50,449
- Did I tell you that there's a ghost, too?
- No. You didn't mention that.

77
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:55,020
Yeah. She's just a child, 6 or 7.
I saw her standing by the pool.

78
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:59,218
Ok, are you more excited about meeting
new friends or a new ghost?

79
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:03,253
That's not funny.
She really needs my help.

80
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,777
The earrings are too much.

81
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:21,185
- Jordan!, come and join us.
- I will, as soon I can.

82
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:25,363
Wait until you taste jordan's cooking. He
literally could open up his own restaurant.

83
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,458
I fully support that.
Lento's on the square, we're over.

84
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,460
Right, honey?

85
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,848
What? Oh, uh, yes. Grandview is not
exactly the gourmet capital of the world.

86
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:42,533
- Oh, what kind of music do you guys
like to listen to? - You choose.

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,705
This is one of jordan's artists. I want to
listen to it and let me know what you think.

88
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,936
Turn it off!

89
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,055
Um, could you... could you turn
it down just a little bit?

90
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,684
Sure. Of course.

91
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,880
You see, this is what happens
when delia's not around.

92
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,150
- What's going on out there?!
- Be quiet!

93
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:15,474
- Jordan!?
- Come here!

94
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,330
- This is insane. It won't shut off.
- Got a flashlight?

95
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,829
Maybe we can turn off
the main water supply.

96
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,136
Um, it's in the basement to the left
of the stairs in the entryway.

97
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,848
I see what I can do.

98
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,190
- Where'd the little girl go?
- I'm looking.

99
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,965
Gonna go find the
main circuit breaker.

100
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,341
Go away!

101
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,941
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Who are you?

102
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:55,217
- My name is melinda.
- Please be quiet.

103
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:57,996
My mother's upstairs sleeping.

104
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,986
- She's not upstairs. There's no one up there.
- Yes, she is.

105
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:05,110
- She's been up there all day.
- It's just you here, but I can help you.

106
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:12,518
- Found it.
- Melinda, jim, where are you?

107
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,588
Uh, we're in here.

108
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:20,311
- That was freaky. I am so sorry.
- Well, at least now we have witnesses.

109
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,327
Tell delia we're not
completely insane.

110
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,560
Who the hell is that?

111
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:36,002
- Hey. Come back here!
- Baby, let him go.

112
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,069
How come we can
all see him?

113
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,412
That one's not a ghost.

114
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,527
It's just so hard not to tell them that
they have a ghost in their house.

115
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,539
Maybe you should.

116
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,017
Oh, but they like us so much.
If I tell them what I can do,

117
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:06,298
it'll change everything. They'll never look at me the
same, and I definitely don't want delia to know.

118
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:10,130
Worry about it tomorrow.
Just relax now.

119
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,946
I just keep thinking about that little girl
not wanting the music to wake up her mom.

120
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,517
It's like she's reliving
the day she died.

121
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:18,698
There's nothing you can
do about it now.

122
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,507
Let it go.

123
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:26,387
- Go to your quiet place.
- Shut up.

124
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:29,436
- That does feel nice.
- Aw, you're telling me.

125
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:33,008
- Why don't you come in with me?
- Because I'm enjoying

126
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,005
the view fine from right here.

127
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:38,168
Where are you going?

128
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,814
You're out of vino.

129
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,734
- I'll be right back.
- Stay. - 2 minutes.

130
00:09:56,186 --> 00:10:00,151
Make them leave.
They're going to wake my mother.

131
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,257
What happened?

132
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,276
My quiet place just
become a little bit noisy.

133
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,708
Emily morrison, a 6-year-old girl who
died in her family pool.

134
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:30,536
- How did you find that?
- I ran a news search on the address.

135
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,527
I don't know how a family ever recovers
from something like that.

136
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,225
Yeah. Neither do I.

137
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,233
But the mother and the older brother
were both in the house when it happened.

138
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:40,094
You think the older brother's
the kid from last night.

139
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,914
He'd be about the right age.

140
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:45,911
What happened that day?
I mean, why was no one watching her?

141
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,073
Well, we know that the mother
was sleeping upstairs,

142
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:50,721
which is strange, because the girl
died in the late afternoon.

143
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:52,571
- Maybe her mom was sick.
- Maybe, but that doesn't

144
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,478
- ... account for the brother.
- Morgan, they need a plumber

145
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,201
- ... relatively young.
- Delia.

146
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:04,880
There can't possibly be that many stopped-
up toilets between now and thursday.

147
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:08,916
All right, call me, please,
if anything opens up. Thank you.

148
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,334
I think every plumber
in the entire united states

149
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,025
is actually independently wealthy and they
only take the job just to play with our minds.

150
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:20,022
Thank you so much for the lamps.
They made the house look beautiful.

151
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,523
- You must be jim.
- Hi. You're delia.

152
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,291
You're still looking for a plumber
for amy and jordan?

153
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:29,442
Yes, one who specializes in imaginary
drips and phantom spurting faucets.

154
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,400
Got news for you.
It's not imaginary.

155
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:33,639
Yeah. They had us over
to dinner last night.

156
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,967
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say

157
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,407
it was a very damp
evening overall.

158
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:42,509
- Who did the plumbing at your house?
- Jim actually did most of it.

159
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,495
- I fixed a few leaks.
- Oh, he's being modest.

160
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,416
He basically overhauled
the whole system.

161
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:49,547
- Do you want him to take a look?
- Oh, that would be great.

162
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,115
- I really have to get back to work.
- But he'll be off at 4:00.

163
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:55,634
Really? You are saving my life, jim.
Thank you so much.

164
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,901
- No problem. I'll see you later.
- Anytime.

165
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,861
Whatever happened to,
"you'll never touch another pipe

166
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:02,839
in our house again?"

167
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:05,861
I'm sorry. I needed an excuse to get us
back in that house.

168
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:07,859
Yeah, but what if the pipes are
really damaged?

169
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,279
Well, then we'll jump off that bridge
when we get to it, and there won't be.

170
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,039
This is about ghosts,
not about clogged-up drains.

171
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,449
Lucy, you got some
'splaining to do.

172
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:19,028
It's gonna be fine.
I promise. I love you.

173
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,973
Are you sure I can't get you
guys something to drink?

174
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,272
- Yeah, sure. I'll, uh-
- No. We're fine. Thank you.

175
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,831
Oh, that's jordan. I have to take it.
The water main's down that way.

176
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:33,923
Thanks. No problem.

177
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,060
- I was a little thirsty.
- Just-

178
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,244
- hello, emily.
- How come you know my name?

179
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,253
Do you remember mine?
It's melinda.

180
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,604
Don't talk so loud.
You'll wake my mom.

181
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:10,303
- She's not here.
- Yes, she is.

182
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:14,552
- When was the last time that you saw her?
- I don't know.

183
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,801
She's not here anymore.
Look, I'll show you.

184
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:20,292
- Where are you going? No!
- To the bedroom.

185
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:24,369
She's going to be angry. Jake
says she doesn't want to be bothered.

186
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,457
- Who's jake? Is he your brother?
- Stop.

187
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,397
I'm just trying
to help you.

188
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,435
If you wake her up,
then I'll get the blame.

189
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,515
- There's no one in there.
- Don't go in there.

190
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,321
Melinda?

191
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:54,150
What are you doing?

192
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:58,690
Uh, jim wanted me to check the water
pressure in your bathroom. I hope that's ok.

193
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:02,130
Oh, sure. And when you're done, come join
me in the kitchen. I'm making some coffee.

194
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,719
- Perfect.
- Ok.

195
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:13,337
- Thank you so much, you guys.
- Sorry I couldn't find much wrong.

196
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,296
Well, I really appreciate you trying.
Maybe it's a good sign.

197
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,693
Well, if you need anything else, give
us a call, and thanks for the coffee.

198
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,702
- Bye now.
- Bye. - Take care.

199
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,313
And just for the record, that was the
best plumbing job I've ever seen.

200
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:26,643
Copper piping, top-of-the-line fixtures.
Did you find the little girl?

201
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:30,310
Yeah, but she doesn't know that she's
dead, and it's like she's scared of her mom.

202
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:33,050
- Did you tell amy about this?
- No, but I did get the name and the number

203
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,050
of the previous owner. I told her it
would help us with the service people.

204
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:40,127
You should work for the CIA... Angela
Morrison... What good does that do us?

205
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,977
That's the mom, you know,
and i have to talk to her.

206
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,355
She's gonna know what
happened that day. Bye.

207
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,879
- Oh, hi. Can I help you?
- I hope so.

208
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:17,957
Some friends of mine moved in
to your old house on gardner.

209
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:22,077
Oh, amy and jordan. Nice people.
So, are they settling in ok?

210
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,455
Actually, they're having some weird problems
with the plumbing and electrical system.

211
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,542
Really? 'Cause we just
put in all brand-new-

212
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,384
yeah. Copper pipes. I know.

213
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,623
Um, that's not really
what I'm here to talk about.

214
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:34,633
Sorry?

215
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:38,931
When you lived there,
did you feel a presence?

216
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:45,219
- What sort of a presence?
- Like a spirit.

217
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,850
What are you
talking about?

218
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,677
I know that you lost your
daughter, and I'm so sorry.

219
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,878
Are you trying to tell me
that the new owners

220
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,574
think that my daughter
is haunting their house?

221
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,225
No. I don't think
they know what happened.

222
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,574
But you do.

223
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:08,923
I know that there was
an accident in the pool.

224
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,913
My daughter died,

225
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:18,939
and it was a terrible time, and I've
worked very, very hard

226
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:19,971
to put it behind me
and to move on.

227
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:26,369
It wasn't easy, but I'm at peace with
it now, and when I think of her,

228
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:29,497
I know that she's in a better place.

229
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:34,287
She may not be
in a better place.

230
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,216
I don't really understand
what you want.

231
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,013
I don't want anything.

232
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:44,093
I just want you to consider the possibility
that maybe your daughter hasn't moved on,

233
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:46,442
that there might be
something keeping her here.

234
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:49,352
She was a very happy
little girl.

235
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:53,010
We lived a very good life
until that day.

236
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:58,310
- Look, I have a lot of work to do, so...
- Of course.

237
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,016
J ake?

238
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:08,726
I guess you can
tell my mother's a little nuts.

239
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,726
No, I don't think she's nuts. I think she
just believes in what makes her feel better.

240
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,294
How come you're
so interested in my family?

241
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,122
I don't like to know
that people are hurting.

242
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,523
I saw you the other night
at the house.

243
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:24,741
I know. Thanks for
not ratting me out.

244
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,383
You're welcome.

245
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:31,371
I know what you mean, when you
were talking about a presence.

246
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,348
I think she's
still there, too... Emily.

247
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:41,598
- Why would you say that?
- I saw her.

248
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,523
Emily!

249
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,680
Take it easy, honey.

250
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,548
- I know.
- But she's right there.

251
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,935
I know it sounds crazy, but...

252
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,385
I saw her.

253
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:23,316
I know you did.

254
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,316
You do?

255
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,534
Yeah, lots of kids see spirits,
kind of grow out of it over time.

256
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,671
Sometimes I thought
I was crazy.

257
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:37,740
- Yeah. I know the feeling.
- You see ghosts?

258
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,249
- Yes.
- You've seen my sister?

259
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,622
- Yes.
- So is she all right?

260
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:49,147
She's stuck here, jake.

261
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:54,878
I don't think she knows that she's dead, but
we have to make this our little secret, ok?

262
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,484
Can you tell me
where your father is now?

263
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,639
He got married again.

264
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,136
He has new kids and everything.
He moved out of grandview.

265
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,324
You've had it tough,
haven't you?

266
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,681
Can I talk to my sister?

267
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:12,001
I have to tell her
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,011
Sorry about what?

269
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:18,032
Sorry.

270
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,597
Do you hear that?

271
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:41,873
- What?
- That. It sounds like an animal.

272
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,519
Jordan, come here.

273
00:19:57,953 --> 00:20:00,849
That's strange.

274
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:18,425
What the hell?

275
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:43,069
I have a little
emergency on my hands.

276
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:46,256
Do you have scented candles
or bubble bath?

277
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,508
I do. Are you planning
a romantic evening?

278
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:53,167
With who, tivo? No, I have to get
a gift for amy and jordan.

279
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,691
They're staying
at the grandview regent.

280
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,697
- What? Why?
- You know, I didn't get the whole story.

281
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,797
It's something
about the pool now.

282
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:02,636
Anyway, it'd be great if you could
just make up a little gift basket.

283
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,585
Wow, you really take
care of your clients.

284
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,735
But I'm gonna sort
the whole thing out.

285
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:13,788
- You're not gonna get rich that way.
- Yeah, but I sleep good at night.

286
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,083
- Do you have some time?
- Maybe.

287
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:21,580
I need to run across the street.
Would you mind watching the store?

288
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,881
Are you kidding?
I would love to.

289
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,674
W- wait. Wh-what if
somebody comes in?

290
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,203
Sell them the birdbath.

291
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,332
What are you doing here?

292
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:41,411
I want you to take me
to my sister.

293
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:44,676
I thought all the keys had to be
returned to the real-estate person.

294
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:48,298
- Nobody ever asked me for mine.
- That would be breaking in.

295
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,217
If you're not gonna take me,
I can go by myself.

296
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,085
Jake, stop.

297
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:58,203
You have to tell me what happened
that day, the day that she died.

298
00:21:58,262 --> 00:21:59,835
Then will you take me?

299
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:03,881
I can't promise,
but you have to trust me.

300
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,839
My dad was at work.

301
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,027
He asked me to watch
emily after school.

302
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,906
She asked me if I wanted to play, but
I was in the middle of a video game.

303
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:23,634
I told her to wait
until I was finished.

304
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,824
She said she was gonna
complain to my mom.

305
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:30,041
I told her mom was asleep and she'd
be angry if emily bothered her.

306
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:35,660
- Your mom was sleeping in the afternoon?
- She slept a lot.

307
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,365
My parents were
having problems.

308
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:42,402
The night before, my mom asked
my father to move out.

309
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:47,536
She was afraid to tell emily.
Emily was really close to my father.

310
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:50,630
Anyway...

311
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:55,358
I finished my video game, and when
I looked up. My sister was gone.

312
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,655
I has this really bad feeling,
like my insides were cold.

313
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:08,300
Emily! Emily!
Mom! Mom! I need you!

314
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,494
Come on! Emily!
I just- I lost it.

315
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,807
I'm so sorry! Please come back!
Please, emily! I'm so sorry!

316
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,863
And what happened
after that?

317
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:24,301
I don't remember.

318
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,592
Now will you please
take me there?

319
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:45,894
Jake!
Jake, you came to see me.

320
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,026
I thought
you were mad at me.

321
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:51,223
- Jake, your sister's here.
- What?

322
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:55,865
- Where?
- Right here. Why won't you look at me?

323
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:59,998
- Jake! Jake!
- Wait. What's going on?

324
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,032
- Why won't he talk to me?
- Emily, he can't see you.

325
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:11,242
Why not?
What's wrong with him?

326
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,512
- Do you know what happened to you?
- When?

327
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:16,221
The day that you
asked jake to play.

328
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,922
He wouldn't come,
so I went to play by myself.

329
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,327
- You fell in?
- Yeah.

330
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,675
Then what happened?

331
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,443
I went to sleep
under the water.

332
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,247
Do you remember
waking up?

333
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,392
The truth is
you never woke up.

334
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:54,158
You died that day, and that's why
no one can see you or hear you.

335
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:58,509
- But you do. Did you die, too?
- No.

336
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:01,143
No. I can see you
so that I can help you...

337
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:04,052
go to another place
where you'll be very happy.

338
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,181
But I'm happy here with my mom
and dad. He's coming home soon.

339
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:12,468
- No, sweetie, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

340
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:17,483
Emily, your daddy doesn't live here
anymore. Neither does your mommy.

341
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,511
Tell her, jake. Daddy's coming home,
and he's gonna read me

342
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:26,706
goodnight moon and tuck
me in, me first, then you.

343
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:31,329
- Tell her.
- That's what I've been waiting for.

344
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:49,390
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. This is jake morrison.

345
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,488
He used to live here with his family
before you bought the house.

346
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:55,678
- How did you get in?
- Because he still has a key,

347
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:59,649
and he wanted to return it,
just see the place again,

348
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:02,722
and I hoped that
you wouldn't mind.

349
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,562
- Awkward.
- Slightly

350
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,284
- Is my sister really there?
- Yes, jake.

351
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:21,667
She's waiting for your father
to come home, to read to her,

352
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:23,630
and he has to finish that story.

353
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:27,617
"Goodnight moon"
He used to read it to me, too.

354
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:30,961
Do you think we can get him
to come and see her?

355
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:35,522
- Mm, I don't think so.
- Well, can't you call him?

356
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:39,616
Well, he works a lot,
and he's working on

357
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:45,339
a big house on route 59, and he's
in charge, so he's really busy.

358
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:50,071
Well, this is kind of important... I
mean, don't you think he'll understand?

359
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:53,896
He has a new family.
I don't see him too much.

360
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:58,380
- But don't you at least speak?
- Not too much.

361
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:08,597
Look, jake, um, my father
left when I was very young,

362
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:14,185
and I didn't know why,
but I was heartbroken.

363
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:19,872
And then out of the blue, he'd come back,
maybe for a day, maybe for a week.

364
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:23,088
Sometimes he'd
bring gifts for me.

365
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:26,825
Then he'd be gone again.

366
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:30,201
I didn't know which was worse,
hardly ever getting to see him

367
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:33,584
or having to say good-bye
to him over and over again.

368
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:37,965
And I never wore the gifts he gave me,
'cause I knew it would make my mom really mad.

369
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,201
She didn't want me
to see him or talk to him.

370
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:45,646
I was too young to
understand, so...

371
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:49,058
I wondered if all
of this was my fault,

372
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:51,780
did I do something
to make him leave,

373
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:56,266
you know, was there something then I
could have done to have made him stay.

374
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,363
- What happened?
- He came by less and less, and...

375
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,441
finally I never
saw him again.

376
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:10,423
It was really unfair, because I thought
that I had the power to keep him there,

377
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:13,552
- ... if only I knew how.
- Did you?

378
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,495
- Did you have the power?
- No, I didn'T.

379
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,304
- And neither do you.
- If I had saved emily...

380
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:29,365
he would've come back.

381
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,151
But I didn'T.

382
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:37,221
Jake, you don't think that your
father blames that on you, do you?

383
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,006
- Yeah.
- Oh, why would you say that?

384
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:43,378
I gotta go.

385
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,733
My mom's probably wondering
where I am, anyway.

386
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:58,130
- You did what?
- I'll admit it. I took a chance.

387
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,556
I thought amy
would be at the hotel.

388
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:04,063
- Mel... - I know. It's just
there's so much at stake for this kid.

389
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:08,386
He's in so much pain,
Jim, seems so alone.

390
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:11,492
And he's a great kid,
really smart.

391
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,911
I just don't understand
why his father would ignore him.

392
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:16,700
You know, parents are
supposed to be there for their kids.

393
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,998
I've never seen that.
It's pretty.

394
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:23,151
It's been in my
jewelry box forever.

395
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:28,770
Well, you have a huge heart.
That's why I love you.

396
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:32,789
But you're not a social worker.
You've done everything you could.

397
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:37,116
Not everything.

398
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,052
I know that your family business is
private and none of my concern.

399
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,634
Then why did
you come here?

400
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:16,838
Because I've gotten to
know jake a little bit.

401
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,715
He's a special kid, and he's having
a really hard time right now.

402
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:22,909
What do you mean?

403
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:27,695
He thinks that his sister's spirit
is still in the house on gardner.

404
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:29,862
- Do you believe him?
- That's not important.

405
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:32,408
What is important
is that he believes it.

406
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:36,117
Yeah, well, kids find
different ways of coping.

407
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:43,233
I'm sorry.
Uh, who are you again?

408
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,857
Look, I'm just trying to help, but I think
that jake feels like he can't talk to you.

409
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,247
So you're an expert
on my son's feelings.

410
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,595
No, but I do know what it feels like
to be abandoned by a parent.

411
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:57,696
He feels like you replaced him
with a new family.

412
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,974
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

413
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:02,473
Do you know that he thinks that you
blame him for what happened to emily?

414
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:06,450
Look, I don't know who you are coming
here and... have you ever lost a child?

415
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,455
- No.
- Do you even have children?

416
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:11,561
- No.
- I didn't think so.

417
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,414
Look, jake and me,
we had a code.

418
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,368
When his mother
asked me to leave,

419
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:24,337
I told him that if
he ever needed me,

420
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:24,387
if there ever was a problem, that he should
page me with a 911 text, and I'd be there.

421
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:27,037
And did he do it
when emily drowned?

422
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,046
No.

423
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:33,591
- Do you blame him?
- I-I never said anything like that to him.

424
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:35,938
You don't have to.
He feels it.

425
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:39,247
Well, I don't want him
to feel that.

426
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:45,024
I don't wanna feel that.

427
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:50,967
She was my little girl.

428
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:53,891
She was perfect.

429
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:58,813
And jake, he was a rock-solid kid.
He was a championship swimmer,

430
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:01,125
he was right there, and...

431
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:10,514
Angela found her way of moving
on, and, uh, I found mine, ok?

432
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:14,817
I love jake, and he
knows that deep down.

433
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:19,800
A- and you were right the first time.
This is none of your business.

434
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,464
Melinda!

435
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,890
I never got to apologize for leaving
you in the store so long yesterday.

436
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:52,071
Oh, don't worry about it.
I had a ball.

437
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:57,012
So was there some kind of weird parallel
universe thing going on yesterday?

438
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:59,832
- What do you mean?
- Well, I take over the store,

439
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,585
and you show a house
to a 12-year-old.

440
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,879
Yeah. Look, I'm-
I'm so sorry about that.

441
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,917
Melinda, what were you thinking
letting that kid into amy's house?

442
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,351
She was all over me
about it last night.

443
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,380
I'm sorry. He used
to live there, and-

444
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:15,798
anyway, it doesn't matter.
They're selling.

445
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,447
- They are?
- Yeah. It's a big mess.

446
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:21,137
They think the house
I sold them was haunted.

447
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:24,018
Is that the most brain-dead
thing you ever heard or what?

448
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:28,181
Just about... Um, could
you just hold them off?

449
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:30,540
'Cause maybe if I can get the
family that used to live there

450
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:34,050
to just come back for a few hours,
we could fix the things that aren't working.

451
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,187
- How would they do that?
- Just trust me.

452
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:40,208
If you could get amy's permission, maybe
I can get this whole thing cleared up.

453
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:43,394
- Ok. I'll try to get the key.
- Thanks.

454
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:46,909
- Aren't you opening the store?
- Oh, um, later.

455
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:51,275
I have a quick errand to run.
Bye.

456
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,305
That is one sweet job.

457
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:24,240
- You have some nerve coming here.
- Sorry?

458
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:27,543
Did you actually tell my son that
you could see his sister's ghost

459
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,668
and that she's living
in my old house?

460
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,460
- Yes, I did tell him that.
- Why would you do that?

461
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:37,084
- He's just a little boy.
- Because it's true.

462
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:40,095
My daughter is gone.

463
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,113
She's in a better place.
She's at peace.

464
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:47,558
No, she's not. She needs to see her
father, and you have to help her do that.

465
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:49,986
Her father, the man
who cheated on me.

466
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:53,218
This is not about what your husband
did or didn't do to you.

467
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:55,261
It's about
your daughter's needs.

468
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:57,272
Mom.

469
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:00,003
She's telling the truth..

470
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,433
I felt emily.
She's in that house.

471
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:06,629
Please, jake, I don't
wanna hear this anymore.

472
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,392
And I want you to stop
telling my son lies,

473
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:13,504
and I want you to stop defiling
the memory of my little angel

474
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,172
Stop it!

475
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:19,120
She is not a little angel.
She's not in a better place.

476
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:22,691
- She's still in that house. I know it.
- Come here.

477
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:11,567
- How you doing, jake?
- Ok, dad.

478
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,835
You?

479
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:21,071
- Good to see you, angela.
- Right.

480
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,365
Well, let's all go inside.

481
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:39,954
Brings back
lots of memories.

482
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,041
Some good ones, I hope.

483
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:43,315
I really don't understand
what we're doing here.

484
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,338
Just listen, mom.

485
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:49,844
- What was that?
- Your daughter.

486
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:53,097
Daddy, you're home!

487
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:55,760
Daddy, I'm right
down here!

488
00:36:55,777 --> 00:37:00,394
Sweetie, remember that he can't
see you and he can't hear you.

489
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,454
Only I can, but I'll tell him
whatever you wanna say.

490
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,731
I- I don't know what kind
of parlor trick you're pulling,

491
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,083
but y-you can't be
talking to emily. You just can't be.

492
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:10,414
- Dad!
- Why is he calling me emily?

493
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,857
She wants to know why
you're calling her emily.

494
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:16,420
You always called her
little bunny.

495
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:24,172
- You told her that.
- Didn't tell her anything, I swear.

496
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:31,179
Tell her I'm sorry.
Tell her I'm sorry I didn't save her.

497
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,563
You tried hard, jake.

498
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:37,896
- She says that you tried to save her.
- What?

499
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:42,970
I remember now.

500
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:53,075
I couldn't breathe.
I was just falling and falling.

501
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,399
Then I saw jake.

502
00:37:55,417 --> 00:38:00,072
He was trying to drag me up,
but I was so scared.

503
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:05,552
I was holding on too tight.
I was dragging him down with me.

504
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,904
He tried so hard.

505
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:17,883
You would drown, too,
if you tried any harder.

506
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,853
You tried so hard...

507
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:25,820
But you would have drowned, too,
if you had tried any harder.

508
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:30,420
- I tried to save her?
- You did.

509
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,736
Is that true, jake?

510
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:38,577
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't remember.

511
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:40,604
He was in shock.

512
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,862
Tell daddy he shouldn't
be mad at jake anymore.

513
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:48,838
She doesn't want you to be mad
at jake anymore.

514
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:52,470
I- I'm not mad at your brother, bunny.
I never was. Tell her.

515
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,916
She's with us.
She can hear you.

516
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,306
I was mad at myself.

517
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,944
I wasn't there for you,

518
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,219
for either of you.

519
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,986
I was doing things
that I, uh, shouldn't have been doing,

520
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,533
and I hurt your mom,

521
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:14,394
and I hurt our family.

522
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:18,019
I hurt us, too.

523
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:24,104
I let your father take the blame,
but it was my fault, too.

524
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,837
I should have
been watching you.

525
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:29,726
I should have pulled it together and
not locked myself up in my bedroom.

526
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:38,721
The important thing is is that
you know this wasn't your fault.

527
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:46,938
I just couldn't stand the loss, and
I never meant for you to feel it, too.

528
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:50,092
That's why I felt that you were
better off without me.

529
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:54,929
Both of you.

530
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:57,986
I lost my family
because of what I did,

531
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,930
not because of
what anybody else did.

532
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:05,013
Tell daddy he didn't
lose his family.

533
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:11,314
Jake is your family.
He needs you. He always will.

534
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,301
She says that you didn't
lose your family...

535
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:18,497
Jake needs you,
and he always will.

536
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:25,421
I'm so sorry, jake.

537
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:33,621
I'll never let you go again.
I promise you, ok?

538
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:47,409
I'm sorry I hurt you.

539
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:54,428
I want daddy
to finish the story now.

540
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:58,643
She wants to know if you'll finish
reading "goodnight moon"

541
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,794
She's waited
a long time.

542
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:21,855
- He was up to, "goodnight stars. "
- You were up to, "goodnight stars. "

543
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:29,328
"Goodnight stars. "
"Goodnight air. "

544
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:38,162
"Goodnight noises everywhere. "

545
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:49,668
- Hi, nana.
- Uh, wait.

546
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:54,492
- Ok, I will.
- She wants me to come with her.

547
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:57,411
She's ready to go now.

548
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:01,792
Tell mommy and daddy
I'm gonna like it there.

549
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:06,226
Nana says so.
Tell them I love them.

550
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:08,437
I will.

551
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:14,445
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I didn't mean it.

552
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,274
Goodnight, little bunny.

553
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,687
I can feel her.

554
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:41,910
She's happy now.

555
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,082
Oh, sweetie.

556
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:58,114
I don't know
how to thank you.

557
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:00,961
You already have.

558
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:57,802
