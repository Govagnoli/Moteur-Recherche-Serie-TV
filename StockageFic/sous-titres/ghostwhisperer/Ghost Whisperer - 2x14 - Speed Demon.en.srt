2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,200
My name is Melinda Gordon.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm married...

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,800
I live in a small town...

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,700
and I own an antique shop.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
I might be just like you...

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,600
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,900
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
It's all right, honey.

10
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,600
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:29,209
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,000
and they come to me for help.

13
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:39,908
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

14
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,103
Well, it was definitely
worth the trip.

15
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,803
I mean, they want to do
the estate sale so fast,

16
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,503
there was very minimal haggle.

17
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:56,100
The haggle factor's very important.

18
00:00:56,206 --> 00:01:01,201
Yeah, I'm going to have to hire a truck
to go up there next week.

19
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:04,203
Damn. This road is really dark.

20
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:06,101
Hey, be careful.
How far out are you?

21
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,202
I have no idea.

22
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:09,901
You've got to get a gps.

23
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,902
Hey! Grandview 19 miles. Whoo-hoo.

24
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:16,702
Hmm. Oh, and other
signs of civilization.

25
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,001
Hey, an old fruit stand.

26
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:20,000
You know what?

27
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:24,200
I think we stopped by there
and got apples once. Yeah.

28
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,703
And, um...

29
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:29,103
well, a car, sort of.

30
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,402
Well, that's weird.

31
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,302
Mel?

32
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,500
I think I just went in a circle.

33
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,701
Mel?

34
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,100
Jim?

35
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,701
Mel.

36
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:45,303
Jim! Oh!

37
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,401
Redial, redial, redial.

38
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,302
Great.

39
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,501
Ok.

40
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm talking to the police right now,
and they're going to be here any minute.

41
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,703
Are you ok in there?

42
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,403
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ok.

43
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:07,300
Sorry if I scared you.
You stuck?

44
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:11,302
- Yeah, it died.
- Pop the hood.

45
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,902
Are you looking for it?

46
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:28,703
- Looking for what?
- Someone's going to die.

47
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:32,502
Try it now.

48
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:37,501
You're a miracle worker.
How did you do that?

49
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:41,803
- You need anything else?
- How do I make it back to route 47?

50
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,100
You're all turned around.

51
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,903
Just hang a u-ie,
look for signs for 86 south,

52
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,000
and then 47 should be
about a mile after that.

53
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,602
Ok, thank you.

54
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:52,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

55
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,001
EPISODE 2x14
"Speed Demon"

56
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:40,202
I just don't remember you ever being
haunted by an actual skeleton before.

57
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,802
Oh, it was a ghost, believe me.

58
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:46,601
Don't they usually look the way
they did when they died the first time
they come to you?

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,302
Yeah, so let's not even think about
what happened to this guy.

60
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:53,902
How about let's stay off that road
so we don't ever run into
halloween man again, huh?

61
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,903
I love the Jim Clancy simple approach.

62
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,202
Avoidance--it's worked
for guys for centuries.

63
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:03,403
He said that someone was going to die.
That doesn't exactly lend itself
to avoidance.

64
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:04,900
All right.
What does it mean?

65
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:07,103
I don't know.
I'll try and figure it out.

66
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,900
- How?
- Don't know.

67
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:12,103
See you for lunch.

68
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:16,703
- Same time? Same bench?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,603
Wow. What a haul!

70
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,300
Straight sale, no consignment.

71
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:50,202
Yeah,  well, the problem is
I want to buy most of it for myself.

72
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,503
And you are my best customer.

73
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:54,203
Yeah, I need to find a way out
of that cycle.

74
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,102
What are you doing?

75
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,301
Oh, just trying to avoid
the physical labor I know must come.

76
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,702
Hey, is Ned coming by?

77
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,702
No, he is doing a study group
with 3 kids from school.

78
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,502
They take turns at each other's houses.

79
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,302
Oh, that sounds like
a good way to make friends.

80
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,400
Well, I keep volunteering my house
for all his sessions,

81
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,901
so I can basically sit in the middle
of the floor and stare at them.

82
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,300
- Just as a precaution.
- Yeah. Is that too much to ask?

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,401
- But, you know, of course they
didn't bite. - Mmm, I sense an issue.

84
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,501
It's all starting to be about his
friends. That's what he calls them.

85
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:23,901
"They're my friends, mom."
No names.

86
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,701
Sounds like he's turning out
to be a very normal kid.

87
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,100
I guess so.

88
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:33,601
Hey. You know, you never told me
what happened on your date with Tim.

89
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:38,402
Well, there would have actually had to
have been a date in order for me
to tell you about it.

90
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:41,503
- What happened?
- He didn't show.

91
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:45,200
- What?
- It's no big deal.

92
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,402
Melinda--

93
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,500
Melinda?

94
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,001
Sorry.

95
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:07,101
I'd really appreciate it
if you wouldn't tell Jim.

96
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,301
Right.

97
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,502
Are you ok?

98
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:17,303
I'm fine. You're the one who looks
like she just saw a ghost.

99
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,500
Why is it harder when
you're trying to get lost?

100
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,600
You're doing great.
I have no idea where we are.

101
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,303
Didn't we used to have a map in here?

102
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,703
Hey, thanks for doing this.

103
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:34,603
Do you think I'd let you come back out
on this road again by yourself?

104
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:37,101
Aha! Map.

105
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,803
Hey, do these mean anything to you?
19026?

106
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,600
- What's left on our mortgage?
- No.

107
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,103
- Last plumber's bill?
- No again.

108
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:48,101
I have no idea.

109
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,902
What was...

110
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:03,601
- Gas?
- No, I have half a tank.

111
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,500
Do you see that?

112
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:15,100
What does that mean?

113
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:21,202
I was hoping you'd tell me.
It was in--I wasn't here the last time.

114
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,601
- Uh, got the brake.
- It won't move!

115
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:31,302
- Your feet off the gas?
- Both feet are on the brakes!

116
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:35,801
Oh, damn it!
It's going to be all right.

117
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:40,503
I'll pop it into neutral.

118
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,801
Keep your feet down.

119
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:46,903
- I'm trying!
- Turn it, turn it.

120
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,303
All right.

121
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,500
What?

122
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:12,602
- Looking for the midnight circle?
- What?

123
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,100
Someone's going to die.

124
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,003
See, now I know
we're going the wrong way.

125
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,001
We're all the way
on the other side of town.

126
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, if I can just get the adrenaline
that's still coursing through my veins

127
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,001
- to slow down, I might figure it out.
- Sorry.

128
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:33,703
Why can't we just go home at night
and watch dvds like normal couples?

129
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,302
Hey, look, we can stop 
and ask for directions.

130
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,102
I don't need directions.
I got it figured out.

131
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:42,102
- I just need to find this one road.
- Wait a minute.

132
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:47,400
That's the girl who helped me
on the road last night.

133
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:56,502
Engine seems fine.
Just running a little hot, I think.

134
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,200
Anyway, if you want to leave it here,
I can run some diagnostics.

135
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,803
Oh, no. I don't think there's
anything wrong with the car.

136
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:04,002
Wow. That's cool.

137
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,103
Do you mind?

138
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,203
It's got the roll bar and the magnesium
wheels, 4-inch exhaust, right?

139
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,803
Your  husband knows cars. Cool.

140
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:12,801
While he's distracted, will you please
tell me how to get back to route 47?

141
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:16,100
- Oh, yeah, let me write it down here.
- Thank you.

142
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:19,700
- So, how long have you worked here?
- I own it.

143
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,100
Seriously?

144
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,609
- I mean, not that that's...
- No, it's ok.

145
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,100
My father, he loved cars and he didn't
have a son fast forward, here I am,

146
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,708
- or something like that.
- Wow. I'm in awe.

147
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,500
I don't know the first thing
about cars.

148
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,900
Well, we don't deal too much
with everyday car staff.

149
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:39,503
Most of our clients are serious racers,
real car people.

150
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,703
The road that you found me on last night...

151
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you know if there have been
any accidents there?

152
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:47,500
You know, like serious
people dying accidents?

153
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,500
- Not that I know of.
- Any other weird things?

154
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,900
Weird like how?

155
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,802
I don't know, weird like
cars going haywire,

156
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,901
seeing strange things on the road.

157
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:01,303
Sorry. Other than the odd roadkill,
not much goes on out there.

158
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,302
Anyway, here's the directions,
and my number's on there

159
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,403
- if you have any more car trouble.
- Thank you so much.

160
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:10,500
- Have you ever heard of the
midnight circle? - What's that?

161
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:14,201
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

162
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,400
Ok, Joe. It's ready.

163
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,602
Time to unpeel your husband
away from my cars.

164
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:25,702
Honey, honey. Can we just move in here
for, like, a week? What do you think?

165
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,203
Oh. Business, huh?

166
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,401
Directions.

167
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,202
- The midnight what?
- The midnight circle.

168
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:36,900
- Is that a name, a place, a thing?
- None of the above. All of the above.

169
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,700
- Well, did you check the phone book?
- Yeah, there was no listing.

170
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:44,100
Huh. Thank you.
I'll see you next time.

171
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,603
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, hey! How was school?

172
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,800
- I need $10.
- Oh. For school?

173
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,303
No.

174
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,503
- Well, then, for what?
- I don't know. With my friends.

175
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,202
In case we stop for pizza or something.

176
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,701
Are there children at this
midnight circle, because if not,

177
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:03,402
please, take me there now.

178
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,701
Hey, do you know what it is, Ned?
The midnight circle?

179
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,900
Um, no.

180
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:14,101
Never heard of it.

181
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:24,803
So, Jim is working tonight,

182
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:28,103
and I am starving. You want to go
to Lento's and grab a bite?

183
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,301
Oh, I would love to, but I really
have to make sure that Ned's

184
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,102
doing his homework.
Can I get a raincheck?

185
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:38,100
- Yeah, no problem. Good night.
- Ok. Good night.

186
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,003
You don't belong.

187
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,503
They were just giving me a ride home.

188
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,403
I don't want you in a car
with people I don't know.

189
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:38,101
- Those kids are too old for you, Ned.
- They like me. They're my friends.

190
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:40,802
- Wait. That's your study group?
- What's the big deal?

191
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:42,402
The big deal is I'm your mother. 

192
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,602
I want to know who you're with
and where you are.

193
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,702
- You want to control everything I do.
- Most of it, yes. That's my job.

194
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:53,602
You are not an adult yet, Ned,
as much as you think you are.

195
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,600
And don't blame Melinda. She told me
because she cares about you,

196
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,501
not because she wanted to
get you in trouble.

197
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,102
I could tell things, too.

198
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:13,102
- Hey, where are you going?
- Home, to prison.

199
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,602
Ned!

200
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,103
I  keep your secrets.

201
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,703
Hey, that's not what this is about.

202
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,103
Who were those guys?

203
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,403
They go to my school.
They help me study.

204
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,601
Now I look totally lame.

205
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:29,000
Look, there was a bumper sticker with
numbers on it. What does it mean?

206
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,102
Hey.

207
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,101
I know when I talked about
the midnight circle yesterday

208
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,800
- that you knew what it was.
- I don't.

209
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,103
I'm not playing around, Ned.

210
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,903
There is a ghost attached
to your friends,

211
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,503
or the midnight circle,
whatever it is.

212
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:44,200
A dangerous ghost.
You have to tell me.

213
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't know anything.

214
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,603
- Hi. I'm...
- Melinda Gordon. Yes.

215
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,600
I know all about you.

216
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,201
I'm Kate Payne.

217
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:10,900
I'm so glad to meet you finally.

218
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:12,800
Are you?

219
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,502
Well, yes.

220
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:20,001
Get on there. Get on there.
I'm telling you to get on there.

221
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,102
Maybe I chose a bad time.

222
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:27,802
No. He's in a bit of a bad mood,
but don't let it bother you.

223
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,102
It was lovely to meet you.

224
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,001
Get on there.

225
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,902
Just do me the favor
and just get on there.

226
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:34,701
Get on there.

227
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:39,602
You do realize that that's an inanimate
object that can't understand you?

228
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,100
Oh, it understands me. They all do.
They understand every word I'm saying.

229
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:43,402
Who?

230
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:47,001
Who? The nail, the picture frame,
the hammer. The hammer understands me.

231
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,001
The bastards have the whole
thing planned out.

232
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:51,302
- I was warned you were in a bad mood.
- Yeah, I'm in a bad mood

233
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:54,401
because some people really know
how to get under my skin, ok?

234
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,400
Now, where's my hammer?
I don't even have my hammer now.

235
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,403
I had my hammer right here.
I'm losing my mind.

236
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,301
Looking for this?

237
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,003
Yes, I am. And you know what?
I've had just about as much aggravation

238
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,700
as I can stand for one day, thank you.

239
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:07,902
Ok, sorry. Bad timing.

240
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,601
And I don't want to talk about it, ok?
So, please don't try to drag it out of me?

241
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:14,501
- Ok, no problem. I'll see ya.
- It's about my wife, if you must know.

242
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,101
Well, I don't must know,
so if you'd rather not talk about it...

243
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:19,501
Thank you. I feel so much better.

244
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:23,603
Now, what can I do for you,
Melinda Gordon?

245
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:27,703
Do you have any idea
what these numbers mean?

246
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:31,900
- 1 9 0 2 0 6. Map coordinates?
- Checked it already. Doesn't add up.

247
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,503
Well, it adds up in numerology to... 9.

248
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,102
- Meaning?
- Meaning 9.

249
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,401
9 is the divine number, the number
of completion, the eternal number.

250
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:42,600
The chinese considered it
the celestial number.

251
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:46,900
And there's the famous 9 course meal
at my favorite vietnamese restaurant,
beef or fish.

252
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,403
-  Is any of this helping you?
- Not really.

253
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:52,003
Of course not. Because none of this
has anything to do with numerology.

254
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:53,701
- It doesn't?
- No, it doesn't.

255
00:16:53,807 --> 00:17:00,801
But that doesn't stop me from going on
and on with all the minutiae I know,
does it?

256
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,302
- It's a date!
- It's a date.

257
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,600
Challenge me next time
you come in here, won't you?

258
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:11,600
19th of february, 2006.
That's a year ago next monday.

259
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:16,101
It's a significant date. February 19,
1945 was the battle of Iwo Jima.

260
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,703
The phonograph was invented in 1878.

261
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:23,400
Paul Simon writes "Sounds of Silence"
1964, february 19.

262
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:26,802
Big makeout song for me.

263
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,801
How do you know all that?

264
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:29,501
Well, while the other kids
were out playing baseball...

265
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,802
- You were studying.
- No. I was chasing girls.

266
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:35,801
I never had to study.
Studying I never did because
knowledge came so easy to me.

267
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:37,103
Girls, not so much.

268
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,600
Ok. Have you ever heard
of the midnight circle?

269
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:42,702
- Knitting club for insomniacs?
- You're hilarious. Yes or no?

270
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,002
No.

271
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:47,200
No? That's it?

272
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,202
Wait, there's no medieval
significance or minutiae?

273
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:53,501
Uh, oh! No.
I don't know anything about it.

274
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,401
- Ok, then.
- I have a picture to hang.

275
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,900
Great.

276
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:06,800
You know, if you do ever want to talk,

277
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:10,502
I'm a really good listener.

278
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,402
I don't know if I have
any training for that.

279
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:17,001
Yeah, I didn't think so.

280
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:20,103
Keep it in mind.

281
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,800
I can't believe you lied to me.

282
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,302
It was a secret.
I had to promise I wouldn't tell.

283
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,002
And that was the midnight circle?
There's nothing else?

284
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:48,200
'Cause no more games, Ned.

285
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:51,100
It's a race, a couple of times a month.

286
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,600
They race for money, pink slips,
stuff like that.

287
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:59,603
- And there aren't any rules.
- Where does your mom think you are?

288
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,103
In bed.

289
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,700
I climbed out the window.

290
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:07,900
You have no idea
how much trouble you're in.

291
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:10,502
Delia was furious.
I mean, she was so embarrassed.

292
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,503
Here she is thinking that her
son is asleep in his bedroom.

293
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,600
I thought you said you weren't going to
go out on that road again without me.

294
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,600
I had to go when I had the chance.

295
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:23,800
- Is that where you saw the ghost?
- Yeah. He was in the car that crashed.

296
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,502
- You think he caused it?
- I don't know what to think.

297
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:30,901
I mean, I know that the ghost
is attached to this world,
but it's all so secret.

298
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,202
You should have seen the way they all
scattered when they heard the sirens.

299
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:35,801
You think he's trying
to hurt the racers?

300
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:40,702
Yeah. And I'm really worried
about Cindy, because he said
that somebody's going to die.

301
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:43,103
Maybe that's the way
he died--in a crash.

302
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,803
I keep checking online,
but I don't have a lot to go on.

303
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:47,702
I don't know his name.
I don't know what he looked like.

304
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,901
I don't know when he died.

305
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:53,501
I'll check the records at work,
ask around.

306
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,303
Look, no offense.
It's just not something we talk about.

307
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,500
Yeah, I understand,
but people may get hurt.

308
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,202
That's half the thrill
of the whole thing.

309
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:03,301
- For some people.
- Ok, you almost got killed last night.

310
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:06,701
Last night? I don't think so.
I was at home in bed last night.

311
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:10,801
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry. Um, Melissa, is it?

312
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,603
Melinda.

313
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:15,500
Yeah, well, I got to run.
There's coffee and pastry in the breakroom.

314
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:19,803
Help yourself.
Thanks for coming by.

315
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,601
He died in an illegal street race
19th of february last year

316
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:49,102
in the same spot where
my car first broke down.

317
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:53,201
It says he owned Pike custom owners.
He was racing a guy named Ray Peters.

318
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,202
There were no charges filed.
There's nothing else.

319
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:56,702
Look at the bottom.

320
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:01,003
Survived by his fiancee Cindy Brown.

321
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:02,700
- Cindy Cindy.
- Exactly.

322
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:05,201
Now I know who the ghost is
and who he's attached to.

323
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:07,802
- What's he trying to do?
- Protect her? I don't know.

324
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,502
Maybe he's going to wipe out
all the people who race against her?

325
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,102
Sounds like a true romantic.

326
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:17,001
- All right, what are you going to do?
- I've got to find this ghost tonight.

327
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:19,502
You doing anything?

328
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:21,903
Cool.

329
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:30,402
Just, uh, stay in the beam
of the headlight.

330
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:34,303
Yeah. I'll wave if I need you.

331
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:46,801
I know your name.

332
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:49,603
Gordon Pike.

333
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,901
I know that you died in a car race.

334
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,701
I can help.

335
00:25:56,208 --> 00:26:00,103
I think I know what's going on.

336
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:05,200
This has to do with Cindy, doesn't it?

337
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,002
Yeah, it's about Cindy.

338
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,300
Well, I can help you
talk to her if you want,

339
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:19,501
if it'll help you cross over,
but you can't stay here.

340
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:23,302
- You just can't. 
- I trained her, taught her to race.

341
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,203
Everything she knows is because of me.

342
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:28,501
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you can protect her forever.

343
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,901
I don't want to protect her.

344
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,302
I'm going to kill her.

345
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:38,701
She thought she was as good as me.
She wanted to prove she was better.

346
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:42,100
I don't understand. I thought you two
were a couple. Weren't you engaged?

347
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:45,800
I was her first love.
She thought I was a rock star.

348
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,703
Most  people were afraid of me
because I wanted to race.

349
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,201
Not her.

350
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:52,701
I've never had anybody
look at me that way before.

351
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:56,203
Ok, so what went wrong?

352
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,703
I let her drive my car.

353
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:00,502
What?

354
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:03,802
I taught her to race.
I showed her everything I know.

355
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:06,603
She was good, too.
A natural.

356
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,901
Then she didn't need me anymore.

357
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:12,601
She wanted to prove
she was faster and smarter.

358
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:16,303
- Was she?
- Smarter, maybe.

359
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:19,502
She really knew how to mess
with my head before a race.

360
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:23,001
It started with just kid stuff.
She's got to competitive with me.

361
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:25,701
Then she had to keep pushing it.

362
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:29,002
- Like, sometimes she'd mess
with my nitrous. - Nitrous?

363
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:32,802
You inject it into the manifold
when you need a last-second boost.

364
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:35,401
Or she'd mess with my fuel mixture.
Little things.

365
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,701
But then I started losing,
and it wasn't funny anymore.

366
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:44,900
The night I died was a big race between
me and Ray Peters, a 15k payday.

367
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:48,002
And she warned me she wasn't going
to let me get paid that night.

368
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:49,601
So, what happened?

369
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:53,302
I came out of the turn, hit the nitrous button.

370
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,002
Next thing I know... boom!

371
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:05,202
I'm floating above my car watching it burn.

372
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:08,802
And I see my body just laying there,

373
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:12,300
all the skin burned off.

374
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:16,300
Do you really think that Cindy
could do something like that?

375
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:19,000
Maybe, maybe not.
Same result.

376
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,402
She took things too far.

377
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:24,703
Did you cause the crash the other night?

378
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:30,801
I was just having some fun,
making Jimmy bash her around a little.

379
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:35,102
I'm saving the real thing for monday.

380
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,403
The 19th of february.

381
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:41,201
The day you died, a year ago.

382
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:45,201
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to make fun.

383
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,302
No, it's ok. I'm used to people
being in tears right about now.

384
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:52,103
I can just picture Gordon running around
like a ghost, still trying to win races.

385
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,400
What a funny idea.

386
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:55,501
You know I'm not kidding.

387
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:58,702
Oh, no. You seem like you really believe it.

388
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:02,500
He told me that he made Jimmy
run into your car.

389
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:03,800
What do you want?

390
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:05,503
I think Gordon's trying to hurt you.

391
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:09,003
Well, he couldn't do that anymore
than he already has.

392
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:11,503
He told me that he taught you
everything about racing.

393
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,500
He did. But once I got the hang of it,

394
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,900
I could make a car do
any damn thing I wanted.

395
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,800
My very first race I won.

396
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:21,202
Then I won the next one and
the one after that. It was crazy.

397
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:25,902
Right away, people started
to know my name.

398
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,602
Gordon got so jealous.

399
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:35,902
He still thought he was better than me,
and he never let me forget it.

400
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,501
He even got a car straight from
Japan with right-hand drive--

401
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,800
anything to get attention.

402
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:44,503
So, naturally,
I'd challenge him,

403
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,000
and I'd beat him.

404
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:48,203
Over and over again.

405
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:51,103
I wasn't just Gordon Pike's
girlfriend anymore.

406
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,303
He was Cindy Brown's boyfriend.

407
00:29:54,408 --> 00:29:57,200
- He said he was your first love.
- Oh, he was.

408
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,703
He was everything I thought
a man was supposed to be.

409
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:02,302
And then he showed me what I could do.
He showed me what was possible.

410
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:06,602
I mean, I never thought I had any kind
of talent, let alone this kind.

411
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:09,001
- Just one problem.
- What?

412
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:13,001
Once he saw how good I was, he wanted
to put the genie back in the bottle.

413
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:14,401
Like how?

414
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:17,200
He'd do anything to keep
guys from racing me.

415
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:19,703
What happened the night he died?

416
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:22,902
Gordon was pissed. Ray Peters
had never been beaten before.

417
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:27,103
He had to wait in line to race him.

418
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,000
Me and you, finally.

419
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:33,003
- Man, I'm shaking.
- Yeah, you will be.

420
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:35,900
You're the one I should be racing,
not your old man.

421
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:38,803
You're the one to beat,
from what I hear.

422
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:42,100
Yeah, well, you have to
get past him first.

423
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,800
Done deal.

424
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:52,101
He was out of control after that,
and I guess I wasn't much comfort.

425
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,500
What do you mean?

426
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,000
I liked it.

427
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,401
I liked that Ray said what he said.

428
00:30:56,507 --> 00:31:00,901
Hell, it was more of a compliment
than I ever got from Gordon.

429
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:05,503
He thinks that you did something to
his car to cause the crash that night.

430
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:07,601
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Gordon.

431
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,603
Ray Peters ran him off the track.
Everyone knows that.

432
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,702
- So, Ray Peters caused the accident?
- The king of dirty tricks?

433
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,100
He probably did it just coming out
of the turn where no one could see.

434
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,701
- Yeah, but Gordon's car blew up.
- Look!

435
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:25,001
I did love Gordon, even when
I hated him. You understand?

436
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:26,600
Not really, no.

437
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:30,603
I would never have done anything
to hurt Gordon. Not like that.

438
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:36,101
And if he is really here
like you say he is, he knows it.

439
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:41,501
I feel like I've gone from
"West Side Story" to

440
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,902
- "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."
- It's just so weird.

441
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:46,701
Two people who start out loving
each other end up hating each other.

442
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:47,501
How does that happen?

443
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,002
The question you gotta ask is
why do they keep making it happen.

444
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:51,102
What do you mean?

445
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:53,403
Well, I mean, everybody's
got a storeroom, right?

446
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:55,800
Resentment, grudges, anger?

447
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:58,600
Most people, they open up that storeroom
and they let a few of them out.

448
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,800
You know, they deal with them.
They get rid of them.

449
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:04,700
Something tells me that your storeroom
would be standing room only.

450
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,103
Yeah, sometimes i gotta knock down
the wall into the next storeroom,

451
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:11,101
but the point is, you know, a couple,
two people, they start using those bad

452
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:14,202
things from that storeroom
against each other, why stay?

453
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,100
Why not move on?

454
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:16,900
Maybe they're getting
something out of it.

455
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:19,001
Yeah. They need to be miserable.

456
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:21,601
For some people, that's as strong
as the need to breath.

457
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,501
It's like they're feeding off
each other, like they're trying

458
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:28,500
to convince each other that
they don't deserve to be happy.

459
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:31,700
Makes me glad I'm basically a simpleton.

460
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:33,703
Far from it.

461
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:36,903
You gotta keep these two people
away from each other for good.

462
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,801
How are you going to do that?

463
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:41,700
I'm going to talk to a guy
named Ray Peters.

464
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:43,503
Now you want me
to hang out with racers?

465
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:46,801
What I want is for you to introduce me
to Ray Peters. It's important.

466
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:49,601
- Ghost related?
- Yeah, if you must know.

467
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:52,703
- I like to be kept a little more
in the loop. - You're unbelievable.

468
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,301
You could just think of me
as a sounding board.

469
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,801
Look, are you going to introduce me
to Ray Peters or not?

470
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,402
Are you going to save me from
my mother hanging me by my ankles?

471
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,400
You're lucky to have a mother
who cares so much about you,

472
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:04,303
and we are not going
anywhere near cars.

473
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:08,503
Do you know where Ray Peters works?

474
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:23,001
So, the much feared Ray Peters
delivers pizza?

475
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,001
Yeah.

476
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,200
Very, very fast.

477
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,702
Ok.

478
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,102
Why is she asking me
so many questions, Ned?

479
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,903
Look, she's cool.
She's with me.

480
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,702
Ok, I got it, Ned.
Thanks.

481
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:36,403
I want to talk about that night.
Do you remember anything?

482
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:37,800
Like I could forget it.

483
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,300
Am I happy Gordon kissed
the blue wave? No.

484
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:42,102
Am I happy it wasn't me? Yes.

485
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,902
What about the accident? People say
that you ran Gordon off the track.

486
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,503
People can say whatever
they want to say.

487
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,103
Ok, but did you,
'cause Cindy thinks you did.

488
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:51,002
- What if I did?
- I want to know.

489
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:54,402
Not because I want to cause you any
trouble, but because it's important.

490
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:58,103
Whatever happened that night is between
me and Gordon, and Gordon's dead.

491
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:02,502
So, I guess you will
really never know.

492
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:09,302
Will I see you tonight?

493
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,100
You're racing tonight?

494
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,601
You bet your ass.

495
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:16,600
I'm racing Cindy Brown, finally.

496
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:20,802
In memory of Gordon.

497
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,103
Now you know why I like
to hang out with these guys.

498
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:32,900
You, in the store, right now.

499
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,400
If it was Ray Peters,
how come I don't remember?

500
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,800
You said yourself you didn't
remember exactly what happened.

501
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,100
Cindy was always messing with my car.
That's the only thing that could've

502
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,801
made my car blow up, not Ray
forcing me off the track.

503
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:45,302
I don't think she'd do
anything on purpose.

504
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,700
I think she still has
feelings for you.

505
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:50,003
- You think?
- Yeah, I do.

506
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:53,502
I don't think she would ever
try to kill you.

507
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:56,100
Look, make your peace, Gordon.

508
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:59,801
Cross over.
Be done with it.

509
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:02,602
There's only one thing
I need to cross over.

510
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,003
What?

511
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,001
And that's for her
to cross over with me.

512
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,203
And I'm going to make sure
that that happens.

513
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,300
Come with me to the garage
and let me help you talk to her.

514
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:15,200
You go.
Tell her I said hello.

515
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:23,202
If you do this, then you can
forget about turning pro.

516
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,501
This is more important
than turning pro.

517
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:28,203
- What, revenge?
- How about justice?

518
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:31,000
Nobody ever did anything about how
Gordon died. They all just let it go.

519
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,602
And they think I don't care,
now they're gonna learn different.

520
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,101
I want you to do this. I want justice.
That's what Gordon would have liked.

521
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,202
- People are going to see you do it.
- I've just got to force him up into

522
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:44,203
the wall, and there's a good chance
he'll roll and he'll get exactly
what he deserves.

523
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:50,100
Ray Peters killed Gordon.
Tonight I'm going to return the favor.

524
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:10,102
- Cindy couldn't hurt me if she tried.
- I wouldn't underestimate her.

525
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,403
Why? Because she thinks
I made Gordon crash?

526
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:17,102
No, because she thinks
you made Gordon die.

527
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:20,903
She can give me her best shot.

528
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:23,200
Look, you want to know
who killed Gordon Pike?

529
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,901
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

530
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,902
Gordon Pike killed Gordon Pike.
That's it.

531
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,200
What are you talking about?

532
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:29,801
He was trying to run me off the track.

533
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:32,502
But I knew his move,
saw him do it a hundred times.

534
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:37,202
I braked on him. He shot off my fender
and went into a bad spin, rolled over.

535
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:39,502
I think he ruptured his fuel tank,
I don't know.

536
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:41,802
But when he hit the ditch,
his car blew.

537
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,302
He died because he was trying
to screw me and it backfired.

538
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,502
Is he right?

539
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,602
He was ready for me.

540
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,202
He knew what I was going to do.

541
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:54,401
He used my own momentum
to put me into a spin. - What?

542
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:57,300
I hit the nitrous to try
to power out of it.

543
00:36:57,405 --> 00:37:00,503
Everything went white.

544
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:06,102
- Who the hell are you talking to?
- Come on. Let's do it.

545
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,802
It's Cindy's car.

546
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:12,502
I loosened the bolt
on her steering column.

547
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,500
What?

548
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,301
You're nuts.

549
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:45,800
Stop the car!

550
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,701
Stop the car!

551
00:37:57,806 --> 00:38:01,501
Stop the car, Cindy! Please!

552
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:07,403
Stop the car, baby. Please.
It's all my fault.

553
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:11,601
I'm so sorry.
I know it wasn't you.

554
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,201
Watch out!

555
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,502
- Give her some room!
- I'm ok! I'm ok.

556
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:33,302
- What happened?
- I don't know.

557
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,300
The steering went out.

558
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,102
I swear, I checked it, Cindy.
It was tight.

559
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:41,000
It was him, wasn't it?
Tell me. It was him!

560
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:43,401
Ok, Cindy, please.

561
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:45,801
He knows what happened,
how it wasn't you and it wasn't Ray.

562
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,800
- It was his own mistake.
- Well, he just tri
