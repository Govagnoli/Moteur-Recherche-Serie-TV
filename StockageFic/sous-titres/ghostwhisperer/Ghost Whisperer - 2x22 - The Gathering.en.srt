1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,100
Previously on Ghost Whisperer:

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,400
There were 5 signs this past year:

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,700
the dead dove, the bee, the dead will
walk, the return of the forgotten.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,400
The only thing that hasn't happened
is death of a loved one.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,900
She's gonna be all right.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,500
Are you trying to tell me
something about my friend?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,900
All eyes will be on you.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,900
There's a better place for you.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Gabriel...

10
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:36,900
what are you saying?

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,006
We're blocking the light...

12
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:43,304
and soon, no one's gonna get through.

13
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:56,509
You have something I want.

14
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,303
Do you know what it's like
to be obsessed, miss Gordon?

15
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:06,700
So that you can't think,
you can't eat?

16
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:08,001
I do.

17
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,201
And these children do.
And I think soon, you will, too.

18
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,701
Why am I here?

19
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,303
Sorry about the drama,
my assistant called you.

20
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,903
But I had to know that you'd
be willing to come to me.

21
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:17,800
Meaning?

22
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:22,300
Meaning that since the very mention of
the words May the 11th on the telephone
brought you here,

23
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,502
I know we're both interested
in the same thing.

24
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:28,302
I'm not gonna play word games
with you, mr...

25
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:29,603
Clark.

26
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,902
Ethan Clark.
Happy to meet you.

27
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,102
Yeah. You obviously already
know my name.

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,903
A byproduct of the aforementioned obsession.

29
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,001
I don't want to play games
with you, either.

30
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,303
Honestly.

31
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:45,700
I just want to find out what you know
and tell you what I know.

32
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,902
May the 11th, 2005.

33
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:52,902
A ferry capsized in the Irish Sea.

34
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:56,802
Young mr. Liam Fletcher
was on that ferry.

35
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,601
He survived.

36
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:06,702
The reason I'm so aware
of this accident is because my
wife Dana was also on that ferry.

37
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,800
She did not survive.

38
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:12,401
In fact, no one else did.

39
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:16,102
A year later, May the 11th, 2006,

40
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,903
I came down to my morning paper
and read about a plane crash

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,003
just outside a little town of Grandview.

42
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:24,803
Sent me thinking about May the 11th.

43
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,202
And I started looking
at other May the 11ths.

44
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:30,101
Maybe you have, too.

45
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,100
May 11,2004...

46
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,700
Subway tunnel caved in in Moscow.

47
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:41,601
Miraculously survived by Elena Petrova.

48
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,803
May the 11th, 2003.

49
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:48,702
Bridge collapsed in Italy.

50
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,603
Sole survivor, Stefano Donato.

51
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,800
How'd you know about these accidents?

52
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:04,403
It's complicated.

53
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,201
Yes, it is.

54
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,103
What does all of this
have to do with me?

55
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,200
I don't know.

56
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:16,203
But what I do know is that everything
leads back to you, Melinda.

57
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,703
- May I call you Melinda?
- Not yet.

58
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,503
Right.

59
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:24,203
I've spent the last year traveling
the world researching the accidents

60
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,701
and finding these children.

61
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:30,600
Each one of them, working on
a little part of this puzzle.

62
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,802
Each one of them obsessed with you.

63
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,103
Why?

64
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,700
Well, that's where it gets interesting.

65
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:41,801
Karen, would you bring in Stefano?

66
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,802
Stefano...

67
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,303
One day...

68
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:53,300
I died.

69
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,200
And I saw you.

70
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,903
I need to know what the hell
is going on here.

71
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,100
They don't seem like
accidents, do they?

72
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:10,101
4 events, same date, a year apart.

73
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:13,401
What's the pattern?
What are they a part of?

74
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,601
I've been trying to figure that out, too.

75
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,403
If there's something bigger going on,

76
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,100
I want to know what.

77
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:22,103
I mean, I've been led to you
for a reason, don't you think?

78
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,700
We should work together.

79
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,303
How?

80
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:28,601
There's one child survivor
I haven't been able to locate.

81
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,003
The little girl who was
in the plane crash.

82
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:34,103
Kristen Filbert.

83
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:43,100
She was pulled from a car
that got crushed under the plane.

84
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,402
Her mom died trying to protect her.

85
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:50,003
Well, I think somewhere she's making
something or drawing something.

86
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:52,002
I mean, maybe the picture
isn't complete.

87
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:55,100
Maybe she has the answer.

88
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:59,100
Do you think you could find her?

89
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:31,102
EPISODE 2x22
"The Gathering"

90
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,201
This guy is filthy rich.

91
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,401
He actually owns the ferry company
from the accident,

92
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:39,002
but that's just a part of it.
He owns an airline, a shipping company

93
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:40,903
and 3 quarters of a soccer team.

94
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,101
What, he couldn't afford
the other quarter?

95
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,303
You should have seen those kids' faces.

96
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,300
They looked at me like
they already knew me.

97
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:49,102
I don't get this guy.

98
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,803
I mean, I don't know
what his endgame is.

99
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,703
- Does he know what you can do?
- I didn't tell him,

100
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,102
and I don't know if I will.

101
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:58,402
He lost his wife on that ferry,
and I think researching the stuff

102
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:02,001
just makes him feel
connected to her somehow.

103
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:03,803
Yeah, but can you trust him?

104
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,900
I don't know that, either.

105
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:08,002
But, look, he brought these kids here.
I mean,

106
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,602
I owe it to them to find out what
it is they're going through and why.

107
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,400
This doesn't make sense to me,
and I don't think it makes sense
to you, either,

108
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,100
and it's starting to give me the creeps,

109
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:20,301
so, will you please let me
take you away from here?

110
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,100
At least till after the 11th?

111
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:23,301
I would love that.

112
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:28,202
But if this is about me, then it's
gonna follow me wherever I go.

113
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,302
And I need to see it through here.

114
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,800
How can I help you?

115
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,603
Be careful.

116
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,303
Be aware of everything around you.

117
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,400
And we'll get through it.

118
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:40,803
And, call me...

119
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:44,202
like a million times.

120
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,803
I will.

121
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,902
What is this?

122
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,602
We used to be strong and many.

123
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,001
Now we're few.

124
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:54,802
There are more dark spirits now.

125
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,900
They get stronger, we get weaker.

126
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:06,702
You have to protect
the ones who are left.

127
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,900
You fail, we fail.

128
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,902
So do you think is means
that Gabriel is back?

129
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,801
I don't know who else
she could be talking about.

130
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,600
Well, it doesn't necessarily
mean Grandview, right?

131
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,600
I mean, this ghost could have been in
Zimbabwe yesterday, for all we know.

132
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,800
No, I'm pretty sure that this ghost
has been making the same rounds
since she died.

133
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,703
Where is your desk and stuff?

134
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,001
Oh, well, it seems that I failed
to inform the supply manager

135
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:38,703
that I postponed my sabbatical.

136
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,202
So they took all your furniture?

137
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,301
An oversight. Heads will roll.

138
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,301
What I'd really like to know is
where have you been?

139
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:45,503
Why haven't you called me sooner?

140
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,402
I mean, we have children with
near-death experiences,

141
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,600
psychic visions, you have a prophet
ghost with the candle brigade.

142
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:51,800
Is your dialing finger broken?

143
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,800
Sorry. Things have been
happening very fast.

144
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:57,706
Well, you'll be very happy to know
that the lack of a desk or a chair
with wheels hasn't stopped me

145
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,504
from trying to figure out
what is going to happen on May 11th.

146
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:04,809
See, it all has to do with
a world out of balance,

147
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:07,502
a world where chaos rules,

148
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,703
which is what prophet ghost
keeps telling us,

149
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,100
and what we know Gabriel wants.

150
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:14,001
From the fall of the Roman Empire
to the Civil War,

151
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,901
it all starts with a single,
individual trigger.

152
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,801
Well, I don't think that the prophet
ghost is talking about an apocalypse.

153
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:23,303
I think she's talking about these kids.
They've been touched by the light,

154
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,303
their changed.

155
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:26,400
Well, that's my point exactly.
All these giant events start

156
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,100
with a single, individual trigger.

157
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,401
I mean, the assassination of Julius
Caesar caused 15 years of Civil War

158
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:33,203
and the eventual fall of Rome.

159
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,401
The election of Abraham Lincoln
split this country in two.

160
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,202
That's something we're still not over.

161
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:41,300
All these giant disasters can be
traced back to the smallest fuse.

162
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:45,302
So the fifth accident that you and I
think is gonna happen on May 11th

163
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,302
may actually be disguised
as something small?

164
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,000
But it will have a huge effect
on the world.

165
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:52,600
It might be a misfortune suffered
by a few very special children,

166
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,302
children that are a threat
to the dark side.

167
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:55,802
Well, there's still one out there.

168
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,001
The little girl that Jim pulled
from the plane crash.

169
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,702
Well, we have to find her
if she has a piece of this puzzle.

170
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:03,200
We have to figure out what's going to happen on May 11th.

171
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:05,400
We have less than one week to find her.

172
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:10,100
If I had a desk,
I'd pound it for emphasis.

173
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,500
Something I can help you with?

174
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,303
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for someone.

175
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:30,602
Don't like to see people
messing around with the mailboxes.

176
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,201
Neither do I.

177
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:36,102
I was just looking for a man,
Charlie Filbert.

178
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:38,900
This... it was the last address
I had for him, so...

179
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,502
Long gone.

180
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,203
- Excuse me?
- About 6 months ago.

181
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,003
Her and her dad just moved out.

182
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,202
Well, did they leave
a forwarding address?

183
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:50,902
I wouldn't know about that.

184
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,402
I hope I'll see you again.

185
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,700
You're a lot nicer than the other one.

186
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,101
What other one?

187
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:06,702
- Gotta finish my rounds.
- No, wait, was his name Gabriel?

188
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:12,700
Now you know everything.

189
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,001
You've been given 5 signs,
and they're all pointing

190
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,202
to something happening on May 11th?

191
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,901
There's this sign that
I keep getting warned about.

192
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,702
It's the only thing that hasn't
happened yet, death of a loved one.

193
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,602
But the warning keeps getting stronger.

194
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:29,602
And you still think this has
something to do with me?

195
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,600
I don't know. It may be you,
it may be Jim,

196
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:34,700
but it's definitely something
I have to pay attention to, and

197
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:37,100
now you really think I'm insane.

198
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,402
I think you're my friend.

199
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:42,603
And people come into each
other's lives for a reason.

200
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:44,603
Maybe I'm supposed to learn something.

201
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,701
Maybe you are.

202
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,600
But whatever it is, I...

203
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,100
I am here for you.

204
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:56,400
I can't tell you how much
that means to me.

205
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:58,302
And, uh...

206
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,301
you are a little insane.

207
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,103
But that is what I love about you.

208
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,902
Thanks. I think.

209
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,303
So, how can I help?

210
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,301
I'm looking for Kristen Filbert,

211
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,102
the little girl who survived
the plane crash.

212
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:15,000
She and her father moved away a few
months ago, and I don't know where.

213
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:17,403
Did you check her middle school?

214
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,203
No.

215
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:20,403
Just because somebody moves
doesn't mean they change schools.

216
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,203
And even if they did,
maybe they'll be willing

217
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:26,103
to tell you where they sent the records.

218
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,602
I miss Kristen.

219
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:29,400
She was a smart kid,
always did her work,

220
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,701
got along with everyone.

221
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,700
Can you tell me
where you sent her records?

222
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, well, we didn't.
We just gave them to her dad.

223
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:38,200
He said he wanted to home school her,

224
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,402
that he had just found a little
house up in Sunset Park.

225
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,703
Do you know why?
I mean, why he took her away?

226
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:47,402
She just never really came back
all the way after she lost her mother.

227
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,802
She was withdrawn, she barely spoke.

228
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,400
- Did she draw a lot?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,400
She was always working on something,
but she wouldn't show anyone.

230
00:12:56,507 --> 00:13:01,701
Did she leave anything behind,
like a drawing or anything?

231
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:05,603
You know, there was one thing.

232
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,401
There was an english assignment I gave,

233
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,601
I asked them to write down
the first thing they thought of
when they woke up in the morning,

234
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:16,302
and the last thought they had
before they went to sleep.

235
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:21,901
I haven't been able to get
Kristen's answer out of my mind.

236
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,700
Melinda...

237
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,700
Melinda...

238
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,901
Melinda...

239
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:15,801
Hi, grandma!

240
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:19,401
It is so good to see you!

241
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,401
- Am I dreaming?
- Sure.

242
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:26,803
That's the only way
I can come to you now.

243
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,700
I always liked watching you
hang the laundry.

244
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,201
I know.

245
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,200
Made you feel safe.

246
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,001
What is it like
where you are, grandma?

247
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:39,103
Well, that doesn't matter right now.

248
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:43,302
There are things that you have
to do here, honey, important things.

249
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:48,903
You have to be ready for what's coming,
and you can't doubt yourself.

250
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:53,603
I want to be ready, but...
I don't know how.

251
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:57,103
They're gonna come for you, honey.

252
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:59,700
You may not even recognize them.

253
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:04,900
Well, they may come as something
as normal as the weather.

254
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,701
Just don't be afraid.

255
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:11,901
If you are, you'll lose everything.

256
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:16,501
You must protect the balance.

257
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:36,402
Grandma?

258
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm really sorry to barge in on you
like this. I know it's been a while.

259
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,801
It isn't that I'm not happy
to see you, I am.

260
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,200
It's just, you know, I'm trying
to get Grandview out of my head.

261
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,700
And Kristen's...

262
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,602
She's had a rough time, hasn't she?

263
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,400
Well, she was ok until
she got back from the hospital,

264
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:01,201
started having dreams.

265
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:05,300
Didn't want to talk about it.
She started crying at night,
crying for her mother.

266
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:11,703
You know, I try and comfort her,
and sometimes I lose it, too, you know?

267
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,401
Well, yeah, we both just...
we just miss her a lot.

268
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,401
Did moving help?

269
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:20,601
Oh, no. Not really.

270
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:23,203
Not yet, anyhow.

271
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:26,700
Now, you said there were other kids
who were going through the same thing?

272
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:32,102
Kids who have survived disasters
and near-death experiences.

273
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,002
I want her to come to Grandview.

274
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:37,001
I really feel like it would help everyone
if she could just meet these kids.

275
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,302
No way. I'm sorry.

276
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:40,603
I know how you feel.

277
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:44,703
Ok? I really do, but I wouldn't ask
unless I thought it was really important.

278
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:48,003
Why is it important?

279
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:52,400
I think this could be a part
of something much bigger.

280
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:57,703
And I feel like she and these kids
should be together right now.

281
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,202
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:03,703
It's just not a good time.

283
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:08,300
Well, thanks for thinking
about it anyway.

284
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,201
call me,

285
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:15,501
you know, if you change your mind
or if you just want to talk.

286
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:19,302
Her teacher said that she was drawing
a lot and didn't to show anyone.

287
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,803
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:29,402
She started doing these right after
she came home from the hospital.

289
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,000
Could I keep this one?

290
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:33,101
There are a couple hundred
just like it upstairs.

291
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:36,603
I guess I can spare one.

292
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:41,100
I think I've seen this before.

293
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:07,200
Ok, this is what Kristen drew.

294
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,902
And this...

295
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,200
is the composite

296
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:15,301
that Liam, Stefano and Elena did.

297
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,902
Ok? Now, watch this.

298
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:22,703
Ok. Follow me.

299
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,101
It was right under our noses
the whole time.

300
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:57,103
Dedication and midnight lantern walk
on may 11th to honor the 230 victims

301
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,000
of the crash of flight 395.

302
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,201
I don't exactly understand.
What does this tell us?

303
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:06,802
Kristen's painting is almost an exact
match to the new memorial
at the plane crash site.

304
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:10,401
It also matches the drawings
that the other kids have been doing.

305
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:11,703
Means whatever's going to happen,

306
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,503
it's probably going to happen
at the crash site.

307
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:16,401
That's what the kids have been trying
to tell us without them realizing it.

308
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:20,702
But when you say "whatever's going
to happen", what do you mean?

309
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,100
We've been tracking this
for quite some time,

310
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:27,301
and Melinda and both feel that the
number five plays heavily into this.

311
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:30,701
We believe that the fifth accident
is going to happen this May 11th.

312
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,801
- In 4 days?
- Yes.

313
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,001
Here in Grandview?

314
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,002
Well, so it seems.

315
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:40,102
But it's not as important where as to
whom, and right now it's about Melinda.

316
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,501
Ok, there is something that you need
to know about me.

317
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,100
Melinda...

318
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:48,202
can see ghosts.

319
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:53,103
She talks to ghosts,
she hangs out with ghosts.

320
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,701
All right.

321
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:00,703
So all this is real?

322
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:02,301
Pretty much.

323
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,703
How do you do it?

324
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:07,202
I've been shown visions from a spirit,
and told certain things.

325
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,603
What's really important is that
we focus on this dedication.

326
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,201
But how are the kids involved?

327
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,603
Let's not find out.

328
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:15,602
I'm gonna talk to somebody
about cancelling the ceremony,

329
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:20,302
or at least postponing it
until we can find out more.

330
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:23,702
This ability you have,
do you see spirits clearly?

331
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,900
- Can you tell one from the other?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,802
Are there any around me?

333
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:32,500
You mean your wife?

334
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,403
No. No, there's no one around you.

335
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:37,000
But that probably means
she crossed over.

336
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,901
So that's a really good thing.

337
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,803
There's something that you're
not telling me about her...

338
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,300
about how she died.

339
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:50,402
I laughed at her.

340
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:55,002
She believed she was psychic
ever since she was a little girl.

341
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:57,300
And did you believe that she was?

342
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,100
No. I didn't believe any of that.

343
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:04,903
I enjoy teasing her,
perhaps little too much.

344
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:11,502
We planned to go to Dublin
on the ferry.

345
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,501
A night before she said
she had a bad feeling.

346
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:19,103
She said she had a vision,
and she ask me to cancel the trip.

347
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:22,601
Again I laughed at her.

348
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:27,202
Our plan was to meet on the ferry.
I was delayed on the conference call.

349
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,501
I didn't notice.

350
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:32,201
She got on the ferry,
I didn't,

351
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,100
and as it turns out,

352
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,401
she was right to have had
a bad feeling.

353
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:40,201
She was right to have asked me
to cancel.

354
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,200
And I lost her.

355
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:57,303
It's not a good time.

356
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,702
Are you the one that can help me?

357
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:03,301
Yes. But it is really
not a good time, ok?

358
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,903
I'm scared.

359
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:10,002
- I don't know what to do.
- Ok, look, just hang in there,

360
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:13,402
all right? And I'll...

361
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,302
Oh, Alex!

362
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,001
Please, don't call me Alex in public.

363
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:28,503
Sorry, mayor Milio,
can I have a minute?

364
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,403
Bad day.

365
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,202
My town council meeting ran late.

366
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,203
I have a school vote and a clean up
committee rally.

367
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:35,801
Look, I really need you to cancel
the dedication ceremony.

368
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:36,602
Why?

369
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:38,501
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

370
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:41,400
But I just get this feeling that
something bad may happen there.

371
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,800
Look, can you just postpone it
until I can get all this figured out?

372
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,000
Get what figured out?

373
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:49,101
Well, I don't exactly know yet, but
I do know there could be some danger.

374
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:50,503
Look,

375
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,502
we're going to have plenty of security.

376
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:56,000
Everything will be fine.

377
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:18,401
Delia!

378
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,101
Delia!

379
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,400
Delia, are you here?

380
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,503
Hey. I was just gonna call you.

381
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:08,701
Are you all right?

382
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,000
It's been a day. A week.

383
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,102
These streets are dangerous.

384
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,602
There was someone who just...

385
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,800
You have a visitor.

386
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:27,102
Kristen, what are you...

387
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,303
How did you get here?

388
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,203
I took a bus.

389
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,703
Please don't tell my dad.

390
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,803
Sweetie, I have to tell your dad, ok?

391
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:38,402
He must be crazy looking for you.

392
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:40,102
Why did you come here?

393
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:44,301
I heard you say that there are
other kids. Just like me.

394
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:46,001
I want to meet them.

395
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:47,802
I feel like I have to.

396
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:49,301
Why?

397
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,903
I don't know.

398
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,901
I don't want to see
the things that I see.

399
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:57,802
What do you see?

400
00:24:57,907 --> 00:25:01,302
I don't want to say it.

401
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,200
It's too awful.

402
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,001
Ok, well...

403
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:14,202
I'll take you to see the others,
but only if your dad says that it's ok.

404
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:18,200
It's a crazy thing that you did
by coming here, Kristen.

405
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:22,003
But I'm really glad you did.

406
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,901
Thank you, Charlie.

407
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:30,602
She's ok.

408
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:33,201
Just let her spend the day, ok?

409
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:37,003
I think it could really help her.

410
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:40,003
Yes, I will bring her back myself.

411
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,400
Ok.

412
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,603
I'll call you later.

413
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:47,703
Melinda Gordon...

414
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:51,702
Grazi.

415
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:59,601
That's the only thing I know in Italian besides bene.

416
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,703
Just going to the kitchen.

417
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:04,301
Come on.

418
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,903
Why does it feel like
we all know each other?

419
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:14,100
Well, maybe because you've all
been through the same things.

420
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,003
Look, I know that this
is hard for all of you.

421
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:20,201
You're in a strange place
and you're scared.

422
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:21,800
I see things.

423
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:23,900
Things that haven't happened.

424
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:26,403
We all do.

425
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:29,300
People who have been through
what you've been through,

426
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:33,001
people who die, even for
a short time and see the light,

427
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,603
they always come back changed.

428
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,303
They know things that
they didn't know before.

429
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,603
And they can see things.

430
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,200
I don't want to.

431
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,603
I just want to be the way I was before.

432
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:45,903
Me, too.

433
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,600
I just want things to be
like it used to be.

434
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,101
I know.

435
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:53,800
You and I have both lost someone
we loved to that plane crash.

436
00:26:53,905 --> 00:27:00,501
And I wish all the time that things
could be as exactly as they were before.

437
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:05,103
Look, I know what it's like
to be different...

438
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:10,901
and to have people make you feel
like you're not quite right.

439
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:15,202
But you just have to know that all
the things that make you different,

440
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:17,300
all the things you've seen,

441
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:20,001
all the things you feel,

442
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:23,201
those are all things
that make you special.

443
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:27,302
No matter what anybody else thinks.

444
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,800
You may have been given a gift.

445
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:35,102
A gift to be able to help
others, maybe even help you.

446
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:39,601
Even if it doesn't always
feel like it's a gift.

447
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,803
I showed them the drawing
of the memorial.

448
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:44,203
They all feel as if
they've been there before,

449
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,503
and they all feel as
if they'll be there again.

450
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:49,703
Oh, I can't let this happen. I mean,
they're sensitives now, you know?

451
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,902
They have some psychic ability,

452
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:56,003
and that could make them a target, too.
We just can't take any chances.

453
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:00,303
Well, it's good they're all together.

454
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:05,501
- Was this your wife?
- Yes. That's Dana.

455
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:17,100
I don't know why I haven't seen you
around your husband.

456
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:20,102
Why are you ignoring him?

457
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,402
I want to see Ethan.

458
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:25,102
But I can't yet.

459
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,403
Why?

460
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,300
- I'm only here to help you.
- So then help me.

461
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:35,302
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

462
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:40,701
Is Ethan all right?

463
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:43,701
He feels a lot of guilt

464
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,203
about not believing
that you were psychic,

465
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:51,002
letting you get on that ferry
and not canceling it.

466
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:53,800
I think that's a big part
of why he's here.

467
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:57,400
He has nothing to feel guilty about.

468
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:01,300
Everything happened as it should.

469
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,200
I know that now.

470
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:07,400
Watch out for him.

471
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,603
Don't let him lose himself.

472
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,101
Tell him...

473
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,600
I'll find my way to him.

474
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:19,101
I will.

475
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:28,301
Hey, Ethan, it's Melinda.
Please call me, it's really important.

476
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,200
I've left 2 messages at his house,

477
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,701
and I don't even know how many
messages on his cell phone.

478
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:35,303
Are you sure you should tell him
that his wife's...

479
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:36,701
ghost is here?

480
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:38,301
How can I not tell him?

481
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:40,703
Because he can't talk to her, right?

482
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:44,303
I mean, what's worse?
Thinking someone you love is not there,

483
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:49,500
or knowing that they are,
and you can't interact with them?

484
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,602
I don't even know
if that's my call to make.

485
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,503
But I can at least tell him that she's
ok and that she's thinking about him.

486
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,301
Ok, I get that.

487
00:29:56,405 --> 00:30:00,000
But what if it makes him...

488
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,003
What?

489
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,402
Are you sure it was him?
It was Gabriel?

490
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,600
Believe me, it was him. What the hell
was he doing with Ethan?

491
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:14,100
- How do they even know each other?
- You know, I never trusted that Ethan.

492
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,103
- You only met him once.
- I know, but he's got that accent,

493
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:17,703
- and he's handsome.
- Yeah, and?

494
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,803
Well, that pretty much that covers it.

495
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,002
So, still haven't found your furniture?

496
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:25,200
That's a sore subject with me.
Let's not bring it up.

497
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:27,702
I know a place that has
a sale on lawn chairs.

498
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:30,300
Look, we know that Ethan
is interested in these accidents,

499
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:31,900
- and what follows, right?
- Right.

500
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,700
Ok, we know that Gabriel wants
to take souls to the dark side

501
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,301
to make the dark side stronger, right?

502
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:37,103
Yes.

503
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:41,002
Ok. So how does what Gabriel want
intersect with what Ethan wants?

504
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,002
First, we have to assume that these accidents,

505
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,200
like the plane crash, are being
caused by the dark spirits,

506
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,200
'cause we know that
they're getting stronger and

507
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,502
want to cause pain and grief
whenever they can.

508
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,401
Well, what would the light spirit's
answer to that be?

509
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:53,903
- Survivors.
- Survivors?

510
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,901
Every accident had one survivor.

511
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:57,101
Kids.

512
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,802
Purity, innocence.

513
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:01,903
Yeah. Yeah, these kids had
near-death experiences.

514
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,000
They're special. They're light
spirits in their own right.

515
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:07,603
And they're powerful ones. And maybe
they're more powerful in groups of four.

516
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,200
My grandmother told me that I have to
protect the balance.

517
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:12,202
I thought your grandmother died.

518
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,901
Right, sorry, I forget
that doesn't matter in your world.

519
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:19,201
Look, no one was meant to survive
these accidents, yet these 4 kids did.

520
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:21,800
And they were touched by the light,
so they're a threat to Gabriel

521
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:23,400
and whoever controls him.

522
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:27,100
That's why Gabriel's here.

523
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,400
Where are the kids?

524
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:54,301
Hello?!

525
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:55,502
I need to see Ethan.

526
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:56,701
He's not here.

527
00:31:56,805 --> 00:31:58,103
Where are the kids?

528
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:02,902
Ethan and his friend left
with them an hour ago.

529
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,601
Where did he take those kids?

530
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:07,303
Grandview.

531
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:15,800
Stop! There he is.

532
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:22,801
No, just wait here.

533
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,701
He promised you that you'd be able
to talk to your wife again, didn't he?

534
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,901
You never told me she was still here.
Gabriel did.

535
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,103
Look, I was trying, ok?
I left you a message.

536
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:34,701
Did you let him take those kids?

537
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:36,301
- They're fine.
- Where are the kids?

538
00:32:36,408 --> 00:32:37,702
- I'm not telling you.
- Why not?

539
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,901
Because he told me not to help you.

540
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,902
How the hell did Gabriel find you,
or did you find him?

541
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,900
He came to me. I don't know
how he knew about me or the kids.

542
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,301
He told me he could see the dead,
and that my wife was here.

543
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:51,702
He told me that she could come here,

544
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,403
but that you'd make her go away.

545
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,701
I can't make her do anything.

546
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:57,800
He told me she could come back forever,

547
00:32:57,906 --> 00:32:59,800
that I could talk to her,

548
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,702
that she'd come right here,

549
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,901
but if I helped you,

550
00:33:04,008 --> 00:33:05,401
you wouldn't let her come.

551
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,200
Ethan, I've seen Dana.

552
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:10,403
Ok? I didn't know who she was at first,
but she kept coming to me.

553
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:13,501
She showed me the accident, she helped
me understand what's going on.

554
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,303
Those kids are in danger.

555
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:18,300
He told me I shouldn't believe you.

556
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:20,702
Tell him he has to help you.

557
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:23,501
She's here.

558
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:27,700
Dana...

559
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,300
She wants you to help me.

560
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:34,801
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

561
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:39,801
Ask him if he remembers what he said to
me the day he asked me to marry him.

562
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:43,001
Do you remember what you said to her
the day that you proposed?

563
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,803
Of course I do.

564
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:47,402
He said if I married him,

565
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,100
I'd never spend another lonely minute.

566
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:55,402
You told her she'd never
spend another lonely minute.

567
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:00,900
I miss you so much.

568
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,102
You made me try so hard.

569
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,402
All I wanted was to be the man
you thought I was.

570
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,802
Now it's too late.

571
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,102
Nothing matters anymore.

572
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,301
It's not too late.

573
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,302
Tell him...

574
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:20,601
this is all meant to happen.

575
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,701
Everything happened for a reason.

576
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,602
She said it's never too late,

577
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,501
and that everything has happened
for a reason.

578
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,400
She wants you to help me, Ethan.

579
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:31,101
Ok, that's what means
something right now.

580
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:34,800
Now please tell me where
Gabriel took those kids.

581
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,103
The dedication.

582
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,602
He wanted them to be
part of the lantern walk.

583
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:42,003
He said it would be good for them
if they were part of something.

584
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:46,401
I mean, you didn't tell me
she was here!

585
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:49,102
I'm sorry!

586
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:54,502
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:04,503
I love you.

588
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:24,801
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention, please...

589
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,801
you all know me, I'm mayor Milio,
and I'd like to say to you,

590
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:34,000
today marks the anniversary
of a very tragic event.

591
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:35,203
Mel, hey.

592
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,602
Jim, it's me.

593
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:39,203
I need you to find Kristen
and the other kids.

594
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:42,402
Mel, there's no signal up here.
I can't here you.

595
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,600
No, hello?

596
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,000
Mel?

597
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,601
Oh, Jim?!

598
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,703
Can you go any faster?

599
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:58,301
We are people from different
parts of the county,

600
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,300
different parts of the state,

601
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,101
and we're all here this evening

602
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,802
in order to honor these poor souls.

603
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:11,703
The children of Grandview have joined
together for a lantern procession.

604
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,203
Ladies and gentlemen,

605
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:16,101
our children.

606
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,003
It's ok, sweetie.

607
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:13,501
You're safe.

608
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:18,100
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:20,000
This is what I saw.

610
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:21,700
What?

611
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:24,801
What did you see?

612
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:38,502
Mel!

613
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:48,001
Give me a B.V.F.
And an airway! Now!

614
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:05,302
The fifth sign.

615
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:09,501
Death of loved one.

616
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:26,901
No!

617
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:30,102
No, I'm not ready.

618
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:32,201
You are ready.

619
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:34,102
But not for the light.

620
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:36,100
For what's inside you.

621
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:41,001
The darkness that's always
been there, waiting.

622
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:07,901
It's time for you to know who you are.

623
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:12,502
And to know who your brother is.

624
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,801
No!

625
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,703
Hey, can you hear me?

626
00:40:56,406 --> 00:41:00,502
It wasn't about me protecting them.

627
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,401
It was about them protecting me.

628
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,301
What happened?

629
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:14,700
I think I have a brother.

630
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,003
What?

631
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:19,301
I think I have a brother.

632
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:24,000
All right, Mel,
what are you talking about?

633
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:29,602
He said I have a brother.

634
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:34,203
Who said this?
Who told you you have a brother?

635
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,801
My father.
