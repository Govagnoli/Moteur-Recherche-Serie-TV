1
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,230
Did I tell you what's going on with ned?

2
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,040
He brings this girl home,and I barely have time to approve of her or not,

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,820
and then he says,you know what,mom,she's not the girl for me.

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,050
And I'm like,ned,I thought I liked that girl.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,010
What?

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,230
Oh,my god.

7
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,750
Rick: Graffiti here in grandview?

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,830
Are you sure there was graffiti?

9
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,500
I mean,was the handwriting nice,at least?

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,570
Ok,this isn't funny,

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,470
and we're not just talking about some random tagger.

12
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,490
It was meant for me.

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,400
Well,I wouldn't worry about it.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,970
It's probably some stupid prank,some kids.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,730
Why would they write that?

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,930
All right,have you been on and shame the devil lately?

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,520
-What?
-Justin yates' obnoxious blog?

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,230
No.

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,890
Well,there's been some chatter lately,a bunch of posts,about you.

20
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,280
A person of interest in grandview who claims to have more than a passing acquaintance with the dead.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,030
I've heard about a store in town where really weird stuff happens.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,420
I can't believe this.

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,930
It's like he's trying to out me.

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,160
How long has this been happening?

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,180
I don't know,a week.

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,660
But don't even pay attention to it.

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,940
You should see what they write about me.

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,840
He knows things,thanks to your careful

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,650
and thorough notes that you let him steal,

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,720
he knows everything about me.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,740
Do you have any idea what my life is going to be like if this gets out?

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,820
I didn't let him steal my notes.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,580
He stole my notes 'cause he's clever,he's cunning.

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,210
He lives on campus,right?

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,050
Take me to him.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,170
You put this out there,justin.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,910
I thought you were going to keep my secret.

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,350
Why are you trying to hurt me?

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,450
People come to my blog for the truth.

41
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,980
Oh,yeah,'cause you're all about the truth.

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,040
Look,this is a bad time,ok?

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,420
Hey,justin,this might be a good time to tell you

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,020
about a fascinating new invention called the hanger.

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,260
Besides,according to the professor's notes,

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,910
you've helped a lot of people.

47
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,480
You've affected a lot of people.

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,290
I mean,how long do you expect to keep this a secret?

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,260
Exactly,justin,I have helped a lot of people.

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,520
And if this gets out,my life is going to be turned upside down.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,030
Rick: Interesting choice of words.

52
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,780
Hey,give that to me.

53
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,170
Look,I came to you a long time ago with a lot of questions,

54
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,500
and you gave me nothing,and now you want my help?

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,570
I don't want anything from you.

56
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,120
I just want to be left alone.

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,160
That may not be possible.

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,900
It could be anybody.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
I mean,that's what's so scary.

63
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,060
Someone who saw me doing something,

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,760
or someone who talked to one of the families that I've helped.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,380
This is what I always dreaded--

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,390
some nutjob out there decides you're a witch.

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,650
Can't the justin fellow trace this on his blog?

68
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,590
Well,he's not being very cooperative.

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,230
I'll make him be cooperative.

70
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,610
Look,this may not even have anything to do with justin or his blog.

71
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,690
I mean,last time I talked to him,

72
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,180
he said that he would keep my secret.

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,500
And you believe him?

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
Yes.

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,270
Because he wants something in return.

76
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,210
Uh,what would that be?

77
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,660
I don't know,he hasn't told me yet.

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,880
All right,so meanwhile,you're in the bulls-eye of some potential lunatic,

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,720
could be someone you see everyday,a customer,a dealer.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,490
Or payne could be...

81
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,750
right and it could just be a school kid prank.

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,700
Look,I know you don't need to hear this,

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,800
but maybe we need to talk to the police.

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,040
Look,this could just be a one-time thing.

85
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Ok?

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,890
Let's not panic.It'll probably never even happen again.

87
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,720
How many people do you think saw that before we got here?

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,970
We should just paint something new on the window every night,

89
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,150
like,sacks fifth avenue.

90
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,560
This is really scaring me.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,850
I mean,what if whoever or whatever is doing this,

92
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,580
decides to take things to a whole new level?

93
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,950
Melinda,you should call the police.You know that.

94
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,870
I don't even think the police can protect me.

95
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,780
With everything that I've learned about grandview's history,

96
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,520
for people who do what I do,it never ends well.

97
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,350
I really have to figure out who's doing this.

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,920
I have an idea.

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,070
I need to go home for 2 seconds.

100
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,270
I'll be right back.

101
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,110
We will leave this on tonight,

102
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,750
and this should give us a perfect view of whoever's doing this.

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,950
Or the world's most boring documentary of main street.

104
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,980
Yeah,let's hope so.

105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,280
All right,let's just leave it there,forget all about it,

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,140
and have a great day.

107
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,060
Right.Time to make money,have fun.

108
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,910
I'll open up.

109
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,190
Yo.

110
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,620
Yo.

111
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,860
Dude,I live downstairs.

112
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,530
What's the deal with the noise every night?

113
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,430
What noise?

114
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,080
Well,it kinda sounds like you're bowling with your furniture.

115
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,890
Yeah,well,it wasn't me tonight,dude.

116
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,880
I was just sleepin'.

117
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,830
Oh,yeah?With who?

118
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,460
Thor,roman god of thunder?

119
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,500
You mean jupiter.

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,090
Thor's the norse god of thunder.

121
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,870
Oh,is that right,joseph campbell?

122
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,150
Whatever.

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,380
What would it take to get some silence up in here,man?

124
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,210
You could stop talking and leave.

125
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,080
Dude,your hamster habitat is like so upside down right now.

126
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,250
It's a gerbil,and he likes it that way.

127
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,980
Are we done?

128
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,220
I don't believe it.

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,720
Ok...

130
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,930
here,give me the cord.

131
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,090
All right.

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,700
Keep going.

133
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,050
Whoa,whoa,wait.

134
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,260
Melinda: Why would you do this to me?

135
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,460
I didn't do anything.

136
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,160
What kind of person are you?

137
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,530
I was here sleeping all night.

138
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,380
Justin,we have it on tape.

139
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,710
You don't know for sure that was me.

140
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,870
Do you want to see the tape again,

141
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,540
or should I just see if the police agree with me?

142
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,680
Why don't you just cut the B.S.

143
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
And tell us what's going on?

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,060
Yeah,and why the hell everything in this room is upside down.

145
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,000
Ok.

146
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
Um,here.

147
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,080
Check this out.

148
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,450
You tell me what's going on.

149
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,670
Are you saying you don't have any memory of this?

150
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,390
None.

151
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,060
As far as I know,I was asleep.

152
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,000
Why did you paint witchcraft on my window?

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,690
And what does the awdring of the woman with the wings mean?

154
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,020
I think it means I'm haunted.

155
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
Justin,I don't see ghosts anywhere.

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,630
Just you,defacing my property.

157
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,780
And I want it to stop.

158
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,850
Yeah,well,me too.

159
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,470
Ok,I got a lot to do,so you guys should just go.

160
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,540
You know what,that's the wrong answer.

161
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,200
Look,just leave me alone!

162
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,490
I think what you're talking about is somnambulism.

163
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,010
It's a lot more common than you might think.

164
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,850
It happens mostly in children,but it does happen in adults.

165
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,260
For example,my college girlfriend,

166
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,700
I think she was asleep for our entire relationship.

167
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,330
What causes it?

168
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,790
Uh,I don't think she saw my spark.

169
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,840
I'm talking about sleep-walking.

170
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,460
Well,you'd have to ask a doctor to get that answer,

171
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,610
but it could be a lot of things.

172
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,280
Could be anxiety,it could be a reaction to drugs or alcohol.

173
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,570
It could be a way to avoid people you see in the street and don't want to talk to.

174
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh,I'll remember that the next time you come into the store.

175
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,030
That's harsh.

176
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,320
Look,I just--I don't know whether I'm supposed to be afraid of him or help him.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,490
Well,we don't really know this guy,

178
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,270
so I'll talk to some other professors he has

179
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,510
and I'll ask some kids,to see what they know about him.

180
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,550
I'll keep an eye on him,too.

181
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,620
I just want to know what his secret is,you know,

182
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,380
before anything else happens.

183
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,610
Man: Justin yates?

184
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,530
I'm actually in two of his classes.

185
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,900
But he doesn't talk to me,or anybody else.

186
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,070
The dude is like an island,like onto himself.

187
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,760
Ok,moving past the awkward similes,

188
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,350
maybe he just hangs out with a different crowd.

189
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,130
Maybe he just doesn't like you.

190
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,420
Everyone likes me,professor payne.

191
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,440
It's like a curse,I swear.

192
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,390
But this dude justin,he just doesn't like people.

193
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,950
He's like a disanthrope.

194
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,060
Misanthrope.

195
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,520
You were close,though.

196
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,200
Well,I'm glad you're getting your money's worth on education here,josh.

197
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,360
Is there anything you can tell me at all about justin yates?

198
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,700
I don't know what he's doing up there in his room at night,

199
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,380
but it's real noisy.

200
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,460
It's got something to do with his gerbil.

201
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,480
I think we're done here.

202
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
Jim: He looks like a zombie.

203
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,440
Exactly.

204
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,800
And he was in that same weird trance when he turned his room upside down.

205
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,830
Now payne thinks that he's sleep-walking.

206
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,970
I just keep thinking that it's another possession or ghost-related thing.

207
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,410
But you haven't seen a ghost?

208
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,920
Well,no.

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,910
But he also said it could be a reaction to medication or alcohol.

210
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,760
Well,if that were true,

211
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,350
I would have slept-walked through my entire senior year in college?

212
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,350
Is that a guy thing?

213
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,130
This making jokes about college and sleep-walking?

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,270
Oh,what was the name of the drug you thought you saw?

215
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,590
I think there's something else going on here.

216
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,180
I didn't really get to see the label,but,uh...

217
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,080
-car--carba--
-yeah,carbamazepine.

218
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,720
Look,this is a drug to control convulsions,all right?

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
Payne could be half-right.

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,150
I mean,somnambulism in adults is usually a symptom of mental illness

221
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,310
or seizures of some sort.

222
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,400
So you think there might be something really wrong with him?

223
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,510
I just think,you know,it might not be spiritual.

224
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,110
It could be very physical.

225
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,360
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,170
Looking for you.

227
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,410
How did you find me?

228
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,350
Doesn't matter.

229
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,560
Look,I know this is hard,

230
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,550
but I need you to believe that I want to help you.

231
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,100
Why should you,huh?

232
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,740
I haven't helped you very much.

233
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm not keeping score.

234
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,990
It's just what I do.

235
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,890
I don't need help.

236
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,700
Not yet.

237
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,690
You're sick,aren't you?

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,600
Look,I didn't press any charges,ok,I kept your secret.

239
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,650
I at least deserve the truth.

240
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,630
It's not that I'm sick.

241
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,650
It's just that I'm going to die.

242
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,120
Allyweird smell,like there was something burning.

243
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,490
Day and night,it never went away,so I finally went to a doctor.

244
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,310
How long ago was that?

245
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,590
2 years ago.

246
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,790
I was in ohio before I left to come here.

247
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,300
Wasn't there anything they could do?

248
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah,you'd think,but this particular aneurysm was in a place so deep in my brain

249
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,490
that they couldn't get to it.

250
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,720
They knew it was going to burst,they knew it was going to kill me.

251
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,980
They just...

252
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,540
didn't know when.

253
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,130
It isn't always fatal,is it?

254
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,170
No.

255
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,620
But it's all about location,location,location.

256
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,440
And the size,of course.

257
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,790
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,360
Is that why you cut yourself off from everyone?

259
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,830
Yeah.Pretty much.

260
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,410
But I don't have a big family.

261
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,100
It's just my brother and sister back in ohio.

262
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,200
I don't understand.

263
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,420
Wouldn't you want to be close to them now?

264
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,080
-Wouldn't you want--
-they don't know.

265
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,780
It's better this way.

266
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,850
I made a clean break.

267
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,300
They don't have to feel sorry for me or worry about me,

268
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,350
and I don't have to see all that pity in their eyes.

269
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,990
Doesn't sound fair.

270
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,830
So what's the deal,justin,with you turning everything in your room upside down?

271
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,740
I think I know why,but I can't tell you yet.

272
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,440
Look,it seems to me like you have this,I don't know,

273
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,710
a pipeline,I guess,into death and wherever it is we go after it.

274
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,330
I probably don't know as much as you think I do.

275
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,840
Just tell me.

276
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,740
Do you really talk to the dead?

277
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,530
Do you really help them?

278
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,700
Yeah.

279
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,100
Yeah,I do.

280
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,640
That's why I'm here.

281
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,410
I don't know how,but I was meant to meet you.

282
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,980
Justin,look,I...

283
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,740
I help the dead with their unfinished business.

284
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,470
I help them and their loved ones find closure.

285
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,910
Why wait?

286
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,200
You're alive.

287
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Right now.

288
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,730
Why wouldn't you reach out to the people who love you

289
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,360
so that they can spend time with you while they still can?

290
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,270
I don't need your help with the living.

291
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,420
I need your help with the dead.

292
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,070
What?

293
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,980
After I'm gone...

294
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,280
I need you to help me find someone.

295
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,700
Someone who's dead.

296
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,960
Someone who...

297
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,050
may be waiting for me.

298
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,610
Melinda: He seems at peace with it.

299
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,180
Ah,it's a mask.

300
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,290
Deep down,he's probably scared to death.

301
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,070
Maybe.

302
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,310
But I really think he has a plan.

303
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,950
He's thought a lot about it.

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,500
What are you doing?

305
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,390
I'm just trying to scan on this drawing of justin's,

306
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,160
do a search and see if anything comes up.

307
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,390
Yeah,what's that like to know that he could just die at any minute,just like that?

308
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,510
I can't imagine.

309
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,940
Well,if you think about it,that's pretty much what we all face.

310
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,310
Ok,true,but you know,we do a pretty good job of pretending it's a long way off,

311
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,750
and,well,the odds are on our side.

312
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,610
But for justin...

313
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,800
yeah,he's got inside information,and he knows the odds are totally the other way for him.

314
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,870
That's gotta be hard.

315
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,500
I mean,would you want to know?

316
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,380
If you were gonna die in a month-- Or a week-- Or a year-- Would you?

317
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah.

318
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,260
Yeah,I think so.

319
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,450
Say my good-byes,get everything straightened out,prepare.

320
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,230
How about you?

321
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,370
No,I'd want to wake up that morning thinking everything was great.

322
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,450
Have no idea,and then boom,all of a sudden,lights out.

323
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,640
No fears,no regrets,no sadness.

324
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,890
Just happily oblivious until the end.

325
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,420
Ah,happily oblivious,another guy thing.

326
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,390
Don't knock it.

327
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,200
Awareness is highly overrated.

328
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,740
Wait,this is it.

329
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,870
That's what justin drew on my window.

330
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,320
It's the figurehead for a boat.

331
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,480
Who's boat?

332
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,760
witchcraft+boat

333
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,270
Woman: I'm waiting for you.

334
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,660
Justin.

335
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,190
Julie?

336
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,220
I can't believe it's you.

337
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,660
Find me.

338
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,720
Yeah?

339
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,380
I'll be waiting.

340
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,320
Justin...

341
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,250
melinda.

342
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,340
It's perfect.I saw her.

343
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,210
Who?

344
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,140
My girlfriend.

345
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,740
I mean,she was my girlfriend.

346
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,370
She's dead,and I saw her.

347
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,360
Where?

348
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,940
Here,in this room,and in the mirror.

349
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,390
I mean,I think it's my brain.

350
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,080
This aneurysm,it's letting me see things.

351
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,030
Ok,justin,calm down.

352
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,400
was your girlfriend's name julie?

353
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,880
How did you know that?

354
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,830
I know what witchcraft means.

355
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,590
I know what the picture you drew means.

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,320
How?

357
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,120
You can't hide anything on the 'net.

358
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,530
You,of all people,should know that.

359
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,400
Tell me what happened.

360
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,440
It was 3 years ago.

361
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
3 years,2 months and a week.

362
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,400
I was datin' this girl julie.

363
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,900
She was like...

364
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,550
nobody I ever knew.

365
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,780
Her family had money,so she could pretty much do whatever she wanted.

366
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,960
They gave her a freakin' vintage boat for christmas,

367
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,050
and I'm not talking about the kind in a bottle.

368
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,760
She was wild,totally fearless.

369
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,890
She hung out with this really cool crowd,

370
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,960
but for some reason,she liked me.

371
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,710
She said it was because I was smart.

372
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,980
Who knows?

373
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,160
But I loved being around her.

374
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,240
It was like you never knew what was going to happen next.

375
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,720
Want some?

376
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,370
No.

377
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,540
When it became night, she went below to get a sweater,

378
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,730
and she told me to start the engine so we can get home fast.

379
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,160
I don't know what happened,

380
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,360
but when I went down below to find julie,

381
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,540
the whole boat just flipped...

382
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,380
The keel must have ripped off in the blast, everything was upside down.

383
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,390
I didn't know what to do.

384
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,760
I didn't even know how much longer I could hold my breath.

385
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,870
Why didn't you ever tell me any of this?

386
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,930
I never told anyone.

387
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,630
I told everyone that I didn't remember anything.

388
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,990
So that's why you've been turning everything upside down?

389
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,590
It's like you're acting out your guilt.

390
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,120
Someone else has been acting it out for me.

391
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,670
You may not have had another choice, justin.

392
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,330
Both of you could have died.

393
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,800
That would have been better.

394
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,520
Better than having to live with this for the last 3 years;

395
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,690
having to see her eyes every night...

396
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,380
knowing that she watched me swim away from her.

397
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,480
Dying there would have made things a lot easier.

398
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,650
-But you weren't meant to.
-Right.

399
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,170
No, I was meant to hang out and get an aneurysm a couple years later.

400
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,090
Do you think that's your punishment?

401
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,380
I think I was meant to die on that boat.

402
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,160
I was meant to be with julie.

403
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,530
This?It's just a correction.

404
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,410
Better late than never.

405
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,560
-Justin...
-no, really, it's ok.

406
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm totally cool with this.

407
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,720
Besides...I think whatever's waiting for me after I die,

408
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,760
it's going to be a lot more interesting than what I'm leaving behind.

409
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,680
Right, little buddy?

410
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,810
Justin, it's gonna be all right.

411
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,150
-Am I...?
-Yes.You're dead.

412
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,870
I totally feel normal, totally alive.

413
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,060
Sometimes people don't know what's happening to them at first.

414
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,640
You died in your sleep last night, and that's why you were able to see julie.

415
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah.She told me to find her.

416
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,560
-Where?
-I think I know where.

417
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,980
Justin, you have to go into the light.Ok?

418
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,950
I promise that I will find julie, and I will cross her over.

419
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,590
No.She's waiting for me.

420
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,180
-I have to go.
-Now, justin, wait!

421
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
Come on.

422
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,490
Hey, are you ok?

423
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,640
Comparatively speaking.

424
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,270
How are you?

425
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,630
I'd feel better if I knew where his spirit was.

426
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,130
-You, uh, talked to him after he...?
-Yeah.

427
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,700
He seemed relieved in a way.

428
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,640
I guess it was easier on him then he thought it was going to be.

429
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,930
But he dn'idt want to cross over?

430
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,850
He saw the ghost of his girlfriend, and she told him to come and get her.

431
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,030
That's romantic in a dawn of the dead kind of way.

432
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,950
Yeah, he blames himself for her death.

433
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,670
And I wouldn't be surprised if she blames him, too.

434
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,200
Well, the school notified his next of kin.

435
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,100
It's his brother and sister, they're flying out tonight.

436
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,790
You can find out what they know.

437
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,080
Maybe they know something they don't even know they know.

438
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,930
Easy for you to say.

439
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,240
What are you going to do with the rodent?

440
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,960
I think you two need each other.

441
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,880
Promise I'll be back in an hour.

442
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,400
Will they even talk to you?

443
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,700
Well, since I'm the one who found their brother's body, I guess so.

444
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,890
You know, we could just close up for an hour.

445
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,810
I could go with you.

446
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,220
No, it looks like everybody actually wants to shop today.

447
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,470
I'll be back soon.

448
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,360
Excuse me, how much are these?

449
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,820
Uh, the big ones are 30, the small ones are 20.

450
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,220
They're beautiful.Are they local?

451
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,380
From a mansion in piermont.

452
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,360
There was like 40 or 50 doors.

453
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,060
I have him now.

454
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,910
You have to stay out of it.

455
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,010
I'm sorry?

456
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,670
It was his own free will.

457
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,550
There's nothing you can do.

458
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,170
Stay away, or I'll have someone burn your house down.

459
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,010
Well, that's a lot of doors.

460
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,810
Be great for a french farce.

461
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,270
-You ok?
-Yeah.

462
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,640
-Are you?
-Me?

463
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,220
Sure.Fine.

464
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,350
I'm gonna take two of the big ones.

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,690
Andy, look.

466
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,850
-Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back.
-No, no, no.

467
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,060
-Did you know justin?
-Well, not very well.

468
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,610
But yes.I'm melinda gordon.

469
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,230
You must be his brother and sister.

470
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,630
You're the one that found him.

471
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,120
Yes.I'm so sorry.

472
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,350
The coroner is telling us it was sudden,

473
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,480
but they really don't know yet what happened to justin.

474
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Do you know something?

475
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,630
Do you know why our brother died?

476
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I know this is really hard to understand.

477
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,050
I'm not sure that I totally do.

478
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,400
But it was really important to him not to be pitied.

479
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,110
He didn't want the two of you to have to grieve.

480
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,430
He knew that he was going to die,

481
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,210
and there was nothing you could do to change that.

482
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,660
It's just not fair.

483
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,430
Didn't he know that we loved him?

484
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,950
He's the only family we have.

485
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,470
If it helps, he seemed really at peace with it.

486
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,220
For him, it was like a journey that he had to take,

487
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,120
that he--he wanted to take.

488
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,290
He just felt like he had to do it alone.

489
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,110
Yeah, that sounds like justin.

490
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,270
Do you know about the boat thing?

491
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,880
Said he didn't remember what happened on that boat,

492
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,720
but he was never the same after that.

493
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,660
It was like he just withdrew, like he felt he didn't belong here anymore.

494
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,210
What was he like before?

495
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,320
Just...like a curious little boy, with the best heart.

496
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,490
Our parents died when we were pretty young.

497
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,030
Justin was only 10.

498
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,290
He used to save his money, whatever he could get from errands, dog walking,

499
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,800
and he'd buy things for our mom and dad.

500
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,670
But they were dead?

501
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,060
And he would get newspapers that my dad used to read,

502
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,830
and books that my mom would like,

503
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,190
and he'd go there and read to them, sit with them for hours.

504
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,030
Bring my dad's favorite snacks, said he didn't want them to be lonely.

505
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,200
He gave up time with his friends.

506
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,780
He felt like he couldn't abandon mom and dad.

507
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,310
People started calling him the gravesitter.

508
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,800
That'S...that's amazing.

509
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,830
It was like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.

510
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,050
He just...felt things very deeply.

511
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,110
Was he happy?When he was with julie?

512
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,480
-He was, I guess.But we weren'T.
-Why not?

513
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,820
She just wasn't anything like justin.

514
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
She was a spoiled rich kid.

515
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:30,320
Hung with a really fast crowd, other rich kids.Bad kids.

516
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,840
That detective thought the whole boat thing was suspicious.

517
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,380
What detective?

518
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,570
Julie?

519
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,430
You came.I knew you would.

520
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,840
Julie, I'm so sorry.

521
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,180
You must hate me for what I did.

522
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,540
It's all right.

523
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,070
It's what got me here.

524
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,680
What is this place?

525
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,110
Our new home.

526
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,070
This is where we belong.

527
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,000
Why?Why are you here?

528
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,590
I followed you.

529
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,640
I was mad at you for leaving me like that.

530
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,090
I've been watching you all this time, waiting for you to come to me.

531
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,610
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

532
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,150
I met someone here.Someone like us.

533
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,740
Dead?

534
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,720
Someone with secrets.

535
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,450
Someone who's bad like us.

536
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,010
He showed me things.

537
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,600
Wait, am I-- am I bad?

538
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,950
You know you are.

539
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,940
You left me there to die.

540
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:53,600
It's ok.It's allowed here.

541
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,850
What about the light?

542
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,170
-Melinda said I should--
-there's a secret down here.

543
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,530
Nobody knows it, not even melinda.

544
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,290
What secret?

545
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,980
You can live again.

546
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,810
You can be in the world whenever you want,

547
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,920
and you can touch and feel and taste and laugh and cry.

548
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,890
We'll teach you how.

549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,560
I'm just a friend of the family,

550
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,960
but I heard ythat ou think julie anderson rt bemighesponsible for sinking the boat?

551
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,290
I don't think it, I know it.

552
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,680
Well, what makes you so sure?

553
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,550
Julie anderson was heavy into drugs.

554
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,390
She owed money, lots of it.

555
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,380
So what do you think happened?

556
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,950
Well, the boat was in her name.

557
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,750
About a month before the sinking, she took insurance out on the boat.

558
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,300
Covered everything, all kinds of liability.

559
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,920
So you're saying that she sank the boat on purpose?

560
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,900
I'm saying that she planned to sink the boat,

561
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,110
she planned to blame it on justin.

562
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,330
Have you ever talked to justin about all this?

563
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,330
No.He didn't have any memory of anything,

564
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,000
and I didn't have any real proof.

565
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,790
Family got to the D.A.

566
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
They got the whole thing buried.

567
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,670
-Are you sure about all this?
-Oh, yeah.

568
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,320
By the time julie anderson was 20,

569
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,980
she had a long and colorful history with this department.

570
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,700
I can't thank you enough.

571
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,850
There is absolutely no entertainment value whatsoever in owning a gerbil.

572
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,220
He won't eat a hot dog, he turned his nose up at a potato chip earlier.

573
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,250
-Hello?
-This guy won't show me any affection!

574
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,360
He doesn't snuggle with me.

575
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,120
I need an animal that will cuddle!

576
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,820
Can you focus, please?

577
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,300
Ok, justin fell for a bad woman.

578
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,780
He's not the first guy that's happened to.

579
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,990
She's been haunting him.

580
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,470
I think she even jumped into somebody else's body.

581
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,940
-A possession?
-Yeah.

582
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,360
But I think it's just a temporary thing.

583
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,070
Remember, it happened to you?

584
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,960
I think I'll be remembering the time the ghost got into my body,

585
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,850
made me vomit blood, long after I've forgotten my name, my address,

586
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,120
and what a car key is for, yeah.

587
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,480
I think she's found something here besides justin,

588
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,000
and she's using the possession as a way to get me a message.

589
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,080
What's the message?

590
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,620
Basically, to step off.

591
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,350
She said he's hers, that he came here on his own, no one forced him.

592
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,820
Came on his own?Came where?

593
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,360
Where all the damaged souls in grandview go.

594
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,540
No, no, no, no.No, I'm not going there.

595
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,050
I still have hair on the back of my neck

596
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,530
that's still standing up from the last time.

597
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,290
-No.
-Ok...if you're too scared.

598
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,110
She plays me like a piano!Wait.

599
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,580
I'm surprised you haven't bricked up that hole yet.

600
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,670
I thought I might have to go back in there.

601
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,000
Have you ever thought about having a revolving door installed, maybe a turnstile?

602
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,180
-What was that?
-Nothing.

603
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,170
-Are we there yet?
-No, let's go.

604
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,110
Melinda.

605
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,290
-He's here.
-What?

606
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,390
You really shouldn't be here.

607
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,350
Neither should you.

608
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,200
-No, I belong here.
-No, you don'T.

609
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,700
-They're just trying to make you think--
-it's really all right.

610
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,380
There's so much I can do.

611
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,920
They're gonna teach me things here.

612
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,100
What things?

613
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,600
You don't have to tell her anything.She's not welcome.

614
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,690
-Julie's here.
-Oh, that's good.

615
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Send her my regards.

616
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,580
Justin, julie made that boat sink on purpose.

617
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,660
She was going to blame you and then collect on the insurance.

618
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,890
-I think she was trying to kill you.
-Big deal.

619
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,170
You left me there to die.You killed me.

620
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,590
You were just being human.

621
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,370
Ok, you were really scared, and being scared doesn't make you bad.

622
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,330
You're never going to know if your choice would have changed anything.

623
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,350
We need you here.

624
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,310
And you know why we need you here.

625
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,920
You have nobody.

626
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,160
Nobody cares about you.

627
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,270
We're your only family now.

628
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,770
That's not true.Ok, your brother and sister, they care.

629
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,390
-You spoke to them?
-They're here.

630
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,170
-They came as soon as they heard.
-She's lying.

631
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,900
Come on.Justin, they told me about the grave.

632
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,750
They told me how heartbroken you were when your parents died.

633
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,990
They told me that you went to see them every single day;

634
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,860
that you read to them, that you brought them gifts.

635
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,100
They told me how much you had to give up just to be with them!

636
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,260
Those aren't the actions of somebody who belongs here.

637
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,780
You have so much love in your heart.

638
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,070
They don't need what you have here.

639
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,770
They don't want what you have.

640
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,610
You have to go into the light.

641
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,450
Melinda, I have no idea what's going on.Should I be scared?

642
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,280
Were you really going to kill me?

643
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,210
It crossed my mind.

644
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,790
Did you like me at all?

645
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,280
I tolerated you-- barely.

646
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,190
And my friends and i laughed about you.

647
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,420
I just wanted money, justin, and I knew you would follow me anywhere.

648
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,440
She's trying to make you angry.

649
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,130
She wants you to hate her because that's how ghosts like her get stronger.

650
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,620
Please don't let her do it.

651
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,150
It's ok.Really.

652
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,470
I still loved it.Being with you.

653
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,060
The way you made me feel like I had something to offer.

654
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,650
I just never got a chance to offer to someone better than you.

655
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,590
So thanks for that.

656
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,560
And for the rest of it.

657
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,800
I forgive you.

658
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,820
And I forgive myself for leaving you there.

659
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm so proud of you.

660
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,940
There's just one more thing you're gonna have to help me with.

661
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,420
You know, it would be really cruel if you were lying about this.

662
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,650
I'm not.I promise.

663
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,850
Justin's here with us.

664
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,870
I told him that you were in grandview and you wanted to say good-bye.

665
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,450
And that I'm sorry.

666
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,420
He also wanted to say that he was sorry.

667
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,110
Justin, if you're there...

668
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,130
or here, sorry isn't good enough.

669
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,500
How could you cut us off like that?We're your family!

670
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,530
Did we do something to make you feel we didn't love you?

671
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,820
We would have helped you, we would have been there for you.

672
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,840
If I could do it over...

673
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,930
I could do it again.

674
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,820
If he could do it over again, he would.

675
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,040
Oh, that's gotta be it.

676
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,910
He sees the light.

677
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,220
He's ready to cross over.

678
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,530
What does that mean?

679
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,090
We'll never talk to him again?

680
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,910
Tell them I felt them with me, no matter how scared I got.

681
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,240
And tell them that somehow,

682
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,970
I knew I wouldn't be alive that long, and it's ok.

683
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,970
It's ok.It's ok.

684
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,410
-I'll tell them.
-Tell us what?

685
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,370
You've given me a lot of hope.

686
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,870
You do that for a lot of people.

687
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,850
Don't stop, ok?No matter what.

688
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,390
And tell professor payne that I'm sorry for stealing his files.

689
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,570
And for posting all those disses on the blog.

690
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,580
Oh, and tell him that the gerbil, he only eats organic food.

691
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,090
I don't think he knows that.

692
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm gonna come back.

693
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,690
Some day I'm going to come back,

694
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,990
and I'm gonna tell you what's on the other side.

695
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,960
I'll be waiting.

696
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,100
Thank you...for keeping my secret.

697
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,180
I always wanted to touch your face again.

698
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,950
-Who?
