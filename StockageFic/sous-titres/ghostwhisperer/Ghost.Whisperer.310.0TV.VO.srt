Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,600
*Let your heart be light

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
santa!

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,100
*From now on  our troubles will be out of sight

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,800
*Have yourself a merry little Christmas

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,900
*Make the Yule-tide gay

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
- happy holidays.
- thank you.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
this is nuts.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,500
yeah. i don't know whether to laugh or cry.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,700
and if things continue this way, 
i'm going to have to bring in chairs

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,100
and have christmas eve dinner here.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
i told you,  you were taking on too much.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,500
- speaking of which--
- no.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,100
i'm sorry. i have to go in 5 minutes.
i haven't gotten anything for ned yet.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,500
well, at least i'm no longer confused
on whether i should laugh or cry.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,800
i promise i will come back if i can.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it's fine. i'll close up.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,000
and my christmas list
will magically take care of itself.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,600
got to hurry up and pick something out, ok?
got a lot to do.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,700
do you think mommy will like this one?

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,500
- how much is it?
- $25.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,300
yeah. she'll love it.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,700
oh, hey. is this for your mom?

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,600
yeah. but don't wrap it.
she likes it when i wrap it myself.

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,600
i'm a really good wrapper.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,500
i bet you are.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,400
- so, did you get your letter to santa yet?
- yeah.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,000
- i'm sure he'll read it as soon as he gets it.
- i hope so.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,000
- dad!
- what happened?

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,400
dad! are you ok?

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,900
yeah,  i'm all right, buddy,  just a little burned.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,800
- why do these things keep happening?
- i don't know.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,700
that's weird. it's freezing cold.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,500
it's all right, buddy.
maybe santa will bring me another one.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
you know what? um,  you really should
have a doctor take a look at that, 

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,100
so i'll just get these delivered.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
i'll wrap them up and get them to you tomorrow.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
that'd be great. thank you.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,300
yeah. i just need your signature right here, 
and then i will take care of it for you.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
what was that about?
that kid looked totally freaked out.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
yeah, for a good reason.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
do you want me to add these
to ned's delivery list tomorrow?

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,300
no. i think this needs my special touch.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,000
*And have yourself A merry little Christmas now

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,800
come in from the cold.

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
i'm from same as it never was.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,100
oh, for a second there, 
i thought santa had gotten young and beautiful.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,600
oh, tired and frazzled is more like it.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,100
i'm william's mother claire.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,900
it's reay nice to meet you.
where should i put these?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
right there. just put them on the table, i guess.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,200
most of them are for my staff.

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,400
i just have to bring them in tomorrow.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,500
- how's that doing?
- frost burn, apparently.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,400
doctors had trouble believing that
it was from a p.d.a.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,300
i'm right back on that horse.

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
yeah? this is william.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,300
right, well, we should have included
that in chambers, though.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
yeah. i understand.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,600
busy time of year.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,800
yes, all of a sudden.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
you look cold. would you like some tea?

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,300
i would love some.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,000
hey, um...

66
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,800
is this your grandpa?

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
yeah, grandpa howard. my father's step dad.

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
he looks nice.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,600
so does the tree. you're doing a great job.

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,600
thanks. you can help if you want.

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,600
my dad's getting distracted.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,900
sure.

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,300
doesn't your mom want to help?

74
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
she doesn't live here anymore.

75
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
oh, i'm so sorry.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
it's ok.

77
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,400
they still love me,  and it's not my fault.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,200
it's just better that they live apart right now.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,700
my parents were separated, too, 
so i know how hard that can be.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
they're gonna get back together by christm, though.

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
my mom gonna move back in, 

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,700
or we might just buy
a new house somewhere like floda

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
and start over, 
because everybody's happy in florida.

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,700
sounds nice.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,000
um, do you remember at the store when you said
some weird thin were happening to your dad?

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
- yeah.
- what kind of weird things?

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,300
i don't know. things like...

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
dad! dad, dad, look!

89
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,300
look, the one has a face in it!

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,500
yeah, yeah,  it won't matter.

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
no, if it goes to arbitration,  we'll have--

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,300
- oh, can i see?
- yeah!

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,800
see, there's a face in it that
wasn't there last year. it moves, too.

94
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
yeah, fine. yeah, ok,  i gotta go.

95
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,400
all right, look,  let's stop messing around here
and get this done. come on.

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
here we go.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
it's herbal. i hope you don't mind.

98
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
i have some lovely--

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,900
dad! grandma, help.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
william, are you all right?

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,900
- are you ok?
- yeah, really,  i'm fine.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
i'll get something.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,400
are you sure you're ok, dad?

104
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,700
i want him to know what it's like
to lose everything.

108
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,700
hey, the after work rush
is still a couple of hours off.

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,200
i can handle this for now
if you want to get a head start on your shopping.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,300
head start?
head start is shopping in november.

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
ok, i'm talking about
desperation shopping right now.

112
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,500
i have to check out a couple of things first.

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
wait a second,  you are not still
having christmas eve dinner at your house?

114
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,200
yes, i am. don't ask me how.

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,500
i'm hoping that santa claus
will give me rachael ray for christmas, 

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,900
and then maybe she can handle it.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,100
look, i know this may not be
politically correct in your world, 

118
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
but can't this situation wait
until after the holidays?

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
by situation, you mean haunting, correct?

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,100
well, you know,  you say tomato, i say--

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,300
no, it can't wait.

122
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,200
there's too much anxiety
and negative energy in this house.

123
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,800
this ghost could get very powerful very fast, 
and he really has it out for william.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
so what is it you're looking for?

125
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
anything i can find on william taylor--

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,200
enemies,  deaths of relatives.

127
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
the only recent death
i've been able to find is his father, 

128
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,700
but i saw a picture of him at their house, 
and it's not him.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,100
- something to do th his work?
- ugh, i hope not.

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,100
his work is in mergers and acquisitions.

131
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
his company does  a lot of takeovers.

132
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
i don't know,  it's very coorate.

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,500
yeah, well,  somebody like that
has a lot of heavy duty enemies.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,500
maybe you should concentrate
on the hostile takeovers, 

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
or the people who lost their jobs in the mergers.

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,700
oh, that's a good idea.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,500
at least it would narrow it down.

138
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
to about a hundred.

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,600
daddy?

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,300
oh, it's--i think someone's in the house.

141
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,600
- well, are you sure?
- yeah. i heard them downstairs.

142
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
ok.

143
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
ok, come here, riley.

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,700
riley, you get on the phone and you call 9-1-1.

145
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
and you do not come out of this room, ok?

146
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,900
dad?

147
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
what is it?

148
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,900
it's nothing. it's just...a toy.

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
everything's fine.

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,700
let's get you back in bed.

151
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,700
how did this get included in my order?

152
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,100
well, it wasn't in your order, 
'cause we don't sell those things.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,000
ooh, does that have a remote?
maybe i should get one of those for ned.

154
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
well, you were the only delivery, 
the only person in the house yesterday.

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
so now what happened?

156
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,500
i-i...i don't know what happened.

157
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,500
i came downstairs,  the box was open, 
and this thing was flyin' around.

158
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,900
have you been having
a lot of weird things happen lately?

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
yeah, i guess so.

160
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,000
has anyone around you died recently?

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,600
my stepfather died 2 years ago.

162
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,200
- how old was he?
- 89.

163
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,600
nope, not him.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
what, are you saying that...

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
wait a minute,  bruce spence

166
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,200
a guy i worked with once, 
and he died in a plane crash.

167
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
- wait...
- excuse me?

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
what does that have to do with anything?

169
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,700
oh, hi. i'm so sorry. we're just really busy.

170
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,100
can you give me a day?
i'll call you tomorrow, ok?

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,500
'cause i really think that i can help you.
i'm sorry.

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,000
hi. all righ here is what i found in the back.

173
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
honey, i didn't even know you were home.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,700
sorry, i just got in.

175
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
before i left, 
we got a huge delivery that i had to inventory.

176
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,600
come on,  come on up to bed.

177
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,200
i will. i just have to nail down
something first--ooh!

178
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
here it is.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,900
bruce spencer was c.e.o. of
the struggling barnes & stowe properties company.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,600
he was bought out by the company
william taylor works for, 

181
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,700
and he died in a plane crash.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,700
all right,  that's tragic,  but relevant how?

183
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,100
well, it says here that spencer had hit on
hard times,  since the sale of his company.

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
he felt cheated. company was overvalued.

185
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,100
he ended up losing his house
and pretty much all of his money.

186
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,300
well, good.

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,600
so he's the who's haunting william taylor.

188
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,800
case closed,  time to come up.

189
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
but he doesn't really look like my ghost.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
melinda, you're running yourself ragged.
you gotta get some rest.

191
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,300
there's nothing here
that can't wait till tomorrow.

192
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,300
- you're right.
- all right.

193
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,700
pack up,  and i'll be up in a second.

194
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,500
- jim?
- ready and waiting.

195
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
are you bruce spencer,  by any chance?

196
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,300
no, i'm not bruce...whoever.

197
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,000
then who?

198
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
come on, who do you think?

199
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,100
no way.

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,100
yep. i'm santa claus.

201
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,300
*** you somethin'.

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
i don't understand why you can see me.
usually only kids can.

203
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,700
- well, because i can see--
- hold on,  wait for the question.

204
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
what i need to know is, 

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,700
are you here to help me, 
or are you just going to get in my way?

206
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,700
let's talk about you first.
why do you think you're santa claus?

207
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,900
- why do you think you're you?
- because i am?

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,500
there you go.

209
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,900
ok, um, maybe you're confused.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,700
do you see a light?

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
do you need to cross over?

212
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,000
heh, no. what i need to do is all around me.

213
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
why are you trying to hurt william?

214
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,600
i'm not hurting william.

215
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
i'm helping riley.

216
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
i got a letter from him.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,300
i've been helping kids for
as long as i can remember.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,300
"dear santa, please, 
i just want my father back for christmas."

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,700
i don't understand.

220
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
and you tell me i'm confused.

221
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,400
that guy william
is totally disconnecting from his kid.

222
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,200
i'm trying to get him to
pay attention before it's too late.

223
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,100
every time he gives his kid the bum's rush, 
i try to give him a little correction.

224
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,500
i need to know,  am i gonna have a problem with you?

225
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,500
yes. you need to leave them alone right now.
they're dealing with enough.

226
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,600
so it's get in my way.

227
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
i thought so.

228
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
you told santa he was confused?

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
i guess i know which list you're going on.

230
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
this guy is convinced he's santa claus.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
good! i'm glad,  i hope he is.

232
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,800
you know why?
i have a bone to pick with santa claus.

233
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,400
1982, i asked for a video game.
you know what i got instead? sensible shoes.

234
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
will you please focus?

235
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,700
i need to figure out who this guy is, 
so i can help him with his delusion.

236
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,500
look, you've dealt with spirits like this before.

237
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
remember, you had that one girl ghost
who thought she was bloody mary.

238
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,800
true, but she had specific reasons
for taking on a persona, 

239
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,600
and specific people that she wanted to haunt.

240
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,300
well, what's the difference
between that and this guy?

241
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
for all we know this guy,  the way that he died

242
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
and something that happened in his life
actually made him think he was santa.

243
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,000
yeah, but what? i mean, 
what is his attachment to william and riley?

244
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,200
i mean, riley writes a letter wanting his dad back, 
but it's his mom who's left the house.

245
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
you're being too literal.
this kid feels the distance.

246
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
he misses his dad,  he's confused.
what he wants back is his family.

247
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
so...

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,300
the santa ghost is gonna try to
electrocute and terrorize william?

249
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,100
it's not very jolly of him, is it?

250
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,400
you've really been no help  all.

251
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,800
all right, look,  i'll look up santa claus ghosts
and christmas items on the computer.

252
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,100
just, what else do you want from me?

253
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,000
are you coming to my dinner christmas eve?

254
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,800
- yeah, no. too busy.
- with what?

255
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
christmas eve stuff. you wouldn't understand.

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,400
you know what? be at the house at 7:00, ok?

257
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,700
or i'll kick your christmas butt.

258
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,000
ah, charlie brown would be proud.

259
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
turn right in 100 ft.

260
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
yeah, the selma people get it friday.

261
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,500
ok, right, right. not what i'm playing.

262
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,900
yeah, i should be almost there.
i have the documents ready.

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
turn left in 50 feet.

264
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,500
except that...

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
- turn left now.
- wait.

266
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
turn rig,  turn left.

267
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,100
something's messed up. my g is--

268
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,300
turn right now.

269
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,000
i'm nowhere near whe we're supposed to be meeting.

270
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
look, i need to call you ck, there's--

271
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
i need to pay attention here.

272
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
turn left in 100 feet.

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,900
turn left in 50 feet.

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,500
***

275
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,100
***
your route guidance is now complete.

276
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
it's just that-- i don't know, 

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
you seem to have a handle on
all these weird things that are happening.

278
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,300
well, maybe they'll put that on my gravestone.

279
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
"melinda gordon,  who had a handle on weird things."

280
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,000
so the car just led you there?

281
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,100
yeah, yeah, i was supposed to be
at a business meeting a half hour ago.

282
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,200
everything went foggy, 
and then my gps led me straight to village java.

283
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,700
where i see my wife with another man.

284
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,900
um, i had a visit... last night
from the ghost that's haunting you.

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
a ght?

286
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,500
you're telling me i'm being haunted by a ghost
and you can see it?

287
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,700
yes.

288
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,500
that might be one weird thing too far.

289
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
look, i know it sounds,  but it's true.

290
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
- is it bruce spencer?
- no.

291
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,600
well, who is it?

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
let's just say that i don't exactly know yet.

293
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,700
but maybe he's trying to get you
and your wife back together.

294
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
by letting me see her with another man?

295
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,600
ok. maybe he's trying to show you
how much you have to lose.

296
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,400
jane's never had a problem showing me
what i have to lose.

297
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,700
meaning?

298
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,900
that's why we split up.

299
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,700
a few months ago,  i found out she'd had an affair.

300
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,100
it was a long time ago,  but when i did the math, 

301
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,300
i realized that it was
9 months before riley was born.

302
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,500
- so is riley--
- i don't know.

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
i guess i don't know what to think.

304
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,900
i raised him,  i've been his dad, but...

305
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
i just don't know.

306
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,100
the whole thing's just one big nightmare.

307
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
i'm sorry.

308
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,000
i know what you see when you look at me.

309
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,700
just some corporate guy who's all about work
and making money.

310
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,000
but i believed in things.

311
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,900
i believed in jane.like i never--

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,600
you were brought to that cafe for a reason.

313
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
go talk to her.

314
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
jane.

315
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,700
what are you doing here?

316
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
i don't know.

317
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,300
i...saw you with that guy.

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
oh, really?

319
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,700
well, where the hell were you this morning?

320
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,700
i called you 3 times.
we had a court hearing, remember?

321
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
i know, i just...

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,800
i couldn't face it.

323
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,800
that guy was my lawyer.

324
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
i'm sorry. we can reschedule it.

325
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,200
the judge ruled r me, will.

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,100
i'm taking the job in philly.

327
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,800
and i'm king riley with me.

328
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,700
look, it's close.
you can still visit on weekends if you want.

329
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,500
but you know you've been
pulling away from riley because--

330
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,900
'cause he may not be mine.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,300
it's excruciating to watch.

332
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,100
all he wants is his dad,  and you treat him
like he's a stranger all of a sudden.

333
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,100
can't you see how that makes him feel?

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,000
look, i'm just trying to get through this.

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
you think i want to feel the way i'm feeling?

336
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
i don't know how to turn it off.

337
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,000
- you just ruined everything.
- i know what i did, will.

338
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
i would change it if i could.

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
but we can't make riley suffer for it.

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
i can't believe you actually
did a test for paternity.

341
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
if you don't like the results, 
what are you gonna do?

342
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,400
i'd rather have riley think his dad's not present
because of the distance in miles.

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
not because of the distance in your heart.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,700
you're not trying to get them back together.
you're trying  to tear them apart.

345
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,000
why would santa do a thing like that?

346
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,100
you should **

347
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,700
's like he was rooting
for william and jane to fight.

348
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,100
doesn't that all have to do with
him showing william what he has to lose?

349
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
i don't think so.
there's something else going on here.

350
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,300
hey, wait a minute, 
didn't you tell me that jane had an affair?

351
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
now what if that guy died, 
and he's haunting them both?

352
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
i thought about that, 
but the age doesn't really match up.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,100
although it could have been a may-december thing, 
so it's worth checking out.

354
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,400
gravy dish.

355
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
honey, 
maybe we should just skip this holiday dinner.

356
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,100
i mean, it's 2 days away.
i have to work a double--

357
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,000
no! we are not canceling.

358
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,200
we are not going to break tradition, ok?
it's about being organized.

359
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
look, table's set,  i'm ahead of the game.

360
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
you know what? christmas is a few days away, 

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,700
and there's been a noticeable lack of
christmas gift hints. what gives?

362
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
i have everything i want right here.

363
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,500
uh-huh. ok. come on,  name one thing. just one.

364
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,000
world peace.

365
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,700
ok, this ghost to cross over, which is
why i have to find out if santa is jane's lover.

366
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,700
yeah.

367
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
- hang the garland.
- right.

368
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,900
i'm sorry about all that drama last night.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,700
tough situation,  i understand.

370
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,400
how's riley doing with all this?

371
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
he's sad, 
wishes he could spend more time with his mother, 

372
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,100
but he still seems like a happy kid.

373
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,500
he told me that his mom's coming back
and you guys are going to move to florida.

374
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,300
yeah, well, sometimes
that kid is just in his own little world.

375
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,800
i know i don't need to tell you this, 
but kids are really sensitive.

376
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,000
sometimes they can see things that we don't, 
they feel things that we don't.

377
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,700
i'm just trying to get some clarity.

378
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,700
i need to know if i'm his father or not.

379
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,400
- aren't there tests that can be done?
- i've done the tests, 

380
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,300
but i haven't got the results yet.

381
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,600
so until then,  he feels your distance.

382
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,000
is that why you left me that message to me

383
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
aren't we both too busy for psychology lessons?

384
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,300
i'm just trying to help you.

385
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,600
the man that your wife...

386
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,900
slept with?

387
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,100
do you know if he's still alive?

388
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,100
you think he might be the spirit or whatever?

389
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,100
- it would be good to rule it out.
- yeah, well,  you can rule it out.

390
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,700
he's alive and well and living in san diego
with some very nice memories.

391
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,800
so what do you want for christmas?

392
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
a puppy! oh!

393
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
how about you? what do you want?

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,400
teddy bear.

395
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,300
i know who santa isn't. he is not bruce spencer, 

396
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
and he's not the man that william's wife
is having an affair with.

397
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
i haven't been able to find anything
about deaths in her family.

398
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,800
well, here's a novel idea--
maybe santa is santa.

399
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
yeah, except for the fact that he's a myth.

400
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,100
he's a myth,  but maybe also...

401
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
maybe he's a ghost.

402
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,900
all right,  hear me out. maybe santa's a ghost.

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
think about it. only kids can see him, 
he can travel the world in a night, 

404
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,300
he can whisper  to parents
what little timmy and sally want for christmas.

405
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,800
you said it yourself at all
the kids said that they saw santa.

406
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,600
yeah, but that's probably because he believes it, 
and they can feel his energy.

407
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,000
would santa make things explode
or tear families apart, 

408
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
because that's
what this ghost is doing to william.

409
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,700
he would if he wanted to teach them a lesson.

410
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
ok, all right,  follow me.

411
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,100
all right, let's see,  there's a germanic tribe, 

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,900
they believe that santa claus is a reformed demon.

413
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
he would slither down the chimney, 

414
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,400
and he'd see the kids in their beds
and eat them all up.

415
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,000
that's just nasty.
it's not helping us at all, is it?

416
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,900
no, it's really not,  and our ghost is not santa, ok?

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
he's just a delusional spirit that has
some kind of unresolved issues with william.

418
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
i know, but he thinks he's santa.

419
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,900
and considering the season,  it's delightful.
just run with it.

420
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
i don't have time.

421
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
i don't have time, 
because the season is almost over

422
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
and i'm not even ready for it to start.

423
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,600
i need this ghost to cross over right now.

424
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,200
if this guy isn't santa,  how did we wind up
with the letter from riley to his father?

425
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
good question. ghosts don't have mail boxes, 

426
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
they only have what they die with.

427
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
well, that means this ghost
must have died with the letter.

428
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,400
and he's been hanging onto it
because it meant so much to him.

429
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,400
more than he knows.

430
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,000
wait, you're leading now.
how did that happen? i was just leading.

431
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,200
no, no, no,  think about it.

432
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,100
a letter from a child, 
probably before riley was even born.

433
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,100
that ghost is attached to william.

434
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,100
stepfather! how did i miss that?

435
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
i've gotta go. you're a genius.

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
tell me something i don't know.

437
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,900
like what just happened, 
'cause i don't know what just happened.

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
thanks again,  and happy holidays.

439
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,400
you know, we should take advantage of this lull
and go grab a latte. you want one?

440
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,500
no, i'good, thanks.

441
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,400
did ned screw up a delivery?

442
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,800
nope.i'm just looking for something.

443
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
ok.

444
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,700
William Taylor

445
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
dear santa,  please i just want
my father back for christmas.

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Taylor

447
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,200
gotcha.

448
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,400
hey! i saw you. in a christmas bulb!

449
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,600
you're a smart kid, riley.

450
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,900
santa likes smart kids.

451
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,900
- you're santa?
- in the flesh. pretty much.

452
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,800
how come you're out here by yourself?

453
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,100
- my dad forgets to pick me up.
- what? that's terrible.

454
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,800
sometimes  forgets it's his turn to have me.

455
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,200
but he'll remember,  and he'll pick me up.
he always does.

456
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,900
that son of a--

457
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,400
listen, i just want you to know
that i got your letter.

458
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,100
letter?

459
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,300
and i'm gonna take care of this for you.

460
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,400
- what?
- your dad.

461
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,000
you're not gonna hurt him, are you?

462
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
no, riley.

463
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,700
i'm gonna make sure you get what you want.

464
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
i just want him to like me again.

465
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,600
you leave this with santa, ok?

466
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,100
ok, santa.

467
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,600
put on your seatbelt.

468
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,200
bye, santa!

469
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,200
i know who you are.

470
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,100
and i really need to talk to you.

471
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,600
i can help you.

472
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,600
how can you help me when you don't believe in me?

473
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,000
i know that you're really confused, 

474
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
and don't know why you're here.

475
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,300
of course i do,  to give riley his christmas wish.

476
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,900
i showed you the letter,  didn't i?

477
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
it's a real heartbreaker.

478
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,800
speaking of which,  how did you get it?

479
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,200
you know,  i'm not sure.

480
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,500
i just, uh,  well, it seems like i've always had it.

481
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,500
you have always had it.

482
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,300
especially since you died.

483
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,200
- but the letter's not from riley.
- what?

484
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,100
that's william's letter.

485
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,900
he wrote it when he was a little boy.

486
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,700
he still does the funny thing with his "rs."

487
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,100
wait, i--

488
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,000
oh. that doesn't make any sense.

489
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,700
it does if you're william's father.

490
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,600
and riley is really your grandson.

491
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
what?

492
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,500
how the hell do you figure that?

493
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,400
well, at first,  when i was trying to figure out
who was haunting william, 

494
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
i looked at all the family members.

495
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,700
i'd forgotten that
he said something about his stepfather, 

496
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,300
but i never even thought
to look for a birth father.

497
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
so?

498
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,500
soi think that you're william's birth father.

499
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
that's nuts.

500
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,200
he gave you that letter before you died, 
and it broke your heart.

501
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
that's why you haven't crossed over.

502
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,000
look, i know that you think you're santa claus, 
but you're not.

503
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,100
you're just a lonely little boy's father
who's come back to reconcile with him, 

504
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,600
and i can help you do that.

505
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,100
you are so on my bad list.

506
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,100
- please, ok? let's just--
- no, no, no.

507
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,400
i am santa claus.

508
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
and this is why only kids can see me.

509
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,400
adults have lost their ability to believe!

510
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,700
you would be amazed
at some of the things i believe.

511
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
i'm not gonna waste any more time on you.

512
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,200
- get lost.
- this is my place.

513
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,200
oh. yeah, well...

514
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,400
you're not santa claus.

515
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,300
i guess
i'm just going to have to make you believe.

516
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,800
william **holiday dinner for riley's sake.

517
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
bless his heart.

518
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,500
i feel like i've been cooking all week.

519
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,800
is everything all right?

520
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,200
i'm not sure.

521
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,300
- could i ask you a personal question?
- ok.

522
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,900
- your husband was william's stepfather, right?
- yes.

523
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,500
so william's birth father was your first husband?

524
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
what's this about?

525
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
you know that weird things
have been happening to william.

526
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,700
i think it has something to do with his father.

527
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,000
- and this has what to do with you?
- nothing.

528
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,723
everything. look,  if you could just trust me, 

529
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:21,401
i really think that i could help william, 
and riley, too.

530
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,800
well, i don't see how.

531
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
it's really pretty simple.

532
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,700
my first husnd abandoned us when william was 5.

533
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,500
I'm so sorry.

534
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,400
- what was his name?
- alan silver.

535
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,800
5 years later,  i remarried.
that's why william's last name is taylor.

536
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,500
alan and i weren't right from the start.

537
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,300
i think
having a family just made him feel trapped.

538
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
so we got untrapped.

539
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,200
that must have been really hard
on you and william.

540
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,300
oh, he asked about his dad all the time.

541
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,200
where was he,  why wasn't he with us, 

542
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,500
so i, uh...

543
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,200
i created a myth about alan.

544
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,500
told william his father did important work
all over the world.

545
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,700
he used to try and track
where his father was on a map.

546
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,000
he was so sure
he was going to come home to us someday.

547
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,900
the lie just got bigger and bigger, 
and i didn't know where to stop.

548
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,700
the truth would have crushed him.

549
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,800
christmas... was the hardest time.

550
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
i used to wrap up a present

551
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,300
and put it under the tree
like it was from his dad.

552
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,200
his little face would just light up
when he'd open it.

553
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,900
and then one year,  he just wouldn't open
the present i told him was from his dad.

554
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,900
and after that...

555
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,600
he never asked about his father again.

556
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,300
i'm sure that he stopped asking,  but...

557
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,500
i bet he never stopped thinking of him.

558
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,800
did william ever write a letter to his father?

559
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,100
it wasn't a letter to his father.

560
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,300
dear santa, 
please i just want my father back for christmas.

561
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,500
it was like a knife through my heart.

562
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,400
i felt like i had to do something, 
so i found out where alan lived

563
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,900
and i sent him the letter.

564
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
no response.

565
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,000
i'm pretty sure he got it.

566
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,800
and i bet it really touched him.

567
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
just not enough,  i guess.

568
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,700
here he is, alan silver.
died of heart failure in '97.

569
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,100
this guy made it big. he founded nature for life, 
those great organic coffees and teas.

570
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
ooh, i love that stuff.

571
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,600
yeah, and it says here he became a multimillionaire
when they took the company public.

572
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,100
the irony is,  he couldn't handle it.

573
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,300
see, he just wanted to
have this little hippie company, you know, 

574
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,800
and suddenly he was a rich capitalist.
he had a nervous breakdown.

575
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,300
you know,  i remember that guy.

576
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,700
he gave away all his money.

577
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,034
not only his money but his houses, cars.

578
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:36,741
he gained weight,  grew a beard, 
and stopped cutting his hair.

579
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
santa.

580
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,200
that's got to be it, right?

581
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,700
i mean, he lost his mind, 
started to think that he was--

582
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,000
- uh, this is gonna be a minute.
- yeah, i can see that.

583
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
you know what, 
i'm just gonna take care of the orders downstairs.

584
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,400
ok.

585
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
so, uh, why would you do that to my mother?

586
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,700
make her remember all that crap from the past?

587
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,100
i didn't mean to cause her any pain.
i was just trying to help.

588
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
it's like i told you, 
you have a ghost attached to you.

589
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,100
yeah, so you said.

590
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,300
it's your father. your real father.

591
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
my real father?

592
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,700
you mean the guy who raised me, 
who was always there for me?

593
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
ok, it's your birth father.
he got a letter from you, 

594
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
one that you wrote to santa claus
when you were a little boy.

595
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,700
look, it's a long story, 
but after he died,  he got really confused.

596
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,500
and he thought that the letter was from riley, 

597
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,000
and then he thought that he was supposed to
get you to spend more time with your son--

598
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
wait, wait,  wait a minute.

599
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,600
why would he think
that he was getting a letter from riley?

600
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,800
because he thinks he's santa claus.

601
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,500
because he doesn't know that he's your father.

602
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,300
and why would he--
why would anyone think they're santa claus?

603
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,200
because i think that...i don't know, 

604
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,700
i think he kind of went crazy
before he died, 

605
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,900
you know?
he gave up all of his money, his possessions, 

606
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,900
and i guess that made him think he was santa.

607
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,200
this is great.
so you're telling me that my dead father

608
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
who never gave a damn about his family
is now haunting me

609
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,000
because he thinks he's santa claus?

610
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,000
i really believe that he's haunting you
because he wants to make things right.

611
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,200
oh, plse.

612
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,700
my father was a no-show,  my mother lied about it, 

613
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
and i think you're lying right now.

614
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,300
so just stay the hell away from me.

615
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,400
oh, and by the way,  merry christmas. ho ho ho.

616
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,200
oh, no.

617
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,600
it's true. i can see it now.

618
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,900
i'm not who i thought i was.

619
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,100
great.

620
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
william, wait.

621
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
- i know this is a lot to deal with.
- you think?

622
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
but it's christmas.

623
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
can't you find a little forgiveness?

624
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,400
look, you're talking to the
wrong guy about christmas.

625
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,300
there's only one christmas i remember.

626
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,700
my mother was in the living room wrapping a gift.

627
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,100
i watched her sign the card
and put the present under the tree.

628
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,600
when she left, i went to see what it said.

629
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,800
dear william,  i'm in New Delhi,  i'm sorry
i can't be with you,  but i love you always.

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,800
daddy

631
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,100
see, that's when i realized
that it was all made up...

632
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,900
that none of it was real.

633
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,000
i stopped asking about my father after that.

634
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
so the plane  did mean something.

635
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
yeah, it meant it was all a lie.

636
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,300
my father lied,  my mother lied.

637
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
my wife lied.

638
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,200
the whole idea about
me being riley's father might be a lie.

639
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
nobody thinks i'm worth telling the truth to.

640
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,500
ok, you know what,  you can't look at it that way.

641
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
look, i just want to know the truth.

642
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,400
that's all i want.

643
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,300
somebody to tell me just one true thing.

644
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,400
william...

645
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
that's your son. you do understand that?

646
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
you had a nervous breakdown before you died.

647
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,200
i think it was out of guilt.

648
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
you gave everything away.

649
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,200
and you didn't even know
what you were making up for.

650
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,900
i threw away my wife,  my son.

651
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,600
it's not too le, alan.

652
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
it's never too late.

653
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,200
the christmas light just all of a sudden went out.

654
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,100
i mean, it couldn't happen at a worse time.

655
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,800
riley and jane are going to be here any minute, 

656
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,100
and dinner's almost ready.

657
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,900
i'm so, so glad you made it home.

658
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,800
is that...

659
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,200
the test results.

660
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,800
i had no idea you knew.

661
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,700
i'm so sorry,  william.

662
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,700
you should have told me the truth, ma.

663
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
all those years,  all those hopes.

664
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,700
look,  this isn't about blame.

665
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,991
and whether you two believe it or not, 

666
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:31,438
it's not going to change
the fact that alan is here.

667
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,300
and he deserves a chance
to try to make things right.

668
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,000
how? how could he do that?

669
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,700
tell will i'm sorry
he had to deal with so many lies, 

670
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,900
but the truth 's looking for
exists in one of those lies.

671
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,300
he wants you to know that the truthou want
is in one ofhose lies.

672
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,900
your mother made up stories about me
because she loved you.

673
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
she knew that every boy needs a father, 
real or imagined.

674
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,700
your mother made up those stories
because she knew that you needed a father.

675
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,900
she did it because she loved you.

676
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,700
is my dad really here?

677
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,200
your problem is, 
you're so busy lookin' for the lie, 

678
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,000
you can't see the truth.

679
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,700
and he's telling you that you're so busy
looking for the lie that you can't see the truth.

680
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,300
your son...

681
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,000
maybe he's yours,  maybe he's not.
but you are his.

682
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
you're the only dad he has.

683
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,000
your son is the truth.
he's your truth.

684
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,600
your son is the only truth that matters.

685
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,400
if you love your son right now, 
that's all that counts.

686
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,800
if you love your wife right now, 
that's all that counts.

687
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,700
the rest is just clutter.

688
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,400
he's telling you to let go of the past.

689
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,700
he wants you to listen to your heart.

690
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,300
and if you love your son and you love your wife, 
then that's all that matters.

691
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,200
the past, the rest,  it's just clutter.

692
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,100
why'd you leave me, dad?

693
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
where's the truth in that?

694
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,300
because i didn't know what i had.

695
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,400
because he didn't know what he had.

696
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,500
