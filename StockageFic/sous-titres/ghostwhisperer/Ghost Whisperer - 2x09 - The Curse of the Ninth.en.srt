1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,362
I live in a small town,

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,249
and I own an antique shop.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,413
I might be just like you.

4
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,228
Except that from the time I was a little girl,

5
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:10,469
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

6
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,976
It's all right, honey.

7
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:14,655
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them.

8
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,656
They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living

9
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:19,807
and they come to me for help.

10
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,023
In order to tell you my story,

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,867
I have to tell you theirs.

12
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:09,577
thank you very much.

13
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,103
We are three days grace.

14
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,920
We'll be right back.

15
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,205
When you said that we were going out dancing,

16
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,073
I didn't think this was what you meant.

17
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:19,239
I--I said there might be dancing.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,385
Your exact words were,

19
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:22,542
"I cannot wait to get you out on the dance floor."

20
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:24,649
Come on. Jumping up and down can be dancing.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,208
Another round, folks?

22
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,104
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:28,341
2 would be great.

24
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:29,095
Brandon!

25
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,918
Order up for the band.

26
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,928
Sorry, guys.Give me one sec.

27
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,333
Does that guy look familiar to you?

28
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,192
I don't think so.

29
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:38,980
You?

30
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,070
I don't know.

31
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,411
Why don't you play, man?

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,848
-- You gotta play.
-- no no no

33
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:50,051
Here, I got a guitar--I got a guitar right here.

34
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:58,002
Freebird!

35
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,497
He's amazing.

36
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:15,829
Oh, wait a minute.

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,906
That's why I know this guy.

38
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,454
He used to play for crimson doves.

39
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:19,462
-- Who?
-- Crimson doves.

40
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:20,585
They were a local band,

41
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:22,154
uh...big favorite.

42
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,743
They released this great album a few years back,

43
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,754
and then they just kinda disappeared.

44
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,632
Do you feel that?

45
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,148
Ten.

46
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:49,296
What?What's going on?

47
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,397
Let me guess.

48
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,758
That wasn't the ghost of jimi hendrix?

49
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,972
But it gave new meaning to stage fright.

53
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,436
You know, why does a guy like that work here?

54
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:56,694
I mean, he should be on the cover of rolling stone,not serving drinks.

55
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,264
Maybe he gets monster tips here.

56
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:01,557
Or maybe a ghost is trying to stop him from doing what he loves.

57
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,490
I hate that.

58
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,659
You're dead,you can't move on,I get it.

59
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,098
But don't mess with the living,

60
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,100
especially when they're as talented as he is.

61
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,752
I'm gonna get the jeep.

62
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,264
You stay here,you stay warm.

63
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,094
We'll get this ghost into therapy when we get home.

64
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,261
All right.

65
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,513
Oh, hi! Hey,you were great up there.

66
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh, thanks.

67
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:19,933
Aw, I never did get you those drinks,did I?

68
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:21,475
We cut ourselves off.

69
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:22,573
I'm melinda.

70
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:23,603
Oh. Nice to meet you.

71
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,565
It was weird what happened.Were you ok?

72
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,044
Yeah, it's just some feedback problems.

73
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,322
It's happened before.

74
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:31,506
Oh, really?Like when you used to play with, uh, crimson doves?

75
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:32,447
Are you a fan?

76
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,616
My husband was.

77
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:34,846
So he told you about the curse?

78
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:36,486
No. What curse?

79
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:37,570
Just a bad urban legend.

80
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,561
Have a good night.

81
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,767
Well, do you have a second to talk?

82
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,657
Come on.You really think you can get $3,000 for this?

83
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,752
Easy. It's rumored that the doors played on it.

84
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,724
Who are the doors?

85
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,472
Oh, ouch.

86
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,415
But how are you gonna sell it?

87
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,800
It's broken.It needs a new one of...those pedals.

88
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,244
Well, I worked with a refurbisher,

89
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:04,520
and his card's still on file.

90
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,571
He's also looking to buy a condo if someone wants to sell him one.

91
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,438
-- Serendipity,the name is melinda.
-- Thank you.

92
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,593
I will have to check my schedule,

93
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,142
but I think we're free, right?

94
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,643
I have a ton of homework that the dog needs to eat.

95
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:16,503
Ok, fine.

96
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,921
But I want to see it when you get home.

97
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:18,979
Ok.

98
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,704
Bye, ned.

99
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,293
Yeah.That's a lot of fun to live with for the past week.

100
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,082
What's going on?

101
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,353
Charlie's birthday is coming up.

102
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:30,345
I know. Weird.

103
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,307
He's dead.

104
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,555
But...

105
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:37,219
celebrating his birthday is just a little way for us to keep his spirit with us.

106
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,323
Actually,it makes perfect sense.

107
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:40,704
Yeah, well...

108
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:41,818
ned's not so crazy about it.

109
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,770
He knows it's coming up,

110
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,546
and he's doing everything he can to avoid it,

111
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:47,413
and by extension, avoid me.

112
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,063
Hey, look. I found it.

113
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:52,146
So I'm gonna be on the hunt for a new pedal.

114
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,342
-- Howdy.
-- Hello, handsome.

115
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,587
Hi, delia.

116
00:05:57,977 --> 00:05:59,963
Lesson jim learned at work today:

117
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,065
Don't get caught surfing myspace at work.

118
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,123
Ooh, is there mocking?

119
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:07,810
Something along the lines of you being a 13-year-old girl?

120
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:08,766
Very funny.

121
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,969
It was all worth it because...

122
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,553
a link for the crimson doves.

123
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:13,821
Oh...

124
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:15,780
"rest in peace, jared".

125
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:16,931
Yeah.He's the lead singer.

126
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,908
Get this...he dies in a plane crash

127
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,581
2 days before that cd I was talking about comes out.

128
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,528
But it gets better.

129
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,583
This guy?He's the bass player.His name's sampson.

130
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,844
That's not a stage name.

131
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:30,021
He gives an interview where he says that the band has not been able to play together since the plane crash,

132
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,712
-- because...
-- they were cursed.

133
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:32,866
Yup. Bingo.

134
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,066
Maybe that's what brandon was talking about.

135
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,580
Yeah, except it's not the curse.

136
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,663
It's the lead singer's ghost.

137
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,775
Jared.

138
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:42,975
Is there contact information in here?

139
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,976
No, but  it's a good thing

140
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:48,521
there aren't too many guys with the first name sampson in our zip code.

141
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,380
This guy writes commercial jingles for the radio.

142
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,410
You rock.

143
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,827
Yes, I do.

144
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,754
I gotta get back to work.

145
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:56,735
All right...

146
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:00,589
the first gig we did after jared died should be on here somewhere.

147
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,756
Is that...

148
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,135
is that jared?

149
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:07,189
Yeah.

150
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,001
They had that telepathy only those weird,creative types have.

151
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:15,215
Best friends since childhood,too,so that helped.

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,949
Where's my head?

153
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,762
This is the wrong dvd.

154
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,361
who is that?

155
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,139
Oh. Sandy, jared's girlfriend.

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,234
What are you guys doing?

157
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,981
Brandon has a love song we're trying to get off the ground.

158
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:32,839
Ooh.

159
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,762
Who's it about,brandon?

160
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,907
You know, let me know when you guys are ready to work.

161
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,868
I guess brandon didn't like her very much.

162
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:43,011
Not too much.

163
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,053
They competed for jared's attention.

164
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,372
This is a month after the funeral.

165
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:53,060
With jared gone,brandon tried vocals. But...

166
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,619
Wait, pause it.

167
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,241
Does that look like a "10" to you?

168
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,304
I don't see it.

169
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:14,466
Let me get this straight.

170
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,606
The crimson--whatever-they-ares,

171
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:20,060
they can't play music,and now they're blaming it on a curse?

172
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:21,456
Doves. Yeah.

173
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,020
Anyway, something'snbeen getting in their way,

174
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,599
and I think since the lead singer's ghost died

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,559
just about the same time as they stopped being able to play,

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,596
it might be related.

177
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,165
You know what fascinates me about pop culture curses?

178
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,628
The delusional weight that the fans attribute to the curse.

179
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,111
Have you heard of the "paul is dead" hoax?

180
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,241
A little.Paul, as in mccartney?

181
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,458
Yeah.Well, in a nutshell,

182
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,017
a bunch of beatlemaniacs turned the volume way up on strawberry fields forever,

183
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:46,697
and they think they hear "I buried paul."

184
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:50,591
Next thing you know,rumors pop up that the cute one went toes-up in a car crash.

185
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:53,201
All right, admit it.You were the beatlemaniac who started that rumor.

186
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,654
Oh, sweetheart. If only.Are you kidding me?

187
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:56,911
If I started that rumor?

188
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,023
That would have been the best.

189
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:58,834
But it wasn't me.

190
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,448
It was john lennon's studio trickery.

191
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,523
He said,

192
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,829
"cranberry sauce".

193
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,812
That was it.

194
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,419
Now, you're talking about a physical manifestation,

195
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,985
where people are actually getting ill, playing poorly?

196
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:13,188
-- Exactly.
-- Well, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of that.

197
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,589
It's--well, it's called infrasound.

198
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,013
What's that?

199
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,550
Well, infrasound...

200
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,100
is a frequency...

201
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,889
That's not unlike...

202
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:25,032
Oh!

203
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,304
Please don't do that.

204
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:28,007
It sounds like nails on a chalkboard.

205
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:29,737
Like nails on a chalkboard.

206
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,996
See, different frequencies affect different people in different ways.

207
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:35,271
But infrasound is a frequency so low

208
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,104
that we can't even hear it at all.

209
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:38,736
But human beings can feel it.

210
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,194
It rattles our bones,it makes us sick.

211
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,552
Now, the wives' tale is that when ghosts want to make their presence felt,

212
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:45,048
they use that frequency.

213
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,440
Ok, so...

214
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,323
say that the tale is true,

215
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:51,898
and that the lead singer's ghost pulled a frequency through the amp and speakers,

216
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,295
it could make someone sick, right?

217
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,260
In theory.

218
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,213
Ok, so theoretically,

219
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,963
how do we counteract it?

220
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,364
Uh, well, you have to tune off of it.

221
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,810
Go to the lowest "g" chord available on an electrical instrument.

222
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,672
Uh, that would naturalize the vibrative harmonies

223
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:07,781
and make the music a little less...stomach-churning.

224
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,974
And what about the number 10?

225
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:11,556
That's a pretty broad topic.

226
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,030
Does it have any relevance?It keeps popping up.

227
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:17,267
If it has something to do with your curse,I don't know.I'll look into it.

228
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,576
Hello?

229
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,654
Hi, delia.

230
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,840
How much to fix the piano?

231
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:26,906
Ok, you know what?Do me a favor

232
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,937
and just find out how much it is for just the parts.

233
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:33,536
I think I know somebody who can fix the piano for us at a discount.

234
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:36,934
So how'd you find out I knew about pianos?

235
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,711
I heard that you were classically trained,and I took a wild guess.

236
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,708
Have you been checking up on me?

237
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,544
A little.

238
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,637
When you mentioned a curse,I got curious.

239
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,646
I don't think that's your problem.

240
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,993
Do you always ask personal questions of people you just met?

241
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,711
Actually, yes.

242
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,175
Why do you work in a club?

243
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,693
Because I need a job.

244
00:10:56,346 --> 00:11:00,538
And before you try to get a tearful confession out of me
about how much I wish I could be up there,

245
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,539
let me just save you the trouble.

246
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,037
I wake up every morning wanting that.

247
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,300
But I can'T.

248
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,353
And there's nothing I can do about it.

249
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:11,876
Brandon, I--

250
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,463
I know a little about having a gift

251
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,581
and being frustrated by it.

252
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,413
I think I can help you.

253
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:20,521
You don't even know me.

254
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:23,994
You're right.But all I'm asking you to do is play one song.

255
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,250
If anything happens to this piano,I'm not responsible.

256
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:28,892
Agreed.

257
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:47,881
Keep playing.

258
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,760
But when I tell you, hit the low "g", ok?

259
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:51,648
Why?

260
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,262
Just trust me.

261
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:02,351
Make him play it.

262
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:03,487
Play what?

263
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,942
-- What?
-- Play the tenth.

264
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,890
You know, I know that this is gonna sound random,

265
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,045
but have you ever played the tenth?

266
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,119
You don't know what that is.

267
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,555
Nope.

268
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,191
what about music teachers?

269
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:36,165
Did any of them ever ask you to play the tenth?

270
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,070
I had one music teacher my whole life.

271
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,858
Quite accomplished,actually.

272
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,722
He played piano for the new york philharmonic.

273
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,938
Wrote some symphonies for them, too.

274
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,467
And he's buried right next to my mom.

275
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:48,799
It's your dad.

276
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,125
Yeah.

277
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,732
And the tenth never came up.

278
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,226
-- here you are.
-- Thank you.

279
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:24,871
Excuse me.

280
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,061
Crazy question.

281
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,114
You have patrick roth's other 9 symphonies here.

282
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,641
Do you know anything about a tenth?

283
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,287
Uh, let me check.

284
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:37,774
Oh, it says here he passed away before he could complete it.

285
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,355
Although, we do have his first 3 movements on file.

286
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,252
I see. Could I get a copy of that score?

287
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,983
Sure. We also have recordings of his symphony rehearsals.

288
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:46,258
Can I hear them?

289
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,829
He must play it!

290
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,306
Is that what you want?

291
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:13,759
Brandon to play this?

292
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,116
No!

293
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,130
You're not getting it!

294
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:30,062
Classical music.

295
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,345
Yeah. I just found out myself.

296
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:33,423
I know that it revolves around the tenth.

297
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,835
Um, but it's more like play the tenth symphony,

298
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,571
and the one that I found wasn't even finished.

299
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,090
No, no.I can make this work.

300
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:39,819
This I can make work.

301
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,130
Sure, I would have loved having this information

302
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,745
before I promised sexual favors to a very unappealing woman at the rock and roll hall of fame,

303
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:48,767
but maybe your problem is actually your solution.

304
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,970
The curse of the ninth?

305
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,363
All the great composers died after completing their ninth symphony.

306
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,621
I--you're talking beethoven, mahler,bruckner.

307
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,137
They all croaked halfway through their tenth.

308
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,161
Is this curse real?

309
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,122
No. No, no. It's not a real curse at all.

310
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:03,788
These guys all died from having their brains rotted from venereal disease,

311
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,415
but saying it's a curse makes it sound more respectable.

312
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,731
And what about a ghost coming back to finish his work?

313
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,406
Is there anything in here about that?

314
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,607
Well, it's rumored that brahms was so haunted by beethoven's ghost

315
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,643
he couldn't write a word for 20 years.

316
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,422
That is brilliant.Thank you.

317
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:19,498
Wait. Wait.

318
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,680
Hey, before you leave a melinda-shaped hole in that wall,

319
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,931
you said there were doves in your symbolism?

320
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,868
Crimson doves.That was the name of the band.

321
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,118
Listen to this.

322
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:30,074
"The death of a dove,

323
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:31,134
symbolically speaking,

324
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,207
"indicates misfortune.

325
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,545
"And the death of a dove near someone's house

326
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:37,336
"means the impending death of someone in that house."

327
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,094
Maybe this lead singer's death,

328
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,611
isn't just a coincidence.

329
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,640
Yeah. Maybe.

330
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,725
I can see the dead,

331
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,939
and your father's ghost is attached to you.

332
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,904
So is this the part where you say,

333
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,580
"I'm getting a "p" name."

334
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,647
And I say, "patrick."

335
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,771
And you say,"he wants you to stop worrying about money."

336
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:57,503
And I say--

337
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:59,540
your father is 3 inches shorter than you.

338
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,741
His hairline is receding.

339
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,390
He has a soft european accent. German, I think.

340
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,494
Seems like an impatient guy,

341
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:07,186
and the last time I was with him,he kept telling me how I wasn't getting it.

342
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:09,049
How am I doing?

343
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,006
He used to say that to me all the time.

344
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,730
When I would practice.

345
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,421
4 hours a day.

346
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,148
Every day.

347
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:21,927
He made me play his symphonies.

348
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:25,569
You're not getting it,brandon.

349
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,909
You're off the beat.

350
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,894
Your orchestra is lapping you.

351
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:30,170
Don't look down.

352
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,584
The answer isn't in your hands,

353
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,603
it's here.

354
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,067
Play it right.

355
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,228
Or don't play at all.

356
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:41,103
Ghosts stay behind because they have unfinished business with the living.

357
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:43,673
I think your father trying to ruin your music...

358
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,392
is because he wants you to finish this.

359
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:51,640
Do you have any idea what you're asking me to do here?

360
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,283
The man made my life miserable.

361
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:55,468
And now you want me to get inside of his head?

362
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,328
Look, I understand.But if you complete the symphony,

363
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,034
I can cross him over.

364
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:00,599
Wh--what does that mean?

365
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,968
It means you can play music again.

366
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,814
Your music.

367
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,461
Hey, have you seen the calculator?

368
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,331
Have you thought about what you want to do for your dad's birthday tomorrow?

369
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,966
How about nothing?

370
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,771
Ned, look at me.

371
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,017
This is important.

372
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,407
I really want to do it.

373
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,263
Whatever. That's fine.

374
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,143
Hey!

375
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,074
Hey!

376
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,782
That electric piano is the hit of the town.

377
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,155
I've already had 3 bids on it.

378
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:37,147
Uh, well, you have him to thank for fixing it.

379
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,008
Brandon, delia.

380
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,622
Delia, brandon.

381
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,219
He's very artistic.

382
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,485
As long as he brings traffic through the store,

383
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,061
he can be as artistic as he wants.

384
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,063
Come on.

385
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,228
Hi, ned.

386
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,733
I have a pretty good sense of my dad's composing style,

387
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,292
but I'm gonna have to play it through once

388
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:02,735
just to get a feel for what he was trying to say.

389
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,330
Is there anything I can help you with?

390
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:05,327
Yeah. Uh,

391
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:07,239
do you have a tape recorder?

392
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:12,183
You never answered my question about tomorrow night.

393
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,690
Do you remember the creme brulee that you and dad always liked?

394
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:19,195
Maybe I could make that.

395
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,084
Or maybe we shouldn't do anything.

396
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,277
How come?

397
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,433
Because it's been 3 years.

398
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,433
Because it--

399
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,558
ned.

400
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,796
I want to talk about this.

401
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,289
I have a report due on to kill a mockingbird.

402
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,178
I, um--left it in the back room.

403
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,587
I'll be right back.

404
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,307
How's this?

405
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:43,976
Oh, it's perfect.

406
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:47,981
You can do this.

407
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:50,302
Last time I missed a note,

408
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,100
my dad almost drew blood.

409
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:54,775
Now that he's a ghost,

410
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,700
who knows what he'll do?

411
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,379
Sometimes,ghosts have messages for the living.

412
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,462
I might need your help to understand it.

413
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:03,128
A word, a phrase.

414
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,749
Something that might have meaning for the two of you.

415
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,233
Brandon,your dad's here.

416
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,677
I didn't hit the low "g".

417
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,098
No, it's ok.

418
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,299
It's ok.He probably just needed to see you play.

419
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,946
What is that?

420
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:46,896
I think we're ok.

421
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:48,443
Help me.

422
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,767
Hit the low "g".

423
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,021
Jared.

424
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,011
Wait, wait, wait.

425
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:08,664
Are you trying to tell me that...

426
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,296
my dad is gone,

427
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:11,803
and there's another ghost?

428
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,217
Yeah, attached to him.

429
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:14,483
Uh, it's jared.

430
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,870
He's in the store.

431
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,054
How's it goin', buddy?

432
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,689
He says hi.

433
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,230
That's--

434
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,608
my god,that's awesome.

435
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,773
Yeah. Why are you here?

436
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:28,142
To protect brandon.

437
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,182
He's protecting you.

438
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:29,898
From who?

439
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,663
From that waste of time.

440
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,504
Waste of time?

441
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:34,577
What are you talking about?

442
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:35,616
I know.

443
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,409
We'd been playing together for about a year.

444
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,457
What did you guys think?

445
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,436
I really don't think it works.

446
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,205
It was beautiful.

447
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,525
Do you have lyrics?

448
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,183
I'm still working on them.

449
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,956
And you guys want something to eat,

450
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:06,853
or drink, or--?

451
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:08,306
Dad.

452
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,118
You two, leave.

453
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,632
Right now.

454
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:43,616
So this is what you decide to throw your training away for?

455
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:47,196
This is better than mozart?

456
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,957
Mozart rocked out in his day.

457
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:51,689
You taught me that.

458
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,900
You want to waste your time,

459
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:54,963
I can't stop you.

460
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:59,127
But what I can't forgive you for is wasting mine.

461
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,805
After that,

462
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,441
my dad and I stopped.

463
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:05,597
Everything.

464
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:06,940
Talking,

465
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,806
being in the same room.

466
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,679
Jared became my family.

467
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:14,357
I guess he still is.

468
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:17,754
So, brandon's dad shows up and you what?

469
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,337
Beat him up, and then decide to wreck my store?

470
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,185
It was bad enough that I died and couldn't play anymore.

471
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,005
But then I followed brandon to his next gig

472
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,357
and saw that douche mucking around with the sound.

473
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,651
Disrupted, made brandon play like crap.

474
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:30,585
Wh--what--what's he saying?

475
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,441
He says your dad was affecting your playing,

476
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:33,373
and the rumble we felt?

477
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:35,228
That was his way of fighting him off.

478
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,443
Good intentions aside,

479
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:38,262
this is not solving the problem.

480
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:40,077
Your dad wants you to finish the symphony,

481
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:42,015
and he's not gonna cross over until he does that.

482
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:43,124
Well, maybe there's a third option.

483
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,161
Maybe mr. Father of the year needs to accept who his son is.

484
00:22:47,162 --> 00:22:48,711
Once he leaves brandon alone,

485
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,449
I'll leave him alone.

486
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,489
Oh!

487
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,431
Hello?

488
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,078
Hey, mel. It's me.

489
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,410
Is everything ok?

490
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:02,754
No, actually.I'm a little freaked out.

491
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:06,244
You know, ned was very jumpy the whole car ride home and all through dinner.

492
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:09,625
And then he told me that he had to go do something and...

493
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,157
I can't find him.

494
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,185
Would you want jim and I to help you look for him?

495
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:16,375
I feel like I should give it an hour or so before...

496
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:18,742
I really lose my mind. Ok?

497
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:19,751
So--but if you see him--

498
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:22,268
if you see him at the store or in the square,

499
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,432
will you call me, please?

500
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,531
Will you bring him home?
(Text from Ned:you see ghosts!)

501
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,072
thank you so much.

502
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:33,949
Ned.

503
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:35,981
Am I wrong?

504
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,456
I want you to listen to me very closely.

505
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,725
We cannot tell your mom.

506
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:40,646
-- Why not?
-- It's complicated.

507
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,993
So, you can help this guitarist guy,

508
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:44,228
but you can't help me?

509
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:45,679
With what, ned?

510
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,660
What can I possibly help you with?

511
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,965
I need you to find my dad.

512
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,985
After he died--

513
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:54,371
when I was young...er--

514
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,318
I thought I saw him.

515
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,390
My mom just told me I imagined it.

516
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,688
But I wasn't, was I?

517
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,097
No. No, you weren'T.

518
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:06,600
So, you can still see my dad?

519
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,405
No. It doesn't really work that way.

520
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,765
Why not?

521
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:14,294
Because I have no control over which ghosts appear to me.

522
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:16,041
You helped that other guy's dad!

523
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:20,365
And I heard you saying that ghosts give you signs and messages.

524
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,891
That's just what my mom needs.

525
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,610
A message.

526
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,480
'Cause my mom is hurting.

527
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,757
Ned,where you going?

528
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,017
Home.

529
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:37,110
Don't worry.I'll be fine.

530
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,213
Thanks for your help.

531
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,734
Want anything to eat?

532
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:54,061
You don't see charlie anywhere, do you?

533
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:55,912
No.

534
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:00,018
And the worst part is that I wish I could tell delia and ned that he's here.

535
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,698
But he's not.

536
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:05,684
Have I ever told you how happy I am I'm--

537
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:07,824
I'm not you.

538
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:09,507
Well, that's not helping.

539
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,017
It's not the weight of what you do,

540
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:12,704
it's the responsibility.

541
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:13,759
I mean, how you have to do it.

542
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,679
For example,on one hand

543
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,928
you have to convince brandon not hide his gift.

544
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,164
But then on the other hand...

545
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:26,207
you've been doing exactly that yourself with ned and delia.

546
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:27,784
So, you think I should tell her.

547
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:28,772
No. No.

548
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,719
You should come clean with delia when you feel its right.

549
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,659
And not because ned's got you boxed into a corner.

550
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,918
But...

551
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,713
what I do think is that you should let me talk to ned.

552
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:41,107
You got too much on your plate already.

553
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,878
Thank you.

554
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,054
It's what I'm here for.

555
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,865
You're not getting the string section.

556
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,274
You're too sweet.

557
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,222
The notes are sweet.

558
00:26:02,724 --> 00:26:05,556
You don't have to play it so sweetly.

559
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,913
you are not giving it
you are not giving it

560
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,670
-- Patrick.
-- You have to help brandon with the tenth.

561
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,781
I've done everything that I can.

562
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:20,761
The reason that you're still here is because of your selfishness.

563
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,670
Brandon is not going to complete your symphony.

564
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,071
It's not my tenth.

565
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,800
My son's--

566
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:46,954
Did you guys ever record a tenth track for the cd?

567
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,387
It was just something he was messing with.

568
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,985
When he and jared were figuring out the track order,

569
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,129
it didn't make the cut.

570
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,308
I don't know what happened to it.

571
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,824
But sandy would.

572
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,380
She was with jared the whole time.

573
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:59,360
She went through enough after the crash.

574
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:00,578
I don't want to drag her back into this.

575
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,534
I wouldn't bring it up unless it was really important.

576
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:05,754
If brandon can get through this song,

577
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:08,043
maybe it'll help him play again.

578
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,268
Sammy, hi, I'm melinda.

579
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,985
Hi. Can I help you?

580
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:28,389
Actually I was hoping that we could talk about the crimson doves.

581
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,553
Man, I haven't thought about those guys in a while.

582
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:33,974
So, you didn't keep in touch with brandon?

583
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,250
No.

584
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:39,505
I was hoping you would shed some light on song number 10.

585
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:42,074
There were only nine cutson the album.

586
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,395
Yeah. But you'll remember the song.

587
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:46,650
It was the one with the chords that jared wasn't crazy about.

588
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,922
Why don't you go talk to brandon?

589
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,040
Well, because it's complicated.

590
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,655
I think that jared got in brandon's way.

591
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:56,774
And if i talk to brandon,

592
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,004
all I'm gonna get is an earful about how great his best friend was.

593
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:02,655
So, you go to the girlfriend for the real story.

594
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:04,850
What makes you think I'm gonna be anymore honest.

595
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,354
Because you were there.

596
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:10,621
There's a reason that that song came between them, isn't there?

597
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,848
It was about you, wasn't it?

598
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:23,554
Did jared know?

599
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,157
He must have been furious to find out

600
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,631
that his best friend had feelings for his girl.

601
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:31,699
He was. But not because the song was about me.

602
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,389
Then what was he upset about?

603
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,964
At how good the song was.

604
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,711
See,

605
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:41,150
everybody knew that brandon was scary talented.

606
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,541
That's why jared wanted him in the band to begin with.

607
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,196
And the only person who couldn't see it was brandon.

608
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:48,130
But after he wrote that song--

609
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:50,643
he started outgrowing jared.

610
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:56,376
They had a fight about whether or not the song was going on the cd.

611
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:58,324
The record company wanted it.

612
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,444
Brandon wanted it. But...

613
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:02,809
jared didn'T.

614
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,227
He got on that plane to come back to the studio

615
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:07,507
and remove it personally.

616
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,698
Only he never made it.

617
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,763
After the funeral,

618
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:17,638
brandon gathered every recording he'd made of the song.

619
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:20,059
Stop it.

620
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:21,808
Just leave me alone.

621
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:25,512
Get out of here!

622
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,786
Leave me alone.

623
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,499
He burnt everything?

624
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:39,353
He thought he was honoring jared's wishes.

625
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,519
I really thought you were going to be able to help me get him to play again.

626
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,274
Just wait a second.

627
00:29:58,072 --> 00:30:00,518
This is the first demo he ever made of it.

628
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,586
The one with lyrics.

629
00:30:03,753 --> 00:30:06,048
He wanted to know what I thought about it.

630
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,979
Tell him I cherished it.

631
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,555
Hey, delia. Excellent.

632
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,141
Hey, I was actually looking for ned.

633
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:23,008
And I was wondering if...

634
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,527
you're crying.What's wrong?

635
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,801
Nothing.

636
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,238
Mel told me, um...

637
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,916
today would be charlie's birthday, right?

638
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,101
Yeah.

639
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,325
That...

640
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,455
and I really miss hanging out with my son.

641
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,808
I'm sorry, jim.You didn't ask for this.

642
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,245
If you ever want to talk about it...

643
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,933
that's charlie.

644
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,144
You look very happy.

645
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,689
We were.

646
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,508
For 12 long years.

647
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:09,231
We're ready.We got 13 seconds.

648
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,409
Smile.

649
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:17,200
And then one day he stopped at an atm.

650
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,593
He got robbed and...

651
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:24,416
god, I hate crying when I'm trying to make a point.

652
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,713
That's all right.

653
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,769
They got into a big argument the night before.

654
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,668
Ned just wanted to get his allowance early

655
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:34,595
so he could buy this game.

656
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,926
Charlie told him he'd have to wait.

657
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,715
So, ned called him an asshat.

658
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,951
Is that even a word?

659
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:43,442
I don't really know.

660
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,348
So, we grounded him more on principle than anything else.

661
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:51,747
And charlie was gonna let him off the hook the next day, but...

662
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:54,619
he never came home.

663
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:59,471
That's why I want to celebrat his birthday every year--

664
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,193
so that...

665
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:06,030
ned can remember all the good things about his dad.

666
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:14,904
Hey, kid--you and me.Let's talk.

667
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:15,588
Uh-oh.

668
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,453
What makes you say that?

669
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:18,490
You coming to me,

670
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,668
out of the blue?

671
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:20,768
I know what comes next,

672
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:22,083
you threaten me to stay quiet.

673
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:25,669
Well, it's a good thing I left the pliers back in the van.

674
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,366
Listen, my wife tells me sometimes

675
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,923
you used to see your dad after he died.

676
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,331
Sit down.

677
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:40,998
I was on pretty bad terms when my dad died.

678
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,292
And after I just kicked myself for not saying...

679
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,604
all the things I wanted to.

680
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:52,981
But then melinda told me something that really helped.

681
00:32:52,982 --> 00:32:54,900
She didn't see my dad anywhere.

682
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,021
That's a good thing?

683
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:57,201
That's a great thing.

684
00:32:57,202 --> 00:33:00,112
'Cause it meant that he crossed over, you know.

685
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,160
Into the light.

686
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,579
What is that, heaven?

687
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,928
I think it's a place the dead go to be at peace.

688
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,031
And they only go there

689
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:13,292
when the people they've left behind are ok.

690
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:17,828
My dad isn't here anymore, is he?

691
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,372
-- You got a phone?
-- Yeah.

692
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:32,034
This is my cell.

693
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,506
You want to talk to me about guy stuff,

694
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:36,406
I'm a phone call away.

695
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,012
This is how it works.

696
00:33:38,387 --> 00:33:41,898
We don't tell anybody about what melinda can do, ok?

697
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:44,216
I'll keep any secret you want.

698
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:45,777
You keep this one.

699
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:47,185
deal?

700
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,007
All right.I gotta go to work.

701
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:56,037
Clancy.

702
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:57,493
Can I come?

703
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:10,233
How long has jared been doing this to you?

704
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,575
I don't know.

705
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,518
When the doctor said I was dying,

706
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,622
I tried to reach out to brandon.

707
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:18,390
Tell him I was sorry.

708
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:20,720
I--I was so scared.

709
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:23,730
After the way I treated him.

710
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:25,991
Is that why you stayed behind?

711
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:28,165
To apologize?

712
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:29,356
No.

713
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:32,860
Something in my life was unfinished.

714
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:35,609
I thought it was my symphony.

715
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,321
And then I saw my son perform.

716
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:42,662
He was beautiful.

717
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,809
I couldn't believe it.

718
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:50,159
Couldn't believe that I had never let myself...

719
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,953
see him.

720
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:57,064
He kept on getting in the way.

721
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,369
-- Jared.
-- Yes.

722
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:03,115
From the beginning it was him destroying brandon's playing.

723
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:06,042
But every time I try to stop him,

724
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,619
he drains me.

725
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,905
I think jared is using you.

726
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:12,116
The sadness over what you lost with brandon,

727
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:13,469
it's only making him stronger.

728
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,929
You have to fight him.

729
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,430
I can'T.

730
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:19,796
I've got nothing left.

731
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:52,140
You know I've been searching for this demo for years?

732
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:54,420
And look at that--you lead me right to it.

733
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,145
No. Wait!

734
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,429
You don't want brandon to play the song.I get it.

735
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:04,606
There's a better way,jared.

736
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,894
Oh, you mean your little peace, love and understanding white light?

737
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:08,443
Yeah. I've seen it.

738
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:12,775
What you don't get is that I can do what every rock star dreams of now.

739
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:14,500
I can make people tremble.

740
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,602
I can make the earth move.

741
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:18,616
Why get in brandon's way?

742
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,520
I made brandon who he is.

743
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,509
And I can take it away.

744
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,200
What do you have on your side?

745
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:26,611
Puppy dogs and rainbows?

746
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,924
Brandon's dad means nothing to me.

747
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:31,894
And neither do you.

748
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,591
I'm not crossing over.

749
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,059
Ever!

750
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:42,456
I don't understand why you're asking me to do this.

751
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:45,479
My dad is not going to let me play my music.

752
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:50,849
You see?

753
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:53,616
Your father isn't the one that's been getting in your way.

754
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,575
It's jared.

755
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:56,545
He wouldn't do that.

756
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:57,567
Yes, he would.

757
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:00,566
He was jealous about the song you wrote for sandy.

758
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,205
I destroyed that song.

759
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,250
That wasn't good enough.

760
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:07,324
He was threatened by how good you are.

761
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,980
And the person who wasn't was your father.

762
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:15,381
Tell him the first song was inspired,

763
00:37:15,637 --> 00:37:17,736
glenn gould-esque.

764
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:22,216
He said the first song on your cd was like glenn gould.

765
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,418
He...listened to my music?

766
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:26,934
Yes.

767
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,582
Why couldn't he tell me that when he was alive?

768
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,067
Because he hated you.

769
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,449
Brandon, your father wants to help you.

770
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,452
He wants you to sing sandy's song

771
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,779
and everything else you've ever written.

772
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,301
Maybe this will help.

773
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,381
What happened?!

774
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,367
It's jared.He's hurting your father.

775
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:24,054
You can't just keep doing this.

776
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:25,595
Want to bet?

777
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,700
Is that it?

778
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,233
You can break all the strings you want, man.

779
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,786
No one is going to stop me from playing anymore.

780
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:22,719
* Don't lie and say that it's ok *

781
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:39,021
* it's all right if there's nothing more to say  *

782
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:46,023
* so I'm running away*
-- what does that mean?

783
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,823
That light?

784
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:51,691
It means you're ready to cross over.

785
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:57,314
He's gonna be all right.

786
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:01,180
Yes.

787
00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:16,256
* And faster than you can follow me *

788
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:20,495
* follow me to this place I wish *

789
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,833
I just wish I didn't have to go.

790
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:27,328
Not now.

791
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:32,522
Not just yet.

792
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:39,498
it's time.

793
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,733
Thank you.

794
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:58,122
* And I wanna hear your reasons wanna hear you tell me *

795
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:05,146
* why I should stay try *

796
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:08,867
* try to understand me *

797
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:12,863
* try to understand what I say*

798
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:17,761
* when I say can't stay *

799
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:25,228
* I'm ...I'm moving off of this place  leaving and I won't quit *

800
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:30,093
* I'm running away *

801
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:35,739
* I'm running away *

802
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,882
* I'm leaving this place *

803
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:58,185
So, how do you think the reunion tour went?

804
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:00,932
Ohh, if there was a t-shirt,I would have bought it.

805
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,283
Uh, give me a second.

806
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:09,925
I have to talk to somebody.

807
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:16,168
You'll be ok?

808
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:17,686
Yeah. Trust me.

809
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:19,906
He can't hurt anybody anymore.

810
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:22,870
-- I'll be over there.
-- Ok.

811
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:33,909
Just because you can sing a few songs,

812
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,794
doesn't mean anything.

813
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,359
Doesn't mean you'll make it.

814
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,469
Maybe he doesn't need to make it.

815
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:42,988
Maybe he just needs to play.

816
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,145
Look, I know how angry you are right now.

817
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,018
But if you'll let me,I can help you cross over.

818
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:52,271
Think you're the only afterlife game in town?

819
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,883
There are others around here--

820
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:58,444
people who are dying to meet me.

821
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:01,311
Those other spirits,they will promise you anything.

822
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:02,914
They're all lying.

823
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:06,430
No worse than the usual rock and roll swindle.

824
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:14,450
Be seeing you.
