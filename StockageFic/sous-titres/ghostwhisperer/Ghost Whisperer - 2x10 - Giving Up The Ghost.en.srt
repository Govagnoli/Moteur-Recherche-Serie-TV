1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,900
My name is melinda gordon.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,250
I'm married,I live
in a small town,

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,880
and I own an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,740
I might be just like you,

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,910
except that from the
time I was a little girl,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,880
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,560
It's all right,honey.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,020
Earthbound spirits,my
grandmother called them.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,320
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,200
and they come to me for help.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,660
In order to tell you my story,

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,440
I have to tell you theirs.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,620
thank godness Unbelievable.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,190
Isn't that what
he's supposed to do?

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,610
In one game?

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,910
It's very good.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,240
All right. What do I know?
I played field hockey.

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,570
You know,maybe it's not
too late for me to go pro.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,010
I was a great third baseman.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,280
Hey,I didn't know that you
played baseball in high school.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,870
I didn'T. Little league.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,410
I played a lot of years,though,huh?

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,970
You know,I was 12 when I
hit my first home run.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,900
I can still remember the
pitch. It was a low fastball.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,910
It was right over the middle
of the plate,and I golfed it,

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
you know,right over
the center field fence.

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,360
Nice.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,420
I can still hear my
parents screaming.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,790
You know what? I would've
loved to have seen that.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,730
You can,actually.
My dad took a video.

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,070
Oh,I so want to see that.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
No. No.

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,510
Let's do that again.

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,180
That was incredible.

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,690
Wait. We have to find out if
your mom still has the videotape

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,520
of you getting your
first home run.

37
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,890
Oh,she's got it.

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,060
I swear,sometimes
when I call her,

39
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,960
I can hear it playing
in the background.

40
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,780
What I want to know is,does
she still have my baseball cards?

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,420
wait here

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,410
Hey,sorry. I'm an emt.

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,340
Are you all right?

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,880
Yes. I think so.

48
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,350
collapse on the field exactly caused problems

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,540
he didn't lose consciousness

50
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,730
he's awake, responsive

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,080
- How is he?
- Well,he's a little woozy.

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,650
There's no sign of trauma,
and his nose stopped bleeding.

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,750
We should go to the hospital.

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,170
Why? He's up. He's talking.

55
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,800
I did everything I could.

56
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,750
Yeah,but I haven'T.

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,940
So,the stadium lights,was
that some kind of warning?

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,280
Felt like it.

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,960
if you see a ghost
in here,tell me.

60
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,540
How? There's gonna be people around.

61
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,520
Just give me a signal.

62
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,240
Like what? You want me to whistle?

63
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,080
No,like a baseball signal.

64
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,430
See,the first two mean nothing.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
This,hit and run.

66
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,960
Oh,don't tempt me.

67
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,450
I really,all I want to know is how the
ghosts are affecting people,you know?

68
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,290
So,just do something simple.

69
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,680
Ok.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
what's that a sign for?

71
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,540
All right.

72
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,900
Hi,coach.

73
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,790
Don't mean to bother you.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,990
We just thought we'd stop
by and see if justin is ok.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,910
We're still waiting.

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,840
Sorry we didn't get a chance
to meet back at the school.

77
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,990
It was a little crazy.I'm john heath.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
Jim clancy.It's my wife melinda.

79
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm justin's mom tracy.

80
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,990
Thank you so much for your help.

81
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,690
It was really scary.

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,030
I think I'm still shaking.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,790
I'm sure he'll be ok.

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,620
I hope so. He worked
so hard for this.

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,470
Excuse me. I think I'm
gonna go check again.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,090
I hate this waiting.

87
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,460
Hey,how was he when
they brought him in?

88
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,360
Much better.He was telling
everybody he wanted to go home.

89
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,940
I had to tell him to shut up and
get his butt back in the room.

90
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,150
Is his dad in there with him?

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,350
No.His dad passed away.

92
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,630
That's too bad.

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,600
It's too bad he can't
see what his son is doing.

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,680
He's doing very well.

95
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,730
Hey,is this the first year
you're coaching at grandview?

96
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,180
Second.I was in chicago before.

97
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,450
When I got a chance to come
back home,I jumped at it.

98
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,340
I was born and raised
right here in grandview.

99
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,130
There they are.

100
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,580
there's nothing wrong with me.
They didn't find anything,ok?

101
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
The tests are negative.

102
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,920
Probably was a sudden
drop of blood pressure,

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,780
maybe brought on by the
exertion of the game.

104
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,290
Just take it easy for a day.

105
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,980
Thank you,doctor.

106
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,890
- You sure you're all right?
- He'll be good.

107
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,840
Thanks a lot.

108
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,270
So,what,no ghost?

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,110
Just give me a signal.

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,020
I signaled you 5 times,
this whole thing.

111
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,680
- What's that?
- This is the signal.

112
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,980
What is it that you wanted me to do,

113
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,200
give you a sign before the sign?

114
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,090
How about I sing "some enchanted evening"
or do a cartwheel down the hall

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,120
because you wouldn't have missed that.

116
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,910
Ok.I'm sorry.

117
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,780
Well,was he with anybody?

118
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,120
I don't know. He was
all over the place,

119
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,240
but when he saw the
coach,he was mad.

120
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,280
So,you think the ghost is
attached to the coach.

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,010
Well,maybe,but I don't think
justin collapsed from exhaustion.

122
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,460
That's why they couldn't
find anything wrong.

123
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,630
No medical report is
gonna pick out a ghost.

124
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,880
you all right?

125
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,760
How do I explain 3 broken
windows to our insurance agent?

126
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,900
It's vandalism.

127
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,490
Let's just hope they don't ask
whether the vandal is dead or alive.

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,900
You know,it's times like
this I wish I could see them.

129
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,970
Why?

130
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,220
"Why?" So I could
say,"look,pal.

131
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,220
What the hell do you
think you were doing?

132
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,600
Confrontation,not the best
way to deal with the dead.

133
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,970
Well,he's got no trouble
confronting you or us.

134
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,970
He just feels threatened.

135
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,570
What,he breaks our windows,
and he feels threatened?

136
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,010
You know,look.

137
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,250
This is what I'm
talking about.

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,620
It's frustrating when the
dead can do more than I can.

139
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,850
This ghost wants to hurt justin
or the coach,I don't know.

140
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,960
But what I do know is that he's mad as hell
and he doesn't want me messing with him.

141
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,350
And he wants to raise our deductible.

142
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,300
Ok.Now I know two things.

143
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,250
I just wish I could do more.

144
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,330
You do a lot,and
this ghost...well,

145
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,100
he can't do what you're
thinking about right now.

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,670
Works for me.

147
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,300
it was made about 1940.

148
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,910
You turn the switch once,
and the lamp comes on,

149
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,950
and then you turn it again,
and the skirt moves

150
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
and makes it look like
she's hula dancing.

151
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,750
Thanks.

152
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,150
I guess everyone in town
is cleaning out their closets.

153
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,660
Well,it's for a good cause.

154
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,320
I actually found stuff I thought
I gave away a long time ago.

155
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,560
Hey,you going to the game tonight?

156
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,620
Are you kidding me?

157
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,060
Jim would rather miss his own
funeral than the big playoff game.

158
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,250
Well,you better get there early
because everybody I know is going.

159
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,680
I'll see you at the game.

160
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,300
All right,but whoever gets
there first has to save seats.

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,280
PLAYERS & COACHES  ONLY

162
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,090
You ok,lady?

163
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,590
Wait,wait.You think grandview
high school is haunted?

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,940
It is a high school,and I know a few unresolved
issues that would keep me from crossing over,jim.

165
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,080
But you didn't actually
see a ghost there,did you?

166
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,730
No,not yet,but I think there was a ghost
there that definitely wanted me to stay away.

167
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,720
Sorry about that.

168
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,810
There's got to be a rational
explanation,you know--

169
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,500
sewage gas,mutant cockroaches.

170
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,990
If I ever see a mutant cockroach,
you have to deal with it.

171
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah. I'm your man.

172
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
You don't think
we're all like that?

173
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,690
Yeah,but I'm only 60 feet away.

174
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,130
At least you're in left field.

175
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,050
How you doing?

176
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,350
What did you want with him?

177
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,480
"Him"?

178
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,550
Justin...

179
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,380
stay away from him.

180
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,400
I know who you are-- matt vonner.

181
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,310
No !

182
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,080
justin,don't do this.

183
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,300
Matt...

184
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,150
no.

185
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,500
Who are you?

186
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,590
Justin,what the
hell are you doing?

187
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,590
Stay out of this.

188
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,380
I want to know
what was going on.

189
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,620
She broke it,ok?

190
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,690
Get off me.

191
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,280
Don't you walk away.

192
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,340
You know,just keep her away from me.

193
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,570
You stop right now,or you're gonna
be on the bench for saturday's game.

194
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,250
You know,I'm the only
reason we're in the playoffs,

195
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,930
and you know that.

196
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,360
If I don't play,you'll lose.

197
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,260
Watch your mouth,kid.

198
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,590
You know,I made it,jackie boy,

199
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,290
and you didn't,

200
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,410
but you never were good enough,

201
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,570
and you know that.

202
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,210
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.I'm fine.

203
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,490
I saw what happened.I understand
if you want to press charges.

204
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,590
I don'T. He wasn't himself.

205
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,990
Look.I'm gonna have to report this.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,830
I don't know what's going
on with him lately,

207
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,690
but he's out of control.

208
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,110
I need to know what happened.

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,070
I don't know. It all
happened so fast.

210
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,310
It was probably
something I said to him.

211
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,210
Look.I don't care what kind
of pressure a kid is under.

212
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,760
There is no excuse for this.

213
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,200
You know,I really
have to think about this.

214
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,210
I'm sorry.I have to go.

215
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,260
Got a buyer for
the fishing lures.

216
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,420
That's the crazy crawler,
made by heddon in 1944.

217
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,160
The other one is the wotta
frog,made by paw paw in 1942.

218
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,060
Who's it for?

219
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,690
My husband.
He's a collector.

220
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,110
Oh,well,if you really
want to be a hero,

221
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,330
the vampire.

222
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,380
It's extremely rare,made in 1924.

223
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,250
No. I'm sorry--1923.

224
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,380
Oh,my goodness,I am never
bringing my husband in here.

225
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,570
You are the wife
he always dreamed of,

226
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,010
and I kept telling
him you don't exist.

227
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,130
Mel,look. I just
heard what happened.

228
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,230
I'm trying to stay calm.

229
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
- Ok,jim.
- No

230
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,620
but I'm gonna
tear his head off.

231
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,040
Jim!

232
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,120
Back room,please.

233
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,460
Thanks.

234
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,840
It wasn't justin.
It was matt vonner.

235
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,370
Well,who the hell is matt vonner?

236
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,920
All right.So,it's matt vonner.
I'll tear his head off.

237
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,650
Too late.He's already
dead.He's the ghost.

238
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,500
Matt vonner the baseball player?

239
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,890
Yeah.He was the one that I
saw at the game the other night.

240
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,340
He was also there today.

241
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,720
He's haunting justin,
not the coach,

242
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,830
and justin has no idea
what happened to him.

243
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,310
All right.Then the question is,
if I punch justin hard enough,

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,350
will matt vonner
the ghost feel it?

245
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,510
You're not helping.

246
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,090
Honey,just tell me first,ok,

247
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,730
so I don't hear it
from bob at the station,

248
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,280
who heard it from his brother harry,who
heard it from his kid who plays catcher.

249
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,520
What?

250
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,880
Ok.My bad,but when I
realized who the ghost was.

251
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,150
Matt vonner.

252
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,440
Graduated from grandview in '90.

253
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,370
And signed with the
chicago cubs the same year.

254
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,220
He spent a year in the minor leagues,
then got traded to the white sox.

255
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,810
He won rookie of the year and came in
second for the sid young award 3 times.

256
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,250
- "Sid"?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,610
That's an award they
give out for pitching,

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,940
and you thought i didn't know
anything about baseball.

259
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,360
Cy.

260
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,220
Cy young.He was an old
pitcher a long time ago.

261
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh,sid,cy,whatever.

262
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,390
You know,I remember
reading about this guy.

263
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,090
Now,he was amazing,and
then he just went downhill.

264
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,170
I don't know what happened.

265
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,430
It was drugs or
gambling or something.

266
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,600
Wow,I remember how surprised
people were.He just fell apart,

267
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,300
but why would he
want to haunt justin?

268
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't know.

269
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,870
You know,justin has
been recruited by,like,

270
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,350
5 major league teams,I mean,the a's,
the yankees,the red sox,the braves.

271
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,830
Maybe he wants to hurt justin
so justin can't make the bigs.

272
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,120
- "Bigs"?
- Majors.

273
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:20,920
Makes sense.

274
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,380
That is a possibility,
but either way,

275
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,220
I have to let justin know
what's happening to him.

276
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,740
All right,but with
me this time,ok?

277
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,190
Oh,I'm so sorry.

278
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,740
Do we have any noguchi lamps?

279
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,260
Duty calls.

280
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,610
We will talk some more about
the mutant cockroaches later.

281
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,820
Yeah,and I'll get you
that chemical bug spray.

282
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,830
Great.

283
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,790
You guys have your own code.

284
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,610
That's so cute.

285
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,460
My mom saved the video...

286
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,540
All 14 hours.

287
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,020
Ready for a jim marathon?

288
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,380
Is that really you?

289
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,280
Come on.Can't you tell?

290
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,310
Look at the pecs.
That kid is cut.

291
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,090
What is all this?

292
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,730
My mother is the greatest
living human being on earth.

293
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,450
She saved all my baseball stuff,

294
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,280
everything,and
look at this.

295
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,090
These are the cards..

296
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,510
my dad collected
when he was a kid.

297
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,540
I mean,look at these names--

298
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,250
mantle,mays,koufax,clemente.

299
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,060
That's reggie jackson.

300
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,240
I saw him play once.
My dad took me.

301
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,840
We had seats right
behind home plate.

302
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,150
That day,reggie hit 4
home runs.It's the truth.

303
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,120
That was the last game my dad
and I ever went to together.

304
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,420
It's weird.

305
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,730
Here it is.

306
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,540
I think I hit a double
here in this one.

307
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,080
Maybe it's the next pitch.

308
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,500
Now I know why they
call it a double.

309
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,880
Came here-- came here
to say I'm sorry.

310
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,430
I don't know why
I did what I did.

311
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
Come in.

312
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,560
You got to be kidding me.

313
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,030
You come into our house?

314
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,010
Jim...

315
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,480
I said I was sorry.

316
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,690
I feel really bad about it.

317
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,940
I just need to talk to you.

318
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,720
I need to talk to you,too.

319
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,210
Can you get us some drinks?

320
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,020
Yeah.

321
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,200
Hey,I'll be in the kitchen,
you know,the next room.

322
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,010
Did your coach ask
you to come here?

323
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,690
No,my mom.

324
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,100
Coach suspended me.

325
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,740
I need you to talk to him for me.

326
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,510
I can't be suspended,

327
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,830
and none of this is
what you think it is.

328
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,750
I don't take anything--

329
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,210
no drugs,nothing.

330
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,410
I know I get nosebleeds,
which is,like,a sign of it,

331
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,440
I know,but I'm not on anything.

332
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,650
I work my ass off every day.
I've been doing this since I was 5,

333
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,520
and everybody thinks
that I'm on something,

334
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,240
but I'm not. I
mean,we get tested.

335
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,440
Look. I'm not the
steroid police.

336
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,400
Well,isn't that why you've
been following me around?

337
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,370
You've got a different problem.

338
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,460
Ok.You don't understand.

339
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,680
This is all I've
ever wanted to do.

340
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,950
It's the one thing I've
always been good at.

341
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,740
It's the only thing that's
made my dad proud of me.

342
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,050
What happens when you go
out to play on the field,

343
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,720
when you start to pitch?
Do you feel anything different?

344
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,940
Um, I don't know.
I just--

345
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,150
I feel like I can't lose.
I feel stronger.

346
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,290
It's kind of hard to describe.

347
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,940
Do you know who matt vonner is?

348
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,360
Of course, yeah.Everybody does.

349
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,420
When you're out on
that field, it's him.

350
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,020
What?I don't know what you
mean. Matt vonner is dead.

351
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,860
Justin, it's his spirit.

352
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,040
A ghost?You're telling me that there's
a ghost out on the field  with me?

353
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,050
No,not with you. In you.

354
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,840
That's why you've been having
the nosebleeds.He's using you.

355
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,950
When I'm pitching.
That's what you think.

356
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,550
It doesn't mean that you're not good, but
he is controlling you when you're out there.

357
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,040
- You're lying.
- No,I'm not,and you know it.

358
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,990
Deep inside,you know it.
We have to get d of him.

359
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,560
No.It is me out there.

360
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,630
It's not him.It's not
anything else. It's me.

361
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,880
He's gonna hurt you.

362
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,350
Even if what you say is
true, he's making me great.

363
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,560
Do you think I want to give that
up? Do you think I can give that up?

364
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,930
I am better than I've ever been,

365
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,110
and even if I knew  how to
change that, I wouldn't want to.

366
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,780
Justin... justin!

367
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,460
Leave him alone.

368
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,770
Mel?

369
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm gonna win again.
I'm gonna be great again.

370
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,610
Justin is  the best player
to come through here since me.

371
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,380
I'm taking him  all the way.

372
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,180
Justin isn't playing.
Is that what you want?

373
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,800
The coach? That's the son
of a bitch who killed me.

374
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,590
He killed me!

375
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,540
Melinda.

376
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,640
- You ok?
- Yeah. You?

377
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,810
They reversed your decision?
How can they do that?

378
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,810
They're  the school
board. It's what they do.

379
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,440
They do what they want,
and they didn't reverse it.

380
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,970
They just won't approve my decision
until they review the charges next week,

381
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,080
which really just means they're gonna make sure
justin pitches in saturday's championship game.

382
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,810
Does justin know that?

383
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,420
Eh, beats me.

384
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,170
I'm not the coach anymore.

385
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,160
What?

386
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,450
I told them if justin played,
I wouldn't coach.They agreed.

387
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,970
Oh, I'm so sorry.

388
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,390
That's ok.

389
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,340
Not as much fun  as
it used to be, anyway.

390
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,290
Used to be about playing.
Now it's about winning.

391
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,860
I don't know what's
happened to justin.

392
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,920
I mean, he was
like my own kid.

393
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,930
Every day, I
would work with him,

394
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,520
and now,the last 4 months, it's like
I don't even know who he is anymore.

395
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,760
Hey, I wonder what
happened to coach.

396
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,090
I hear he got fired.

397
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
Anybody know why?

398
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,580
Maybe he made
a bad decision.

399
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,890
You're the one that
shouldn't be out there.

400
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,720
Then why don't you
do something about it?

401
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,350
Hey! Watch out.

402
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,410
Why?

403
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,420
None of us want to go
out there if he pitches.

404
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,240
Why don't you tell us how
the coach got fired,justin?

405
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,860
Hey,hey,hey,
cut it out.

406
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,760
Back it up. Break itP.

407
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,040
Move back.

408
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,920
Justin, take a walk.

409
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,500
What the hell
happened to you, man?

410
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,930
I need to talk to
you about something,

411
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,190
someone.

412
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,410
Someone I know?

413
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,790
Matt vonner.

414
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,290
Well,we grew up together,
played on the same teams,

415
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,820
but matt was always the big deal,

416
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,490
a lot like justin is now.

417
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,030
Were you with him when he died?

418
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah. Why?

419
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,120
He blames you.

420
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
What do you mean?

421
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,650
He says  you killed him.

422
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,220
He says I killed him?

423
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,880
Look.It was matt that
grabbed me that day at school,

424
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,890
not justin.

425
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,750
Ok.You're gonna have to
catch me up a little here.

426
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,880
You saw matt vonner?

427
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
Yes.

428
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,110
You know he's dead.

429
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,120
I know  how it sounds,

430
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,270
but matt's spirit is still here,
and that's why justin is pitching so well,

431
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,300
and he knows it.

432
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,570
You know what's weird?

433
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,580
What?

434
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,110
He's been in my
dreams lately, matt,

435
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,730
and the accident.

436
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,050
Tell me what  happened that night.

437
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,510
We both got drafted the same
year right out of high school.

438
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,730
Matt went straight to the bigs,
and I spent 8 years in the minors.

439
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,310
Then one day,
I got called up.

440
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,770
I was beyond excited,

441
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,410
playing in the bigs
alongside my best friend.

442
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,540
Flew into chicago.

443
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,470
Took a cab ride over to his place.

444
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,980
I mean,he wanted to be the one
to bring me to my first game,

445
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,820
and he had a lot
of problems by then,

446
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,140
but he was ready
for his comeback.

447
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,040
Then on the ride
over to the stadium...

448
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,400
- I'm going to the bigs.
- You're going to the show,baby.

449
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,150
You're  going to the show.

450
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,160
Look out!

451
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,250
Matt was killed,

452
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,940
and that was the end
of it for me, too.

453
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,570
If this is real,

454
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,880
why would he  be doing this?

455
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,050
I think that he's trying to give
himself another chance by using justin.

456
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,310
It's like you said.
Everything is about winning,

457
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,450
even in death.

458
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,390
I don't really believe
in anything too much.

459
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,010
I pray when I get  on the
plane-- that's about it--

460
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,600
but if matt really is still here
and he's doing this to justin,

461
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
he's messing up a good kid.

462
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,100
Tell me  what I need to do.

463
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,830
Can you  talk to justin? He's
afraid that he'll fail without matt.

464
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,580
This is the biggest
game of his entire life.

465
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,690
He's got scouts from 6 different
major league teams looking at him.

466
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,930
I mean, what am I gonna
tell him, "don't pitch"?

467
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,070
Well, then maybe you
should talk to matt.

468
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,260
Justin.

469
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,110
What are you  doing here?

470
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,580
I want you to tell me what
happens when  you come out here.

471
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,820
We're trying to figure
out what's happening.

472
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,190
You believe her?

473
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,740
Justin, you
can stop this.

474
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,480
You know, I'm sorry
about what happened to you,

475
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,150
but that's your fault,not mine.

476
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,680
She shouldn't have come near me.
I have nothing to do with her.

477
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,520
He's behind you.

478
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,160
Justin, don't let him--

479
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,680
Matt, don't do this.

480
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,520
my god.

481
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,590
Jackie boy.

482
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,990
You know,I really wish you
were catching for me tonight.

483
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,170
Be like old times.
You're too old now,man.

484
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,260
You're not gonna  pitch tonight.

485
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm not gonna
let it happen.

486
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,100
just get away
from him. Go.

487
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,680
You're gonna ruin him just
like you ruined yourself.

488
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,640
run Justin Run

489
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,350
Where the hell is he?

490
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,350
To your right.

491
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,110
I'm gonna tell you something
I should've told you 10 years ago.

492
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,210
You were a damn good  pitcher, matt,

493
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,350
but you weren't th much
better than anyone else.

494
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,900
You just thought you were because
of what you did to yourself.

495
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,930
I remember that one
game when you shot up.

496
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,470
We were right here in grandview.

497
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,900
Said it was just once,just to see
if it would  help give you an edge,

498
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,420
get us  into the playoffs,
and you got us in,I guess,

499
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,810
but I never really
felt right about it.

500
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,190
I never felt like we
really won that game.

501
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,610
Everybody else  always remembers
what a great game it was.

502
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,920
Not me.

503
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,990
Then you'd jack yourself up
another time and another time,

504
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,980
and somewhere in there, you just--

505
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,400
you forgot how to play
the game without it.

506
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,900
You didn't just
kill yourself, matt.

507
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,350
You killed the game.

508
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,030
You can't talk
to me like this.

509
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,690
He's the reason  I'm dead.

510
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,820
He thinks that you're
responsiblemfor his death.

511
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,390
You're wrong,matt.
You were driving,not me.

512
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,150
You were so jacked up that night,
you didn't know  what was going on.

513
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't know what to say. It was
my first game, my big chance.

514
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,810
You don't know what it takes to
survive  up here.You don't know.

515
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,710
Ok. Fine. I don't know.

516
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,760
Thought I'd do you a favor by
giving you a ride to the game.

517
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,660
Matt, just drop it.

518
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,820
You want  to know something?

519
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,370
If it wasn't for me  asking for you,
they never would've  called you up.

520
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,100
What?

521
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,400
Yeah. I thought you'd be my good-luck
charm, you know, like the way it used to be,

522
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,770
but if you think you  can compete
in the bigs  without doing what I do,

523
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,460
you're gonna be catching washouts
in little rock by next weekend.

524
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,770
The last thing you said to me was,

525
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,060
"get with the
program, jackie boy,

526
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,390
or be happy riding pine.

527
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,860
No!

528
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,020
don't leave me here.

529
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,040
Don't leave me here.

530
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,860
He saved himself and left me to
die. Tell him I know what he did.

531
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,390
I'm not gonna
tell him that.

532
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,190
I tried to save
that son of a bitch.

533
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,420
It costs me my career.

534
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,920
Coach said he
tried to save you.

535
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
He's a liar.

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,160
Said it cost him  his career.

537
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,670
I saw something.

538
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,290
I remember something.

539
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,520
Because of what you were
on, you weren't clear.

540
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,860
You have to see what
really happened now, matt,

541
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,500
and you can do that now.

542
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,480
You can see what you did.

543
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,600
Don't leave me here.

544
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,500
Don't leave me here.

545
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,550
Come on. Come on.

546
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,090
Matt! Matt...

547
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,500
matt! Come on.

548
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,600
Ok.stday with me  no no No!

549
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,560
How could I not
have remembered that?

550
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,350
You were thinking only
of what happened to you.

551
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,770
You were so focused
on your own pain

552
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,570
that you couldn't even see your
friend was trying to save you.

553
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,640
- I was dying.
- You were dead,matt.

554
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,020
You denied everything
you did wrong.

555
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,650
He lost it all
because of me.

556
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,800
How do I change it?

557
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,640
The only thing you can
do now is make it right.

558
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,640
Coach doesn't want
anything from you,

559
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,780
and justin,the way you make it
right with him is by letting him go.

560
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,720
I hit him.

561
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,250
I hit coach.

562
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,470
No, you didn'T.

563
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,040
Yeah. I did. I felt it.
It was my hand.

564
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,180
I mean, he was
always there for me.

565
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,380
How could i
do that to him?

566
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,330
He knows that
it wasn't you,

567
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,260
that it was matt,

568
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,530
and matt is here
right now.

569
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,470
It's ok. He just
wants to talk.

570
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,210
Tell him  I was afraid, afraid
of not being  anyone anymore.

571
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,430
He wants you to know
that he was afraid.

572
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,960
I just wanted to play
the game again, to pitch again.

573
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,130
That's when I felt
the most alive.

574
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,530
That's why I used you.
You're even better than I was.

575
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,340
I wanted to be on top again.

576
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,460
He thinks you're better than he
was. That's why he used you.

577
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,740
But I've hurt enough
people, so I'm out of here.

578
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,150
You're on your own.

579
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,020
He's gonna
cross over.

580
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,060
He wants you to know
that you're on your own.

581
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,310
What if I can't do
this without him?

582
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,710
Tell him he
never needed me.

583
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,770
I needed you.

584
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,360
He says that you
never needed him.

585
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,730
He needed you.

586
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,860
He wants you to
trust what you know.

587
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,850
I'm not sure what
I know anymore.

588
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,080
Justin...

589
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,650
Trust him,

590
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,050
like I should have.
Let him guide you.

591
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,520
There's nobody better than him.

592
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,560
Trust him.

593
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,980
Need you to warm up.

594
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,620
I don't know if
I can play, coach.

595
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,200
I don't care if you walk
the first 10 batters.

596
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,010
I want you out
there. Come on.

597
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Batting eighth
and doing the catching

598
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,280
number 12,

599
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,540
and batting ninth,

600
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,910
doing the pitching--
number 21,

601
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,190
justin cotter.

602
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,570
where's matt?

603
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,970
I don't know. I don't
think he crossed over.

604
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,460
Having him pitch tonight might
not have been such a good idea.

605
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,190
I knew this would happen.
He thinks I'm out there.

606
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,760
He's mixed up.

607
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,670
He doesn't know the difference between
what I did to him and just being scared.

608
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,000
He's forgotten
how to be afraid.

609
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,090
Justin,

610
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,150
he's not out there.
He's right here.

611
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,590
I can't do this.

612
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,480
Stop thinking with your
head. Think with your arm.

613
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,090
He wants you to stop thinking with
your head. Think with your arm.

614
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,330
- Justin...
- what,man?

615
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm on your team.

616
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,720
We all are.

617
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,270
Yeah. Yeah.I'm sorry.

618
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,030
I'm ok.

619
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,910
Coach tells us you're
the reason he's back.

620
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,640
Osis  let's win this.

621
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,620
You know,

622
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,320
tell matt...

623
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,150
I'll do that.

624
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,550
again

625
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,410
Yeah. I see it.

626
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,870
Is that the light?

627
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,870
I can't see it. It's for you.

628
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,230
Do I just  walk into it?

629
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,370
Yeah.

630
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,690
Hey,do you think
the babe is in there

631
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,210
or mantle or cy young?

632
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,600
Sorry. I don't
have a program.

633
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,180
You know what?

634
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,400
I bet they are.

635
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,140
Hey, one more thing.

636
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,090
Tell jackie boy
I'm sorry

637
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,150
and tell justin,
"throw for the corners.

638
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,060
"  Is he here?

639
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,870
No. He crossed over,

640
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,700
but he wanted me to tell you
that he's sorry,

641
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,300
and tell justin to
throw for the corners.

642
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,800
That's what I always
used to tell him to do.

643
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,330
Play ball!

644
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,020
Hey, good luck.

645
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,720
So... justin pitching.

646
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,950
- Yeah.
- Got any help?

647
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,930
8 other players.

648
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,920
Come on,justin!

649
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,540
All right,kid.

650
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,940
All right,justin!

651
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,150
Throw for the corners.

652
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,730
Go, justin!

653
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,790
Oh, and  it's going,
going... gone.

654
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,270
Home run.

655
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,490
There he goes,
the proud champion.

656
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,210
My first and only home run.

657
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,800
Well, the inning isn't over yet.

658
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,140
Wait. There's a ghost in the house?

659
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,980
Never mind. No.
Do not follow me.

660
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,690
- Do not follow me.
- I'm following you.
