1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,120
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,059
Kate? Pick up.
Find your father, he's in danger.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,070
Oh! Dad, no. Daddy!

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,119
Nice plan, Custer.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,010
You can't go in uninvited.
You need us.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,469
It's not what I expected.
Doesn't fit anymore?

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,109
- You went too far.
- We're all...

8
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,450
- ...that's between you and darkness.
- You're all fired.

9
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,299
- For God's sake, help us.
- People are going to die.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,850
I just can't seem to care.

11
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,500
What I wouldn't give for
a roving band of Prechian demons now.

12
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,129
Without the ritualistic
slayings, of course.

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,969
Of course.

14
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,030
Something to fight. Good to be done.

15
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,469
A little action.

16
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,010
We could buy a star map...

17
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,400
...find out where Steven Seagal lives.

18
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,170
Think he got to be a star
without demonic help?

19
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,459
I say let things be quiet.

20
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,480
Quiet may be good for mankind,
but bad for business.

21
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,540
- We need to make a name for ourselves.
- We can't agree on one.

22
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,009
Unless you came around to--

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,159
- Nope.
- Give it up already.

24
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,830
New name or not, we need
to be out plying our trade.

25
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,659
Generating word of mouth.

26
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,009
We can't expect evil
to walk through the door.

27
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,210
- Can we help you?
- I'm looking for Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,259
- I'm Wesley.
- I'm Francine. My daughter, Stephanie.

29
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,789
- I'm Virginia's friend from the club.
- The country club.

30
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,219
One of Virginia's rich friends?

31
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,099
You certainly came to the right place.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,599
She says you specialize
in the strange.

33
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,009
The stranger the better,
as far as we're concerned.

34
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,310
Tell us the problem. Trust me,
we specialize in strange.

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,879
There's nothing we haven't see--

36
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,349
There's an eye in the back
of her head.

37
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,969
Something bit her after swim practice.

38
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:14,449
When she woke up, that was there.

39
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,030
Did you see who or what
did this to you?

40
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,300
It was dark. She doesn't remember.
She's been in shock since then.

41
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,330
I'll pay whatever it takes.
Can you fix it?

42
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,310
- Consider us already on it.
- You came to the right place.

43
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,789
- Who would do this?
- We'll find out, but it'll take time.

44
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,379
You'd be surprised how many
nasty things are out these days.

45
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,900
He's right behind us.

46
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,439
- Oh, God.
- We gotta move now.

47
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,460
Pass these out,
then get Eva to go into storage.

48
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:11,270
I bought a lot of sleeping bags
in case we got crowded.

49
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,310
Open up. Please? Open up.

50
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,490
- I know it's past curfew. Let us in.
- 10:00. You know the rules.

51
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,430
I know, but you can't leave us
out here. There's something--

52
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,870
- We gotta come in.
- We're full.

53
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,319
- There's no more beds.
- Please, we'll sleep on the floor.

54
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,389
Anne, don't make us go back out there.

55
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,399
- Hey, Merl.
- Jesus. Can't you, you know, knock?

56
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,139
You don't make that
funny expression when I knock.

57
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,420
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

58
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,029
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yes, I am. As in far, as in now.

59
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,230
Who's gonna tell me all
the fun facts about my friends?

60
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,620
Big meeting tomorrow,
top-level Wolfram & Hart brass.

61
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:46,680
I think it's a new demon account.
9:30, Diaghilev.

62
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:51,050
That concludes my career as
an informant. Consider it a freebie.

63
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,120
- Just like everything I've given you.
- 9:30?

64
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,769
Tomorrow. Good luck. Hope you
bust that evil law firm wide open.

65
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,089
- Why the rush to relocate?
- Well, let's see, there's...you.

66
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,959
And every crook and monstro
who thinks they can waltz in...

67
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,209
...and pound me for information.
Without paying.

68
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,180
At least that British guy understood
what a working relationship was.

69
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:22,680
Had some respect.
You only care about yourself.

70
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,019
- You're in no position to judge--
- How is old Wesley, huh?

71
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:32,490
Or the other two you fired?
They doing all right?

72
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,500
Gee, let me guess.
You never even bothered to check.

73
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,199
- This had better pan out.
- 9:30, at Diaghilev.

74
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,310
Pleasure doing business with you.

75
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,360
Make sure to get full names.
No tags or nicknames.

76
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't want new kids
to slip through the cracks.

77
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,839
- I was getting a vibe.
- Yeah?

78
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,699
- See if she's interested.
- Okay.

79
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,889
- Let me know.
- Kenny.

80
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,790
Can we talk for a sec?

81
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,810
How are you? It's been a while.

82
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,319
Fine. Crashing different places.
You know me and shelters.

83
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,220
Too many rules. I need my freedom.

84
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,839
- So why'd you come in last night?
- It was cold out.

85
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,529
- It was 65 degrees.
- I'm from Florida.

86
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,639
65 degrees is like the Arctic Circle.

87
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,529
Kenny.

88
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,789
Why'd you come in?

89
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,500
- Cops.
- What?

90
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Cops. They've been hassling everybody.
What else is new, right?

91
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,330
But these guys....

92
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,059
- We were hanging down on 39th--
- Panhandling?

93
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,950
No, washing my Mercedes.

94
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,820
This cop comes and hits me so hard,
I thought my teeth were coming out.

95
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,330
He hit you?

96
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,610
- What were you doing?
- Nothing, I swear.

97
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,960
After he punched me,
he threw Les into a wall.

98
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,490
Then he reached
for his nightstick, so we ran.

99
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,250
- He wasn't arresting you or--
- He just said, "No loitering"...

100
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,350
...slugged me in the mouth
and chased us for a couple of blocks.

101
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,620
- We got a big problem.
- Good luck solving it.

102
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,730
I mean, who you gonna call, the cops?

103
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,299
I know someone who can help.

104
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:45,809
Annie!

105
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,529
What's up, girl?

106
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,840
I ain't seen you in a minute.
Come here.

107
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,029
What brings you here?

108
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,129
I wanted to see how the other half
lives. Oddly, it's not that different.

109
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,980
Come on.

110
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:05,419
We like to think of it
as Early-American Dilapidation.

111
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,190
- Hi, I'm Cordelia.
- Anne.

112
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,440
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Nice to meet you.

113
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,799
Anne runs a teen shelter on Crenshaw.

114
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,570
- All this time and you still remember.
- I get it.

115
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,610
- I've been busy.
- If you're not too busy...

116
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,679
...can I run something by you?

117
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,159
Kenny's not the only one.
The others all say the same thing.

118
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,070
No provocation. No reason.
The cops are terrorizing them.

119
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,809
Renegade cops. Not exactly my usual.

120
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,519
Oh, that's right. You used to hunt--

121
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,799
- It's cool. They know what's what.
- What?

122
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,240
I still hunt vampires, but I've
learned there are worse things.

123
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,159
Like overzealous cops
beating on my kids.

124
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,789
Speaking of which,
I should really get back.

125
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,049
The shelter gets jammed after sunset.

126
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,750
I'll go with you.
It's not safe to be alone.

127
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,899
I'm going to the center
to see what's up.

128
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,740
And miss out on this exciting case?

129
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,250
- Wesley's friend got bit by a demon.
- Are they okay?

130
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,840
- For the most part.
- But she grew another eye in her head.

131
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,429
That sounds...handy.
What kind of demon does that?

132
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,049
We're trying to figure that out.
Then we'll de-oculate her.

133
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,340
- Just the one in the back.
- Ah, yes.

134
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,029
Angel Investigations, home
of the wicked, high-creep factor.

135
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,230
- Angel?
- Our company, after our former boss.

136
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,259
- We're changing it to the Gunn Agency.
- No, we're not.

137
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,490
- Once these narcissists get some sense.
- But, Angel, that--

138
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,600
Not the guy in the black trench coat?

139
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,629
- You know him?
- He tried to help me out a while ago.

140
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,080
- He did?
- Really?

141
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,759
But it was just a scam
to screw this law firm.

142
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,039
Well, he hasn't changed a bit.

143
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,639
Come on.

144
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,409
- Thanks.
- I got your back.

145
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,000
- I ain't been here in forever.
- It's been a while.

146
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,289
- The cops are tripping, G.
- Define "tripping."

147
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,789
Out for blood. Les got busted up.

148
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,009
The cops stopped me. He got his gun,
looking to put a cap in my ass.

149
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,509
It's outrageous.
They're gonna kill someone.

150
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,259
Could you give us a minute?

151
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,330
I have some paperwork I could do.

152
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,830
- You guys playing her?
- No way.

153
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,379
She's no fool but she has a
blind spot. She wants to trust you.

154
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,350
This ain't no scam. We're the victims.

155
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,889
Right. So, what was you doing
when the cop pulled his piece on you?

156
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,710
- Nothing.
- So I haven't seen you dealing on 5th?

157
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,870
- You telling me it wasn't you?
- It's history. I gave that up.

158
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,279
Do the cops know that?

159
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:52,460
It's not a street sweep the P.D. does
every six months to shut up the moms.

160
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:56,309
Okay? This is war.
And everyone's a target.

161
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,419
She speaks true, G. 100% true.

162
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,929
Keep your hands where I can see them.

163
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,850
Sorry, officer.
Have I done something wrong?

164
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,360
Turn around. Face the fence.
Put your hands on your head.

165
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,240
This is a mistake.

166
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,330
- You're under arrest.
- You don't want to do this.

167
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,220
You have the right to remain silent.

168
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,350
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

169
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,019
You have the right to an attorney.

170
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,220
Should you be unable to afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

171
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,659
Do you understand your rights as I...

172
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,240
...have....

173
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:26,580
Well, if it isn't Charles Gunn,
brother-at-large.

174
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,529
- Meet Rondell and George.
- Hi.

175
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,200
Greetings. I got the camcorder.
What's up?

176
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,379
A problem I promised we'd check.

177
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,039
- This about cops cracking skulls?
- You know about it?

178
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,870
- Who doesn't?
- I didn't.

179
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,009
- Someone could've told me.
- You weren't around.

180
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,730
You been moving on up, playing
demon detective with the new family.

181
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,669
- "Deluxe apartment in the sky."
- It's Christmas when you call.

182
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,169
Maybe I shouldn't have called.
You're free to go.

183
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,700
- We made the trip.
- Don't do me no favors.

184
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,509
I'm not. The favor's for these kids.

185
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:10,389
Now, you got a plan or don't you?

186
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,580
It's simple. You roll the camera
and wait for them to hassle us.

187
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:23,230
- How do you know they will?
- We'll be "walking while black."

188
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,389
Come on.

189
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,860
- Haven't seen you in a while.
- Been busy.

190
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,009
Yeah, me too.

191
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:57,090
Couple of open cases I'm working.
Two women killed in a clothing store.

192
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:01,789
Lawyers from Wolfram & Hart
slaughtered in a wine cellar.

193
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,990
- A real tragedy.
- You seem pretty broken up by it.

194
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,190
- We're still looking into this one.
- Good luck with that.

195
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,640
- Didn't find your vampire pals in time.
- I did set them on fire later.

196
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,549
Sounds like you enjoyed it. But
murder's always been up your alley.

197
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,559
I guess this isn't the best time
to tell you I just killed a cop.

198
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,400
I wouldn't joke about that,
even if you are immortal.

199
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:36,829
Of course, this is a cop that keeps
talking, even after decapitation.

200
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,589
They don't teach that at the academy.

201
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,420
Wanna tell me who it belonged to?

202
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,029
That's him.

203
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:56,460
- Officer Peter Harkes.
- Know him?

204
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,990
Well enough to be at his funeral
six months ago.

205
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,279
You wanna take a ride?

206
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:07,710
Yes, we can handle the eye thing
without you. That's not the point.

207
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,849
Just that maybe we should
back you up on this.

208
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,819
Because I don't want you to get hurt.

209
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,640
Of course I do, but--

210
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,160
Hello?

211
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,930
- Gunn's about to do a stupid thing.
- What did he say?

212
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,150
To find out if cops have been
brutalizing and killing people...

213
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,029
...he's gonna tape cops trying
to brutalize and kill him.

214
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,640
- You're joking.
- Nothing says "I'm onto you"...

215
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,900
- ...like getting a police beating.
- You couldn't stop him?

216
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,440
Hello! Gunn, stubborn: synonyms.

217
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,380
That can't be his plan, can it?

218
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,289
I mean, it's really a dumb plan.

219
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,779
Gunn majored in Dumb Planning
from Angel University.

220
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,109
He sat at the feet of the master
and learned well how to plan dumbly.

221
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:09,440
- We're gonna have to let him do this.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

222
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,670
- He wants help, he knows where we are.
- We'll work our gig, Gunn has his.

223
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,869
- Let's save him from himself.
- The third eye's not going anywhere.

224
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,029
That one.

225
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,980
- He never saw who shot him.
- Catch the killer?

226
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,539
He's no genius.
He's up for the death penalty.

227
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,809
He died six months ago?

228
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,700
- Around then.
- The ground's been disturbed.

229
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,359
- Someone's done some digging.
- How do you know?

230
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,460
A lot of cops buried here?

231
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,410
Yeah.

232
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,380
- How about him?
- Kevin worked Vice.

233
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:15,690
- What's going on?
- Dead cops are back on the street.

234
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,309
- What? How is that?
- Zombies.

235
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:24,049
Reanimated corpses that walk and talk.
Somebody else pulls their strings.

236
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,289
Is it--? My dad, is he...?

237
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,549
No.

238
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,230
- Ground's undisturbed.
- You sure?

239
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,589
I'm sure.

240
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,920
You okay?

241
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,849
Who's doing this?

242
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,660
Give Emma a hand in the kitchen.

243
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,269
- Sorry, no more-- What--?
- Is Gunn here?

244
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,740
No. He left a while ago. Why?

245
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,500
- Where was he going?
- 45th Street.

246
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,769
- I'll start there. I have my phone.
- Check in with me!

247
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,430
- Right.
- Looks like you could use some help.

248
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:35,329
My staff's too scared to come in.

249
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,839
- Where shall I start?
- How are your laundry-folding skills?

250
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm an actress. I can fake it.

251
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,220
Hey! That's my--

252
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,759
Sorry. I have a shirt just like that.

253
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,420
The girl at the store said it was
a one of a kind. Big fibber.

254
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:03,289
I'm all out of beds.

255
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,740
Come on, it's not safe
for man or beast out here.

256
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,150
I'm very sorry. But I really
don't have any free beds.

257
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,190
You don't have to worry about me.

258
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,940
I can find someone willing to share.

259
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,589
Oh, yes.

260
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,769
Plenty of candidates.

261
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,650
- I think it'd be best if you left.
- You should probably go.

262
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,470
This is a shelter, right?

263
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:36,490
It just so happens,
I'm in need of shelter tonight.

264
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,319
Hey! Hey!

265
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,200
Let him go. I don't want any trouble.

266
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,609
See y'all later.

267
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:48,670
Whoa! Watch out, man.

268
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,319
- Jackson.
- Lookie here.

269
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,519
You been ducking me lately, Ray?

270
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,680
- No? You think I'm pissed at you?
- I don't know.

271
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:03,460
You're shaking, Ray.
What you got to be nervous about?

272
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,279
You don't think
I'm gonna kill you, do you?

273
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,509
- Huh?
- No.

274
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:17,849
I'd never kill you here.
Not in front of all the pretty ladies.

275
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,170
You know I'd never kill you here.

276
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,269
I'll set up so they don't see it...

277
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,359
- ...or we can't Rodney King the cops.
- That's if we find any.

278
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,630
- Never had to look so hard for trouble.
- Look, 45th Street.

279
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,710
- So?
- This is gang ground.

280
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,640
They catch us, they'll take us out.

281
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,579
- Even cops don't come here.
- I said you're free to go.

282
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,430
I say I'm gonna do something,
I'm gonna do it.

283
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,269
Damn. Somebody have an apocalypse
and forget to invite us?

284
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,890
- What are you doing?
- Doing? Nothing. Taking a walk.

285
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,180
Hands on the wall, spread your feet.

286
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,440
You're arresting us?

287
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,240
- Do as you're instructed.
- I wanna know if we're being arrested.

288
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,720
- Turn around, face the wall. Now.
- I ain't arguing with you...

289
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,539
...but I'd like to know
what law we broke.

290
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,670
We should know if we broke one
so we don't repeat it.

291
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,930
I won't say it again.

292
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,579
Officer, wait! He's a friend of mine.

293
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,809
A very good friend.
I'm sure he hasn't committed any--

294
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,700
Wesley!

295
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,950
He's got another gun!

296
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,049
Oh, man! Oh, man!

297
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,140
- Let's get out of here.
- Get Wesley.

298
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,890
- Is anyone else cold?
- We'll take you someplace warm.

299
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,859
Help me pick him up! Come on!

300
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,299
Come on!

301
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:29,470
I shot him. I shot a cop.

302
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,589
- Not much choice.
- We gotta move!

303
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,839
I killed a policeman.
Look, he's dead!

304
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,569
- Don't look that dead.
- Let's go!

305
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,930
- We have a situation.
- Any loose ends?

306
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,369
We have witnesses. I need backup.

307
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,859
Hold up. I gotta try to
stop his bleeding. Go!

308
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,200
Around here.

309
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,640
Let him down. Easy! Take it easy!

310
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,910
911, you've got to call 911.

311
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:19,390
- Screw the cops. They did this to you.
- An ambulance.

312
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,579
Oh.

313
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,210
- All right, go down and keep watch.
- Okay.

314
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,490
- Tell them no sirens.
- 911,what is your emergency?

315
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,329
It's pretty quiet in here.

316
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,220
Can I help you?

317
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,059
I'm investigating complaints about
how officers handle things here.

318
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,400
Isn't that for Internal Affairs?

319
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,940
I'm taking a personal interest.

320
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,700
- Where is everyone?
- Only a few of us at the desk tonight.

321
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,470
Not a lot going on?

322
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:15,680
Crime's down in this precinct.
We do things right.

323
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,400
- Who takes credit for that?
- It's a team effort.

324
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,779
But the captain got the ball rolling.

325
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,750
- Can we talk to him?
- He's not here.

326
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,549
You can try again later.

327
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,640
This captain, is he
running things by the book?

328
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,230
I don't have to tell you
who used to rule the streets.

329
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,000
The scumbags did. Hell, I was
afraid to drive to work myself.

330
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,059
Oh, really?

331
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,680
We got a tougher policy.

332
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,509
- Ambulance ain't coming.
- Shut up before they hear you.

333
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,440
- I'm not doing very well.
- You'll be fine.

334
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,619
Getting shot like this?

335
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,710
I seen people shot worse than this,
never even slowed them down.

336
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:17,769
It's here!

337
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,920
Come on, hurry. Move!

338
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,970
Okay, one, two, three.

339
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,349
- Meet me at the shelter.
- All right.

340
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,380
Hey, I'm with him.

341
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,599
It's all right. We're almost there.

342
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,559
Something's going on here.
I'll go see what it is.

343
00:28:58,609 --> 00:28:59,980
Hey, let us through.

344
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,529
No! Don't!

345
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,470
Hey!

346
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,130
Hang on!

347
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,640
Stopping? What are you doing?

348
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,509
Trying to survive. Help me get
him inside. Come on, Wes.

349
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,789
- Here, take this.
- Come on, man, I got you.

350
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,720
Annie, open up! It's G!
Open up! Hurry!

351
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,670
- My God, what happened?
- They shot him.

352
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,309
- Who?
- The cops. They're not human.

353
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,420
All passengers are onboard.

354
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,910
- We have full containment,
- Wait for backup.

355
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,750
Secure the entire section.
Clean house.

356
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,079
He had no right.

357
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:40,559
I know, man.

358
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,880
Wesley.

359
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,670
- What can I do?
- Apply pressure to the wound.

360
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:51,680
Okay.

361
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,980
Good. Hang in there. It's okay.

362
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,490
- Are we safe?
- Lock all the doors.

363
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,890
Keep away from the windows!

364
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,670
You heard him. Let's go, come on!

365
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,539
Damn, that looks nasty.

366
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,339
Jackson?

367
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:15,750
What are you doing?

368
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,640
How do we keep the cops out?

369
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,549
I say let them come, bro.

370
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,509
I know how to handle cops.

371
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,930
That lifestyle working for you?

372
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,940
- Don't get all high and mighty.
- You don't bring down the community.

373
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:34,869
I'm just doing my thing.

374
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,279
Why does nobody care they're
clamping down on this neighborhood?

375
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,450
- Because they're racist pigs.
- That and people like you.

376
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,079
A thug with a gun,
keeping the cycle going.

377
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:51,990
- Not my problem.
- It's my problem! They shot my friend!

378
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,839
Yeah, a white man dying.
Not exactly losing sleep on him.

379
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:02,369
Hey, we can't afford this. Not now!

380
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,869
- All units in place,
- Go.

381
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,329
And keep it quiet, No gunfire,

382
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,440
- He's going south.
- No, come on.

383
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,980
What?

384
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,589
There's internal bleeding.
We gotta get him to St. John's, fast.

385
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,359
- We can't go back out there.
- He's going to die.

386
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:27,950
We're taking him to a hospital now!
I don't care who's out there!

387
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:31,700
Get the door.

388
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,750
- Where are we going?
- Hospital.

389
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,509
That sounds sensible.

390
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:53,650
They're here.

391
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,049
Use this bat.

392
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,730
Everything against the windows.
Move! Quick!

393
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,740
Okay, nail this shut.

394
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,670
Check the kitchen door.

395
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,869
Can I help you?

396
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,569
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.

397
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:47,250
- Who are you?
- Angel.

398
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,500
Well, Angel, if you need something,
someone downstairs will help you.

399
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,789
I need to talk to you.

400
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,029
- About what?
- About some of your more...

401
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,859
...dead cops.

402
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:11,099
Maybe we should talk
about you instead.

403
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:15,800
How do I stop them?

404
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,900
I'll repeat the question.

405
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,889
Move, people!

406
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,530
All circuits are busy,
Please try again,

407
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,809
This is no time for circuits busy!

408
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,230
If the circuits are busy,
get new ones now!

409
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,760
Push them up.

410
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,090
- How do I stop them?
- They're good cops.

411
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:02,440
They died on the streets!

412
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:06,110
- You should've left them.
- I won't betray them!

413
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,519
Okay, let's go!

414
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,329
Get the kids in the back, upstairs!

415
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,230
Gunn!

416
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,320
Gunn!

417
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,480
Help!

418
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,070
- Get out.
- How are you controlling them?

419
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,340
The entrails?

420
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,519
The door, it's giving!

421
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,920
Run!

422
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,699
It's the idol of Granath,
the zombie god.

423
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,539
No!

424
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:21,599
The kids.

425
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,469
Wesley!

426
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,110
Get the ambulance ready.

427
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,969
Help me pick him up.

428
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,769
Sorry. Looks like the streets
just got safer for me.

429
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,170
Time to go to work.

430
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:42,130
Let's go.

431
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,730
Come on, sweetie.

432
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,199
- Here we go.
- Okay.

433
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,000
I took care of our little cop problem.

434
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,710
Crime reports from that precinct.

435
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,050
There used to be
a murder every two weeks...

436
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,380
...a rape every two days,
a robbery every hour.

437
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,500
That's what we gave back
to the community.

438
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,690
I can live with that.

439
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,579
You learn to live with a lot.

440
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,880
This job is making me crazy.

441
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,690
I know the feeling.

442
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,050
For you, detective.

443
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,530
Thanks.

444
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:45,309
Wyndam-Pryce. Doesn't he work for you?

445
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,260
Hey.

446
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,809
- Hey.
- How you doing?

447
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,400
I feel I should be in pain.

448
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,940
A gunshot will do that to you.

449
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,130
And yet....

450
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,880
Is this morphine?

451
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,659
Well, it's bloody lovely.

452
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,539
What are you doing here?

453
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,980
I heard about Wesley.

454
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:06,760
Great. Too bad it takes a gunshot
wound to make you give a crap.

455
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,369
Wesley doesn't need you right now.

456
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,230
We don't need you.

457
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,960
You walked away. Do us
a favor and just stay away.

458
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,869
Thank you,
