1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,979
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,129
None of us are ready just yet.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,039
I don't want you to work for me.
I'll work for you.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,699
Careful with that hand.
You might lose it.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,219
- Isn't that right?
- There's worse things to lose.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,410
They want Angel alive,

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,320
Boo-hoo! Let me wipe my tears
with my plastic hand.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,500
If he won't play by the rules,
why should we?

9
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:58,579
SIG alerts on the 405, 101 and 60,

10
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,899
Better take a helicopter to work,

11
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,090
Your L.A. weather today is sunny,
bright and beautiful,

12
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,319
Am I a lucky guy or what?

13
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,269
I get to meet with the board
and get the quarterlies out.

14
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,959
- Morning, sweetie. Hungry?
- No time.

15
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,010
Oh, have a muffin.

16
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,430
Where's my sugar?

17
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,810
- A manly handshake, huh? Come here.
- Dad.

18
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,430
- We're late.
- I'll start the van.

19
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,990
Jesse, take your vitamins in the car.
Hayley, homework.

20
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,930
Come on, let's go.
Jesse, where are your books?

21
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,550
- I got them.
- And the vitamins.

22
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,620
I got them too. Just keep going.

23
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,169
Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late!

24
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,180
Cordelia. Cordelia! Cordy!
Get her some water.

25
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,110
What is it?

26
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,319
What'd you see?

27
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,360
- How about Western Pacific Power?
- There's threat of investigation.

28
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,139
That's why I was asking.
Where are we with them?

29
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,629
We can tie it up.
They won't miss a dividend.

30
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,110
They've already looted
3.5 billion since deregulation.

31
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,120
Are you suggesting
our clients admit that?

32
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,560
Great idea. They can go to jail
and pay us how?

33
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,819
Litigation is bad PR.
If they refund half a billion...

34
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,019
...we take 20 percent off the top.
Everybody wins.

35
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,709
I'll consider both options.
And the current status of Angel?

36
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,339
He's up, he's down.
He's a barrel of dead monkeys.

37
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,329
He's back with his group.
Sources say he's doing better.

38
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,459
He's not spending all of his time
on the warpath...

39
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,689
...trying to kill...

40
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,170
...well, us.

41
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,730
When do you and Lindsey
meet with Lycor's CFO?

42
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,269
- Oh, I think it's--
- Thursday at 11.

43
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,170
Good. Friday, we'll be
re-evaluating your division.

44
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,360
You can catch me up then.

45
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,439
Let's get to work.

46
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,850
Could you stab me in my back
a little deeper?

47
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,529
You know what re-evaluation means.
One of us gets cut.

48
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,839
- Here, that's a literal cutting.
- Nothing lasts forever.

49
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,819
- That's deep. Why don't you go f--?
- Lindsey, join me?

50
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,689
Some advice about your
attitude towards Angel.

51
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,629
Now, I realize what he did
to you was heartless.

52
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,439
Naturally, your attitude
towards him would be complex.

53
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,680
But it's not professional to air
feelings around colleagues.

54
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,069
People look up to you.

55
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,680
Which reminds me,
I made an appointment for you today.

56
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,889
It'll take a while,
so I cleared your calendar.

57
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,529
Yes. Well, just a....

58
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,930
Well, you'll see.

59
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,170
He had to be crazy.
But he didn't feel crazy.

60
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,649
He felt normal, you know?

61
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,660
- Until he stabbed himself.
- Where did this occur?

62
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,550
I told you, it was in a house.
It could've been...

63
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,500
...an apartment, in a kitchen.

64
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,629
- Narrow it down.
- A nice kitchen? I don't--

65
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,759
- We'll figure it out.
- Start by calling the hospitals.

66
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,519
What? "Did my uncle stab
a knife in his eye?"

67
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,339
They only give information
to relatives.

68
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,100
- I got the hospitals job.
- I'll go to the morgues.

69
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,560
- I'll see if there's a new terror.
- Good idea.

70
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,019
- Keep an eye on her.
- Sure.

71
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,990
We'll be back.

72
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,490
Can I get you anything? Cup of tea?

73
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,079
You let me know.

74
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,569
Lindsey. I'm Dr. Melman.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

75
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,339
Hi.

76
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,250
Your vitals are good. You've had
all the childhood diseases...

77
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,449
...and you're not allergic.

78
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,620
Let's start with
two milligrams of Versed.

79
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,870
A little something to relax you
before we begin.

80
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,750
- Have any questions?
- What the hell's going on?

81
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,939
- Your boss didn't say?
- No.

82
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,449
- They have a funny sense of humor.
- They keep us hopping.

83
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,250
Your firm is a major source
of our funding.

84
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,420
We see most of you
for your primary care...

85
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,839
...but there are some
less publicized aspects.

86
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,360
- What the hell are you gonna do?
- Please, don't be alarmed.

87
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,579
They moved you to the top
of the transplant list.

88
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,769
- Transplant?
- Yes, your hand.

89
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:28,509
We're gonna give you a new one.

90
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't be so nervous.
This is cause for applause.

91
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,080
In just a few hours' time,
you'll be doing the applauding.

92
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,429
- Let's go.
- Get the soft tissue ready.

93
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,669
- Here you go. 4.0 silk.
- Connecting the extensors.

94
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,190
You're doing great, Lindsey.
Where's the Pockla?

95
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,960
Release the tourniquet.
I'm waiting on the Pockla.

96
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,399
Here it comes.

97
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,919
Okay, let's get him to post-op.

98
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,590
My father's name is Henry Addison.

99
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,070
Yeah, I'm his son, Gunn. Ter.
Gunter Addison.

100
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,080
But if he's had a manic episode,
he might not know his name.

101
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,190
It'd be a serious knife
wound in his eye.

102
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,840
- You sure? All right, thanks.
- How's she doing?

103
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,210
She grunted once around noon, then
got on with the maniacal cleaning.

104
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,789
Guess what I found? More nothing
than usual. How about you?

105
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:12,120
- Nothing.
- We need more to go on.

106
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,679
We'll just have to talk
to Cordelia, get her to--

107
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,330
Dig a little deeper?

108
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,120
Go ahead. Best not to crowd her.

109
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,799
You're the one in charge now.

110
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,269
You're right. That's why
I'm assigning this one to you.

111
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,580
Hey.

112
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,029
Boy, you could see your reflection
in that glass.

113
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,000
I couldn't because of
the vampire situation.

114
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,110
- But a normal person....
- What do you want?

115
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,730
We need help.
We're not getting anywhere.

116
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,090
I'm sorry. He's probably dead by now.

117
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,240
We don't know that for sure.
There could be others.

118
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,850
I wish it would stop hurting.

119
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,580
What do you want me to do?

120
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,509
Not exactly sure.

121
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,830
Maybe you can look again.
You know, inside.

122
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,559
That's all I've been doing, all day.

123
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:40,679
That guy in the kitchen.

124
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,399
A normal guy...

125
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,870
...and he picks up a knife.

126
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,240
And--

127
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,580
Oh, God! I think he had kids.

128
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,659
- How do you know that?
- Cereal bowls on the table.

129
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,100
And there was a book bag.

130
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,049
It has a name of a school on it.

131
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,769
D-something. Delaney or....

132
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,250
Delancey School.

133
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,220
That's good, that's great.

134
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,940
Anything else?

135
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,230
I just keep seeing it.

136
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,889
Get some rest.
Wesley and Gunn will look into it.

137
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,250
- Can I get you anything?
- Why does everyone ask me that?

138
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,700
No reason.

139
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,330
She's still rocking,

140
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:19,120
We've got weather and traffic coming,
so keep it right here,

141
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,620
- Good to see you. Pleasure.
- One of our finest.

142
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,649
- Here's Lilah Morgan. Mr. Kraigle.
- Nice to see you.

143
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,730
Use my office.

144
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,610
Irv, call me if you need anything.
You're in good hands.

145
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,090
- Thanks.
- Mr. Kraigle.

146
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,240
- Please, call me Irv.
- Thank you.

147
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,899
That's an expensive operation,
quarter mil.

148
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,769
I guess they like you.
They really like you.

149
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,330
- He's waiting.
- You think you have it in the bag.

150
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,840
I don't think anything, Lilah.

151
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,659
You're the one in pain here?
I can't believe they chose you.

152
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,899
- We didn't do anything wrong,
- It's not about that.

153
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,700
It's about what a jury may award.

154
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,850
Cancer from chocolate? How?

155
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,879
Sell it in a tin
that leaches cytoclistomene.

156
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,899
But how could we know that?
The Chinese sold us the tin.

157
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,139
Don't worry. If a jury ever
hears this, and that's a big "if"...

158
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,340
...they'll be handpicked
or enchanted by us.

159
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,919
Why can't people take responsibility?
The Chinese gave them cancer.

160
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,879
- Actually, it was the Drizon Company.
- Who?

161
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,039
It's a corporation that split
from your company six years ago.

162
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,750
They're responsible
for the tin containers...

163
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,080
...your company fills with chocolate.

164
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,159
- Really?
- The plaintiffs want to sue Drizon.

165
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,129
But they're going bankrupt
this summer.

166
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,299
Are you getting this?

167
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,419
- He's good, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's great.

168
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,549
Well, this is very helpful.
Very comforting.

169
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,309
We're not doing anything unlawful?

170
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,899
No. More importantly,
we're preserving your company.

171
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,850
I have to go.

172
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,820
- Something wrong?
- No. No, nothing is wrong.

173
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,809
Who are you?

174
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,799
Thanks, keep the change.

175
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,099
A whole dollar just for me.
I'm the luckiest delivery man....

176
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,000
- What's all this?
- Lunch. I was hungry.

177
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,269
You don't eat food.

178
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,759
It doesn't keep me alive,
but I get a hankering.

179
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,359
For turkey, ham
and roast beef sandwiches?

180
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,619
You missed the vegetarian.

181
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,079
Soup and salad too?
What is going on here?

182
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,529
- I forgot what you liked.
- Why didn't you ask me?

183
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,539
You said, why does everyone...

184
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,430
...ask if they can get you anything?

185
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,039
So you did this instead?

186
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,799
Yeah.

187
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,039
I love you.

188
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,519
You ought to do that more.

189
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,619
- Buy you food?
- Smile.

190
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,680
What?

191
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,069
Okay, this is weird.

192
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,819
Before he put the knife in his eye...

193
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:22,180
...he was happy about his eye.

194
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,400
- Like it was new or something.
- New.

195
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,829
We found him. Joseph Kramer.

196
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,289
Has two kids.
They go to the Delancey School.

197
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,210
Kids didn't show up.

198
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,380
Mom called.
Said she's taking them away.

199
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,630
Their father supposedly
got a promotion.

200
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,349
- Get a home address?
- We've been there.

201
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,609
- And?
- No trace of belongings.

202
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,099
The place had been cleaned.
The carpet was still wet.

203
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,400
To get rid of the blood.

204
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,480
Little piece of molding they missed.

205
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,660
- Wanna sniff?
- How about I just believe you?

206
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,670
- What do we know?
- Nothing.

207
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,680
Guy's gone, family's gone.

208
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,519
Someone has the power to make
them all disappear in a day.

209
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,019
- We're at a dead end.
- I thought we had more.

210
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,839
There's only one thing we can do.

211
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,339
Oh, God. Oh, no.

212
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,059
- The karaoke bar.
- Angel's gonna sing?

213
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,690
- Isn't there another way?
- There has to be.

214
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,740
Hey, what?

215
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:28,880
Pretty girl on every corner

216
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,390
Sunshine turns the sky to gold

217
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:38,660
Warm, warm, it's always warm here

218
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:44,099
And I can't take the cold

219
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,170
You should pick something short.

220
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,759
- "Stairway to Heaven"?
- Don't even joke about that.

221
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,680
- Oh, my God, look who's--
- Lindsey?

222
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,519
Isn't he fabulous?

223
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:01,680
He comes here?

224
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:06,190
He came a lot, before someone
chopped off his strumming hand.

225
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,200
Looks like he's got a new one.

226
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,980
She's pretty as a picture

227
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,720
Wow! He's good.

228
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,880
Lawyer's got some pipes.

229
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,079
Fills me with love and laughter

230
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,269
- You think he's good?
- Shh.

231
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,019
I can't feel a thing

232
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,470
The sky's gonna open

233
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,859
People gonna pray and crawl

234
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,920
What is that? Rock? Country? Ballad?
Pick a style.

235
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,490
- Shh.
- Don't make me ask you to leave.

236
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,339
The sky's gonna open

237
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,039
People gonna pray and sing

238
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,069
I can't feel

239
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,630
- I can't sing now.
- You won't have to.

240
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,369
Sure is good to have you back
in the saddle.

241
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,880
Your favorite, TNT.

242
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,089
I got a crazy man's hand
who wants to kill someone...

243
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,420
...maybe me.
What do you see?

244
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,880
Well, the hand is quicker
than the eye.

245
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,240
- You'll get that later.
- I need help.

246
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:38,799
I'll say. You might want
to start with the singing.

247
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,359
Hi. You probably don't remember me.
Cordelia.

248
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:48,259
I know you're evil and everything
but that was just so amazing.

249
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,950
- That was tight.
- Terrific.

250
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,289
Is everyone drunk?

251
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,660
What's he doing here?
What are you looking at?

252
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,730
I don't allow violence in here.
Angel's here for the reason you are.

253
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,279
- How's that?
- Two enemies, one case.

254
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,349
Coming together in a beautiful way.

255
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:09,259
- They're working together on this?
- Work with him? With him?

256
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,900
- Did anyone see 48 Hours?
- I got a murderous hand...

257
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,180
...and you're teaming me up with
the guy who cut mine off?

258
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,980
I'm telling you what's what, sugar.
What you do with it is up to you.

259
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,829
If I ever see you outside the club,
I'm gonna kill you.

260
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:36,230
Resentment's an ugly emotion.
I hope you've overcome yours.

261
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,759
Right now, he has your case in the...

262
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,170
...forgive me, palm of his hand. Toodles.

263
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:47,380
If he's the lead,
shouldn't we follow him?

264
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,230
The guy in your vision got an eye,
and Lindsey got a hand.

265
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,160
We should find where
the transplants were done.

266
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:59,380
- So we're following him, right?
- We need to follow his new hand.

267
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,309
I wonder who it belonged to.

268
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,650
Hand belongs to a white male,
Bradley Scott.

269
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:37,240
Served two years for embezzlement.
Paroled last month.

270
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,720
- How'd you find out?
- I'm a detective.

271
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,470
- Did he have a life?
- Why don't you look--?

272
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,309
I am.

273
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,049
Impressive, Angel.

274
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,819
Well, sometimes you gotta
follow your--

275
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,559
So how did your--?
Get you into the NCIC?

276
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,440
- The what?
- National Crime and Information Center.

277
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:59,130
Long story.
How's it coming over there?

278
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:00,900
We got time.

279
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,210
Nobody used to question
my methods or my singing.

280
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,410
You're half right.

281
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,980
I hired a private detective.
He's got a friend.

282
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,819
- We're private detectives.
- We have friends.

283
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,579
We did. She got fired.
Get over it.

284
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,380
Bradley Scott.

285
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,500
While dumping bearer bonds
on the black market, he worked...

286
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,470
- ...at Wolfram & Hart.
- Is he still alive?

287
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,980
His records say he reported to his
parole officer, then disappeared.

288
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:34,200
He gets out of jail, then-- Whack!
They give his hand to Lindsey.

289
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,319
They really wanna give him everything.

290
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,369
- Who is it?
- You don't know me.

291
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,309
My name's Lindsey McDonald.
I work for Wolfram & Hart.

292
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,990
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.

293
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:46,250
Can I come in?

294
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,549
Oh, it's okay. I'm alone.

295
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,769
Professional habit.
I see a lot of lowlifes.

296
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,900
I guess so, being a parole officer.
This is off the record.

297
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:09,650
I had a procedure done
at Fairfield Clinic.

298
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,140
They've paid you to do things
for them in the past.

299
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,730
I need to find out
where they get their body parts.

300
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,410
- What's the code?
- Code?

301
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,309
If you're with Wolfram & Hart,
you know it.

302
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,170
I'm a lawyer there
but this isn't my case.

303
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,849
I don't know the code.
I can pay you--

304
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,349
Tell me what the game is.

305
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,559
It's no game, all right?
This is about me.

306
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,119
Goodbye.

307
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,609
- Friend of yours?
- No, he's not.

308
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,670
I'm about to put a bullet
in your buddy's brain here!

309
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,039
I got him. I know I got him.

310
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,210
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life?

311
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,210
- I don't need you!
- Watch that!

312
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,529
- A little gratitude.
- You got no business--

313
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,990
- Why aren't you trying to kill me?
- I'm on a case.

314
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,250
Why is it always about killing you?

315
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,000
You guys got issues, so I'll just--

316
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,400
You're choking my lead!

317
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,119
"My lead!"
Are we on a schoolyard?

318
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,869
You gotta learn how
to play with others.

319
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,349
I'm gonna loosen the rope.
Tell me all about Bradley Scott.

320
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,809
- Who?
- Guy whose hand you got. Listen up.

321
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,420
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So immature.

322
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,369
Shut up!

323
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,609
- We're waiting.
- I'm not telling you zip.

324
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,329
You can kill me.
Wolfram & Hart will do worse.

325
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,059
Kill you?

326
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,079
Why would I kill you
when I could live off you for a month?

327
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,220
- Can't you taste the butterfat?
- You're gross.

328
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,079
I'll tell you!
Scott stole some bearer bonds.

329
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,099
When he got paroled,
Wolfram & Hart assigned him to me.

330
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,390
Your file says he was a no-show.
But you saw him.

331
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,210
- Once.
- You took him to Fairfield Clinic?

332
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,730
No, not there.

333
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,269
- Where?
- Just some address.

334
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,470
I don't know what they do there
and I don't wanna know.

335
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,609
Her vision hangovers
are getting longer and longer.

336
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:38,119
She can't rest until it's done.

337
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,000
I know. She inherited them from Doyle.
He was half-demon.

338
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,289
I' m not sure the human body
can carry....

339
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,269
Last year, a demon unleashed a slew
of visions on her.

340
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,990
She wound up in hospital,
out of her mind.

341
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,940
She's been a little cranky lately,
but she's not...

342
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,680
Angel, where are you?
I can't hear you.

343
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,019
- ...crazy.
- Are you there?

344
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,900
Nothing. I'm fine.

345
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,900
Gunn and Wesley are playing with
the doors. I'm trying to work here.

346
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,779
Okay, we'll wait here.

347
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,250
I'm fine. Just get it done.

348
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,009
Funny thing happened the other day.

349
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,960
A guy sticks a butcher knife
in his own eye.

350
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,029
Guess he went to the same clinic.

351
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:44,369
Your hand hasn't been doing
anything funny lately, has it?

352
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,829
It's none of my business,
but you don't seem happy.

353
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,740
I know you're Mr. Save-a-Soul.

354
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:56,200
You used to fight with your enemies.

355
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:59,970
I guess it's a lot to carry.
I mean, losing Darla.

356
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,980
I mean, even me, in a way,
as a place to focus your rage.

357
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,990
It's ironic. I mean, here you are,
young and healthy...

358
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,259
...good job, new hand.

359
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,349
The more you get, the less you have.

360
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,319
Am I getting through here?

361
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,960
You just keep on moping.
You're good at that.

362
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,690
Okay. That where you took him?

363
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,259
- Know this place?
- No.

364
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,289
I'm thinking security
will be top drawer.

365
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,259
Window sensors,
motion detectors, guards.

366
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,869
- I don't have my laptop.
- Huh?

367
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,569
To hack into the system
and break the codes--

368
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,309
Wait a minute. That's a bother.
Why don't we just fight?

369
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,759
You might want to step aside.

370
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,890
Come on, work off some
of that aggression.

371
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:25,250
The floor is hollow.

372
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,650
What is this?

373
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:55,950
You know what this is.
Spare parts for guys like you.

374
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,240
You got your "before"...

375
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,140
...and your "after."

376
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,599
More like "during," I guess.

377
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,250
Your firm in action, Lindsey.
Lot to be proud of, huh?

378
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:27,400
Pockla blessed this place.

379
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,730
- Who are they?
- Demon healers.

380
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,450
They know how to regenerate flesh.

381
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,690
That's why the transplants
aren't taking well.

382
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,970
One was there
when they gave me my hand.

383
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,380
Your hand? I think it belonged
to that guy over there.

384
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,230
Or what's left of him, anyway.

385
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh, God. I know him.

386
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:01,559
I didn't get the name before.

387
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,809
We worked in the mailroom together.

388
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,000
Brad.

389
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,000
Kill.

390
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,110
Kill.

391
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,809
Kill who? Huh?
Who do you want to kill?

392
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,760
Kill me.

393
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,630
Please.

394
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,300
What am I supposed to do?

395
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,119
I know what I'd do,
but this is your deal.

396
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,630
Whatever it is, do it quick.

397
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,500
They're gonna come in force.
We gotta help them.

398
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,960
I'm sorry.

399
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,309
Help these people upstairs.

400
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,289
Get them to the car.

401
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,219
How's everything in your head?

402
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,599
What?

403
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,460
Any vision aftermaths?

404
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:13,480
It's better.

405
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,070
What?

406
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:21,980
It's just-- They're starting
to take a toll.

407
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,949
It's part of the job, right?

408
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,369
These re-evaluations
are a mixed blessing.

409
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,199
Sad, as we lose one of our own.

410
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,219
But also hopeful,
as we promote one of our own.

411
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:46,829
Lilah, you have made a lot
of great contributions...

412
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,199
...and you've tried your best--

413
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,510
No!

414
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,050
Lilah, please.

415
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:56,010
They chose me.

416
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,739
I'm clearly the guy.

417
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,110
Yes, you are.

418
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,869
You could have had it.

419
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,090
You didn't have what it takes.

420
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,670
An evil hand. I mean, come on.

421
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,780
Who here does, huh? Leon doesn't.
Charlie doesn't.

422
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:26,860
You know you gave me
an evil hand?

423
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:30,250
I've been writing "kill"
on everything.

424
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,730
It's crazy.
Anything could happen.

425
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,170
- Allan.
- Allan, how are you?

426
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,500
It's gonna hurt in the morning!
Come here.

427
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,940
Stop it, evil hand. Stop it!

428
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,829
I just can't control my evil hand.

429
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,869
Nathan, I'm so proud
that you chose me. Charlie!

430
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,699
But if I was in your shoes...

431
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,949
...I would've chosen Lilah.
You know why?

432
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,300
Do you have any idea
the hours she's logged in?

433
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,449
The files she has on you guys?

434
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,369
Deep stuff.
Ronnie, your stock manipulations.

435
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,880
Nathan's offshore accounts.

436
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,989
Can you imagine if those files
got back to the senior partners?

437
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,440
They'd eat you alive!

438
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,920
She's been working overtime.

439
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,550
She's all you ever dreamed of.
Lilah is your guy.

440
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,360
Me?

441
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,039
I'm unreliable.
I got these evil-hand issues...

442
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,760
...and I'm bored with this crap.

443
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,500
Besides, I'm leaving,
so if you wanna chase me...

444
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,630
...be my guest.
But remember. Evil.

445
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,989
Charlie.

446
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,110
Good luck.

447
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,170
Evil.

448
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,500
Well, let's amend the minutes.

449
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,500
Lilah Morgan was promoted.

450
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:10,440
And someone call an ambulance.

451
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,329
If you're here to kill me, get in line.

452
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,650
I really like this truck.
'56, right?

453
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,900
First year they had
wraparound windshields.

454
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:46,550
Back in the '50s, we all thought life
would be like The Jetsons now.

455
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:52,380
Air cars, robots. I'd love to have
an air car. Wouldn't that be cool?

456
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,769
You're gonna talk me to death?

457
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,369
Things don't always
work out like you think.

458
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:03,670
I bet Wolfram & Hart aren't happy
losing one of their best.

459
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,889
Let them try to stop me.
It'll be fun.

460
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,070
Is that a healthy attitude?

461
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,539
Where are you going, Lindsey?

462
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,840
Back to your roots?

463
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,199
Something like that.

464
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,489
Hope you're not waiting for me
to say I learned a lesson.

465
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,010
That now I see the light--

466
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,820
If you say that, I'd have to kill you.

467
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,230
No. I'm just here to say bon voyage.

468
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,320
Don't come back.

469
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:42,179
To L.A.? No.
You can have this place.

470
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,590
Good. Glad I didn't have
to do something immature.

471
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,469
The key to Wolfram & Hart...

472
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,219
...don't let them make you play
their game.

473
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,690
Make them play yours.

474
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,570
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

475
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:09,530
Don't drive too fast, now.
Lot of cops out there.
