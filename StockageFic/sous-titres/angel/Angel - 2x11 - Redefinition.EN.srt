1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,229
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,469
- How about a song?
- The Host helps people.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,769
- Senses their futures.
- Only when they sing karaoke.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,970
They brought her back. I need
to know why. Why like this?

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,850
Why human?

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,039
I believe you said something
about a massacre.

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,980
For God's sake, help us.

8
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,149
- People are going to die.
- I can't seem to care.

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,859
- What you did--
- Is wrong.

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,130
You went too far.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,100
The three of us are all that's
standing between you and real darkness.

12
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,159
You're all fired.

13
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,479
What just happened?

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,659
Can someone explain to me
what happened?

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,570
- We were fired.
- Canned.

16
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,630
- Let go.
- Axed.

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,109
- Dismissed.
- Booted.

18
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,079
All right. I get it.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,849
But what just happened?

20
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,250
Fired?

21
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,359
Angel fired us?

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,739
Looks that way.

23
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,480
- I can't believe it.
- Keep a level head.

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,650
Perhaps he'll change his mind.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,019
He locked 20 lawyers in a room
with two vampires.

26
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,870
- I'd say his mind's changed enough.
- Darla!

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,239
It's all about Darla.

28
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,530
Well, at least Angel's consistent.

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,549
It's always some blond driving
him over the edge.

30
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,459
- What do we do now?
- Think I'll get a burrito.

31
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,109
What?

32
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,019
By all means, if you're hungry.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,329
Hey, this was just a side gig.

34
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,980
The extra cash was nice...

35
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,680
...but Angel wants to go commando....
No skin off my nose.

36
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, my nose skin is angry. And hurt.

37
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,450
- And--
- Disappointed?

38
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,300
I won't pretend to understand
Angel's reasons.

39
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,050
But maybe he needs to be alone now.

40
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,870
And the best thing we can do
for him is to let him be.

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,789
Alone.

42
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,740
I'm not ready yet,

43
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,060
Too many years sleeping
in soft beds...

44
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,990
...living in a world where
I don't belong,

45
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,370
I can't fight now, Not yet,

46
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,740
But soon,

47
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,009
- Sir, you should be in a hospital.
- She saved me.

48
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,129
- You should be checked out by a doctor.
- There's gotta be a reason.

49
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,720
- Why am I the only one left?
- You're in shock.

50
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,189
I'm the only one left.

51
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,800
Hey, we've got a live one here.

52
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,000
We do?

53
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,870
Ma'am, can you stand up?

54
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,089
Lilah.

55
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,529
You've gotta be kidding me,

56
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,930
He fired you? You're on a mission
to protect the innocent.

57
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,339
He can't fire you.
What did he say, exactly?

58
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,540
- "You're fired."
- Oh.

59
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,000
Can you file a grievance
with the union?

60
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,259
I'm not in a union. I'm--

61
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,509
I don't even know what
the name of my job is. Was.

62
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,490
You're a renowned specialist
in supernatural aid and rescue.

63
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,139
No, I'm just--

64
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,449
Renowned?

65
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,160
To me you are.
You saved my life.

66
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,360
But you should be in a union.
Father used union conjurers.

67
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,920
- I didn't know.
- Wizards are very progressive.

68
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,959
Your father tried to sacrifice you.

69
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,310
And I'll never talk to him again.

70
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,029
Although I'm healing, thanks to a lot
of therapy and a huge trust fund.

71
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,379
You know what it is? He's jealous.

72
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,889
- Your father?
- No, Angel.

73
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,540
You impersonated him to
rescue me, and you were too good.

74
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,740
I don't think so.

75
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,310
He fired Cordy and Gunn too.

76
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,980
All of you? Why?

77
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,240
It has to do with Darla
being made a vampire again...

78
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,860
...and being with Drusilla.

79
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,879
The three of them have
a very tangled past.

80
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,410
I guess he doesn't want us
in his way.

81
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,730
Well, his loss. You'll get
another job, just like that.

82
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,529
What else can you do?

83
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,389
Not much.

84
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,649
When Wolfram & Hart take
a life, they do it at a distance,

85
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,699
I don't have that luxury,

86
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,610
It's time,

87
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,980
I'm not on their level,

88
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,240
But I can get there,

89
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,250
And when I do, I'll be right up close,
I'll bring the fight to them,

90
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,320
No messages? Are you sure? Check--

91
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,210
Thanks.

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,529
- Getting the freeze-out?
- Lilah....

93
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,269
You bitter because Darla
didn't kill me?

94
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,269
- More like bummed.
- Sorry to disappoint.

95
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,259
So I'm not the only one
feeling the lack of empathy.

96
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,870
- What?
- No phone calls. No flowers.

97
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,090
I could be nervous,
but I'm just pissed.

98
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,500
We're the only survivors.
We're under suspicion.

99
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,970
I don't like suspicion. Next we'll
turn up dead in some freak accident.

100
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,279
We did nothing wrong.

101
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,539
That has nothing to do with it.

102
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,049
If they're looking for a scapegoat,
we might as well grow horns.

103
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,200
A scapegoat, Lilah? They--

104
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,799
They wanted Drusilla brought in.
I was following orders.

105
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,159
And you honestly think that matters?

106
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,769
Don't doubt for a minute
someone's gonna pay, Lindsey.

107
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,220
And we're the only ones left.

108
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,870
Not the only ones.

109
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,230
Lindsey, I've missed you.

110
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,029
Close the door.

111
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,480
If we'd wanted you dead, you'd have
never made it out of the cellar.

112
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,570
Now close the door.

113
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,460
He's got cow eyes, big and black.

114
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,100
Moo....

115
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,080
You spared me.

116
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,889
Why did you spare me, Darla?

117
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,669
Do you really have to ask?

118
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,470
I love you.

119
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,980
Shut up, Lilah.

120
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,889
Look at you two. Such pretty scars.

121
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,399
You put us in a difficult position.

122
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,090
Did I? Smart young lawyers,
hungry for their big break and...

123
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,580
...oops, boss gets eaten.
Someone's got to step in.

124
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,690
Someone pretty,
with questionable ethics...

125
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,789
...and $1200 suits that
look good on the 6:00 news.

126
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,899
You think they'll promote him?

127
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,259
Or you.

128
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,460
In any case, that's why you're here.

129
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,179
I've decided to keep the line
of communication open...

130
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,899
...between us and Wolfram & Hart.

131
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,470
- What for?
- We can help each other.

132
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,090
What is it exactly that
you want, Darla?

133
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,500
Power.

134
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,779
During my stint as Wolfram & Hart's
puppet, something occurred to me:

135
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,879
I loathe being used.

136
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,789
I believe I sent you a 15-body memo
to that effect.

137
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,590
We're gonna be big players
in this town.

138
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:59,679
You don't have what I want,
but you have what I need.

139
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,049
Money. Connections.

140
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,169
We're no good to you dead.

141
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,409
The senior partners are looking for
someone to blame for your massacre.

142
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,389
Surely they wouldn't kill
both of you. Seems like a waste.

143
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,659
Well, I guess whoever's left standing
will be our liaison.

144
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,440
- Liaison to what?
- To the world above.

145
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,940
In the meantime,
we'll focus on the world below.

146
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,019
This power that you want,
does it have a target?

147
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,580
- Maybe Angel?
- Don't say that.

148
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:42,210
Not everything is about Angel.
I just want to have some fun.

149
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:47,220
I thought you would make him
your top priority.

150
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,399
I spent 250 years without Angel.

151
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,970
You think being human
made me go all gooey?

152
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,419
No.

153
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:59,090
No, I thought you'd kill him.

154
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,320
All in good time, my love.

155
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,409
All in good time.

156
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,759
They were just waiting for us.

157
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,870
All crouched and hiding
in that little back room.

158
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,340
I don't usually hit the fast food
places. The people are all greasy.

159
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,419
But this was like Christmas!

160
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,370
I'm ready,

161
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,169
I've got the moves,

162
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,169
Now I need to know
what theirs are,

163
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,210
- Bloody mary.
- Want real blood?

164
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,600
No. Bloodless, thanks.

165
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,350
Thank you.

166
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,539
We'll take a break and see
who wants to sing next.

167
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,070
Steady on, Wesley.

168
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,980
Perhaps something by...

169
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,009
...Cat Stevens.

170
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:53,610
- Your drink, sir.
- Oh. Thank you.

171
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,690
- Wesley!
- Cordelia! How...

172
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,059
...odd to see you.

173
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,779
What are you doing here?

174
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,580
Me? Oh, I just came in for a drink.

175
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,570
Because only demon
karaoke bars have those.

176
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,600
- You were gonna sing.
- Dear Lord, no.

177
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,740
No.

178
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,070
I merely--

179
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,700
- What are you doing here?
- Oh!

180
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,250
Ah, well....

181
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:33,200
- I was in the neighborhood
- You live 15 miles away.

182
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,509
Well, you know L.A. It's all
one really big neighborhood.

183
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:39,490
I see.

184
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,700
Come to find your destiny, have you?

185
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:50,669
- And who is gonna help you?
- Shania Twain or Madonna.

186
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,639
I haven't decided.

187
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,889
We're both at loose ends,
since Angel--

188
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,080
- Pulled a total wig.
- Quite.

189
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,670
- I'm somewhat embarrassed--
- How do you think I feel?

190
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,319
Gunn, what are you...?

191
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,950
You said this was just a side gig.

192
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,430
I can't have you seeing through
my macho exterior.

193
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,410
Oh, heavens forfend.

194
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:30,660
I'll assume it's not Madonna.
What song were you gonna sing?

195
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,740
You wouldn't know it.

196
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,980
I, for one, would like to point out
the patheticness that is us.

197
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,799
This is all Angel's fault.

198
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,480
Hope he's happy now. Alone in his
demon world with no one to talk to.

199
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,529
I'll talk!

200
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,569
I'm telling you, I don't know--

201
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,730
Is this how you get your rocks off?

202
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,170
All right! All right!

203
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:15,329
I heard about your girls.
Godzilla, Darcilla, whatever.

204
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,529
They've been looking for demons...

205
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,529
...to join some crew they're running.

206
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,769
That's all I know, man, I swear.

207
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,750
Okay!

208
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,009
Okay! Okay!

209
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,250
You didn't hear this from me but...

210
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,130
...you know that Bar and Bite Club
off La Cienega and Washington?

211
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,440
That's the only demon haunt
they ain't been to.

212
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,500
Hey, you're gonna cut me down, right?

213
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:56,210
You're gonna leave me hanging? Hey!

214
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,480
Hey!

215
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm spinning here, man!

216
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,089
Freaking vampires.

217
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,359
Wow, that was something.

218
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,250
But no victims?
That's where you lose me.

219
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,170
- Who are you?
- I'm Darla and this is Drusilla.

220
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,960
Some of you know us by reputation.

221
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,890
I never heard of you before.

222
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,700
Now you never will.

223
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,579
I trust we have everyone's attention.

224
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,339
Good.

225
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,400
We've come with a little proposition.

226
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,970
Me and my girl aren't just
the new thing in town...

227
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,730
...we're the only thing in town.
And we're in the market for some--

228
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,710
Well, one doesn't really want to
use the term "muscular slaves."

229
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,000
Actually, one does.

230
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,710
We're only looking for the best.

231
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,910
Those creatures who not only excel
at devastation, but revel in it.

232
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,779
Our crusade is one of malevolent joy.

233
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,859
- Eyes like needles.
- Dru, I'm working here.

234
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,710
He sees you. Sees what you were.

235
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,529
- He'll never be alone again.
- Stop.

236
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,289
Just don't.

237
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,359
He's watching you, my sweet,
right now.

238
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,569
Angel.

239
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,950
He wants to punish us.

240
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,460
He thinks we've been naughty.

241
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:14,519
- He remembers when you were warm.
- Shut up!

242
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,910
As I was saying, if you think
you have what it takes to join us...

243
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,410
...auditions are tonight,
at this address.

244
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,059
Winners get to foment
mass destruction.

245
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,059
Losers will be gutted
and left for dead.

246
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,490
Have a nice night. Come on.

247
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:43,789
I'm not ready,

248
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:44,779
Angel.

249
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,839
I can still feel her,

250
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,180
Her pain,

251
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,579
Her need,

252
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,940
Her hope,

253
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,450
I'm too close,

254
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,240
Too close to fight her,

255
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,730
Lilah.

256
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,400
Something happen?

257
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,789
I can't do it anymore, Lindsey.

258
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,140
- Do what?
- The waiting.

259
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:37,220
I sit in my office...

260
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,839
...and every time there's a noise
or the phone rings....

261
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,980
- One of us is gonna die.
- Everybody dies.

262
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,400
But not everybody ends up
turned into dog food.

263
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:52,700
You got a 50-50 chance of surviving
this thing, just like me.

264
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,420
It's not good enough.

265
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,569
- There's a way out.
- How?

266
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,319
We don't wait for them to choose.
We choose each other instead.

267
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,150
If we stick together, we can win.

268
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,089
We could leave. You and me, tonight.

269
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,059
- They'd have no choice--
- They'd hunt us down.

270
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:17,869
No. Not if we took files
as insurance.

271
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,059
- Take files?
- Yes.

272
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,849
Look, I've heard the rumors.

273
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,119
We both know it worked for you
once before.

274
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,240
You knew just what to take.

275
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,569
You won't have to assume
any of the risk.

276
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,900
Just tell me which files
to steal, and I'll get them.

277
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,299
And then we can get out of here...

278
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,069
...and this mess, together.

279
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:52,920
Are you in?

280
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,349
Lilah, I would never steal files.
I'm shocked at the suggestion.

281
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:14,980
Forget about the frame job.

282
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,839
They're gonna kill who they want.

283
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,160
Just take it like a man.

284
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,119
But see,

285
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:25,490
That's what I'm saying. If Wesley
hadn't been shaking his finger...

286
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,789
That's what I'm saying. If Wesley
hadn't been shaking his finger...

287
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,089
...and no, no, no, this whole
Darla thing would have just...

288
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,799
...blown over.

289
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,279
- What?
- Blown over?

290
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,490
- Obsessions don't just blow over.
- Right.

291
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,990
Well, you certainly didn't help
by making him feel guilty about it.

292
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,920
You shamed him into firing us.

293
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,519
- You're blaming this on me?
- Not blaming--

294
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,980
Yes, I'm blaming you.
You get the blame.

295
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,630
If I had to listen to you two,
day in, day out, bitch, bitch, bitch!

296
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:03,839
I would have killed you.

297
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:08,039
That's rich, coming from...

298
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,180
...Mr. I-Don't-Take-Orders-
Now-Where-Do-I-Stick-My-Ax?

299
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,720
- What do you mean?
- You've never...

300
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,569
...been very supportive
of Angel's leadership role.

301
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,089
- I remember a shroud--
- Hold on.

302
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:22,119
Are you saying this is my fault?

303
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,690
Well, you won't follow his directives.

304
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:29,460
Was one of his directives,
"Hire pansy-ass British guy"?

305
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,730
My ass is not pansy.

306
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:37,230
- You kids need another round?
- Yes!

307
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,430
What about her?

308
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,299
Maybe if she'd had visions...

309
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:47,420
...Angel would've been too distracted
to think about Darla.

310
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,259
You have an obsession, you squeeze it
into your schedule, no matter what!

311
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:57,480
- So you admit it's an obsession?
- No. I mean, yes, but no.

312
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,099
- Hypocrite.
- Ass-pansy!

313
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,589
We are the champions

314
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,700
We are the champions

315
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,160
No time for losers

316
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:23,740
Cuz we are the champions

317
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,740
Vampires.

318
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,519
Sloth demons.

319
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,910
You know what's really, really evil?

320
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:40,619
Tequila.

321
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,099
- I need to be dead now.
- Well, well.

322
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,609
I can see the maudlin segment
of tonight's binge is in full swing.

323
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,299
Oh, don't be blue.

324
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,569
I was very impressed with your
musical recitation of pain.

325
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,680
And when I say pain,
I mean mine.

326
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,829
You sang your hearts out.

327
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:08,109
Yeah. Our hearts were out.

328
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,819
You, Mr. Big Mojo Guy...

329
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,940
...are supposed to
give us guidance now.

330
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:20,960
She's right.

331
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,170
We came, we sang, we--

332
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,339
We fought the urge to regurgitate.

333
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,700
So spill, already. Not you.

334
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,210
What are we supposed to do with
our lives? Where do we go from here?

335
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,359
Oh, I'd love to tell you, sweetie.

336
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,289
But when the big guys talk,
I shut my yap.

337
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,000
And they're about to get real chatty.

338
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,900
- You all right?
- No!

339
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,349
- What'd you see?
- Alley.

340
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,269
Not too far from here.

341
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,630
A demon's dragging a girl.
She's hurt. Bleeding.

342
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:10,650
Let's go.

343
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,430
I don't get it.
Are we late?

344
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,990
- We didn't feel late in my head.
- Over here.

345
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,369
It's hers.

346
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:51,900
It's gotta be hers. But where is she?

347
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,160
- If we had Angel, we could track her.
- He'd also kill that demon.

348
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,130
Did I mention his teeth?

349
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:03,190
- I wish Angel was here.
- Well, he's not.

350
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:11,269
Angel's walked away from
his duty. We're not going to.

351
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,700
- So how do we find her?
- Start with basics.

352
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,259
First, we examine the area
for any tell-tale signs...

353
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,380
...of a particular kind of--

354
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:25,609
Ew.

355
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,789
There's different kinds of "ew"?

356
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,630
No. Look.

357
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:33,970
He took her up there.

358
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,420
The building's abandoned.
The front door was chained.

359
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,579
How are we supposed to--?

360
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:45,619
I didn't like that barkeeper.

361
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,400
Can't get his eyes off my fingers.

362
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:52,390
It's nearly midnight.
We should get to the factory.

363
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,440
My little bird is anxious.

364
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,299
Recruiting demons is stressful, Dru.

365
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:00,019
- He won't leave.
- I don't wanna hear it.

366
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:04,740
We could have 1000 soldiers,
and he'll still come. Galloping.

367
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,079
Who says this is about Angel?

368
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:10,559
Can't I wreak havoc without
him being involved?

369
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,430
You miss him, like a heartbeat.

370
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,789
I don't miss my heartbeat.

371
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:20,059
It was a symptom of a disease
I've been cured of.

372
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,359
In a perfect world,
Angel would be here...

373
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,509
...helping me torch this city.

374
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,230
It's his job. But where is he?
Probably flogging himself in church.

375
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,150
Ooh, flogging! Ooh, churches....

376
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,019
We should be slaughtering
the innocent.

377
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,910
Laughing, as we rain
destruction on this town.

378
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,940
I see such pretty fire.

379
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,059
Fire. Conflagration.

380
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:50,549
In a perfect world, there'd
be nothing here but ashes.

381
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,710
And pain.

382
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:56,200
So much suffering.

383
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:58,990
The flames are lovely.

384
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:03,400
They dance, and the fire
licks like a cat.

385
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,569
And the screams.

386
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, it's like star music.

387
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,890
That's nice, Dru.

388
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,710
Now hurry up. We can't be late.

389
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:43,420
It's always the same. A smelly,
old, abandoned building.

390
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,250
Are there no hideouts
in Beverly Hills?

391
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,289
Several, as a matter-- Look.

392
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,839
Over there.

393
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,349
That's her. But where's the--?

394
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,480
Get her out of here!

395
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,839
Come on, we--

396
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,819
- Get her to a hospital.
- Yeah.

397
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:50,890
- What about you?
- I'm fine. It's just--

398
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,130
We should go before I pass out.
Or possibly during.

399
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,539
Nearly ripped us to shreds.

400
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,710
But out of everybody here,
which one of us is dead?

401
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,089
Let's make this quick, okay?

402
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,740
We weed out the losers and get out.
I've got little patience left.

403
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,700
Oh, it's beautiful!

404
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,059
Dank and dark.
It reeks of death.

405
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:30,049
That's motor oil, Dru.

406
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,420
Could we buy it?
It could be our castle.

407
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,019
We're broke.

408
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,500
Though I suppose Lindsey
could help out in that respect.

409
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:44,410
- If they haven't killed him yet.
- I like the girl. She's wicked.

410
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,009
Sweet kids. Naive,
but they're only human.

411
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:52,880
I doubt they know what Wolfram
& Hart's true plan for Angel is.

412
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,119
But I have to say,
my curiosity is piqued.

413
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,340
Ten little soldiers all in a line

414
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,500
A shot rings out, down to nine

415
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,599
Ten?

416
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,119
I'd be happy if we can find three
who can hack it.

417
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,219
Dead already?

418
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,159
Bad soldiers!

419
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,619
I should have known.

420
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:50,980
A shadow.

421
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:53,519
Why so far away, my love?

422
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,190
Why don't you come over here
and stake me?

423
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,050
Angel?

424
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:08,769
Angelus?

425
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:58,739
Make it stop, please!

426
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,059
That wasn't Angel.

427
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,550
He's gone. He's all gone.

428
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,889
It hurts!

429
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,039
It hurts!

430
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,530
It wasn't Angelus, either.

431
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,489
Darla, help me!

432
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,449
Help me, please....

433
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,179
Who was that?

434
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,360
- And the fire?
- They're alive.

435
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,059
- Undead.
- Whatever.

436
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,329
- It was Angel.
- So?

437
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,679
Killed a dozen demons.
Set the girls on fire.

438
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,469
- Your point?
- A little grimmer than usual.

439
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,360
- Holland's vision lives.
- Screw it.

440
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,960
If anybody's going down,
it's gonna be you.

441
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,289
If that's what it takes.

442
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,010
Sit down.

443
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,719
I suppose you know why you're here.

444
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,280
The senior partners have decided...

445
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,260
...that this should be a time
of grief and reflection.

446
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,059
We can never replace Holland Manners.

447
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:44,250
He was a man of extraordinary talents.

448
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,210
This leaves us with
an opening in our roster.

449
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,599
We need an executive vice president...

450
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,489
...of special projects.

451
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,489
Mr. McDonald...

452
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,469
...your conduct at this firm
has proved spotty, at best.

453
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:11,570
You've stolen files,
cooperated with our enemy...

454
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,780
...and disobeyed orders
time and again.

455
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:21,199
Miss Morgan, when you drove away
the telekinetic Bethany Chaulk...

456
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,530
...you lost us a powerful
potential assassin.

457
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:29,250
Both of you have been negligent
about informing us...

458
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,900
...of visits from certain ladies.

459
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:34,199
Who, lest we forget...

460
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,929
...ate the majority of our
contracts department.

461
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:44,670
The truth is, neither one
of you are qualified...

462
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,690
...to run special projects.

463
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,750
As for your relationship
to one another...

464
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,800
...your competition has been...

465
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:56,570
...vicious, destructive and...

466
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,010
...healthy for each other.

467
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:01,059
That's why we've decided...

468
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,789
...to appoint you both as
acting co-vice presidents...

469
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,449
...until such time as we see fit
to narrow it down.

470
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,400
Congratulations.
This is a big step.

471
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:21,030
The senior partners
will be watching you.

472
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:54,329
We're keeping the agency open.

473
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,789
With or without you.

474
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,869
You've turned your back
on your mission, but we haven't.

475
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,260
Someone has to fight the good fight.

476
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,980
Let them fight the good fight,

477
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:31,880
Someone has to fight the war,

478
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,579
Thank you very much,
