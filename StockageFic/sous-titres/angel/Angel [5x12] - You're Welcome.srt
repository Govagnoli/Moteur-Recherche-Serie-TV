- Fred.
- Hair follicles, enzymes and something--

- Oh, God.
- I think God is out at the moment.

Why would Greenway do this?
It was just a stupid racketeering charge.

I told him we'd get him off with probation
so long as he shut down operations.

What are the odds?

- Also, not shockingly,
our client practices black arts.
