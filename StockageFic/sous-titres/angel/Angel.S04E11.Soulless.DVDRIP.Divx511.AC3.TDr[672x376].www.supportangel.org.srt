2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:04,648
If you kill him, I'm gonna lose you.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,170
CHARLES:
We haven't touched each other since...

4
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,925
Since we murdered Prof. Seidel.

5
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,249
- You've been keeping track of me.
- Yes.

6
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:15,763
You move on Fred, and I'm
gonna put you down hard.

7
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,168
CORDELIA:
<i>It's coming, and no one can stop it.</i>

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,167
<i>Connor, you never had a childhood</i>
<i>or anything that's real.</i>

9
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,848
<i>And if this is the end,</i>
<i>I want you to have something that is.</i>

10
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:29,329
WES: <i>The Beast is planning</i>
<i>to block out the sun, permanently.</i>

11
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,568
Angelus.

12
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:33,810
ANGEL: <i>The Beast knows me.</i>
FRED: <i>No, it doesn't. It knows Angelus.</i>

13
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,403
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- We need Angelus.

14
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:42,368
- I'd much prefer we had a plan.
- Wo-Pang. He can deliver Angelus to us.

15
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:45,849
- What is that?
WO-PANG: A receptacle for his soul.

16
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,571
WO-PANG:
It is done.

17
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:53,967
Angelus.

00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:13,365
[SCREAMS]

19
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,683
CONNOR: Out-of-towners?
- Yeah, Tucson.

20
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,091
Welcome to L.A.

21
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,403
Tourists.

22
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,811
FRED: Seeing Angel's soul all floaty
like that makes me crazy.

23
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,602
It's not forever, sugarplum.
We're just borrowing it.

24
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,327
Cordelia.

25
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,292
Don't drop it.

26
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:40,443
Angel is gone.

27
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:46,649
I can't believe...

28
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,682
It's done.

29
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,846
Taking Angel's soul, putting it in a jar?
I hope we know what we're doing.

30
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,887
If Angelus knows how to destroy
the Beast, it's all we've got.

31
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,290
- Yeah, otherwise, permanent midnight.
- He's dangerous.

32
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:02,449
I know.

33
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,683
I've seen it.

34
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,125
- But we're doing the right thing.
- As long as we're very careful.

35
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:14,127
Before Angelus was ensouled,
his viciousness was mythic.

36
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:17,046
- You all know his history.
- Killing, maiming, torture.

37
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:21,525
Puppies nailed to walls. Thank you,
Cordelia, for that lovely image.

38
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,008
But I think that brings us up to speed.

39
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,408
There's only one thing
Angelus will focus on.

40
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,963
Getting free, so he can slaughter us.

41
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:35,372
We're Angel's only link to humanity.
Angelus will hate us for that.

42
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,885
He'll want to make us suffer.

43
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,889
Watch the monitor when I go down.

44
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,613
Pay attention to everything he does,
everything he says.

45
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:50,410
He'll try to confuse you. To play on
your emotions so you drop your guard.

46
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,242
If he succeeds even for an instant...

47
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,803
...we're all dead.

48
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,567
I've spent my life training for this
and I'm still not ready.

49
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:08,048
He's smarter than I am
and a great deal more focused.

50
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:12,445
He'll exploit everything Angel knows
about me and go for the jugular.

51
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,243
Whatever he's got,
I'm not going to see it coming.

52
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:22,288
ANGELUS SINGS:
<i>If you're going to the woods tonight</i>

53
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,763
<i>You won 't believe your eyes</i>

54
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:31,803
<i>If you're going to the woods tonight</i>
<i>You're in for a big surprise</i>

55
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,962
Soulless

56
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:41,612
Angelus.

57
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,050
ANGELUS:
Wes.

58
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:50,083
Why the long face?
Aren't you happy to see me?

59
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,448
WES: Should I be?
ANGELUS: Well, if it wasn't for you...

60
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:56,652
...and your shaman friend,
I wouldn't be here. I'm feeling the love.

61
00:05:56,853 --> 00:06:00,084
- The choice was Angel's.
- Angel-schmangel.

62
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,528
You're the man with the brains.

63
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:06,322
- You're comfortable?
- Nice acoustics.

64
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,046
Wouldn't hate a chair.

65
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,363
You'll have to forgive
the accommodations.

66
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:15,651
The last time you were free,
you terrorized Sunnydale.

67
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,002
That slayer, she's a pistol.

68
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,923
I've imagined this moment many times.

69
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,210
Years of study, research.

70
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:32,163
I've read everything
ever written about you.

71
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,568
Stop, I'm blushing.

72
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,442
To be one-on-one
with the legendary Angelus.

73
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:44,132
As a former Watcher...

74
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:45,646
...it's a high point.

75
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:49,846
Buttering me up, getting me all relaxed.

76
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:54,445
Not the most innovative
interrogation technique...

77
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,490
...but okay, I'll play.

78
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:59,730
- Is it a game?
- Hey, open book.

79
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,485
Anything you want to know.

80
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,766
How sweet that virgin Gypsy tasted.

81
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:11,493
The special smell of a newborn's neck.
My first nun. Now, that's a great story.

82
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:16,248
- We could start there.
- Don't be coy, Wes.

83
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:20,531
You're just dying to know
about the big Beastie.

84
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:23,412
- Fire away.
- All right.

85
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:27,612
- Did you know the Beast?
- Well, now that's a question.

86
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:32,051
Not a great question.
Not even an insightful question.

87
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,687
Not a Wyndam-Pryce-worthy question.

88
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,890
If you knew the Beast,
why wouldn't Angel remember?

89
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:41,165
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't
remember the good times.

90
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,649
Maybe he won't let himself.
So like him.

91
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,769
Here's one for you.

92
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,164
What's the deal with Angel
and the <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark?</i>

93
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:56,127
- The movie?
- Perfect-day fantasy he came up with.

94
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:59,649
Caves, booby traps...

95
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,963
...the requisite phallic sword.

96
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:06,132
- He fought the Beast in the fantasy.
- Real candy-ass.

97
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,769
- The Beast?
- Angel. Not enough to be the hero.

98
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,845
Couldn't be happy unless
the whole gang's pitching in.

99
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:17,285
- So he killed the Beast in his fantasy?
- Had to, to get what he wanted.

100
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,882
We all want something, Wes.

101
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,283
It's the way of the world.
Everybody's got an agenda.

102
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,810
And you're going to tell me mine.

103
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:30,452
You want to come down here,
get your vital stats on Lava Boy...

104
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,888
...be a hero.
- I want to know how to kill the Beast.

105
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:36,045
- It has nothing to do with being a hero.
- Sure, it does.

106
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,443
But why now?

107
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,527
Can't be because
there's an apocalypse coming.

108
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:45,083
- Always one of those around the corner.
- Enlighten me.

109
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:48,285
The foul rag-and-bone shop
of the heart.

110
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,445
That's where you live.

111
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,966
Meaning?

112
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:58,405
You want to impress the girl.
Move in, get her to love you.

113
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:03,089
And after a couple of days of flowers
and chocolate-covered cherries...

114
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,765
...you'll bend her over the counter...

115
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,804
Is that supposed to rattle me?

116
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:14,210
Kind of bony for my taste...

117
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:18,651
...but different strokes.
- The Beast called you an adversary.

118
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:25,082
Bet he loves to rub that shiny bald head
against her soft, milky skin.

119
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:27,892
Mmm. Good.

120
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,685
ANGELUS:
<i>Come on, Wes.</i>

121
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:39,083
<i>Not like your school-girl crush</i>
<i>is a secret.</i>

122
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:45,244
Charles, remember, we can't
believe anything Angelus says.

123
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,172
How about the stuff that's true?
Can we believe that?

124
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:52,890
He distorts everything.
He lies with the truth.

125
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,409
It's part of what makes him
so dangerous.

126
00:09:56,573 --> 00:10:00,327
- Yeah, don't let him get to you, kiwi.
- He's not the only one that's getting.

127
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,131
Charles.

128
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,885
I know.

129
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,565
I know.

130
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,924
It's just words.

131
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,687
You found a vulnerability, exploited it.
Well done. Can we move on now?

132
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,641
I'm just getting started.

133
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,524
Tell you this.

134
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:25,088
All that digging you've been doing
on the horny giant?

135
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,406
Wrong place.

136
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,448
And the right place?

137
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,929
I could tell you.

138
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,532
It wouldn't be sporting.

139
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:39,726
But you were adversaries,
you and the Beast.

140
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:45,486
Guy like me: Friends, enemies,
hard to keep track.

141
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,288
If he was an enemy, I'd be doing
you a favor destroying him.

142
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:55,086
You know, you're not fooling anyone.

143
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,285
Get some new clothes,
cool haircut, hit the gym.

144
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:02,372
You're still the same loser none of the
other kids wanted to sit with at lunch.

145
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:06,771
Yet you're locked in that cage,
and I'm out here.

146
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,651
So?

147
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,172
You got no leverage.
What are you gonna do, kill me?

148
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,571
If I have to.

149
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,046
Wait'll they drop, Wes,
then try that line again.

150
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:27,211
I'll put your soul back.
You won't talk, no problem.

151
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,489
We'll bring Angel back
and be no worse off.

152
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,968
Making you a failure again.

153
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:35,688
You want to waste my time,
you can rot down here.

154
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:41,328
Nice stamina, Wes.
No wonder Fred's not interested.

155
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:44,048
Whatever your connection
to the Beast, clearly...

156
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:46,044
...you don't know anything
that can help.

157
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:51,606
ANGELUS: This where I'm supposed to
get defensive? Talk to prove you wrong?

158
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:54,123
What else have you got?

159
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,406
You must hate it...

160
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,882
...that Angel fights evil.

161
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,930
ANGELUS:
Eats you up inside, doesn't it?

162
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:06,405
Seeing all those idiots flock
around him, calling him a champion.

163
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,123
Anyone ever call you a champion?

164
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,811
- I do my part.
ANGELUS: Right.

165
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:19,571
Like letting Lilah suck Lorne's brain.
Or here's an oldie, but a goodie.

166
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:23,408
Faith. Good job being her Watcher.

167
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,925

00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:31,449
- He's so relaxed.
- It's like he's not even in a cage.

508
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,243
In his mind, he's not.

509
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:40,725
- You get anything off him?
- Let me put it this way, MoonPie...

510
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:45,091
...you don't want to know.
- I don't. I definitely don't.

511
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:47,721
CHARLES: What happened?
CONNOR: Vamps.

512
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,243
- They didn't get the Svear?
- No, the Beast did.

513
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,643
Slaughtered the entire family.

514
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:57,362
- He found a way to kill them after all.
- So much for our big priestess rescue.

515
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:00,446
Are we sure Angelus doesn't
know anything more?

516
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:03,923
- I mean, maybe we should talk to him.
WES: No.

517
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,851
He's told us everything
he's going to.

518
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:09,050
Which means our plan,
turning Angel into a soulless monster...

519
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,885
...it's a bust.

520
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:19,128
- Lf Angelus can't help us...
- It's time to bring back Angel.

521
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,802
Oh, and he's usually so chatty.

522
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:29,644
Rough night.

523
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:33,249
We'll need the shaman.

524
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:43,047
ANGELUS: Here I thought
you'd be halfway to Georgia by now.

525
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:45,602
CORDELIA:
I told you I'd be back.

526
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:48,446
- I'm back.
- How'd the little field trip turn out?

527
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,371
The priestesses still feisty?

528
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:56,205
We found a little boy, his sister,
mom, dad, grandma, all dead.

529
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:59,849
Oh, God, I'm always missing
the fun stuff.

530
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:03,762
- The Beast butchered them.
- So?

531
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:08,165
Did you bring me back a souvenir?
Maybe a stray baby toe?

532
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,652
[CHUCKLES]

533
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:13,203
Come on, Cordy,
where's your sense of humor?

534
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:16,769
- Guess I lost it.
- Don't blame me for your little debacle.

535
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,970
- I told you everything I know.
- Too late.

536
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,164
And whose fault is that?

537
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:27,891
Doesn't matter. I showed you mine,
now it's time to show me yours.

538
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:33,770
The deal was, you give us information,
we save the world, you get me.

539
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:37,289
Well, world not saved.

540
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,722
You're not thinking
I'm just gonna let this go?

541
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:56,972
Not seeing a whole lot of other options,
with the big steel cage and all.

542
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,403
I won't be in here forever.

543
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:02,050
About another hour.

544
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:05,683
I forgot to tell you the best part.
We're putting your soul back.

545
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:10,721
- Not gonna happen.
- Oh, but it is.

546
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,532
Just in time for the primo
apocalypse that's coming.

547
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:17,049
- Too bad. I know how you love those.
- Been looking forward to it all day.

548
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:20,171
- Still am.
- The thing is, you're never coming back.

549
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,803
- Angel's gonna make sure of that.
- We'll see.

550
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:27,845
What you don't get, Angelus...

551
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:32,165
...is that you're nobody.
Just a disease.

552
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:36,810
And Angel can't wait to be rid of you.

553
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:40,768
Think I'll start with the twins.

554
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:46,207
I just love a woman
with nice ripe thighs.

555
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:53,241
Not even close.

556
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:59,044
The more you piss me off,
the longer I'll keep you alive.

557
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:04,052
Oh, something tells me
she's a screamer.

558
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:08,607
CORDELIA:
Okay, let's...

559
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:13,611
- What?
- Angel's soul.

560
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:20,203
It's gone.
