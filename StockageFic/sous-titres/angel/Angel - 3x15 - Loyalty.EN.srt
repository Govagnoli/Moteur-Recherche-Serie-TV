1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,910
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,750
Holtz, we took a lot from you,
that's true.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,230
Now's your chance. Do it.
Finish it while you still can.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,320
You can't just let him walk
away. Not after what you swore to me.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,960
Go out and find others like you,
people who have suffered as we have.

6
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,489
- What's this?
- Take Groo someplace nice.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,789
You'd like that.

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,219
- What about my son?
- He has a role to play.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,769
I've located commentaries on
the prophecies concerning your son.

10
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,579
You gotta admire the loyalty.
All night here, hitting the books...

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,960
...logging serious alone-time delving
into the secret mysteries of....

12
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,509
Man, Wesley needs a life.

13
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,140
I wonder if he found
anything new about Connor.

14
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,259
Don't touch that.

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:02,479
They're just in a specific order.
I'll be lost.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,469
What time is it?

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,060
Time for Wesley to wakey-wakey,
isn't that right, Connor?

18
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,650
I must have lost track of the time.

19
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,579
I meant to go home.

20
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,659
Road to hell, right?

21
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,230
You find any answers
in all these stuffy books?

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,439
He already knows the answer,
he's looking for the question.

23
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,879
Have we heard from Cordelia recent--?

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,209
Wanna see Connor do something cool?

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,849
I'm teaching him how to die.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,579
Don't.

27
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,939
Ticktock, Wes.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,620
Running out of time.

29
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,090
Running out of time.

30
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,709
Morning, Wes. You been here all night?

31
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,840
You'd think somebody was killing him.
All night, the screaming and crying....

32
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,849
- Colic is the worst.
- I hold him, I walk him. Nothing works.

33
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,330
Have you tried the vacuum?

34
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,629
Sometimes the white noise from a
motor will put a colicky baby to sleep.

35
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,900
You know, I read about that.

36
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,810
The problem is, I can't run the vacuum
while my older one is sleeping.

37
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,939
You could try taping the sound.
Leave it playing by the crib.

38
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,030
I should have thought of that.
Mr. Dad to the rescue.

39
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,050
Mrs. Ferguson?

40
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,379
Excuse me.

41
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,169
"Mr. Dad."
Check me out. I'm Mr. Dad.

42
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,960
You okay, Wes?

43
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,710
Just a bit tired, is all.

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,949
Probably good you got
out of the office.

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,969
You've been all holed up with
all those prophecies and books.

46
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,349
I've been working on
a particularly difficult translation.

47
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,270
Is it about Connor?
Anything we have to worry about?

48
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,969
- Mr. Angel?
- We're up, kiddo.

49
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,379
- You coming in?
- In case you forget to ask anything.

50
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,269
Always better to have
an extra pair of ears, right?

51
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,449
It's like a....
It's like a soft gurgle.

52
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,259
Or a wheeze. It might be a wheeze.

53
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,550
I heard it last night
when I fed him. Hear it?

54
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,250
I hear a normal, healthy heart.

55
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,779
You don't understand,
I got, like, really good hearing.

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean really good hearing.

57
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,819
Well, most first-time parents do.

58
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,370
This wheeze or gurgle happened
while you were feeding him?

59
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,490
- Is that bad? What is it?
- In my professional opinion...

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,069
...it's called digestion.

61
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,250
During your exam, you didn't notice
anything abnormal about him?

62
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,029
Wes, what kind of question is that?
Did you?

63
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,509
No, your son is just fine.

64
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,470
When will we get
the results from the blood test?

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,350
- In a week. It's just a precaution.
- But Connor's healthy?

66
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,879
As healthy as a human being
can possibly be.

67
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,709
- Did you hear that? Thank you.
- No problem.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,459
Thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks.

69
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,910
Angel? You can let go
of the doctor now.

70
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,069
Right. Come on, kiddo. Yeah.
Thanks.

71
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,439
Take care.

72
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,310
And they bitch about my cold hands.

73
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah.

74
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,360
Did you get turned around?
You're supposed to be in Exam 3.

75
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,800
My mistake.

76
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,660
No last name, no bank account.
How you ordering stuff off the Web?

77
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,610
It's not hard. You hack
into the shipping database...

78
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:23,019
...find somebody who's ordering what you
want and substitute your information.

79
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,959
Except that would be
high-tech robbery.

80
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,680
I memorized Cordelia's
credit card number.

81
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,680
Low-tech robbery.

82
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,620
- Some kind of boomerang vamp stake?
- No. They're itty-bitty hockey sticks.

83
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,480
Check this out.

84
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,829
How cute is this?

85
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,769
- Seriously.
- You got too much time on your hands.

86
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:56,230
- Come on, you think it's adorable.
- At least I'm manly enough to deny it.

87
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,910
Things have been slow since Cordelia
and the Groosalugg went on vacation.

88
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm actually jonesing for a throw-down
with something mean and nasty.

89
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,149
Cordelia hasn't called once w;th
a vision. Do they have phones there?

90
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,829
Maybe they're not near a phone.
It's a vacation.

91
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,790
They're not gonna waste it all
in a dark hotel room...

92
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,500
...together, where food's delivered
and there's no reason to go outside--

93
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,620
- Hockey's a great sport.
- It's the whitest sport known to man.

94
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,790
- But the games are indoors, at night.
- Got you.

95
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,779
I know it's a little early to think
about stuff like this...

96
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,910
...but I can't wait to watch him,
you know, grow up.

97
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,560
For him to lose his first tooth.
Learn how to ride a bike.

98
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,470
I wanna help him pick out a tux
for his senior prom.

99
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,509
I just can't wait to see
who he's gonna be.

100
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,300
I know that's mushy,
but he just makes me so happy.

101
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,660
- He shoots, he scores!
- Sure, of course, with no defender.

102
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,110
- Bring it on.
- I think Connor is gonna be a center.

103
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,290
- What you got?
- Controlling the puck.

104
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,819
- Ditching the left wing.
- Come on.

105
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:17,420
Taking it all the way to the crease--

106
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,379
Yeah, you know,
this isn't regulation size.

107
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,399
Excuse me.
Is this Angel Investigations?

108
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,990
I need your help.

109
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,450
Last Monday night, my son Timothy
snuck out of the house.

110
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,389
He left to go to the pier.

111
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,350
He loved the lights
on the Ferris wheel.

112
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,669
So I went after him. I searched
the pier, the arcade.... Nothing.

113
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,409
So I sat up all night
and waited for him to come home.

114
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,059
When did he return home?
Right before dawn?

115
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,620
Yeah. But his face was....

116
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:03,110
There was something wrong
with his face.

117
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,429
And he was so angry.

118
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,169
He was calling me names
and pounding on the door...

119
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:14,899
...and screaming at me to let him in.

120
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,519
It scared me.

121
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,960
I was afraid of my own son.

122
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,779
And then he just...

123
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,669
...went up in flames.

124
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,320
If you'd let him in,
he would have killed you.

125
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,289
- At least he'd still be alive.
- No.

126
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,059
What came to your door wasn't your son.
It looked like him, but it wasn't him.

127
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,490
Maybe I could have found
a way to turn him back.

128
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,600
When somebody becomes a vampire,
there's no turning back.

129
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,259
No matter how much you believe there's
some part of him you can save...

130
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,940
...all that's left is an evil thing.

131
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,750
You say your son went
to the pier that night?

132
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,519
- Gunn, why don't you do a little recon.
- I could gear up and take care of it.

133
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,980
No. If there's a nest, we go as a group.
Strictly reconnaissance.

134
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:10,460
Fred and I will check it out.

135
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,350
If I could have found
that thing myself...

136
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,559
...I would have killed it
with my bare hands.

137
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,720
It made me afraid
of my own little boy.

138
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,909
I don't understand any of this.
I don't know what to do.

139
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,289
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce heads
the staff at Angel Investigations.

140
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,309
Doles out assignments, specializes
in reference and research.

141
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:39,740
This woman, Fred, is the science
expert. It's unclear if she's a fighter.

142
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:45,110
Finally, Charles Gunn. Big, strong,
could be a formidable opponent...

143
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,799
...though he seems a bit impulsive.
We may be able to use that.

144
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,610
Good work, Aubrey.

145
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,940
Thanks, boss.

146
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't understand. How can
these people work for a vampire?

147
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,009
- I once made a pact with a demon.
- So you could get to Angelus.

148
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,029
So you could kill a vampire.

149
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,899
I'm sure they believe their reasons
are good, however misguided.

150
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,639
Things aren't always black and white,
good and evil.

151
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,710
What about Angelus?

152
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,210
He's evil.

153
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,389
Chains would be good now.

154
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,240
I knew you were meant for this.

155
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,029
We need to get moving. Events are
happening quicker than I could've hoped.

156
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,669
Thank God. I'm starting to get bored.

157
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,259
You know, my barber has
the same problem with his scissors.

158
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,450
Hence the bad haircut.

159
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,549
Love the whole chained,
undead look you got going on.

160
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,100
Really sets off your fern.

161
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,669
Stand down, Justine.
It's only Sahjhan.

162
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,659
"Only Sahjhan"? See, that's
the trouble with you, Holtz.

163
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,549
If you'd only done what you'd--

164
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,590
Can we have a little privacy here?

165
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,820
- No.
- Fine. You owe me a dead vampire.

166
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,860
Yes, well, how should I put this?
What are you going to do about it?

167
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,440
Nothing, that's what you'll do.

168
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,509
It's all you can do, or else you
wouldn't have brought me here.

169
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,190
You've done your part, Sahjhan.
Now let me do mine.

170
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:17,049
What is your part? Recruiting a bunch
of paramilitary Moonie freaks...

171
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,259
...to play Candid Camera
with Angel's buddies? That's crap.

172
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,070
Admit it, you're a coward.

173
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,899
And I bet Caroline would agree.
You remember her, don't you?

174
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,710
Your dead wife,
mother of your dead kids.

175
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,080
How'd they die? Who swore revenge?

176
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,980
Any of this ringing a bell?

177
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,840
- Get out.
- Or what? You can't kill me.

178
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,399
But I can trap your dimensional
essence in a Resikhian urn.

179
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:55,840
They last a lifetime.
That is, if you live forever.

180
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,289
This isn't over, Holtz.

181
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,149
I know it's dangerous.
I don't care. You're a wizard.

182
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,299
Because it's the right thing to do.

183
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,269
Then because I'm paying you an obscene
amount of money. Do it and call me.

184
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,110
- Hey, Wes?
- What is it?

185
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,110
- You're busy, I'll come back.
- What can I do for you?

186
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:26,769
Nothing.

187
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:30,049
I just wanted to compliment you.

188
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,799
You were really there for that woman,
Aubrey, who lost her kid at the pier.

189
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,720
Thank you.

190
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,029
You've been working so hard,
staring at all these books.

191
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,840
As a book-starer myself,
I know how crazy-making that can be.

192
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,419
You should get out of here.
Go for a walk. You deserve it.

193
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,029
I was thinking maybe
you could call Aubrey.

194
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:59,620
Her paperwork says she's single.
She probably needs a friend.

195
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,129
Fred?

196
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,840
We're not here to date.
We're here to do a job.

197
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,100
Now, why don't you go to the pier
and do your job.

198
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,730
Is everything all right?
Are they taking care of you?

199
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,820
No, Mom, this is Lilah.
You called Lilah.

200
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,090
Do you need anything?
Do you need money?

201
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,830
No, Mom, I can't come over.
I'm in Los Angeles.

202
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,450
You know that.

203
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,220
Don't cry. Mom, please stop it.

204
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,409
I'm gonna have to call you back.

205
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,909
- You don't have an appointment.
- That's it?

206
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,149
No "Wow, how'd he do that?"
No screaming in terror?

207
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,840
You 21st century types are so jaded.

208
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,169
You're Sahjhan, aren't you?
I may be jaded, but I do my homework.

209
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,649
And there's a girl downstairs with
records on everything.

210
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,279
- My company rocks.
- Yes, I'm familiar with your firm.

211
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,049
In this and other dimensions.

212
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:19,629
You're a time shifter. You
recruited Holtz in the 18th century...

213
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,659
...put him on ice so he could pop up and
stake Angel when he's least expecting it.

214
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,639
Considering I have yet to dance
on Angel's pile of dust...

215
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,529
...I'm imagining that Holtz isn't
working fast enough for you.

216
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,490
And you think my firm could
expedite the process.

217
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,289
More or less.

218
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,809
Wolfram & Hart's official policy is
to let Angel live until he is useful.

219
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,649
I'm sworn to obey that policy.

220
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,919
Is there some other way
we can help you?

221
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,799
I have a plan. But for it to work...

222
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,110
...I require a very rare
and valuable ingredient.

223
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:07,490
Getting it will be difficult,
if not impossible.

224
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,089
- I need the blood of Angel's son.
- Got it.

225
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,829
Got it? How'd you get it?

226
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,809
Swiped it from his doctor's office.
I don't know what good it will do you.

227
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,410
Boys in the lab said
it was completely normal.

228
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,619
That's because they're looking
for the wrong thing.

229
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,529
So I'm looking
for anything suspicious...

230
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,299
...like small, dark places where
somebody could get grabbed...

231
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,450
...any blacked-out cars or vans,
or pale, bumpy people with sharp teeth.

232
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,490
Don't worry about seeing any actual
vamps. The sun's still up in the sky.

233
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,069
Even so, as professionals,
shouldn't we be aware--?

234
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,349
Ring toss. Want me
to be all macho and win you a prize?

235
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,450
- Charles.
- All right, you can be the macho one.

236
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,529
Look at that stuffed bunny.
Could you win it for me?

237
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:07,450
- This is so wrong.
- You're right. I don't want the bunny.

238
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,970
- We're supposed to be working.
- No, we're doing some bogus recon.

239
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,829
- Still, it's our job.
- Actually, this was my job.

240
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,920
Wes never said to bring you. Probably
sent me so he could chat up my girl.

241
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,400
Wesley wouldn't do that.

242
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,829
I'm your girl?

243
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,180
Wes knows about us,
and you didn't let me know?

244
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,059
You knew he was interested in you.
Now he knows we're seeing each other.

245
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:36,740
I don't think he likes the idea of us
dating while we're working together.

246
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,859
He said something to you, didn't he?

247
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,880
You got my back, right?

248
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,619
You told him what we do with our
personal lives isn't his business, right?

249
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,500
Oh, you bet I.... Didn't.

250
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,069
I like you and I want
to keep liking you.

251
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,480
Then do.

252
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,509
Maybe when we're out like this,
we should just work.

253
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,130
No. Can't do it that way.

254
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,420
Maybe I'm greedy, but I want it all.
The great girl and the great job.

255
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:12,069
I'm not giving up either
without a fight. How about you?

256
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,880
Good.

257
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,599
Now, how about we go looking
for some vampires?

258
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,619
It's coming at you.

259
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,900
I have to leave for a while.

260
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,480
Wes, what's going on?
You've been on edge for days.

261
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,890
Talk to me.

262
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,750
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

263
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,220
You mean, with Connor?

264
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:59,680
You didn't mean to give Uncle Wesley
such a headache, now, did you?

265
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,970
I won't be long.

266
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,809
Hey, Wes?

267
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,319
Thanks.

268
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,569
You're a good friend.

269
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:14,829
Isn't he?

270
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,059
We should be getting back.

271
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:23,710
Hang on.
I'm getting a tingle.

272
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,779
I thought we were gonna keep
that out of the workplace.

273
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,599
Not that kind of tingle.

274
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,740
I don't see anything suspicious.

275
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:42,099
Except that guy trying to break
into that building over there.

276
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,839
The carousel closed hours ago.

277
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,029
- Is that a vampire?
- Only one way to find out.

278
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,789
- Charles, what are you doing?
- My job.

279
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,809
I didn't walk the pier all day just to
go home and file a report with Wesley.

280
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,509
- Let's finish this.
- We're not supposed to be doing this.

281
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,779
When I say "go," run!

282
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,839
- Get out of here. Go!
- But--

283
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,319
- They're gonna kill him.
- Maybe.

284
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,759
- Shouldn't we do some--?
- No. That's not why we're here.

285
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,789
Behind you!

286
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,809
Well, what do you know.

287
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,650
Fred, why are you still here?

288
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,240
I got your back.

289
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,700
Well, actually, I got his back.

290
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,079
Thanks.

291
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,720
Thirty-four degrees,
12 minutes north...

292
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,279
... 118, 21...

293
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,210
...west.

294
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,539
This...

295
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,509
...must be it.

296
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,529
You're supposed to be a statue.

297
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,250
Guess you are.

298
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,680
Sort of.

299
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:59,210
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kill that wizard.

300
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,970
Accept this offering,
and open the gates of truth.

301
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,500
How dare you call on the loa?

302
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,279
I come in supplication, O great one...

303
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,720
...begging for answers to questions
only your power can reveal.

304
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,990
You have answers, human.
You search now only for the question.

305
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:53,000
Is it true? Will Angel really kill his
son as it says in the prophecies?

306
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,829
That the vampire will devour
his child is certain.

307
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,789
The dark question you harbor
is only, when?

308
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,680
No. The dark question
I harbor is, how do I stop it?

309
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,059
It cannot be stopped.

310
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,369
It has to be stopped!
There must be a way--

311
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,269
Your insolence is displeasing.

312
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,210
You try chatting
with a cranky hamburger.

313
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,369
You risk your life, human,
calling on the loa.

314
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:31,220
Perhaps what you really seek is death.
The pain in your heart begs for it.

315
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,930
Then do it and be done.
Nothing else will stop me.

316
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,809
Simple mortal,
your pain is just beginning.

317
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,569
Betrayal and agony lie in wait.

318
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,109
And time is running out.
Yet still you ignore the question.

319
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,619
All right, then when?
When will this happen?

320
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:54,480
The first portent will shake the earth.
The second will burn the air.

321
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,349
The last will turn the sky to blood.

322
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:04,759
An earthquake?
That's the first portent?

323
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:09,299
- We live in California.
- Earthquake, fire, blood.

324
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,440
Be heedful of the signs, human,
and trouble the loa no more.

325
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,869
I need a drink.
Scotch, 30-year-old, two ice cubes.

326
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,099
Certainly.

327
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,849
Not on your best day. Bye.

328
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,799
Enjoy.

329
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,519
Sorry I'm late.

330
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,609
Kind of ironic,
my being a time shifter and all.

331
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,480
- It's on.
- It's on?

332
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,410
Our plan? The Angel plan? On.

333
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,809
I outsourced the labor,
buried the costs.

334
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,420
We shouldn't have any problem
with the firm. Good seeing you.

335
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,799
Okay, but let's skip the small talk
and get down to business.

336
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,069
I time-skipped 133 years for this.
Would a little conversation kill you?

337
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,150
Right. 'Cause we're on a date?
I met you here so we could talk freely.

338
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,720
So let's talk freely.

339
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,079
Would it impress you if I told you
I invented daylight-savings time?

340
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,990
Why do you want Angel dead?
It's the only thing I couldn't find.

341
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,940
Boy, all work and no play.

342
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:42,630
I have my reasons.

343
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,019
How about you?
Dyed-in-the-wool company gal...

344
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,380
...why risk it all to kill Angel?

345
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,819
We have our history.

346
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:53,460
Well, same here.

347
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,420
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

348
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,710
Then what are you afraid of?

349
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:03,660
You may be insubstantial,
but I can still smell the fear.

350
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,539
Wow. Where does the time go?

351
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,180
So when does this plan go into effect?

352
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,970
It's already started.

353
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,400
Hi. Sorry to interrupt your staring.
You looked into it.

354
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,990
Aubrey. I didn't hear you come in.

355
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:40,910
Please.

356
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,029
I got your message that
everything was taken care of.

357
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,839
I can't tell you
how grateful I am to you.

358
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:55,130
It might have been too late
for Timothy...

359
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,359
...but at least those monsters won't
be able to take someone else's son.

360
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:06,839
"Monsters." I don't recall mentioning
there were more than one.

361
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:11,599
Well, you did say before
that there could be a nest.

362
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,089
Well, thanks for the check.
We'll mail you the receipt.

363
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,170
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but are you okay?

364
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,339
No offense, but you look
a little rough around the edges.

365
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,990
I'm not sleeping very well.

366
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,349
Would you like to go out?
Get a cup of coffee or something?

367
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,349
You mean, with you?

368
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,769
To be perfectly honest with you...

369
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,450
...I could use a friend right now.

370
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,009
Ever since my son was....

371
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,960
It gets lonely.

372
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,000
You're good.

373
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,349
I like the "lonely" thing.

374
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,380
- What?
- Yeah, "lonely." That was a nice touch.

375
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,890
- Moves like a fighter, not a victim.
- Yes.

376
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,230
You set up my friends.
They could have been killed.

377
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:21,029
But they weren't. Your friends
are still alive. My little boy isn't.

378
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,279
I'm sorry about your son.

379
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,059
Is that how Holtz found you?
Because of what happened to your son?

380
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,309
You're right to protect him.
Holtz is one of the good guys.

381
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,720
He has every right to hate me.

382
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,329
And if he ever comes close
to any of my people ever again...

383
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,200
...or tries to touch a hair
on my son's head, I'll kill him.

384
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,579
And anyone who gets in the way.
You might wanna mention that.

385
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,220
Good boy. That's my little guy.

386
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,150
Your first earthquake.

387
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:23,500
Behind you!

388
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,549
This tiny girl....
Outsized, outmatched, outnumbered.

389
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:33,609
And she survived.

390
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:37,400
Why? Because she was willing not to.

391
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,660
She was prepared to die for the cause
rather than abandon her comrade.

392
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,210
We, too, must be willing to die.
But more so.

393
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:52,539
Study this carefully. You'll be
fighting these two very soon.

394
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,650
Perhaps sooner than I expected.

395
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,220
They found you out.

396
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,329
- I'm sorry.
- It's not important.

397
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:14,819
I am annoyed you allowed
yourself to be followed.

398
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,619
Don't blame her.

399
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,670
I would have found you eventually.

400
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:29,470
Maybe we should cut out his tongue.

401
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,400
- Send a message to Angelus.
- Maybe.

402
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,619
Or perhaps you could lie on the floor
and gag for a while.

403
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,690
I didn't come here to fight.
I'm not your enemy.

404
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,359
But you do have trouble
making the distinction.

405
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,769
- You're fighting the wrong man.
- Angelus?

406
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,890
No. Angel.

407
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,579
He's not Angelus anymore.
He's a good man.

408
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,559
- He's not even a man.
- Nevertheless, he has a soul now.

409
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,900
Yes, that he might know the pain
he's inflicted on his countless victims.

410
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,869
A brilliant curse, I admit. Gypsies
have a knack for creative vengeance.

411
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:14,920
Where they fail, however,
is in the execution of justice.

412
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,210
And that I will have.

413
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,599
If it's a sacrifice you require,
take me.

414
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,180
Angel's no more responsible
for the crimes of Angelus than I am.

415
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,049
Was it your hands that held down my
wife as she was violated and murdered?

416
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:34,900
That wrapped around my son's neck
and snapped it like kindling?

417
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,430
Were yours the hands
that clutched at my daughter...

418
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:42,279
...as she was turned into
a creature damned for eternity?

419
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,769
Angelus is in his nature.
The beast will re-emerge.

420
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,289
You've seen it, you know it.
And that is why you are here.

421
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,460
You're afraid
he's going to kill the child.

422
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,299
And you're right.

423
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,549
Your infiltration was more
successful than I had realized.

424
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,360
I don't need prophecies
to tell me what is plain.

425
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:13,440
So long as the child remains
with the demon, it's not safe.

426
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,440
Well, I must have misunderstood.

427
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,650
I thought it was a blood vendetta.
You really want to protect Angel's son.

428
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,050
- You don't believe me?
- Not sure, really.

429
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,780
It could be the low, scary voice
that's giving me trouble.

430
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,630
It's time to make a decision,
Mr. Wyndam-Pryce.

431
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,289
My army is strong
and will only increase in number.

432
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,239
Fight against us,
and this war will become a bloodbath.

433
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,210
This isn't war. It's revenge.

434
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,059
What's wrong with revenge?
It's all some of us have left.

435
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:58,619
I can't know what
it's been like for any of you.

436
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:01,940
You might, soon enough.

437
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:09,170
When I put my son's body into the
ground, I had to open the coffin...

438
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,179
...just to know
that he really was in there.

439
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,219
You also may discover that a child's
coffin, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce...

440
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,659
...it weighs nothing.

441
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,539
Barely touched your food.

442
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,519
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:50,659
Look, I've been thinking about
yesterday. I'm not really mad at Wes.

444
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,409
You were right.
I should have stood up to him.

445
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,250
I understand his position.
He's the boss, we gotta respect that.

446
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,559
His job is to keep things tight.
That's a lot of pressure.

447
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:06,579
You aren't changing your mind,
are you?

448
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,719
I mean, about the wanting it all?

449
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,590
As long as we're not
smooching on the job...

450
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,000
...or being sucked underground
by a plant demon...

451
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,900
...I say, why not go for it?

452
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,230
What if we can't manage it all?
The job, the romance....

453
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,389
Emotions are tricky.

454
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,840
They can cloud our judgment,
like at the carousel last night.

455
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:36,159
What if it doesn't work?

456
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,630
So we're back to that?

457
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,590
What if Wesley makes us choose?

458
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,360
I've been fighting vamps and demons
since I was a kid.

459
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,570
That sense of doing good...

460
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,820
...of waking up in the morning
and making the world safer, better....

461
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,889
I've always had that.

462
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,050
But I never had a Fred before.

463
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,480
If we have to, I choose you.

464
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,619
I came on too strong, didn't I?

465
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,550
No.

466
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,679
You came on just right.

467
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,719
Look, let's try not to worry too much.
Wesley's a good man.

468
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:49,530
He'll do the right thing,
He always does,

469
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,019
Come on in.

470
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,809
I'll get you some food.
You're hungry, aren't you?

471
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,030
Have a nice walk?

472
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,360
How you doing?

473
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,230
Really.

474
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,010
I've had better days.

475
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,440
I know the feeling.

476
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,159
I figured it out.

477
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,320
How I really knew about Aubrey.

478
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,710
All that pain, that rage.

479
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:48,070
Only way she could deal was
to join Holtz and take her revenge.

480
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:51,500
You know how I knew that?

481
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,230
Because you would have done the same.

482
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,349
Scares me.

483
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,610
You know?

484
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:11,119
If anything like that happened
to Connor, I don't know what I'd....

485
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,659
I love my son.

486
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,840
Love can be a terrible thing.

487
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,170
I used to think that.
I thought love...

488
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:30,309
...was something that swallowed
you whole, ripped you up inside.

489
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:35,710
But what I feel for Connor,
even that fear...

490
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,909
...Wes, it's....

491
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,010
It's not terrible.

492
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,880
It's beautiful.

493
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,230
What's so funny?

494
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,420
Life.

495
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:10,280
Life is funny.

496
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:14,719
Listening to stupid people
talking to hamburgers is funny.

497
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,570
Worrying about things

00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,130
Got you.

500
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,769
Wes, get out!

501
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,980
It's okay.
It's okay, it's all right.

502
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,960

503
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,860

something to snack on.
