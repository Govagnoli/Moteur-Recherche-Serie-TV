1
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:14,630
Anna.

2
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,940
Master Liam?

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,940
Anna, come closer.

4
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,329
Master Liam, your father....

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,690
He'll be at church repenting his sins.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,059
And he should. Closer, Anna.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,990
Why are you in the shadows?
Are you sick?

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,270
The light.
It bothers my eyes just now.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,350
And I know the reason why.

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,130
Out again all night, is it?
Drinking and whoring!

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,000
I smell the stink of it!

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,130
- And a good morning to you, Father.
- You're a disgrace.

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,039
- If you say so, Father.
- Oh, I do. I do say so.

14
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,189
Have you had enough for one night?
Must you corrupt the servants too?

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,829
Servant, Father.
We have one servant.

16
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,019
Anyway, everyone gets corrupted.

17
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,109
But I find some forms
of corruption more pleasant--

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,790
I'm ashamed to call you my son.

19
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,049
A layabout and a scoundrel.

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,760
You'll never
amount to anything more.

21
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,200
Crazy homeless guy got
out the subway.

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,950
Tore up the car,
threatened some passengers.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,340
They pulled the emergency brake.
They're all shaken up.

24
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,319
- What about the suspect?
- Gone.

25
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,590
- The call said a hostage situation.
- It was.

26
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,000
The suspect escaped?

27
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,579
We're still getting
the story, it's unclear.

28
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,590
You have 24 witnesses.

29
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,299
- They all have the same story.
- Which is?

30
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,390
Suspect went out the top vent
while the train was moving.

31
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,000
- He climbed out of a train?
- He was pulled out.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,520
Pulled out by what?

33
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,490
Get statements.

34
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,310
Guess I can forget
about reading him his rights.

35
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,449
It's...

36
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,169
...not a person, is it?

37
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,919
No. Demon.

38
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,419
- And is it--?
- Dead? Yeah, it's dead.

39
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,319
So they die, then.

40
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,969
Yeah.

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,509
I'm still having trouble with...

42
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,960
- ...this otherworldly stuff.
- Right.

43
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,800
Demons aren't otherworldly.
In fact, they were here...

44
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,769
...first.

45
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,279
Who should I call?

46
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,649
- Don't call anyone. I'll handle it.
- What do I put in my report?

47
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,250
- Do what you always do.
- This isn't a normal case.

48
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,029
It's L.A., you've seen this a lot.
You didn't have a name for it.

49
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,360
No. I think I'd remember.

50
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,220
People can see what they need to.

51
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,050
Nothing about him stood out.

52
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,029
Except maybe the smell.
Just an average homeless guy.

53
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,399
This is what we got.

54
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,550
Average height, weight and build.
This is your best?

55
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,839
You pulled the emergency brake?

56
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,740
Guy came right at me.

57
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,810
- Why?
- He didn't say.

58
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,149
Why did you pull the brake?

59
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,589
It was an emergency.

60
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,610
Let's get this circulated.

61
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,920
- We want this guy, right?
- We'll do our best.

62
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,490
- Can I go?
- Yeah, you can go.

63
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,370
Why's your father here?

64
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,560
- Daddy, why are you here?
- In the neighborhood.

65
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,110
You've been listening
to that police scanner again.

66
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,149
Nothing on cable, anyway.

67
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,500
You had a hostage situation.
I missed the action.

68
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,779
In 35 years, haven't you seen enough?

69
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,600
Do you know I'm lead officer on scene?

70
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,819
You're doing okay, get back to it.

71
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,699
- What's he up to?
- He's checking up on me.

72
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,319
You sound surprised.

73
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,290
No, you don't get to do that.

74
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,470
- What?
- Kill a demon in front of me...

75
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,199
...then act like we'll have coffee
together. That doesn't work.

76
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,980
- How does it work?
- I'm not sure it does.

77
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,819
No offense. I think you're probably
a pretty decent guy for what you are.

78
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,339
This is business, not personal.
I'm not your girlfriend.

79
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,139
Who is he?

80
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,319
Who, that one?

81
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,279
Yes.

82
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,649
He's magnificent.

83
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,350
Oh, yeah. God's gift, all right.

84
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,120
Really? I've never
known God to be so generous.

85
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,019
His lies sound pretty
when stars are out.

86
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,029
He forgets his promises at sunrise.

87
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,029
That's not a problem for me, actually.

88
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,980
Pay attention!

89
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,689
We just have to decide
what the code will be.

90
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,980
- Code?
- For the security system we got.

91
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,829
- What have we been talking about?
- I don't....

92
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,550
It should be something
easy to remember.

93
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,670
Like my birthday.

94
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,740
- I don't know your birthday.
- I'm aware of that.

95
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,300
After 11 months of punching it in,
you won't have any excuses.

96
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,610
- Did you identify it?
- I believe so.

97
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,529
Would that be the demon you
encountered this morning?

98
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,290
Yeah, that's him.

99
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,509
Her. It's a Kwaini.
They're all female.

100
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,569
How do we dispose of them?

101
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,860
Should be standard. Burial in virgin
soil, simple Latinate incantation.

102
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,810
- However....
- What?

103
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,089
Well, it's curious.
According to the books...

104
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,339
...a Kwaini is a peaceful demon.

105
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,970
- Nonviolent.
- Nonviolent?

106
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,750
No. This thing was a fighter.

107
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,959
Not if it's a Kwaini.
Not a fighter by nature.

108
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,100
They're articulate, gentle creatures.

109
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,889
Not capable of
the strength you described.

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,639
Maybe it was just having a bad day.

111
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,110
- Something set it off.
- Clearly.

112
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,110
Forget whether it should've
fought well as it did.

113
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,590
What would make a peaceful demon
attack a train full of commuters?

114
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,750
Something on the train?

115
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,970
Or someone.

116
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,120
- Angel.
- Hi. Can we talk?

117
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,809
- What's up?
- It's about that demon.

118
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,039
If you must discuss this, could
you please not use that word?

119
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,419
It makes me, I don't
know, just uncomfortable.

120
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,960
Just say "evil thing," okay?

121
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,909
- Sure.
- Thanks.

122
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,549
I thought you'd handle it.

123
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,529
I am. It's just that the
evil thing wasn't evil.

124
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,539
The evil thing wasn't evil?

125
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,659
Well, it was an evil thing.

126
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,480
It wasn't an evil-evil thing.

127
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:22,919
There are not evil-evil things?

128
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,980
Well, yeah.

129
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,059
All right. Sorry.

130
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,529
How did you get in here?
It's daylight.

131
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,470
- Sewer system.
- Right. I remember.

132
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,899
- I need the names of the passengers.
- Why?

133
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,409
I think the demon--

134
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,360
- The train was targeted for a reason.
- The "evil thing" needs a reason?

135
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,500
- It was after something, someone.
- Nothing was there.

136
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,169
- Passengers.
- Checked out.

137
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,320
Look into them. We'll start with
the guy who pulled the brake.

138
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,870
- He said--
- It's still dead, right?

139
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,639
- Yeah.
- Good. I'd like to forget about it.

140
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,809
- I think--
- There's nothing here.

141
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,980
Your not evil "evil thing" was just evil.

142
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:06,970
Can't we leave it at that?

143
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,639
I guess you can't blame
her for being skittish,

144
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,299
I don't know. Since she tried
to kill me, it's been different.

145
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,490
She'll come round.

146
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,070
Most people require time to adjust...

147
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,100
...after seeing the dark
forces around us,

148
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,279
- Women, in particular...
- Found it!

149
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,539
...struggle with it.

150
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,769
If she struggles with...

151
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,289
...the bigger picture,
she'll miss the details.

152
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,100
- Details?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,940
Like why a guy who drives a van
would be on a train during work.

154
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,409
Good question,

155
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,730
Anyway, we've located
the Kwaini's body.

156
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,799
- Okay, you'll run the tests?
- Yes,

157
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,639
See you at the office.

158
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,120
- Mr. Lockley?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,460
I'm Angel. We met at your party.

160
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,429
- I'm Katie's friend.
- Did something--?

161
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:33,970
She's fine.

162
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,970
- She with you?
- No. She doesn't know I'm here.

163
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,029
I bet she'd like to know
who else was visiting you.

164
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,120
She thought you were there
because you were worried?

165
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,620
- What do you want?
- What was in that package?

166
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,279
What do you mean?

167
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,980
You took something from the crime
scene that the police didn't find.

168
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:57,659
Who do you work for?

169
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,340
I don't work for anyone.
I'm retired.

170
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,389
I'll find out. I'm telling you
out of respect for Kate.

171
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,740
Are you threatening me?

172
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,720
No. I want to protect your daughter.

173
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,700
Protect my daughter?
From what?

174
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,470
Finding out you weren't there
today because you care.

175
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:19,990
- You got any kids, Angel?
- No.

176
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:23,590
Don't think you
know how a father feels...

177
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,279
...or why he does what he does.

178
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:31,500
Liam! You'll do as I say!

179
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,320
Sweet Kathy. No tears.

180
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,240
- We'll meet again.
- Not if you defy me.

181
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,289
Not as long as I live.

182
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,559
Move away from the door.

183
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,710
Go, but don't expect to come back.

184
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,850
As you wish.
Always just as you wish.

185
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,980
It was a son I wished for! A man!

186
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,049
Instead, God gave me you.
A disappointment!

187
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,049
You couldn't have asked for better.

188
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,210
You told me in word, in glance,
what it is you've required of me.

189
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,580
And I've met your goals, haven't I?

190
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,559
That's madness!

191
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,980
The madness is, I couldn't fail enough.

192
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,610
We'll fix that now.

193
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,159
I fear for you, lad.

194
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,590
And is that all you can find
in your heart for me now, Father?

195
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,700
Who'll take you in? No one!

196
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,679
I'll find a place to sleep,
I tell you that. Out of my way.

197
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:37,919
I was never in your way, boy.

198
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,559
If you go courting trouble,
you're sure to find it!

199
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,019
You know what to do...

200
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,500
...darling boy,

201
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,919
I could show you
things you've never seen,

202
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,850
Why the urge for lunch?

203
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,549
Lunch time, ain't it?

204
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,299
So you drive here for a hot dog?

205
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,409
One of Manny's. Best there is.

206
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,490
I'll let you and Manny speak.

207
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,909
I thought I'd spend time with
my daughter.

208
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,929
So....

209
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,799
- You been good?
- Yeah. Yeah, good.

210
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,759
And how's Angel?

211
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,049
Pardon me?

212
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,320
Tall guy you brought
to my retirement party.

213
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,129
Yeah, I know who you mean.

214
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,230
That ain't a Mexican name,
is it? Angel?

215
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,600
I don't think so.

216
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,240
You two seeing each other?

217
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,159
We were never
seeing each other, Daddy.

218
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,700
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

219
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,029
Must be something. He married?

220
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,100
- No.
- West Hollywood?

221
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,970
Daddy, no.

222
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,919
Angel's just not my type.
Or I'm not his type.

223
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,379
There's a type and it's the wrong one.

224
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,500
He got a job?

225
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,120
Yeah. He's a P.I.

226
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,659
Private investigator. He any good?

227
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,519
Yeah, he's good. Very good.

228
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,460
- He likes working nights.
- That's good.

229
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,230
That's good he's good.

230
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,289
You came here to talk about...

231
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,080
...a guy you saw me with once?

232
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,680
Well, he made an impression.

233
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,559
- You like him?
- No. Not really.

234
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,809
Then what's this all about?

235
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,700
Nothing. Just....

236
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,750
It's not good to be alone.

237
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,170
Well, vivisection confirms it.
This certainly is a Kwaini.

238
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,500
So they become violent?

239
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,809
No. My tests
detected something else.

240
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,059
- What is it?
- Think of it as the adrenal gland.

241
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,609
- It should be a lot smaller.
- What happened?

242
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,920
The inflammation was
caused by this substance.

243
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,990
I found traces of it in
the Kwaini's system.

244
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,160
Know what it is?

245
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,950
Difficult to say
under these conditions.

246
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,819
But what I can tell you is,
it's synthetic...

247
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,529
...and it seems to contain properties
not unlike PCP.

248
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,460
Though more metaphysical in nature.

249
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,970
I found "eye of newt"
as an ingredient...

250
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,710
...added chiefly for
taste rather than kick.

251
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,759
- It was on drugs.
- Yes.

252
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,650
The delivery guy was carrying.

253
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,440
I think it would be fair
to assume it...

254
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,910
...was jonesing to get well, yes.

255
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,210
Not only did this turn it violent,
it enhanced its strength.

256
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,160
Times 20, I would say.

257
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,099
What would happen if
a battle demon took this?

258
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,880
I shudder to think.

259
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,819
Hey, guys?

260
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,769
Why have a security system
if you never turn it on?

261
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,630
I could have been anyone
or anything.

262
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,890
Move your entrails.

263
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,970
So you're back.

264
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:54,339
Good, Mr. "I-Can't-Follow-Suspects-
In-Daylight-Because-I'll-Burn."

265
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,509
- What'd you find?
- I hate following detail.

266
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,700
The voyeuristic side is unseemly.

267
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,329
How about traffic?
And parking? Or the lack of it?

268
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,039
- Not like the movies, is it?
- No. Fortunately, I am.

269
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,400
So it turns out he
really is a delivery guy.

270
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,410
It's not the package
he got from Kate's dad.

271
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,579
He had lunch here
and was in there forever.

272
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,930
Don't know what they served,
but he had leftovers.

273
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,900
That's it. That's the source.

274
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,509
That's where it's all coming from.

275
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,289
Guy's name is Angel.

276
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,289
He's an investigator. A good one.

277
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,180
Why is he looking at our operation?

278
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,970
I don't know.
He's got his reasons.

279
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,220
- What was in the package?
- We agreed--

280
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,549
We agreed that I'd use
my connections...

281
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,019
...to help you move illegal parts.

282
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,950
We didn't agree that I'd remove
crime evidence...

283
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,349
...or use my daughter
for information.

284
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,369
We understand what you've done for us.
We're appreciative.

285
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,230
My advice to you:

286
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,119
Whatever you're moving in
your packages...

287
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,339
...dial it down for a while.

288
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,680
Sound advice, Mr. Lockley.
Thank you.

289
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,690
How should we deal with Angel, sir?

290
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,230
- Kill him.
- Is that wise?

291
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,339
Lockley doesn't like
our arrangement.

292
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,630
Angel's death could turn him.

293
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,680
Kill Lockley too.

294
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,190
Must I think of everything?
Someone get me an adrenal gland.

295
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,390
A man of just 26 years.

296
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,109
Liam was loved
by everyone he met....

297
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,240
We pray that you take his
eternal soul into your care.

298
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,359
Welcome to my world.

299
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,500
It hurts, I know. But not for long.

300
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,180
Birth is always painful.

301
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,299
I could feel them above me...

302
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,940
...as I slept in the earth.

303
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,710
Their heartbeats...

304
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:45,289
- ...blood coursing in their veins.
- Yes.

305
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,990
- Was it a dream?
- A dream for you.

306
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,170
Soon, their nightmare.

307
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,109
You there!

308
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,539
What have you done?

309
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,319
Grave robbers!

310
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,930
You know what to do.

311
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,329
Our Father, who art in heaven...

312
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,099
...hallowed be thy name.

313
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,039
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.
Give us this day--

314
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,130
It all makes sense
now, doesn't it?

315
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,009
Perfect sense.

316
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,019
You can do anything.
Have anyone in the village.

317
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,430
Who will it be?

318
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,589
Anyone?

319
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,039
I thought I'd take the village.

320
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,789
O-5-2-2.

321
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,880
There. See?

322
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:10,410
Right. Now we're protected by
home and workplace security...

323
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,079
...designed to compliment
any room, home or office.

324
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:18,069
No minions of hell get in
without us knowing first.

325
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,289
Sun'll be down soon. I'm going out.

326
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,109
- You'll want backup.
- No. Not this time.

327
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,359
I need to know what we're facing.

328
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,740
Right. A cautious approach is best.

329
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,089
- "Fools rush in."
- No, he wants you to stay here.

330
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:38,369
- Hi.
- Give me that.

331
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,069
- Am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

332
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,410
Here.

333
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,480
What's this?

334
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,670
The list of names you asked for.
Passengers on the train.

335
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,150
Right.

336
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,950
Thank you.

337
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,220
Why'd you change your mind?

338
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,339
- Something my father said.
- Your father?

339
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,710
He asked if you were good.

340
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:11,440
"Good"?

341
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,650
At what you do. I said you were.

342
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,549
Thanks.

343
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:22,130
No matter how uncomfortable I am
with certain circumstances...

344
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,309
...I can't ignore your instincts.

345
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,690
If you think there's more
going on, there probably is.

346
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,440
- I appreciate that.
- And I'd like to be involved.

347
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:34,240
What?

348
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,730
In the case. You find something,
you bring me in, okay?

349
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,539
Are you sure about that?

350
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,500
- Gotta face those demons sometime.
- Right.

351
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,509
Isn't this above and beyond
the call of duty?

352
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,000
Let's try, Wesley.

353
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,380
I understand you
want to protect her...

354
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,849
...from learning about her father.

355
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:04,130
You've already warned him once,
and that's too much.

356
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:08,150
I warned him about me, but he
needs to know who he's working for.

357
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,539
- If he doesn't already know.
- He can't.

358
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,420
Perhaps. Still, he must realize
he's in league with someone...

359
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,710
...who, if not criminal,
is unethical.

360
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,579
- It's his choice.
- I understand.

361
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:25,269
Sometimes the price for a bad choice
isn't equivalent with the offense.

362
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,589
- Go set him straight.
- Thank you.

363
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:39,319
- Hope he knows what he's doing.
- Have faith, Wesley.

364
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,009
Door is open,

365
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,309
Yeah, thanks.

366
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,720
Bathroom window is ajar,

367
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:08,049
Bet you'd like some of this?

368
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:11,480
Hopheads.

369
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,109
Window is open,

370
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:20,410
I'm unplugging it.

371
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,119
All right. Talk.

372
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,230
Kate, pick up. Get your father
out of his house. He's in danger.

373
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,759
- Mr. Lockley, may we come in?
- What do you want?

374
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:38,160
Let us inside.
It concerns your daughter.

375
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,480
He doesn't know, he won't understand.
I'm on way there now.

376
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,769
You're like the rest of them, Father.

377
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,000
Cowering in their houses.
Boarding up the windows.

378
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,009
Smearing garlic in their doorways.

379
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,150
You'd think something evil, vile...

380
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,490
...and monstrous was
terrorizing this village...

381
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:10,970
...and everyone in it.

382
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,970
Be gone, unclean thing.

383
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,630
A demon cannot enter
where he is not welcome.

384
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,369
He must be invited!

385
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,200
That's true. But I was invited.

386
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:40,779
She thought I'd
returned to her, an angel.

387
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,599
Murderer!

388
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:48,730
Strange.

389
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:53,630
Somehow you seemed
taller when I was alive.

390
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,410
Lord, bind this demon now.

391
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,009
To think I ever let
a tiny, trembling thing...

392
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,660
...make me feel like you did.

393
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,690
Deliver me unto
thy protection, Father.

394
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:07,789
You said I wasn't a man.

395
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,539
You told me I was nothing,
and I believed you.

396
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,660
You said I'd never amount
to anything.

397
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,740
You were wrong.

398
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,380
You see, Father...

399
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,470
...I have made something
of myself, after all.

400
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,579
- You boys like a drink?
- We'll wait.

401
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,490
So you said this was about Katie.

402
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,859
Yes. Just a question.

403
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,079
You haven't mentioned
our association, have you?

404
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:01,750
She doesn't know a thing. Why?

405
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,259
We thought that had you
confided in her...

406
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,329
...she might not share
your pragmatism.

407
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,400
Given her position and youth.

408
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,640
You're afraid
she's not crooked like me.

409
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:16,430
She'll never be, I've seen to it.

410
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,890
Providing for her future.
I'm glad we could help.

411
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:22,750
Yeah.

412
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:28,950
I'll thank you when I get my Father
of the Year award. Anything else?

413
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,960
Just one more thing.

414
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,960
- I need you to invite me in.
- What? Get out of here.

415
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:51,269
- Invite me in. Do it now.
- You need to go.

416
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,490
Invite me in!

417
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:55,509
Invite me in!

418
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,140
You're not welcome here.

419
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:05,309
If he dies, I'll come in
and kill you both.

420
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,339
Oh, Daddy! No, Dad!

421
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,519
Kate.

422
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,420
Kate, he invited them in.

423
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,470
- But you knew.
- I wanted to save him...

424
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,329
...he wouldn't let me.

425
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,269
He didn't understand what
he was involved in.

426
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,150
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

427
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,700
Get out. Please get out.

428
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,220
Please get out.

429
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,670
What happened to
"investigating before rushing in"?

430
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,990
- That was plan A. We're on B.
- Plan B is?

431
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,740
Do I have to explain it to you?

432
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,319
No.

433
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:57,150
Unlike my father,
I know what you are.

434
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,480
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:00,750
I see.

436
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,289
I know it won't kill you,
but this will.

437
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:12,789
Told you I knew.

438
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,559
What do you know?
Do you know what walks this city?

439
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,519
You have no comprehension
of what stands before you!

440
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:29,550
A demon who thinks
he's scarier than he is?

441
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,119
Yeah, she knows.

442
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,030
We go, you won't lose your head.

443
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,659
Let's go.

444
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,989
- You're dead.
- I'm already dead.

445
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,719
Welcome to the club.

446
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,019
You okay?

447
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:33,219
Never trust an evil-evil thing.

448
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,269
Kate, I know that
what happened with your father....

449
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,809
My father was human.

450
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,409
You don't know anything about that.

451
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,429
This contest is ended, is it?

452
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,329
- Now I've won.
- Are you sure?

453
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,639
Of course.

454
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:18,619
- I proved who had the power here.
- You think?

455
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,170
What?

456
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,409
Your victory over
him took but moments.

457
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:29,250
Yes.

458
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,639
His defeat
of you will last lifetimes.

459
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,980
What are you talking about?
He can't defeat me now.

460
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:38,739
Nor can he approve of you...

461
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,550
...in this world or any other.

462
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,840
What we once were informs
all that we become.

463
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,429
The same love infects our hearts...

464
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,050
...even if they no longer beat.
Simple death won't change that.

465
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:02,139
Love?

466
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,730
Is this the work of love?

467
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,380
Darling boy. So young.

468
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:14,840
Still so very young.
