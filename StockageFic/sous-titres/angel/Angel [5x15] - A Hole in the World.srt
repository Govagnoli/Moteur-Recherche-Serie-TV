1
00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:04,125
<i>I don't see why it</i>
<i>has to be this way.</i>

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,357
There are plenty
of good schools in the area.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,434
I know. And I have a nice room
and I could meet a nice boy.

4
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:11,901
And we could get married
and live in my nice room.

5
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,462
- He'd have to be smallish.
- And have sweet little babies
that can sleep in the drawer.

6
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,702
I do not see a downside
to this plan.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,745
Daddy, I love you like pancakes,
but I'm getting the hell out of here.

8
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,644
- Language.
- She should say it.

9
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:24,648
That's where she's going...
Hell-A.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,914
It's Los Angeles.
The City of Angels, remember?

11
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,080
And if you meet one angel there,
I'll eat the dogs.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,182
Bunch of junkies and spoiled movie actors.
That's who you're gonna meet.

13
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,659
In the graduate
physics program at UCLA?

14
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:39,663
- You don't know.
- Sweetie, why don't you check
the Chevy one more time.

15
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,996
Chevy's fine.
I slept in a drawer till I was three.

16
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:46,265
Didn't stunt me none.

17
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,966
- Oh, did you call Bethany? Is it still okay?
- Late as you like.

18
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:51,669
She says they'll leave you a key
in case they turn in.

19
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:54,075
I know I'm forgetting something.

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,240
Well, you just call us up,
we'll drive it up to you, move in. No problem.

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,284
<i>- Mom.</i>
- I'm just scaring you.

22
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll call you lots.</i>

23
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:05,819
- I know you will.
- [Gasps] Feigenbaum.

24
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,519
I can't make the trip
without Feigenbaum.

25
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,425
He doesn't quite look up to it.

26
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,192
Hush. He's the master of chaos.
He'll love L.A.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,791
- All my junkie movie actor friends.
- Don't you joke.

28
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:21,296
Now, you're gonna promise me
that you're gonna be careful.

29
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,308
I'm gonna study, Mom.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,310
I'm gonna learn every damn thing
they know up there...

31
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:29,643
and then figure out
some stuff they don't.

32
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:31,649
And I'll be careful.

33
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:36,711
I'll even be dull, boring.
Cross my heart.

34
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:39,313
- [Screams]
- [Creatures Shrieking]

35
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:54,202
<i>- [Gunshot]</i>
- [Cocks Gun]

36
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:03,707
- I think we got the nest.
- The others are finishing a sweep.

37
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,750
Nasty little buggers.

38
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,115
Kinda cool physiologically.

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,188
They reproduce
by vomiting up crystals...

40
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,690
that attract and mutate the microbes
around them to form eggs.

41
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,227
Are you trying to turn me on?

42
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:20,662
It is kind of romantic.

43
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,099
A roaring fire.
A snug little nest.

44
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,205
<i>[Spike] Fuss, fuss.</i>
<i>The thing was about to strike.</i>

45
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:39,045
- It was on your back. What was I supposed to do?
- Ask me to turn around.

46
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,847
- Heat of battle. Wasn't time.
- You just like stabbing me.

47
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,583
L-I'm shocked!
Shocked that you'd say that.

48
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,591
I much prefer hitting you
with blunt instruments.

49
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,423
You know, we only asked you along
because we felt sorry for you.

50
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:53,555
If it weren't for me, you'd be bug food,
so stop whinging.

51
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,601
- Angel?
- I'll be all right, Fred.

52
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,227
No, I just want the bug.

53
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:02,967
It's in pretty good shape,
and I'd like to take it back to the lab.

54
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,942
Always like a new specimen.

55
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,945
[Thud]

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,713
Whoa. Uh...

57
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,657
What's this?

58
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,159
- Delivery.
- Ancient Relics is two floors down.

59
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,355
<i>Invoice reads Science Department.</i>
<i>Winifred Burkle.</i>

60
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,963
- Do you need me to sign?
<i>- Been signed.</i>

61
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:34,438
Okay.

62
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,562
We're three little maids
who all unwary

63
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,663
Come from a ladies' seminary

64
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:45,301
Freed from its genius tutelary

65
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:48,938
Three little maids from school
Three little maids

66
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:54,953
And you don't stop with all the ladies
and the gangsta butt go...

67
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,045
- What's up?
- I should ask you.

68
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,319
- You seem unutterably cheery.
- I am.

69
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,792
I am. Look. I gotta
be straight with you...

70
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:05,090
'cause this is kinda
blowing my mind.

71
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:08,098
- Tell me.
- Fred and I are getting back together.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,897
She was so keyed up from last night's fight,
she asked me over.

73
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,404
We ended up talking for hours
like old times.

74
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:18,034
All of a sud... I can't even keep this up,
'cause your face is gonna make me weep.

75
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:20,044
Wes, I am so messing with you.

76
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:24,776
- [Chuckles]
- L... Oh. No, l...

77
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:27,853
Come on. Brother gets a dig in?
That's my right.

78
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,184
- So, you know about...
- It's on every BlackBerry in the building.

79
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,259
No secrets in the House of Pain.

80
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,056
And is that all right
with you... Fred and me?

81
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:43,062
Last year, you wouldn't have asked me that
question. The man becomes civilized.

82
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,399
<i>It's cool.</i>

83
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:49,406
Our thing's long done,
and I know how you feel about her.

84
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,442
Thank you.

85
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,444
And to add
the necessary boilerplate...

86
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,878
you ever hurt her,
I'm gonna kill you like a chicken.

87
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,812
Acceptable terms.

88
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:01,080
<i>- Now, on to the real fun.</i>
<i>- Yes, you seemed like something was up...</i>

89
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,917
before you made that tasteless
and horrible joke at my expense.

90
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:05,991
Lindsey McDonald.

91
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:08,616
- You know where he is?
- Settle for "was"?

92
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,820
He can hide from the senior partners,
but not from the D.W. P<i>...</i>

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,991
- and not from my many, many ears.
- He was living here.

94
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,466
Under the name Doyle. The way
he was messing with Spike and Angel...

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,470
could be he had
some other schemes laid out.

96
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,563
Senior partners
took him out fast.

97
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,904
- I don't even think he had time to pack.
- Worth checking.

98
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,309
- Nice work. You should tell Angel.
- You can tell him.

99
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:30,115
- I ain't going in there.
- It's bollocks, Angel!

100
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,377
- I ain't going in there.
- It's bollocks, Angel!

101
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,974
It's your brand of bollocks
from first to last.

102
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:37,920
You can't ever see the big picture.
You can't see any picture.

103
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,288
I am talking
about something primal, all right?

104
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,827
Savagery.
Brutal animal instinct.

105
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,829
And that wins out
every time with you.

106
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,865
You know, the human race
has evolved, Spike.

107
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,801
Oh, into a bunch of namby-pamby,
self-analyzing wankers...

108
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:53,804
- who could never overcome aggressors...
- We're bigger, smarter...

109
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,670
plus there's a thing teamwork,
not to mention the superstitious terror...

110
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,539
- of your pure aggressors.
- You just want it to be
the way you want it to be.

111
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:02,876
- It's not about what I want.
<i>- [Wesley] Sorry.</i>

112
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:05,280
Is this something
we should all be discussing?

113
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,552
No.

114
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,557
It just sounds a little serious.

115
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,560
It was mostly...
theoretical. We...

116
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,630
We were just working out a...

117
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,729
Look. If cavemen and astronauts
got into a fight...

118
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,735
who would win?

119
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,597
Huh.

120
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,975
You've been yelling at each other
for 40 minutes about this.

121
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,644
- Do the astronauts have weapons?
- [Both] No.

122
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,914
I couldn't find
any invoice on it.

123
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,924
I thought maybe
you went crazy on eBay.

124
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:50,462
No, no eBay.
After the commemorative plate incident...

125
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:53,258
I'm living clean.

126
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:55,265
Did you run a spectral analysis?

127
00:07:55,367 --> 00:08:00,361
Yeah. Everything's bouncing off it,
which doesn't thrill me.

128
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:04,841
Yeah, let's not be hasty about opening it.
It's probably just a mummy.

129
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,503
Mummies can be
a lot more trouble than you think.

130
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,104
And you're seeing Wesley now.

131
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:13,446
Uh, oh. Okay.

132
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:17,283
Uh, that's not connected
to mummies in some way.

133
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,358
No. I just wanted
to get it out there.

134
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,053
Uh, and I'm totally good with it.

135
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:28,259
L... You know, I know I've made,
uh, advances.

136
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:31,029
L-I'm sorry.

137
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,730
No. I didn't want to
make you uncomfortable.

138
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,802
I love working with you,
and that's plenty for me.

139
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,880
You're sweet.

140
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,146
Want me to get
our HazMats on this baby?

141
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,118
Yeah. And, uh, see about
where it came from.

142
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,416
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

143
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,911
[Gasps, Coughing]

144
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,718
What happened?

145
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,722
Oh, I don't know.
It opened, and there was air.

146
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:30,124
- Are you okay?
- Uh, I think so. That was odd.

147
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:36,094
Harmony just pulled me out of
a very promising poker game...

148
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,567
down in Accounts Receivable,
so this better be good.

149
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,264
Oh, and by the way,
all the guys down there agree...

150
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,035
that astronauts don't stand a chance
against cavemen...

151
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,043
so don't even start.

152
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,705
Look. I can't
do this anymore.

153
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,714
<i>Admitting defeat, are you?</i>

154
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,716
You and me,
this isn't working out.

155
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:56,015
Are you saying we should start
annoying other people?

156
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,146
I'm saying you should go.

157
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,851
You really can't stand
the competition, can you?

158
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,790
That isn't the...

159
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:07,025
The way I figure it is that Lindsey
brought you back as a spirit...

160
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:11,364
bound to this place
so you'd become... invested in it.

<i>He only made you corporeal again</i>
<i>once you'd gotten used to it, attached to it.</i>

162
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,200

I just don't have anywhere else to go.

163
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,780
What if you did?
Look. Wolfram and Hart...

164
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,543
has got offices
in every major city in the world...

165
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,744
and a lot more out of it.

166
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,687
I'll give you the resources you need to go
anywhere... cars, gadgets, expense accounts.

167
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,988
<i>You fight the good fight,</i>
<i>but in style.</i>

168
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,086
And, if possible,
in Outer Mongolia.

169
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,423
A roving agent.

170
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:46,493
Sort of a 007
without the poncey tux.

171
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,574
- Go anywhere I want?
- Anywhere. Everywhere.

172
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:53,008
Hmm.
Anywhere but here.

173
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,346
<i>But that doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense.</i>

174
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,246
- I just call it like I see it.
- But the cavemen have fire.

175
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,251
That's what they live with
in their caves.

176
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,446
The astronauts should at least
have some sort of weapon.

177
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,045
Hey there.

178
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:08,558
I was just on my way to thinking
of an excuse to come and see you.

179
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,753
And how is that working out?

180
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:13,388
Really great.
Where you coming from?

181
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,161
Oh, Medical. I breathed
some old mummy dust.

182
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:18,532
Had to make sure
I didn't discover any new germs.

183
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,573
- You all right.
- They shooed me right off. Mummy-free.

184
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:25,768
Good. I was hoping
to take you out tomorrow night.

185
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,778
And I don't feature you
wrapped in bandages.

186
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,407
- Take me out where?
- Can it be a secret?

187
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:35,476
Oh, sheesh.
Get a balcony, you two, huh?

188
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,578
You'll still find me
for lunch though, right?

189
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,623
I'll just look
where the sun shines.

190
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:42,785
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

191
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,988
You make me happy

192
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:54,906
Get Medical.
Someone get Medical now!

193
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,646
[Chuckles]
It's my boys.

194
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:11,779
Haven't had this many
big strapping men at my bedside...

195
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,358
since that night
with the varsity lacrosse team.

196
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,087
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>That was a joke.</i>

197
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,462
Well, you sure gave us all
a big scare, Freddles.

198
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:25,128
Yeah, you just need to rest.
Lab's doing some blood work.

199
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:28,536
- I'm a mummy, aren't I?
<i>- [Spike] I've fought plenty of mummies.</i>

200
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,940
And none of them were as pretty as you.
Almost none.

201
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,878
Now you all are being
too comforting.

202
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,450
What's really up?

203
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,543
You're sick, and you're making it worse
by worrying.

204
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:44,519
We've got that sarcophagus
under the scope.

205
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,854
<i>If it gave you anything,</i>
<i>we'll isolate it in a few hours.</i>

206
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,724
So, you don't know what it is?

207
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,228
Yet.

208
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,628
- Okay.
- We're gonna work this.

209
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,135
<i>Shouldn't take long.</i>

210
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,467
Handsome man saves me.

211
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,337
[Chuckles]
That's how it works.

212
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,844
Let's get crackin'.

213
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:19,722
[Chuckles]
"Get crackin'."

214
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,659
He's such an old fogy.

215
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:34,433
I know you've gotta
go be book man.

216
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,770
Yes.

217
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,208
Just hit that light.
I'll be here in a heartbeat.

218
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,338
Assuming I still have one.

219
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,916
Hush.

220
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,856
- Wes and Fred?
- You didn't know?

221
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,927
I didn't know.

222
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,257
- How's she handling it?
- She's smarter than all of us put together.

223
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,265
- She knows it's bad.
- How bad? What do we know?

224
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,393
Whatever she's got, it doesn't match up
with any of the pathogens in our archives.

225
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,337
- It's mystical, and it's not ours.
- What about the sarcophagus?

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,102
My team is cross-checking the symbols,
but it's also new territory for us.

227
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,871
Angel, what exactly is happening to her?
You talked to the doctor.

228
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,879
<i>- [Wesley] They have something?</i>
- Yeah, I, uh...

229
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,940
Some parasitic agent
is working its way through...

230
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,952
I mean, as near
as they can tell...

231
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,988
Get to the point.

232
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,455
Her organs are cooking.

233
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:28,458
In a day's time, they'll liquefy.

234
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:34,789
No, not this girl.
Not this day.

235
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,800
Look, Wes.
You gotta tell me what was in that box.

236
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,802
I need a name,
a history, anything.

237
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,737
- We can't get it open. Not even the lasers...
- Where did it come from?

238
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,172
It just showed up.
No return address.

239
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,267
Didn't recognize the guy
who brought it in...

240
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,312
come to think of it,
the middle of the night.

241
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,438
- This was deliberate.
- Senior partners?

242
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:53,450
It doesn't add up, but I'll hit
the White Room, talk to the conduit.

243
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:56,020
All right, look.
If the senior partners didn't do this...

244
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,021
- you gotta get them to help us.
<i>- [Gunn] Any way I can.</i>

245
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:02,082
What about Doyle? Uh, Lindsey.
The man likes to play his games.

246
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,822
I was looking to work the streets,
and we've got his address.

247
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,398
For all we know,
he's probably sitting there, laughing.

248
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,935
- If there's muscle work to do...
- Let's make it twice as fast.

249
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,630
And baby makes three,
in case anybody feels like singing.

250
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,798
- Good. Guys...
- You don't have to say it.

251
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:18,467
I'll say it anyway.

252
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,205
Winifred Burkle. Go.

253
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,851
[Moaning]

254
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,464
I'm sorry to interrupt. I just need to know
if the Holbein clan history was here.

255
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,194
<i>- It was supposed to be faxed to my offiice.</i>
- It can wait.

256
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:47,635
These guys are really important.
I just need...

257
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,401
I mean, the whole company
can't be working Miss Burkle's case.

258
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,500
- Of course.
- [Gunshot]

259
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:55,910
<i>[Whimpering]</i>

260
00:15:56,014 --> 00:16:00,974
<i>Jennifer, please send anyone else</i>
<i>who isn't working Miss Burkle's case to me.</i>

261
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,645
Hello?

262
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,156
Here, kitty, kitty?

263
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,093
Look. I know there's someone in here,
and it ain't just me.

264
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,493
I'm not going anywhere till...

265
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,535
[Breathing Heavily]

266
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,437
Well, what do you know?
It <i>is</i> just me.

267
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:29,071
You don't wanna be here.

268
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:32,912
I never wanna be here.
What happened to the cat?

269
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:37,184
The physical form of the conduit
is determined by the viewer.

270
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,987
So, I'm looking at me
because what?

271
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:45,358
We're gonna play a mirror game?
Get our mime on?

272
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,331
- You are failing.
- I'm not the issue here.

273
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,368
I believe that you think that.

274
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,029
You can't let this happen to Fred.

275
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,300
This is the part
where I need to be clear.

276
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,474
[Groaning]

277
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,914
I am not your friend.
I am not your flunky.

278
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,417
<i>I am your conduit</i>
<i>to the senior partners...</i>

279
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,420
and they are tired
of your insolence.

280
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:13,491
Oh, yeah, they are not here
for your convenience.

281
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,390
I didn't come for a favor.

282
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,895
- We can make a deal.
- Deals are for the devil.

283
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,592
Do you want someone else...
a life for hers... you'll get it.

284
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:25,829
You can have mine.

285
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:29,566
[Snickers]
I already do.

286
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,080
<i>- [Spike] No sign of Lindsey.</i>
<i>- [Angel] Look for plans.</i>

287
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,245
<i>[Clattering]</i>

288
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:53,362
Well, I'll be damned
all over again.

289
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,299
Don't touch me!

290
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,733
Hiding out from
the senior partners, Eve?

291
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,670
How many sick days do you get
before they dock you?

292
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,367
- What do you want?
- Fred's dying.

293
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:07,604
Some mystical parasite.
Ring a bell?

294
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,646
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

295
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:13,047
What about your boyfriend, love?
He got some wacky scheme brewing?

296
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:16,052
- Sending coffins about?
- You two stay away from me.

297
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:19,419
Look, Eve.
This happens quickly or very, very slowly.

298
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,220
Sarcophagus.
Older than anything we know.

299
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,888
Lindsey and I had nothing to do with that.
I'm not lying. L-I'm not.

300
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:33,730
Have you... heard from him?
About him?

301
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,863
Oh, this is truly poetical.

302
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,874
You're not saying
what we need to hear.

303
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:41,377
Why would we do anything to Fred?
Why would we even care about...

304
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,937
<i>Oh.! Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>That was a knuckle-buster.</i>

305
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,713
[Chuckles]
I'm Jake LaMotta over here. It's pathetic.

306
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,288
Oh, here's the thing, Eve.

307
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,914
You're going to sing for me,
and I'm going to read you right now.

308
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,392
<i>And here's one more thing.</i>
<i>Winifred Burkle once told me...</i>

309
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:01,090
after a sinful amount of Chinese food,
and in lieu of absolutely nothing...

310
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,599
"I think a lot of people
would choose to be green.

311
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,762
Your shade,
if they had the choice."

312
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,601
If I hear one note,
one quarter note...

313
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,608
that tells me
you had any involvement...

314
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,678
these two won't even
have time to kill you.

315
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,974
Oh, and anything by Diane Warren
will also result in your death.

316
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,178
Well, except "Rhythm of the Night."

317
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,915
I wanna help. I swear to you.
I've got nothing against Fred.

318
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,854
Say it with a song
in your heart.

319
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,289
Pretty as a picture

320
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,471
She is like a golden ring

321
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,234
- She's clean.
- You've been wrong before.

322
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:46,504
Yeah, and I might be now,
but she reads clean.

323
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:49,273
Her future's
not too bright, but...

324
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:53,818
- What do you mean?
- Well, nothing's written in stone... lately...

325
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:57,081
but, uh, if I was about

329

<i>If you're talking about a sarcophagus</i>

before humankind.

- They were all driven out of this dimension.
<i>- The ones that were still alive.</i>

335
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,878
But long before that,
they were killing each other all the time.

336
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:33,549
And they don't die
the way we do.

The oldest scrolls.

You need to find
the Deeper Well.

- A burial ground.

I don't think this is

That's speculation.
Either way she dies.

00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,906

of finding this Deeper Well?
- I already have.

353
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:32,380
It's in England, in the Cotswolds.
That's the location to the inch.

00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:35,851
Lorne, tell Harmony to prep the jet.
We can be there in 10 hours.

You can be there in four.

We have really good jets.

357
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,422
It will have a guardian,
maybe several.

- How do we know going there is gonna do squat?

359

- We'll keep working here, but, yes, I think it is.

362
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,741
If nobody thinks it's too ridiculous,
I'm going to pray.

00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,505
No, it's appreciated.

Fred, you can't be doing this.

00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,210
Why the bloody hell not?

492
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:12,221
He can't lie.

493
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:17,625
You did this!
You did all of this!

494
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,891
Technically, that's not the case.
I just played my part.

495
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,523
Why? You couldn't stand the thought
of Wes winning her, so you kill her?

496
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:26,330
No. I meant everything
I said about her.

497
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:29,133
I chose Fred because I love her.
Because she's worthy.

498
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,868
You think I'd have my god
hatched out of some schmuck?

499
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,206
What are...

500
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:38,338
This was all set in motion
millions of years ago, Charles.

501
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:40,349
And there's just no way to stop it.

502
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:42,351
Angel and Spike.

503
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,648
<i>Oh, they're really on track,</i>
<i>but it doesn't matter.</i>

504
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,848
Angel's not gonna save her.

505
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:50,222
- You don't know Angel.
- I'm not being clear.

506
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:54,093
I don't mean that Angel
is going to fail to save her.

507
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:57,326
I mean, he's gonna let her die.

508
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:10,670
Would you read to me some more?

509
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,715
Of course.

510
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:17,345
[Groans]
Oh, the light hurts my eyes.

511
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:22,852
But I don't want you
to turn it off.

512
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,623
But it hurts my eyes.

513
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,824
Everything's so bright and hollow.

514
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:35,570
Cavemen win.

515
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:40,472
Of course the cavemen win.

516
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:42,478
I would never have thought
you'd end up here, Angel.

517
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,605
- I could say the same.
- So you two know each other.

518
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,910
That was a statement.
I already know that you do.

519
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:49,918
I'll tell you as much as I can.

520
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:52,955
The Old Ones were demons pure.

521
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:57,183
They warred
as we would breathe, endlessly.

522
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,728
The greater ones were interred,
for death was not always their end.

523
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,425
Illyria was feared
and beloved, as few are.

524
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:06,970
It was lain to rest
in the very depths of the well.

525
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:08,971
Until it disappeared
a month ago.

526
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:11,837
Someone took it from under your nose
a month ago, and you didn't miss it till now?

527
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:14,274
That makes you
quite the crap jailer, doesn't it?

528
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:16,471
<i>Also</i> a statement.

529
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,480
Your friend likes to talk.

530
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:20,482
So much, he's even
right sometimes.

531
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,280
The man I remember
couldn't be stolen from so easily.

532
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:26,220
The tomb was not stolen.
It disappeared.

533
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:29,292
I believe it was predestined to
as part of Illyria's escape plan.

534
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:33,822
And as for my not noticing...

535
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:37,128
Well, my charges are not few.

536
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,643
[Spike]
Bloody hell.

537
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:51,044
- [Angel] How far does this go down?
- All the way.

538
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:54,376
All the way through the Earth.

539
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:57,784
So, the coffin disappeared,
teleported...

540
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,981
but it was brought to us.

541
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,150
Illyria was a great power.

542
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,820
So great, that after
millions of years dead...

543
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,128
somewhere on this Earth
it still has acolytes.

544
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:12,326
There's only a few of us now.

545
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:15,269
I came to L.A. Because I knew
that's where its kingdom had been.

546
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,966
It was supposed to teleport
back to the base of its power...

547
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,010
but the continents drifted,
which they do.

548
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:23,375
I had others help me get it here,
but then it got stuck in...

549
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,210
<i>would you believe it...</i>
<i>Customs.</i>

550
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:31,184
But you took care of that.

551
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:37,855
You signed the order to bring it into the lab,
so you could get another brain boost.

552
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:46,329
It's like I said.
I'm just one small part...

553
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,998
- of a great machine.
- Angel's gonna save her.

554
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,372
What he's fighting against
is older than the concept of time.

555
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:57,436
I couldn't stop it.
There's nothing left to do now but wait.

556
00:35:57,548 --> 00:36:00,847
Wait and try and figure out exactly
what you want to tell your...

557
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:13,725
[Whimpering]

558
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,792
Oh, God!
I've sinned!

559
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:22,463
I've sinned,
and I'm being punished.

560
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:25,701
<i>[Groaning]</i>
<i>I don't know what's wrong.</i>

561
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,710
I never got a B-minus before.

562
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:32,475
[Yells]
I'm sorry.

563
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,642
I'm sorry.
Make it stop.

564
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:39,548
[Gagging, Gasping]

565
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,490
It's been freed,
the demon's essence.

566
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,562
Yeah, it's been freed.
Why do you think we're here?

567
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,823
And what's your favorite color?
What's your favorite song?

568
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,831
Who's the goalkeeper
for Manchester United?

569
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,130
How many fingers am I holding up?
You wanna kill me? Try.

570
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:56,400
I don't have time for your quirks.

571
00:36:56,507 --> 00:37:00,102
The power to draw back
Illyria lies in there.

572
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,647
It requires a champion who has traveled
from where it lies to where it belongs.

573
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:08,411
- You got two of those right here.
- But I didn't know it was free.

574
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,459
If we bring the sarcophagus
back to the well...

575
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,461
it will draw Illyria
out of your friend...

576
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:24,364
and into every single person
between here and there.

577
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,993
It will become
the mystical equivalent of airborne.

578
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:32,041
<i>It will claw into every soul in its path</i>
<i>to keep from being trapped entire.</i>

579
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,110
Tens, maybe
hundreds of thousands...

580
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:39,376
will die in agony...
if you save her.

581
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:44,987
No.

582
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:53,654
That's madness.

583
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,631
This is a place of madness.

584
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,660
I'll prepare the spell.

585
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:03,205
Your choice.

586
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:15,751
Hell with the world.

587
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:18,048
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>

588
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,792
Why did we go there?

589
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,828
Why did we think
we could beat it?

590
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,824
It's evil, Wesley.

591
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,834
It's bigger than anything.

592
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:37,066
- I don't believe that.
- No! I'm with him!

593
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:42,105
You won't leave me now?

594
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:46,744
- We're so close.
- I will never leave you.

595
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,648
Hmm.

596
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:51,653
Oh!

597
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:54,019
[Sighs]

598
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,718
That was bad.

599
00:38:56,827 --> 00:39:00,456
But it's better now.

600
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:02,464
You won't leave me?

601
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,898
I won't.

602
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:09,271
My boys.

603
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:14,833
[Sobbing]
I walk with heroes.

604
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:18,437
- Think about that.
- You are one.

605
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:20,483
Superhero.

606
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:25,578
[Sobbing]
And this is my power.

607
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:30,490
Do not let them take me.
Not me.

608
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:35,227
That's right.

609
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,232
That's right.

610
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,311
He's with me.

611
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:01,854
Spike.

612
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,792
This goes all the way through...

613
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,796
to the other side.

614
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:15,203
<i>So, I figure, there's a bloke...</i>

615
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:19,674
somewhere around... New Zealand...

616
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:22,540
standing on a bridge
like this one...

617
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,546
Iooking back down at us.

618
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,276
All the way down.

619
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,782
There's a hole in the world.

620
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:38,127
<i>Feels like we ought to have known.</i>

621
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:42,688
[Sobbing]

622
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:45,233
Will you kiss me?

623
00:41:03,954 --> 00:41:06,252
Would you have loved me?

624
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,917
I've loved you...

625
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:13,929
since I've known you.

626
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:18,393
No, that's not...

627
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:21,562
I think maybe even before.

628
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:23,936
[Sniffles]
I'm so sorry.

629
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,407
No, no, no.

630
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,378
[Gasping, Coughing]

631
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:39,282
I need you
to talk to my parents.

632
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:42,881
Th-They have to know
I wasn't scared...

633
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:45,052
and that it was quick.

634
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:49,494
That I wasn't scared.

635
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,090
- Oh, God!
- You have to fight.

636
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:54,830
You don't have to talk.
Just concentrate on fighting.

637
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:58,533
- Just hold on.
- I'm not scared.

638
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:02,134
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:07,148
Please, Wesley.

640
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,844
Why can't I stay?
