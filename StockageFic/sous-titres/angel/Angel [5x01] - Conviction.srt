00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:35,999
I'm explaining the catch so you don't have to
stand around wondering what it is.

161
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,160
See, in order to
keep this business running...

162
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,103
you have to
keep this business running.

163
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,835
And that means keeping your clients--
most of them anyway-- happy.

164
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:47,036
<i>It means lettin' 'em</i>
<i>get away with stuff.</i>

165
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:51,014
Sweetie, they were getting away with it
while you were all sitting around your hotel...

166
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,482
<i>waiting for the phone tojangle.</i>

167
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:56,213
You're on the ins now,
and you can stop the worst of it.

168
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:59,882
Maybe find some new solutions
to some old problems.

169
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,561
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Isn't anybody excited?</i>

170
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,963
This is a crazy time of fun.

171
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:13,732
The most powerful evil around has given
a pivotal position over to its sworn enemies.

172
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,536
You're not scared, are you?

173
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,878
Your client files
are all in there.

174
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,317
Might want to start
going through 'em.

175
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:36,961
[ Angel ]
This is unbelievable.

176
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:39,428
I think I've lost
my appetite.

177
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:42,728
Which is kind of a first.

178
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,030
Hmm. Well, this is
interesting.

179
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:48,573
Apparently old Joe Kennedy tried to
get out of his deal with the firm.

180
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,073
That explains a lot.

181
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,541
<i>Yeah, but George Sr.,</i>
<i>he read the fine print.</i>

182
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,772
<i>There's no one these guys</i>
<i>don't have a piece of.</i>

183
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,679
How are we even supposed to
start makin' things right?

184
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,979
<i>Here's a winner.</i>
<i>Corbin Fries.</i>

185
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:04,783
On trial for smuggling Asian girls in
for cheap labor and prostitution.

186
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,017
Been charged with drugs, gunrunnin'.
Nothin' stuck.

187
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,925
- That's one of our human clients.
- Looks like the trial's not goin' too well this time.

188
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,860
Hmm. First good news all day.

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,568
I can't even remember
which pile is which.

190
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:19,569
I'll get my secretary
to go through it in the morning.

191
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:23,300
- Do I have a secretary?
<i>- [ Wesley ] I imagine they'll</i>
<i>find you someone who can...</i>

192
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,774
stomach the idea of
working for the side of the righteous.

193
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:29,644
<i>My impression is a lot of these guys arejust</i>
<i>opportunistic. They'll go with the flow.</i>

194
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:32,239
You know we're gonna have to
check the whole staff...

195
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,252
make sure we don't have
any die-hard evildoers plotting against us.

196
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,819
And here I was worrying
about the clients.

197
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:41,256
We're doing the right thing.

198
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,090
Right?

199
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:51,069
Well, uh, we're doin' it
tomorrow, exalted one.

200
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,069
My horns are fallin' asleep.

201
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,298
Yeah. You guys
go get some rest.

202
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,773
- What about you?
- I'll work a while yet. Go on.

203
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,438
[ Sighs ]

204
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:11,220
<i>A lot simpler fighting vamps</i>
<i>on the street, wasn't it?</i>

205
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,419
Tricked-out pickup,
loyal gang.

206
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,688
Just you and the pointy wood
against the living dead.

207
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,196
This gonna be a thing with you--
jumping out at people?

208
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,529
Or do you just not have
an office of your own?

209
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,064
I'm just wondering
if you're ready for the next step.

210
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,800
Or if maybe I'd like to go back
to livin' on the street...

00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,604
eatin' garbage and watching my buddies
get picked off one by one?

212
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,611
Yeah, that was the life.

213
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,510
So you're not backing out?

214
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,885
You don't know me,
or you wouldn't ask that question.

215
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:44,387
I can see why
the senior partners chose you.

216
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,389
Have fun.

217
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,389

No, this is Angel.

Are you sure?

00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:54,019
Less and less.
Can I get a cup of coffee?

And they're evil here.
They don't judge.

No burning up.
A great medical plan.

- And who needs dental more than us?
- This is surreal.

252

Now, before you go
threatening to fire me--

253
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,624
- I threatened to kill you.
- Don't let's quibble.

I'm strong.
I'm quick.

If that means what
that guy said.

00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,139

- It's pig's blood.

- It tastes--
- Pretty good, right?

But why? You--

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,924
I thought a familiar face...

would be just the thing
in a place like this.

I mean...

279
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:28,775
you are gonna tell her
you're okay with this, right?

00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:10,414
So, anyway, I really think
you should not fire me, and Wes does too.

- I saw the file.

00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:35,580
Yeah, well, personally,
I think he deserves to be eaten by weasels...

300
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,648
but he's hinting
we'd best help him.

301
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,547
Threatening, actually.

00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:44,144

Oh, yeah. Let's all chitchat and have
tea and crumpets 'cause I got so much time.

got to trial.

Now, I bring a lot of money
into this firm-- more than most--

Yeah, I know who you are,
