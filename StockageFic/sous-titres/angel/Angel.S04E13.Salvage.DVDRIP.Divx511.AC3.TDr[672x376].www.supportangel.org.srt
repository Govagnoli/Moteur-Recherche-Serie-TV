But there's no real power here.

512
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:45,807
My master's power is beyond all limits.

513
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:49,932
Beyond your petty imagining.

514
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:54,201
You are weak.

515
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,685
You're nothing.

516
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,282
You could not even defeat me.

517
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:03,484
Ain't that the truth.

518
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:06,008
I mean, look at this guy.

519
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:11,682
Pretty much the only thing that could
do damage to that thick, stony hide...

520
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:13,571
...is himself.

521
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:18,170
Or maybe, I don't know,
maybe a piece of himself.

523
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:34,048

525
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:58,049
Faith.

526
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:10,890
Oh, crap.

527
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,692
You mean killing The Beast
really does bring back the sun?

528
00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:16,083
I thought that was Angel's
retarded fantasy.

529

[GROANING]

530
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,611
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

531
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:21,843
Take the bad with the good,
I always say.

532
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:25,090
Anyhow, I just wanted Beastie Boy here
to soften you up.

533
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,966
I like my meat nice and tender.

Ooh!

536
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:35,804
A swing and a miss, slugger.
Sorry, but...

537
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,246
God.

538

[LAUGHING]

539
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:49,289
Okay. Well, I gotta give you props.

540
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,449
Nice move, really.

541
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:56,010
We'll just have to take a rain check
on that whole "eviscerating you" thing.

542
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,686
Just you and me now, Faithy.

543
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,249
Catch you later.

544
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,087
Check it out. We got sun.

545
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,971
Well, ding-dong, The Beast is dead.

546
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:31,251
I've never seen anything
so beautiful in all my life.

547
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,812
Where are the others?

548
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,090
Yeah, let's hear the war stories.
How'd you bring that monster down?

549
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:37,891
It wasn't us, not Connor and me.

550
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:40,362
She must've fought it. Faith.

551
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,683
Beast must've attacked her,
and she must...

552
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,411
It's gotta be.

553
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:48,327
- Hey, where's Cordy? Does she know?
- She's up in her room.

554
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,772
Hey, what about Angelus?

555
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,725
If that girl can take out The Beast...

556
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:57,522
...my money says she'll have Angelus
hog-tied and back here by dinnertime.

557
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:04,243
Hey, isn't it incredible?

558
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:09,364
It's wonderful.

559
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,047
She did it. Faith.

560
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,204
She's...

561
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,042
...amazing.

562
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:21,532
- Connor...
- I had no idea what a slayer could do.

563
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:25,843
A weakness for slayers.
You're definitely his son.

564
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,169
Connor...

565
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:36,451
...we need...
There's something you need to...

566
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:41,604
I don't know how...

567
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,287
Well, I know how, but...

568
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:46,324
What?

569
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,764
What is it?

570
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:52,409
We're having a baby.

571
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,563
Touch it.

572
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,162
This...

573
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:15,802
It's impossible. How could...?

574
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:22,202
All I know is, there's a life growing
inside of me, and it's ours.

575
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,563
We're connected now.

576
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:38,169
You and me...

577
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,883
...forever.
