00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:05,213
LORNE: <i>Evil's coming.</i>
<i>And it's planning on staying.</i>

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,122
Find that Beast.

00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,041
WESLEY:
<i>It won 't quit till everyone's dead.</i>

5
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:18,212
Go underground,
change your name.

00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:21,683
<i>The Beast is planning to</i>
<i>block out the sun. Permanently.</i>

7
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:24,088
Join with me, Angelus.

8
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:27,091
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- We need Angelus.

9
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,924
WO-PANG: It is done.
CORDELIA: Angelus.

10
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,647
GUNN: We're taking out Angel's soul,
putting it in a jar?

11
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:34,968
Hope we know what we're doing.

12
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:39,007
You wanna impress the girl. After a few
days of chocolate-covered cherries...

13
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,971
...you'll bend her over
the kitchen counter...

14
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,086
Tell me what
I just walked in on.

15
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,164
Face it, you can't
give her what she needs.

16
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:49,292
Charles! Stop it.

17
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,168
Fred.

18
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:55,365
You're still the same loser
no one would sit with at lunch.

19
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,645
Yet you're locked in that cage
and I'm out here.

20
00:00:58,853 --> 00:00:59,922
Won't be here forever.

21
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,964
He's told us everything he's going to.

22
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,562
- We're putting your soul back.
- We'll see.

23
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,923
FRED:
Angel's soul. It's gone.

00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,852
WO-PANG:
Must acquire better guards.

28
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,607
Angel's soul has been stolen.

29
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,882
I have no need for the vampire's soul.

30
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:45,692
Then where is it?

31
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:56,362
That I cannot discern.
But it is still viable within the Muo-ping.

32
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:59,167
- "Muo" what?
- It's still safe in the container.

33
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,890
Angel's soul has been misplaced. I bet
this sort of thing happens all the time.

34
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,965
What do you have as
a backup plan to re-ensoul somebody?

35
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,931
WO-PANG:
There is no other way known to me.

36
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,768
Without the Muo-ping,
you're screwed.

37
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:19,568
And what happens if the Muo...
Container thing breaks or gets opened?

38
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:24,332
Then, like all things, the soul
can be returned or destroyed.

<i>realized something important:</i>

41
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:39,411
Being evil is wrong.

42
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,565
I wanna be good.
I wanna be Angel again.

43
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,162
<i>You hear me? I'm ready.</i>

44
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,647
I'm ready too, fang boy.

45
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:54,091
He knows, doesn't he,
that his soul's missing?

46
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,851
Probably knew before we did.

47
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:59,323
- Hope that shaman can help us.
- He should've never been brought here.

48
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,882
Now instead of just worrying about
the rock-eater...

49
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:03,884
...we got Darth Vampire
in the basement.

50
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:08,604
- Bringing Angelus was our best chance.
- That you talking or Wes?

51
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,810
- You were pushing for it too.
- Then maybe I did the wrong thing.

52
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:17,366
<i>Like smacking your girl around?</i>
<i>I bet you Wes would never hit her.</i>

53
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,888
<i>He's all proper and English.</i>

54
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:23,850
And that accent.
Chicks just love a good accent.

55
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,732
Makes them all buttery
in their nether regions.

56
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,412
<i>Isn 't that right, Fred?</i>

57
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,924
<i>You know, I had a bit of an</i>
<i>Irish brogue back in the day.</i>

58
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:37,291
<i>If you like, I can use it on you</i>
<i>when I rape you to death.</i>

59
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:39,887
<i>Or...</i>

60
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,527
Son of a bitch.

61
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:44,923
He's just...

62
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:46,526
It's just words.

63
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,372
Yeah.

64
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:54,371
And that's the only way he can hurt us.
He knows he's never getting out.

65
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,612
Cavalry

66
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,408
- The great Angelus.
- Oh, come on.

67
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,931
You can do better than that. Try playing
up the awe and the reverence a bit.

68
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,288
"The great Angelus."

69
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:15,571
Great? Being locked in a cage?

70
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,652
Yet managing to display better
grooming habits than you.

71
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,812
Look at yourself, Lilah.

72
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:28,282
All these years, wanting to meet me...

73
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:33,572
Couldn't run a comb through your hair,
maybe slap on a little lipstick?

74
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,805
Evil doesn't have to mean sloppy.

75
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,284
- Stop it.
- Feeling touchy, are we?

76
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:44,571
The Beast. I want you to stop it.

77
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,447
Oh.

78
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,490
Not sure I really want to.

79
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:53,009
Don't get me wrong.
Not a big fan of the horn-job.

80
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,650
But he did bring on permanent midnight.
Gotta give him props for that.

81
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,371
Can you do it or not?

82
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:04,570
Why is your thong in such a bunch,
counselor? You're a professional.

83
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:10,243
Working the sewers.
Beast took everything. Killed them all.

84
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,808
Saw the damage.
Does have a flair for it.

85
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,083
Not just at the office. Everybody.

86
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:18,802
Field ops, liaisons,
people out sick that day.

87
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:22,045
But not me. Not yet.

88
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,892
Why is he picking on us?
We're the bad guys.

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,970
Apparently not bad enough.

90
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:31,644
But there is a bright side. You have a
devoted boyfriend who loves and cares...

91
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,929
Oh, wait.

92
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,970
You don't.

93
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:38,129
Your life really is crap.

94
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:44,409
And yet I'm not the monkey in the box.
I want that thing destroyed.

95
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,203
You're the only one who can do it.

96
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:52,642
Maybe we can work something out.

97
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:59,842
What Angelus said about me...
I didn't mean to hurt you.

98
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,447
I would never do that.

99
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,763
I know.

100
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,321
I just can't help but
think if you didn't attack...

101
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:11,803
Attack?
That's how you see it, I attacked him?

102
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,362
What do you call what he was doing
before I came in?

103
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,364
- I don't know why...
- He was kissing you.

104
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,532
Don't lie to me.
It's the one thing you're not good at.

105
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:25,170
- It just happened.
- Because you let it.

106
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:30,129
I've never felt so much for anyone.

107
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,687
I would do anything for you,
but it's not enough, is it?

108
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,252
- Charles, l...
- We can't do this anymore, Fred.

109
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,210
I'm tired of you looking
everywhere but at me.

110
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,643
Like that.

111
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:54,890
What is it?

112
00:07:55,813 --> 00:08:00,045
Just can't make heads or
tails out of this banishing text.

113
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,444
- You guys have any luck?
- Yeah, but it was all bad.

114
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:07,771
Shaman didn't have the soul, doesn't
know who took it, or how to find it.

115
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,806
Other than that, everything's peachy.
Any word from Lorne?

116
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,372
Damn it!

117
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:32,726
Lilah. Ran off into the sewers.

118
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,804
Connor, wait.

119
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:40,131
You should stay here, make sure it isn't
a setup. There might be others.

120
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,562
Check the locks.

121
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,925
What kind of brain fart made that
witch try and let Angelus out?

122
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,004
I wanna know how she
knew he was here.

123
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,447
Maybe she took Angel's soul.

124
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:14,252
She's a mucky-muck at
Wolfram and Hart. It's her job to know.

125
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,973
I thought the Beast killed
everyone at Wolfram and Hart.

126
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,806
Maybe she cut some kind of deal with it.

127
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:23,488
You really think she has
a connection to the Beast?

128
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:34,802
You're a son of a bitch,
you know that?

129
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,727
When I said go underground,
I didn't think you'd...

130
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,650
- Is that where the Beast...?
- Can't make it stop.

131
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:50,210
- I can take a look at it.
- I'm fine.

132
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,684
How did you know we had Angelus?

133
00:09:56,893 --> 00:10:01,205
Big magic, taking a champion's soul.
Makes ripples.

134
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:03,728
I still know some people that like ripples.

135
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:08,332
It was your idea, wasn't it?
To bring him?

136
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,882
- Great minds...
- Aren't foolish enough to release him.

137
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,561
- I wasn't.
- So the crowbar...?

138
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:18,122
I had to make him believe
I was desperate.

139
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,325
Not much of a stretch, really, is it?

140
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:25,167
And you always wanted Angelus?

141
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,730
No. Wolfram and Hart did,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

142
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,286
I just...

143
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:35,408
I just want my life back.
All my pretty things.

144
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,168
I'm selfish that way.

145
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,405
That's why we wouldn't have
worked out.

146
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,964
There are many reasons we
wouldn't have worked out, Lilah.

147
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,166
<i>Rheinhardt's Compendium</i>?

148
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,211
I need to find a way to make it pay.

149
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,366
I've already checked.

150
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,763
There's nothing in here
that even remotely...

151
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,252
...describes...

152
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,484
...him.

153
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,524
It's identical to my copy,
except for this passage.

154
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,092
How's that possible?

155
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,486
It's not a local copy.

156
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,970
Pulled some favors, got it on
the pan-dimensional black market.

157
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:36,451
Still, it should be the exact same text.

158
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,252
Unless...

159
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,123
- Unless what?
- We'd have to check more books...

160
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:45,968
...from other dimensions, but what if
there were references to the Beast...

161
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,728
...at one time that
had somehow been removed?

162
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,005
But what would something
that powerful need to hide?

163
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,973
Lilah or not, something is
doing the Beast's dirty work.

164
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:03,331
It would explain how Giant Lava Boy
could tiptoe past us to take out many.

165
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,371
And butcher that family.
Those priestesses.

166
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:10,162
Even though Lilah's evil, I don't
see her hacking up all those people.

167
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,245
Okay, maybe it's not just her.
Maybe the big bad Beast...

168
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,131
...has minions doing his dirty work.

169
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,772
ANGELUS:
Morons.

170
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:22,001
That big rock doesn't have minions.
It is the minion.

171
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,287
No, it's not. We've seen what it can do.

172
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,648
ANGELUS:
You've just seen the warm-up act.

173
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,771
- What are you saying?
ANGELUS: There's something bigger.

174
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:35,288
Something worse. The Beast...

175
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,921
...has a boss.

176
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,162
- Worse than the Beast?
- That's...

177
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,812
That's not possible.

178
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,085
How did you survive this long
being so retarded?

179
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:52,488
Cut the Fu Manchu.
What do you know?

180
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,765
Quite a bit, bright boy.

181
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,727
Maybe I'll fill in the blanks sometime.

182
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,530
How do you know there's
something worse?

183
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,161
Because I have a brain, son.

184
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:07,889
The Beast I knew was big
into smash and slaughter.

185
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,489
Had the brawn to be really good
at it too. But the big picture?

186
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:15,164
Not his strong point.
But flash forward.

187
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:20,003
Now he's all rain of fire, destroying
the Ra-Tet, blotting out the sun.

188
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,647
Big moves for a guy whose
head's made out of rock.

189
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,366
Maybe he got smarter.

190
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,770
And maybe I'll sprout some
wings and flutter away.

191
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,852
There's something else out there.
More powerful, more vicious...

192
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:34,406
...pulling all the strings.

193
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:40,292
Ooh. I don't know about you,
but I'm just dying to find out what it is.

194
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,970
What, no cake?

195
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,005
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

196
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,408
- Angel's soul.
- Oh, that what.

197
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,484
- She didn't take it.
- How do you know?

198
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:57,242
- Because she told me.
- You believe her? Lying's her job.

199
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,762
He's got a point.

200
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:03,051
- You wanna search me?
- What happened?

201
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,403
She was hurt in the attack
on Wolfram and Hart.

202
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,047
GUNN: Place was a slaughterhouse.
How'd she make it out?

203
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:09,805
Got lucky.

204
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,331
Maybe it was more than that.

205
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,808
What were you doing downstairs
with Angelus?

206
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,085
WESLEY: She was gathering intel.
GUNN: With a crowbar?

207
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,209
She's the only one
to make it out alive...

208
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,933
...then she shows up after
Angel's soul goes missing.

209
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,924
I said she had nothing
to do with that.

210
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,931
- Maybe she knows who did.
- Or who's controlling the Beast.

211
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,886
- Controlling?
- Angelus thinks he's just the muscle.

212
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,084
Not that I trust him any more than you.

213
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:36,403
Everything that's happened
is part of a plan...

214
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:39,485
...with something worse than
the Beast sketching the blueprints.

215
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:42,247
That's what he's been trying to hide.

216
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,608
- There might be something in the text...
- Text?

217
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,487
Lilah found a passage
in <i>Rheinhardt's Compendium</i>.

218
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:51,611
But we searched that already.
There's nothing in there.

219
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:55,123
All references to the Beast
have been erased in this dimension.

220
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,891
I got my copy of <i>Rheinhardt's</i>
way out of town.

221
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,085
I'm surprised
you didn't think of that.

222
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,690
That's why Angel
can't remember the Beast.

223
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,208
His memory's been wiped clean
just like the books.

224
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:08,812
Why does Angelus remember?

225
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:12,369
Because his mind wasn't here when
the spell or whatever was cast, right?

226
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:15,007
We should compare this passage
with the information...

227
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,641
...Wolfram and Hart extracted
from Lorne. There might...

228
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:20,048
Yeah, have fun with that.

229
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,330
- Charles...
- Somebody needs to be downstairs.

230
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,927
Make sure nobody else
tries to intel our boy.

231
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,131
CORDELIA:
Let him go.

232
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,205
I know this is hard.
I know we're all tired and hurting.

233
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,846
But we have to stay focused.

234
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:41,008
We need to figure out what's coming
and how to get Angel back before then.

235
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,212
Because if this is as bad as I think it is,
we'll need him more than ever.

236
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:50,641
You know what I like about you?
You play to your strengths.

237
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:53,373
You know what they are
and you stick to them.

238
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,001
You don't find that much these days.

239
00:15:56,173 --> 00:16:01,008
Everybody always trying to expand
their horizons, actuate their potential...

240
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:06,566
...and all that other touchy-feely crap.
But not you. You don't try to change.

241
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,409
Because you know your place.

242
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:15,092
That'll go a long way towards
keeping you alive.

243
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,284
Well, a lot longer than the others.

244
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,566
Man, you guys really are on a streak.

245
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:28,124
You let L.A. Nearly burn to the ground,
lost the sun, let the creepie-crawlies...

246
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,648
...practically take over the city.

247
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,405
But, you know, that's okay.

248
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:36,327
At least you got the love
of a good woman.

249
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,047
Till she dumps you for a guy with
a bigger horizon.

250
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,048
- It's her life.
- Oh, wait.

251
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:47,723
Did I miss it?
Did she already let you down easy?

252
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,124
Cheer up, buddy.
Not like we didn't see it coming.

253
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,853
Especially after what happened
to her old professor.

254
00:16:57,013 --> 00:17:00,688
Come on. Even Angel's not that stupid.

255
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:03,532
The way things changed
between you two.

256
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,369
The furtive looks. All that guilt.

257
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,692
Mm. There's nothing like
your first murder.

258
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:15,490
Don't worry. I won't tell
what our little girl did.

259
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:19,528
- She didn't...
- Yeah! It was you.

260
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:23,083
- Stepping up and being the man!
- I did what I had to do.

261
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,047
I guess Fred didn't quite
see it that way. Wow.

262
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:32,885
You do a chick a favor,
you'd think she'd be grateful. But no.

263
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,328
She still goes for the broody smart guy...

264
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:39,327
...all mysterious and tortured.

265
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,808
I guess when you think about it,
for the first time in your life...

266
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,164
...you just weren't dark enough.

267
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,807
Maybe there's hope for you
after all, Chuck.

268
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,726
FRED:
This is hopeless.

269
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,602
The Orb of Thessulas is the only way
I can find to restore Angel's soul.

270
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,845
But that only works if it's moved
on to an afterlife or something...

271
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:10,049
...not floating in a jar somewhere.

272
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,565
- We'll find a way to bring Angel back.
- How?

273
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:21,204
The way we always do:
Skill, perseverance...

274
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:22,886
Luck.

275
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:28,091
Not a lot of that going around.

276
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:32,289
- We'll be all right.
- As long as we stick together.

277
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,210
Fred...

278
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,170
What happened between
me and Gunn...

279
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,285
I didn't mean...

280
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:48,406
That's not what I wanted.

281
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,052
Could you tell him that?

282
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,609
I don't think he'll listen.

283
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,369
We're not...

284
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,287
We're not together anymore.

285
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:08,572
Oh.

286
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,731
Not because of what I did?

287
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,770
Things just haven't been right.

288
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,284
Not for a while.

289
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:29,212
I think this is the part where
I'm supposed to say I'm sorry...

290
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:32,883
...and I'm really trying to be, but...
LILAH: Any progress?

291
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:37,568
- Not really.
- Pity.

292
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,050
I made some headway
cross-referencing...

293
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,091
...but no telling how long it'll take
to get anything definitive.

294
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,131
But you've made some progress?

295
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,767
Sure looks like he's trying.

296
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,250
I'll relieve Gunn.

297
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,847
See if I can get anything else
out of Angelus.

298
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:59,161
So, what now? Ouija board?

299
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:03,763
Lorne. Did you find out anything?

300
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:07,648
Zip. Zilch. And what in the
hell is Succubitch doing here?

301
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:11,448
Still trying to figure that out.
So nothing?

302
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:14,730
Talked to every contact that
hasn't beat it for higher ground.

303
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,849
Nobody's heard Bo Peep
about Angel's soul.

304
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:18,605
Forget about the goody-goody.

305
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:21,924
You wanna kill the Beast and
give his boss a run for his evil?

306
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:25,125
The answer is downstairs in a cage.
Sic Angelus on him.

307
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,563
You know what Angelus
would do if we let him out?

308
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,485
Kill you all in a bloody shower of
violence, but hey. Greater good.

309
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,526
We'll find another way.
I'm sure if we just all...

310
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,161
What? Hold hands and sing a hymn?

311
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:41,126
Might be hard when
the Beast is ripping your guts out.

312
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,805
Lilah, I know things look grim right now.

313
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:50,642
Don't go Watchtower on me, Saint
Cordelia. I don't think I could stomach it.

314
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:54,609
Man, I'd love to punch your face in.

315
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:58,523
Are you trying to turn me on?

316
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:03,644
What's sad about people like you, Lilah,
it all comes down to fear.

317
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:06,931
Fascinating.
Now that we've got that settled.

318
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,881
You're too scared to believe in anything
because you're too scared to hope.

319
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,328
You won't even open your
eyes to the possibility.

320
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:18,050
You don't get it, do you, Twinkie?
I'm what I believe in.

321
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:21,206
You think I got this far
by sticking my head in the sand?

322
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:24,127
The Beast that eviscerated me
has a boss.

323
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:28,047
That boss is gonna end life as we know
it, and nobody is coming to save us.

324
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,967
Not Angel, not the Powers That Be
and not the 40-damn-2nd Cavalry.

325
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,284
So if anybody has scales
on their eyes...

326
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,607
...it's you.

327
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:43,932
I can bring him back.
I know how to re-ensoul Angel.

328
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,890
Hey, we were just talking about you.
At least I was, anyway.

329
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,851
- What is it?
- Cordelia had a vision.

330
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:06,402
She knows how to put his soul back.

331

you guys suck.

00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,811
Sorry if I scared you.

500
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,644
Angel. I thought...

501
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:27,452
Cordy let me out.

502
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:34,123
Actually, I asked her to be let out.
You know what? Never mind.

503
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,052
No, wait.

504
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,681
I'm the one who's sorry.

505
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:43,129
After everything you've
been through, I...

506
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:48,369
It has been a little rough.

507
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:52,402
- On all of us. The stress is...
- I know I could use a drink.

508
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,565
Now, you see?
That's what I was afraid of.

509
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:03,206
For the rest of your life
you'll only see this evil thing.

510
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:10,564
You're my friend, Angel.
Past is past and done is done.

511
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,732
Thanks, Fred.

512
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,006
Can I get a hug?

[GLASS BREAKS]

514
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:29,291
It's my inner megalomaniac.
I rebel at serving coffee.

515
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,490
- Angel, I thought you were confined to...
- Change in plans.

516
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:36,049
Cordy talked me out of staying down
there. Now I've got my own mission.

517
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:37,811
- Which is?
- Too dangerous, son.

518
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:39,691
I'm afraid you can't go with me.

519
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:46,613
I have to go save the world.

520
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:55,130
So has anyone seen Cordy?

521
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,244
Connor's on point.
Three-party follow-up.

522
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:02,244
Me, Wes and Fred in the truck.
Cordy?

523
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,489
I don't understand how
the spell didn't work.

524
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:07,884
- Dud <i>ex machina</i>. There's a surprise.
- Cordy.

525
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,683
We'll be fine. Go.

526
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,728
He'll want to feed. A lot.

527
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:17,726
Our only advantage is,
he might think we want to capture him.

528
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,685
We're all agreed
that's not an option.

529
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,321
Angelus is loose because
we brought him in this world.

530
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,445
It's our job to take him out of it.

531
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:29,090
Take the shot. Any shot you can get.

532
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,806
Now you're playing my song.

533
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:33,326
- I don't know if l...
- You will.

534
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:36,565
Let's go, while his trail's still hot.

535
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:50,445
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Where's the fun in that?

536
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:03,892
What happened to pedestrians?
Human pedestrians?

537
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,971
Is there no fast food
left in Los Angeles?

538
00:38:08,693 --> 00:38:12,368
And he let me think
I was talking him into it.

539
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:16,412
Those evil geniuses. Get you every time.

540
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:20,972
The Beast and then Angelus
and now there's something worse.

541
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:25,326
- I thought the spell was...
- Divine intervention?

542
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:32,008
Trust me, you have more chances of
winning the lottery six times in a row.

543
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:33,526
I had the numbers done.

544
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:39,248
- It just makes me question...
ANGELUS: What's it all for?

545
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,768
I would too, if I were about to die.

546
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,532
This time...

547
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:02,292
...you stay down!
As for you, luscious thing...

548
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:05,246
...you were gonna let
me out of that cage, so let's see...

549
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:08,883
I'll give you, what, a 10-second start?
Ten, nine...

550
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:11,726
There's a girl who takes
advantage of her opportunities...

551
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:15,526
Don't be jealous, kitten.
She's just the warm-up.

552
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:19,726
I'll save the good stuff for you.
Eight, seven...

[SIRENS WAILING]

554
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,206
Doesn't make sense.

555
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:42,923
- What doesn't?
- Angelus would want to feed.

556
00:39:43,093 --> 00:39:47,325
But his scent ends here
and it's not a highly populated area.

557
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:50,291
It ends here? Somebody pick him up?

558
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,523
He'd go where he could
wreak the most damage.

559
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:56,243
Which doesn't necessarily
mean highly populated.

560
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,447
He doubled back.

561
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,088
Lilah.

562
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:08,448
Oh, Lilah!

Boo!

566
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:49,732
Oh, Lilah, I had such high hopes for us.

567
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:53,932
Your devious mind, my killer instincts.
What a team we would've made.

568
00:40:54,373 --> 00:40:55,692
Could still make.

569
00:40:57,493 --> 00:40:59,449
Always were a closer.

570
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:02,127
Unfortunately, with the new
big scary in town...

571
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,727
...you're just
not looking so tough anymore.

572
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:08,571
And I'm a winning-team kind of guy.
Couple that with the recent...

...people shortage, you're lucky
I'm letting you yack this long.

574
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:29,764
- He's gonna kill us.
- I know.

575
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,723
Why do you think I let him out,
you stupid bitch?
