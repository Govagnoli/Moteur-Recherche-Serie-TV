1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,459
Los Angeles,

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,280
You see it at night and it shines,
A beacon,

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,060
People are drawn to it,
People...

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,330
...and other things,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,470
They come for all sorts of reasons,
My reason?

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,559
No surprise there,

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,570
It started with a girl,

8
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,070
She was a really, really pretty girl.

9
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,050
No, I mean....

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,589
She was a hottie girl.

11
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,570
She had....

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,510
I mean, her hair...

13
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,340
...was....

14
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:34,710
You know?

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,159
You kind of remind me of her.

16
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,689
Because....
Because, you know, the hair.

17
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,149
I mean, you both have hair.

18
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,979
A shark! Oh!

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,020
- We want to cash out.
- Yeah, sure.

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,849
Girls are nice.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,159
Here you go, pal.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,569
Thank you.

23
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,200
Come on, let's go.

24
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,989
Let's go find some real fun.

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,400
You really know the doorman?

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,379
You can get us into Lido?

27
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:40,569
I don't want to go clubbing.

28
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,370
I want to party right here.

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,129
Hey, back off!

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,989
Shut up and die.

31
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,909
Excuse me. Excuse me.

32
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,489
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,010
Anyone seen my car?

34
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,129
It's big and shiny.

35
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,000
Piss off, pal.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,409
Breath mint?

37
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,539
You shouldn't have done that.

38
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,229
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,030
They were....

40
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,580
Go home.

41
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,520
Thank you.

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,300
Get away from me.

43
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,050
I like the place.

44
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,129
Not much of a view...

45
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,990
...but it's got a nice "Bat Cave"
sort of air to it.

46
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,970
Who are you?

47
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,259
Doyle.

48
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,000
- You don't smell human.
- That's a bit rude.

49
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,750
As it happens,
I'm very much human.

50
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,829
On my mother's side.

51
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,240
I come uninvited, so you know
I'm not a vampire like you.

52
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,930
What do you want?

53
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,980
I've been sent.

54
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,579
- By the powers that be.
- Powers that be what?

55
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:45,110
Let me tell you
a little bedtime story.

56
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,810
But I'm not sleepy.

57
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,050
Once upon a time,
there was a vampire.

58
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,939
He was the meanest vampire
in all the land.

59
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,110
Other vampires were afraid
of him. He was such a...

60
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,699
...bastard.

61
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,699
Then one day, he's cursed.
By gypsies.

62
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,250
They restore his human soul.

63
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,529
Suddenly, he's mad with guilt.

64
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,660
"What have I done?"

65
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,319
He's freaked.

66
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,089
Okay...

67
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,850
...now I'm sleepy.

68
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, it's a fairly dull tale.

69
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,300
I feel it needs a little sex.

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,009
So, sure enough, enter the girl.

71
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,990
Pretty little blond thing.
Vampire slayer by trade.

72
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,399
Our vampire falls madly
in love with her.

73
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,790
Eventually, the two of them
get fleshy with one another.

74
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,959
The moment he--

75
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,189
I guess the technical term is
"Perfect Happiness."

76
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,189
But when our boy gets there...

77
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,129
...he goes bad.
He kills again.

78
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,149
It's ugly.

79
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,139
When he gets his soul back
for the second time...

80
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,720
...he figures he can't be near her...

81
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,790
...without endangering them both.
What does he do?

82
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,329
He takes off.

83
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,100
Goes to L.A...

84
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,920
...to fight evil,
and atone for his crimes.

85
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,420
He's a shadow.

86
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,439
A faceless champion
of the hapless human race.

87
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,370
You wouldn't have a beer
in here, would you?

88
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,819
No.

89
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,949
You must have something
besides pig's blood.

90
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,529
You've told me the story
of my life, which since...

91
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,500
...I was there, I already knew.

92
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,430
Why aren't I kicking you out?

93
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,250
Now I'm gonna tell you
what happens next.

94
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,670
This vampire, he thinks he's helping.

95
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,720
Fighting the demons.

96
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,120
Staying away from humans
to avoid temptation.

97
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,120
Doing penance in his little cell.

98
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,089
But he's cut off...

99
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,879
...from everything.

100
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,939
From the people he's trying to help.

101
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,379
I still save them.

102
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,850
Who cares if I
don't stop to chat?

103
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,449
When was the last time
you drank blood?

104
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,649
Buffy.

105
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,769
Left you with a bit of a craving.

106
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,149
Let me tell you something.
That craving's gonna grow.

107
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,430
One day, one of those helpless
victims you don't care about...

108
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,189
...will look too
appetizing to turn down.

109
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,029
And you'll figure, "What's one
against all I've saved?

110
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,560
Might as well eat them.
I'm still ahead by the numbers."

111
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,759
I'm parched from this yakking, man.
Let's go treat me to a Billy Dee.

112
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,590
It's not about fighting
and gadgets and such.

113
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,779
It's about reaching out. Showing them
that there's love and hope.

114
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,940
- Spare change?
- Get a job, you lazy sow.

115
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,409
It's about letting them
in your heart.

116
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,730
It's not just saving lives,
it's saving souls.

117
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,519
Hey! Possibly your own
in the process.

118
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,100
I want to know who sent you.

119
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,039
I'm honestly not sure who sent me.

120
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,120
They don't speak to me direct.

121
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,149
I get...

122
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:02,559
...visions.

123
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,549
Great splitting migraines
that come with pictures.

124
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,029
A name, a face.

125
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,620
I don't know who sends them.

126
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,009
Whoever sends them
is more powerful than us.

127
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,769
- They're trying to make things right.
- Why me?

128
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,529
You got potential.

129
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,669
- The balance sheet ain't in your favor.
- Why you?

130
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,509
We all got something to atone for.

131
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,429
Had a vision this morning.

132
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,990
When the blinding pain stopped,
I wrote this down.

133
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:34,750
Tina?

134
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,409
Pretty girl. Needs help.

135
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,250
Help with what?

136
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,789
That's your business.
I just take the names.

137
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:43,100
- I don't get it. How am I supposed--?
- Get into her life, remember?

138
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,120
Get involved.

139
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,340
Look, high school's over, bud.

140
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,809
You gotta make with the
grown-up talk now.

141
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,519
Why would a woman I've never met
talk to me?

142
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,549
Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

143
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,149
No, I guess you really haven't.

144
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,889
I'm not good with people.

145
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,169
That's the whole point of this
little exercise, isn't it?

146
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,429
Are you game?

147
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,309
Tina, I gotta do it by seniority.
Everyone wants to work extra hours.

148
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,070
It's just....
I just need....

149
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,250
I'm good for Saturday nights.
If people want to go out...

150
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,120
...I'll double-shift, whatever.

151
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,480
You're on the list, okay?

152
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,389
Thanks.

153
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,370
Sure is a cute...

154
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,059
...doggy.

155
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,049
So, do you...?

156
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,529
How late are you open?

157
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,490
You talking to me?

158
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,580
Wow!

159
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,649
Good reflexes.

160
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,850
Thanks. These come
out of my paycheck.

161
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:20,490
So...

162
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,720
...are you...

163
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,440
...happy?

164
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,250
What?

165
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,570
You looked sort of down.

166
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,700
You been watching me?

167
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,360
No, I just....

168
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,679
I was looking towards there...

169
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,649
...and you walked...

170
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,210
...through there.

171
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,350
You don't hit on girls
very often, do you?

172
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,679
It's been a while.

173
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,039
I'm sort of new in town.

174
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,419
Do yourself a favor.
Don't stay.

175
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,919
You never answered my question.

176
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,450
Am I happy?
You got three hours?

177
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,759
Do I look busy?

178
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,490
I get off at 10.

179
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,159
I suddenly feel underdressed.

180
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,610
Did you want a drink?

181
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,320
I know who you are,
what you're doing here.

182
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,990
Stay away from me.
Tell Russell to leave me alone.

183
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,230
I don't know any Russell.

184
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,889
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

185
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,309
- Why were you watching me?
- Because you looked lonely.

186
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,870
I figured then we have
something in common.

187
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,620
Oh....

188
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,730
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,309
- I'm really--
- It's okay.

190
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,720
No, it's not.

191
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,470
I'm sort of having
relationship issues.

192
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:53,700
Who's Russell?

193
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,450
I'd like to help.

194
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,129
Only help I need is a ticket home.

195
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,200
And that wasn't me
asking for money.

196
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,029
Where's home?

197
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,929
Missoula, Montana.

198
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,750
- You've been there?
- During the Depression.

199
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,250
My depression.

200
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:17,769
I was depressed there.

201
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,820
- But it's pretty.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,580
Lots of open land.

203
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,350
Lots of nothing else.

204
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,149
I came here to be
a famous movie star...

205
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,049
...but they weren't hiring.

206
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,860
Well, I have a fabulous...

207
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,259
...Hollywood party to go to.

208
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,309
Hence the glamour.

209
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,730
Girl giving it owes me
my security deposit.

210
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,039
It was nice threatening you.

211
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,549
You need a lift?

212
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,929
Tina! Smile for the camera.

213
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,639
Who is this hunk of tall,
dark and handsome?

214
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,549
Just a friend.

215
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,940
Margo, I really need to
talk to you.

216
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,870
Grab yourself a drink,
I'll be right there.

217
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,549
Cute.

218
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:23,960
Everyone's a star.

219
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,460
Who's Russell?

220
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,279
Someone I made
the mistake of trusting.

221
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,220
Here I am.

222
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,620
- This won't take long.
- I wouldn't leave that one unattended.

223
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,340
You are a beautiful, beautiful man.

224
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,029
- Thanks.
- You're an actor.

225
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,899
- No.
- That wasn't a question.

226
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,659
I'm Oliver.

227
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,799
Ask anyone about Oliver,
they'll tell you I'm a fierce animal.

228
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm your manager as soon as you call.

229
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,389
I'm not an actor.

230
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,929
I like the humor.
I like the whole thing.

231
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,899
Call me. This isn't a come-on.

232
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,889
I'm in a serious relationship
with a landscape architect.

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,919
You know, they asked me to
come and read a third time.

234
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm an actress! I don't put up
with things like that.

235
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,549
Cordelia?

236
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh, my God! Angel?

237
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,610
Nice to see a familiar face.

238
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,860
Are you living here?

239
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,309
Yeah. You?

240
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,789
Malibu.

241
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,700
A condo.
Not on a private beach...

242
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,169
...but I'm young, so I forbear.

243
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,120
And you're acting?

244
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,250
Can you believe it?

245
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,789
I just started it
to make some quick cash...

246
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,970
...and then, boom.
It was like, my life.

247
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,950
So...

248
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,889
...are you still...?

249
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,250
Yeah.

250
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,470
There's not actually
a cure for that.

251
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:00,629
Right.

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,850
But you're not evil?

253
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,620
You're not here to...

254
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:05,820
...bite people?

255
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,720
No, I gave a friend a ride.

256
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:08,990
Oh, good.

257
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,309
I better get mingly. I really should
talk to people that are somebody.

258
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,370
But it was fun!

259
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,950
It's nice that she's grown
as a person.

260
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,330
She doesn't have the money yet.

261
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,519
Who's that?

262
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,129
Stacy.

263
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,850
He's just a creep.

264
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,359
Can we please go?

265
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,730
Yeah.

266
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,170
He wants to see you, that's all.

267
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,549
Okay. Okay, no problem.

268
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:55,440
Damn it!

269
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,730
I don't know you.
Don't get involved.

270
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,269
Tina, get in the car.

271
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,430
You know what?

272
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,329
You're not gonna shoot.

273
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,670
Good call.

274
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,599
Nice party, huh?

275
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,369
A little too fabulous for me.

276
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,859
You have one new message,

277
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,650
Cordy, it's Joe at the agency,

278
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:57,339
No luck, again,

279
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,500
Having trouble booking auditions,
Networks say they've seen enough,

280
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,779
No need to call, I'll buzz you
if something changes, Bye,

281
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,700
You have no more messages,

282
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,589
My Girl Scout training.

283
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,869
I can live out of this bag
for days if I have to.

284
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,640
I made some tea.

285
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,329
Thanks.

286
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,589
- Do you take milk and sugar?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,519
Because I don't have those things.

288
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,650
I don't get a lot of visitors.

289
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,470
At least not ones you like.

290
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,339
I have relationship issues too.

291
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,549
I guess this is the part
where you comfort me.

292
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,170
Not like you didn't earn it.

293
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,210
No.

294
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:57,160
This is the part where you
have a safe place to stay.

295
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:00,380
You don't want--

296
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,380
You have enough people
taking advantage.

297
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,230
Boy, are you ever
in the wrong town....

298
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:19,759
Thanks.

299
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,680
Did Russell have a last name?

300
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,509
You don't need to know it.

301
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,549
You've done enough already.

302
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,980
This is L.A. Guys like him
get away with murder.

303
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,069
Who did he murder?

304
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,150
I don't know. Maybe nobody.

305
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,670
He likes....

306
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,380
He likes pain.

307
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,779
I mean, he really does.

308
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,589
He talks about it
like it's a friend of his.

309
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,170
And you don't leave him.

310
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,559
He tells you when he's had enough.

311
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,380
I knew this girl, Denise.

312
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,339
She tried to get away.

313
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,619
She disappeared off the face
of the earth.

314
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,000
He finds you.

315
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,299
Not anymore.

316
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,269
No! No!

317
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,329
- Tina.
- No! No!

318
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,200
It's all right.

319
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,279
He was here.

320
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,490
I'm here.

321
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,289
Easy....

322
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,529
Did Denise have
a tattoo on her left shoulder?

323
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,710
She had a rose.

324
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,319
I think she was murdered.

325
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,599
There've been others.
He picks girls with no one to care.

326
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,039
You don't have to be afraid.
Look, you're safe here.

327
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:14,990
Why do you have that?

328
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,470
You knew who I was when you
walked in there last night.

329
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,730
No, I didn't. Look, I just--

330
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,660
I had your name. It's complicated.

331
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,849
I'm sure. Big complicated game
that Russell is playing with my head.

332
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,569
- What's he paying you?
- He's not.

333
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,170
You're just like him!

334
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,450
You stay away from me.

335
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,569
Please, listen to me.

336
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,880
Russell.

337
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,140
I've been looking everywhere for you.
And here you are right under my nose.

338
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,470
Oh, I own the building.
Most of the block.

339
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,470
Are you gonna point that
at me all day?

340
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,509
What did you do to Denise?

341
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,099
- Nothing.
- I want the truth, Russell.

342
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,599
She wanted to go home.
I bought her a ticket to Pensacola.

343
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:56,130
She's dead.

344
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,049
What do you mean?
She called me yesterday.

345
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,690
She's thinking of going
back to school, wanted my help.

346
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,480
Look, we both know
I live outside the box...

347
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,700
...but I don't go around
killing my friends.

348
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,160
If you're sick of L.A.,
if you need rent....

349
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:22,910
You know, I only want to help you.

350
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,200
Just tell me what you want.

351
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,950
I want to go home.

352
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:30,680
Done.

353
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,960
Poor thing. Who's been spinning
your head like this?

354
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,950
I don't know, I thought you hired him.

355
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,039
He turned into something.

356
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,039
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen.

357
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:51,289
Well, you're young.

358
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,369
The guy was called Stacy.

359
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,359
First name or last?

360
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,039
I don't know.
Probably done some time.

361
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,250
- I can ask around.
- Great.

362
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,440
Gray '87 Mercedes 300E. Gonna need
some serious work on the bumper.

363
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,410
- Call the chop shops.
- I know a couple.

364
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,339
He leads me to Stacy,
Stacy leads me to Russell.

365
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,339
You couldn't have known she'd run.

366
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,279
Let's get to work.

367
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,819
- You can't cut yourself off--
- Doyle.

368
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,539
I don't want to share my feelings.

369
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,920
I don't want to open up.

370
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,809
I want to find the guy that killed
Tina and look him in the eye.

371
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:19,250
Then what?

372
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,500
Then I'm gonna share my feelings.

373
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,609
Mr. Winters, the Eltron merger
is a go.

374
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,710
They caved on everything after you...

375
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,039
...negotiated with their CFO.

376
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,980
We'll bring the papers by tomorrow.

377
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,819
She had something, didn't she?

378
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:54,009
I was sorry to kill her so soon.

379
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,430
Actually, you haven't seen her
in several weeks.

380
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,009
You were in conference yesterday when
the unfortunate incident occurred.

381
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,140
We've located a witness who says
he saw a dark-complected man there.

382
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,019
Impressive.

383
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,460
Wolfram and Hart is a full-service
law firm, Mr. Winters.

384
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,410
It's our job to make sure that our
clients' lives run more smoothly.

385
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,940
Who is this?

386
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,309
Fresh face. I think we should meet.

387
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:33,990
Should I alert the firm that she may
constitute a long-term investment?

388
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,170
I don't think so.

389
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,500
I just want something to eat.

390
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,890
Where does he live?

391
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,500
Whatever she was to you,
you better forget it.

392
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,799
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

393
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,559
Russell? Let me guess.

394
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,450
Not big on the daylight or mirrors.
Drinks V8.

395
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,119
You get in his way, he'll kill you
and everyone you care about.

396
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,880
There's nobody left I care about.

397
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,630
"I am somebody.

398
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,950
I matter.

399
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,950
People will be attracted to my positive
energy and help me achieve my goals.

400
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,880
I am right where I'm supposed to be..."

401
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,630
...and not dying for something to eat!

402
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,339
Hello. Cordelia Chase.

403
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:35,230
Cor, it's Margo.
You were such a hit at my party.

404
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,289
Oh, thanks.

405
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,319
Well, guess who saw my videotape
of the party...

406
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:42,799
...and guess who wants to meet you.

407
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:47,059
A director? A manager? An assistant
to an assistant who wants lunch?

408
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,420
Russell Winters.

409
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,900
The investment guy?

410
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,970
Oh, Cordelia.
He is a lot more than that.

411
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,829
He helps people get started
in their careers.

412
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,940
He knows everyone,
and he wants to meet you tonight.

413
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,289
Tonight?

414
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,410
He'll send a limo for you at 8.

415
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,609
You're really going to war here.

416
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:15,799
I guess you've seen a few.

417
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:18,410
Fourteen. Not including Vietnam.

418
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,740
They never declared it.

419
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,420
"People will be attracted to my
positive energy...

420
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,700
...and help me achieve my goals."
Oh, yeah.

421
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,410
Best of luck to you.

422
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:46,140
I got money on the Vikings tonight,
but I'll be there in spirit.

423
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,849
You're driving.

424
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,329
Wait a minute. No, no.
I'm not combat ready, man.

425
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,480
- I'm just a messenger.
- And I'm the message.

426
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,369
I'm Russell.
Thank you so much for coming.

427
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,369
That'll be all, Franklin.

428
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,279
We'd like to be alone.

429
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,150
Wow. What a nice place.
I love your curtains.

430
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,460
Not afraid to emphasize the curtains.

431
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,390
I have old-fashioned tastes.

432
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,130
I grew up in a nice home.

433
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,670
It wasn't like this, but we had rooms
that we didn't know what were for.

434
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,480
Till the IRS got all huffy about
my folks not paying their taxes...

435
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,960
...for, well, ever.

436
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,079
They took it all.

437
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,150
Margo tells me you're an actress.

438
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:50,230
- That's going well?
- Oh.

439
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,390
Yeah, it's great.
I've had a lot of opportunities.

440
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,690
The hands in the LiquiGel commercial
were almost mine by a few girls...

441
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,559
...and, well....

442
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:07,700
It's not everything I....

443
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,130
How you doing?

444
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:24,390
I think we're lost.
We're looking for Roscomere.

445
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,240
Hey, what are you watching there?
Is that the game?

446
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:33,930
Tie him up.

447
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,180
I'm out in 10 minutes
or I'm not coming out.

448
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,640
I've tried really hard, you know?

449
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:52,940
Usually when I set out to do something
I succeed at it right away.

450
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,359
But I don't know anybody...

451
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,740
...and I don't really
have any friends here.

452
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,880
Now you know me.

453
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,549
And you don't have to worry anymore.

454
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,049
What do you want me to do?

455
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,240
Just tell me what you want.

456
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,609
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm getting
all weepy in front of you.

457
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,000
I probably look really scary.

458
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,930
I finally get invited
to a nice place...

459
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,049
...with no mirrors...

460
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:35,170
...and lots of curtains.

461
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,470
Hey, you're a vampire.

462
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,130
- What? No, I'm not.
- Are too.

463
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,500
I don't know what you mean.

464
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,019
I'm from Sunnydale, we had
a hellmouth. I know a vampire...

465
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:48,990
...when I'm alone with him
in his fortress-like home.

466
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,269
I'm just feeling a little
lightheaded from hunger.

467
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,849
I'm just wacky and kidding.

468
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,599
Truth is, I'm glad you know.

469
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:17,000
We can skip the formalities.

470
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,510
Russell Winters.

471
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:50,280
Angel?

472
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,360
I have a message...

473
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,230
...from Tina.

474
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,900
You've made a very big mistake,
coming here.

475
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,900
You don't know who he is, do you?

476
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:05,130
Oh, boy, you're about
to get your ass kicked!

477
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,070
Angel!

478
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:32,099
Kill them!

479
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,690
Angel!

480
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,449
That's it. I'm gone.

481
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:57,050
Damn it!

482
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,429
It's a good gate.

483
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,559
I had a little bit
of an accident. We'll talk later.

484
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,079
- Got it!
- Finally.

485
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,139
I thought I'd faint while barfing.

486
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,690
Sorry. Okay, so it's over, right?

487
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,139
We're gonna be okay. You put
the fear of God in that Russell guy.

488
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:47,059
He's not gonna come looking
for me, right?

489
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,530
The Eltron mutual trust binder
is ready for your signature.

490
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,219
Local authorities have no information
on the intruder from last night.

491
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,280
However, we do have several
top private investigators that--

492
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,880
--are looking into his whereabouts.

493
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,269
I believe we've located him.

494
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,829
I'm with Wolfram and Hart.

495
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,510
Mr. Winters has never been accused...

496
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:25,869
...and shall never be
convicted of any crime.

497
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:27,610
Ever.

498
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,730
If you harass our client, we'll
bring you into the light of day...

499
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,650
...a place, I'm told, that's not
all that healthy for you.

500
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:39,960
Angel.

501
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,130
We do things a certain way in L.A.

502
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,869
Well, I'm new here.

503
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:48,000
But you're a civilized man.

504
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,969
We don't have to go around
attacking each other.

505
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,949
Look at me. I pay my taxes,
keep my name out of the paper...

506
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:58,380
...and I don't make waves.

507
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:03,110
And in return,
I can do anything I want.

508
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,360
Really?

509
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:16,559
Can you fly?

510
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,199
Guess not.

511
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,760
Set up an interoffice meeting at 4:00.

512
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,699
It seems we have a new player in town.

513
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,650
There's no need to disturb
the senior partners with this.

514
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,250
Not yet.

515
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,949
Hello?

516
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,139
Hello?

517
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,119
What happened to Russell?

518
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,059
He went into the light.

519
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,110
Yet you don't seem to be
in a celebrating mood.

520
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:39,980
I killed a vampire.
It didn't help anyone.

521
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:45,199
You sure? There's a girl
upstairs who's happy as can be.

522
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,070
Oh, my God!

523
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,940
A cockroach. In the corner.

524
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,409
I'd say it's a bantamweight.

525
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,320
Okay, first thing, we need to call
an exterminator.

526
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,099
And a sign painter.
We should have a name on the door.

527
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,639
Okay, I'm confused.

528
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,829
Doyle filled me in
on your little mission.

529
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,260
So if we're going to be helping
people out, maybe a small charge.

530
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,510
A fee.
Something to help pay the rent...

531
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,000
...and my salary.

532
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,880
You need someone to organize things,
and you're not rich...

533
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,000
...Mr. I-was-alive-for-200-years-and-
never-got-an-investment-portfolio.

534
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,250
- You want to charge people?
- Not everybody.

535
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,849
But sooner or later we are gonna have
to help some rich people, right?

536
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,360
Possibly, yeah.

537
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,460
Hand me that box. We should charge...

538
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:43,119
...based on a case-by-case analysis,
but with me working for a flat fee.

539
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,010
I mean, that is...if you think
you can use me?

540
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,440
Of course, this is just temporary...

541
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,510
...until my inevitable stardom
takes effect.

542
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,860
Good choice. She'll provide
a connection to the world.

543
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,110
She's got a very humanizing influence.

544
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,130
You think she's a hottie.

545
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:19,190
She's a stiffener, all right.
Can't lie about that.

546
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:22,050
- But she could use a hand.
- True.

547
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,579
There's a lot of people
in this city need helping.

548
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:29,289
So I noticed.

549
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:31,480
You game?

550
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,610
I'm game,
