Corporate seers alerted me to the situation.

165
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,356
- Which is?
- It's a harbinger.

166
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:41,559
- Harbinger?
- Upshot is we've got trouble with a capital ''T''...

167
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,192
and that rhymes with ''P,''
and that stands for ''prophecy.''

168
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,601
Shanshu.
Maybe you've heard of it?

169
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:50,539
Oh, God. That again, yeah.
I'm familiar. So?

170
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:54,043
So it talks about a champion--
a vampire with a soul...

171
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:57,547
who will play a pivotal role
in the apocalypse... for good or evil.

172
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,277
Anybody's guess.
That part's hazy.

173
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:03,582
I thought the Shanshu had to do with
Angel becoming human again after--

174
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,590
That's just the epilogue, princess.

175
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,128
And for the record, the prophecy
doesn't call Angel by name.

176
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,891
<i>Hold on. You're sayin'because</i>
<i>Spike's back,you think he's--</i>

177
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:16,024
I don't think anything.
All I can tell you...

178
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,035
is his very existence is
disrupting the order of things.

179
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,968
No argument here.

180
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,974
There were already two souled vampires
in the universe before Spike fried.

181
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,102
<i>- Why is this happening now?</i>
- Key word here is ''champion.''

182
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:31,046
Spike gave his life to save the world.
That gives him the cred.

183
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,448
But when he died and
became a ghost, case closed.

184
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:37,920
Now that he's back,
all bets are off, kids.

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,229
- Where are you going?
- To check on something.

186
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:51,295

I was working on recorporealizing Spike...

- Hey, I would've said something
if I'd known, sweetie.

190
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:03,480
bring Spike back?

191
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:08,519
You guys did do it, right?

192
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,680
Something came
in the mail for him.

193
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,759
The mail?
Like the amulet.

194
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,296
Yeah. Never did find out
who sent it.

195
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:21,093

What you're told. Right.

198
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:32,767
So the seers told you the phones
and all were a harbinger.

199
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:38,208
- Of what?
- Something worse...

00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,988

''The root of the tree

- It's metaphor.

- Oh, come on, Spike.

308

- Why the bloody hell not?

We don't want to be wrong about this.

310
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,912
There is no wrong. The drinking
of the cup is predestined.

311
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,742
That can't be changed.
Whoever drinks from it was meant to.

312
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:47,648
And when one is confirmed
as the central figure of the prophecy...

313
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,913
the universe should realign itself.

314
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:53,479
So this cup thing--
Where is it? Does it say?

Drusilla sired me,

00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:10,446
I didn't make you, Spike. I just opened up

No, you're less.

498
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:48,389
That's why Buffy
never really loved you.

499
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:50,426
Because you weren't me.

500
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:57,458
[ Grunts ] I guess that means
she was thinkin' about you...

- You're gonna be okay.Just--

- What?
- Come on, Fred.

Probably should've dusted you...

That's not a prize
you're holding.

524
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:28,879
It's not a trophy.

525
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:34,420
It's a burden.

526
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,994
It's a cross.

One you're gonna have to bear
till it burns you to ashes.

Believe me. I know.

529
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,607
So ask yourself...

530
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:56,612
is this really the destiny

<i>Do you even really want it?</i>

to take something away from me?

00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:10,859
Bit of both.

00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:59,974
I fell down... some stairs.

Big stairs. Gunn.

- And getting worse.
What about the cup? Did you--

00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,788
- It was a fake. Somebody set us up.
- What? Who?

543
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:16,724
I don't know. Sirk was the one
who sent us there. Maybe he's--

544
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:20,285
<i>Gone. Cleaned out his offiice</i>
<i>and pulled a puff of smoke.</i>

Stairs, huh?

546
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:28,499
All right. Sirk's gone, the cup
is a fake, but the madness is real.

Hey, what the hell happened?

Senior partners stepped in. Apparently they
were working on the problem since it started.

553
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,189
They managed to temporarily
stabilize the universal equilibrium.

Temporarily. For how long?

00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:03,838
What about Sirk and this fantasy
he fed us about the cup?

556

The partners don't know a thing
about it. They're as angry as you.

- Really doubt that.
- Don't worry, Angel.

him in, find out who put him up to it.

not as fun as it sounds.

On the plus side, they totally fell

right under

And you might be happy to know
Team Angel is on red alert.

00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:21,935
Could be they think the partners just
fired a warning shot across their bow.

Oh, and by the way...
