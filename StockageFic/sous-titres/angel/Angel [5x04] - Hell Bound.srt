00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,578
Oh! Good night.

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,648
Good night.

3
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:58,044
[Gasps]

4
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,683
- [Screams]
- How long did you know I was there?

5
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,658
Oh. Just since the lobby.

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,786
But that popping up behind me
was really scary. Look.

7
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:15,092
<i>- I dropped my papers.</i>
- Nice touch.

8
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,999
- Thanks.
- I'd give you a hand with that, but, uh...

9
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:23,206
Oh. Still no interaction.

10
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,798
Not a twinge.
Can't spirit the knickknacks about.

11
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,038
Can't willie the locals.
Bloody sad ghost I turned out.

12
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,376
I've told you before.
You're not a ghost.

13
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,450
Chipper!
Give us a hug.

14
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:38,045
You know what I mean. You're more
than a common spectral disturbance.

15
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,646
I've never seen anything like you.

16
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:44,285
<i>- [Beeping]</i>
- Bet you say that to all the spirits.

17
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:50,323
Oh. Your radiant heat signature's
dropped another.02 degrees.

18
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:52,299
Thought it was a bit nippy.

19
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,972
Is, uh, everything...
Are you...

20
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,373
Feeling the tug
of eternal damnation?

21
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,808
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>I can't touch anything.</i>

22
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:09,079
- Using all my mentalies just to
keep from slipping into hell.
- I won't let that happen.

23
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:13,350
I've been working on a theory.
Well, more of a hunch, actually.

24
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:16,893
- But I think I'm getting close.
- To making me a real boy again?

25
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,588
[Chuckles] As real as
a vampire with a soul can be.

26
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:23,827
- It won't be like Angel's
thing with the prophecy, but...
- What prophecy?

27
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:27,995
The "Shan-shoe-ha"
something or another.

28
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:32,041
It says that if Angel helps enough people,
he gets to be human again.

29
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:34,042
Oh. Really?

30
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,505
Goody for him.

31
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,584
- Ahh! That totally makes sense!
- What does?

32
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,845
The fluctuations in your readings.

33
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:45,387
<i>A lack of particle cohesion.</i>

34
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,585
L-It's almost as if your essence
is straddling a dimensional void.

35
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:52,958
Which may be the key, assuming that
the amulet you used to save the world...

36
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,827
is some sort of trans-reality amplifier...

37
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:59,027
capable of focusing massive quantities
of mystical energy.

38
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:02,833
And what in the King's English does
that mean to the dearly almost departed?

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,001
<i>It means that if I can defy</i>
<i>most of the laws of nature...</i>

40
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:10,603
there's a good chance I'll be able to anchor
you to this plane and make you corporeal.

41
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:16,820
Well, might be a hug
in your future after all.

42
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,458
Spike?

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,528

44
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,302

Brilliant.

the quickest way back to the lab?

51
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:22,281
I'll take that as a "No" then.

No, no, stop crying.
Stop crying.

It's okay you put on

00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:28,646
Yeah, they can't just...
No, no, no. Just put the pills down.

57
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:31,778
I'll straighten this out.
If I can't, I'll take a handful myself.

58
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:42,297
I need these as soon as possible.

Nice to see you."

Little preoccupied.

63
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,449

the word we're looking for.

<i>- I mean you having one. A real one.</i>

73
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,508
When's the last time you had
anything besides day-old takeout?

74
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,776

up in your lab?

Twenty minutes? Thanks.

[Clears Throat]
Um...

79
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:52,032
I know how difficult it's been
going from a small detective agency...

80
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:55,537
to running, uh,
Wolfram and Hart.

81
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,134
- And-And we've all been adjusting, but...
- It's okay.

82
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,442
Wes just gave me the talk.
And I'm going to have a good meal...

83
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:08,006
and at least six hours of sleep,
so everybody can just stop worrying.

84
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:11,315
I'm fine. Really.

85
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,117
Good. That's...

86
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,022
Actually, there's some
concern about how much...

87
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,220
the Practical Science
Department's been spending.

88
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:24,160
Oh. Um, yeah.

89
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:27,135
I guess I may have gone over
my projections by a few...

90
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,296
§800,000.

91
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,840
That's how much you've
exceeded your quarterly budget.

92
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,911
And the quarter
ain't over yet, sweetie.

93
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:39,608
Look, l-I know it sounds like...
I mean, it is a lot of money...

94
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:43,550
but l-I'm trying to do something
that's never been done before.

95
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:47,647
So, yeah, attempting to
recorporealize Spike is going to cost...

96
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,488
Whoa. Trying to do what?

97
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:54,257
Make Spike corporeal again,
like you asked.

98
00:07:54,364 --> 00:08:00,098
Uh, no. What I asked for was for you to try to
find a way to get Spike <i>out</i> of Wolfram and Hart.

99
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,106
Angel, we accepted the offer
to take over the L.A. Branch...

100
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,939
of an evil, multidimensional law firm because
we thought we could make a difference.

101
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:11,310
Use the resources of Wolfram and Hart
to do something decent.

102
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,349
And how's that have
anything to do with Spike?

103
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,114
He just saved the world. Vampire with
a soul fighting for the good of humanity.

104
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:22,386
Ring anything?
He's just like you... a champion.

105
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,551
God, I really hate that word.

106
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,926
- Think of what an asset
he'd be fighting on our side.
<i>- Except he won't be.</i>

107
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,398
I know Spike better than anyone,
and he only cares about himself.

108
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:35,130
- And Buffy.
<i>- Well, this is getting interesting.</i>

109
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,800
You're right.
He does care about Buffy.

110
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,902
So where do you think he's going to run off to
as soon as his fresh new feet hit the ground?

111
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,913
<i>Is that what this is about?</i>

112
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,848
You're afraid he's gonna come back
and try to get with your ex again?

113
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:52,650
<i>I just want you to be careful, Fred,</i>
<i>because I know how charming Spike can be.</i>

114
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:54,883
He is quite the dish
with those eyes and...

115
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,222
And hair and the cheeks and...

116
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,227
What do you think I am, stupid?

117
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,593
I know he's been playing me
with the looks and the smiles.

118
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,326
I'm not some idiot schoolgirl
with a crush.

119
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,925
Then what is it?

120
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:11,736
It's about doing
what's right. Remember?

121
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,502
Your department, your call.

122
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:20,009
Just don't be disappointed
if it doesn't work.

123
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:24,110
Some people can't be saved.

124
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:34,021

Come back and haunt me tomorrow.

Not like it's such a big
bleeding deal, is it?

If a ponce like you
could break out...

153

I never escaped from hell. All I got was a short
reprieve. Not even sure how I managed that.

<i>Nothing's written in stone</i>

- Not as much as I loved your nonstop yammering.

The way you always had to be the big swingy,
swaggering around, barking orders.

179

- Always interrupting.

- Uh, none. Last sweep was 10 minutes ago.

- W-We should spread out, see if we can find him.

327
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:57,882
Or whatever she contacted wasn't
the dark soul we were expecting.

328
00:24:57,987 --> 00:24:59,887
So if she wasn't
talking about Spike...

329
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:03,823
Then there's something else
here at Wolfram and Hart.

330
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:06,190
Something else a hell of a lot worse.

331
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:18,036
<i>[Water Running]</i>

332
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:57,178
Why did it kill her?

333
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,046
Reaper's supposed to
take souls, not make 'em.

334
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,608
If it's come for me, couldn't have been
worried she was gonna help.

335
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,348
She didn't even know I was there.

336
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,686
Unless it wasn't about me.

337
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:14,555
Fred, I think I know why it killed her.

338
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:18,464
It was trying to hide something. Something
it didn't want you to know because...

339
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:33,439
Come on.
Just reach out.

340
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:24,490
Come on, then.
No more games.

341
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,398
No more hiding in the shadows.

I'm not talking to flunkies anymore!
You hear that?

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,860
Got your number, don't I? You're sending

349

You're just some little twit of a spirit
trying to have a go at me, aren't you?

350

An eternity of suffering for your sins.

But first, I get to play.

356
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,029
Let's get started then...

00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:39,798
shall we?

358
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,273
Got it.
The dark soul.

<i>- A lot.</i>

360

There are over 3,200
different references.

00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:54,787
- Four of'em are about you.
- What? Give me that.

362
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,950
- This is getting us nowhere.
- Let me see.

363
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:02,596
Oh, that's not fair. I didn't even
have a soul when I did that.

364
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:05,565
There has to be a way
to narrow down the search.

365
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:08,967
<i>Reaper. Cross-reference</i>
<i>with the word "Reaper."</i>

366
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:12,768
<i>- Where'd you pull that?</i>
- Came to me in the shower.

367
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,969
<i>Here it is. Matthias Pavayne,</i>
<i>dark soul number 182.</i>

368
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,646
- Pavayne.
- Well, there's not much here.

369
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:23,877
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>European aristocrat, 18th century.</i>

370
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:26,546
<i>He was a doctor</i>
<i>nicknamed "The Reaper"...</i>

371
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:28,850
"for performing unnecessary
surgery on his patients."

372
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,859
- What kind of surgery?
<i>- [Wesley] The kind you don't recover from.</i>

373
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:35,158
There's a file on him
in internal archives, classified histories.

374
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:37,391
- He worked for Wolfram and Hart?
<i>- Not exactly.</i>

375
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,594
"Word spread of
his unorthodox practices.

376
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:43,934
"Fled to California, still under
Spanish rule at the time.

377
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,567
"His arrival coincided with a rash
of brutal ritualistic murders.

379

Pieces?

380
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:58,910
The slaughter continued for
the better part of 20 years.

381
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:02,582
<i>The perpetrator was never caught.</i>
<i>At least, not by the authorities.</i>

382
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:04,716
Are you saying Wolfram and Hart
took this guy out?

383
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:08,194
- Why would they do that?
- Sounds like their idea of employee of the month.

384
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:10,561
Because they needed his blood.

385
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:14,033
<i>"Representatives from Wolfram and Hart</i>
<i>were looking to build a new branch...</i>

386
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,604
"in what would eventually
become Los Angeles.

387
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:20,835
Unfortunately, a Spanish mission was already
on the site their seers recommended."

388
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:25,403
<i>They needed an appropriate sacrifiiice</i>
<i>to deconsecrate the grounds.</i>

389
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:30,008
So this place is built on the blood
of a mass-murdering psychopath?

390
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,850
- It would appear so.
<i>- But if Pavayne's half as bad as he sounds...</i>

391
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:36,447
he should've been roasting his
chestnuts in hell centuries ago.

392
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,027
You said something about
the dark arts, right?

393
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,289
Maybe he knew enough
to figure out a way to stick around.

394
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:44,696
Might explain why the mystics
can't get a bead on him too.

395
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,700
What I still don't get are all
the ghosts in Wolfram and Hart.

396
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:49,168
- But there aren't any.
- But that's what I mean. High-risk employment.

397
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:53,640
People die here all the time. This place should
be full of spooks. So what happened to 'em?

398
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:55,937
Maybe this Pavayne character's
munching on 'em.

399
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:59,845
Whatever he's doing to them, we need
to get Spike back, before he's next.

400
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:06,454
Vampire soul.
Watch it struggle.

Such passion.

00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:29,934
So wet and sweet.

406
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:33,242
Perhaps I'll have a taste one day.

<i>You really think this'll bring Spike back?</i>

445
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:56,517
Well, I had to extrapolate
a new variation...

446
00:33:56,625 --> 00:34:00,425
on interdimensional plasma dynamics
on the fly, but if the math holds...

447
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:05,125
All right. First we'll try to get Spike back,
and then we'll deal with Pavayne.

448
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:09,295
Wait. For this to work, it's gonna
require a massive surge of dark energy...

449
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,566
- to catalyze the process.
- How massive?

450
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,073

The equivalent of nuclear evil.

Where the hell are
we supposed to find that?

452
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:19,740
Well, there is a legend...

453
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:24,785
that tells of a volcano deep in
the forbidden jungles of South Africa.

454
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,015

a little closer to home.

Why do you think they call it that?

And how are we still in the building
when we're standing in a place...

458
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:39,658
- that technically doesn't exist?
<i>- So this is your brainstorm?</i>

459

00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:43,089
Getting what you deserve.

488
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,421
<i>[Spike Grunting]</i>

489
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:48,724
You're right.
[Panting]

490
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,991
I do deserve to go to hell.

491
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:57,133
But not today.

492
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,003
You dare!

493
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,378
Quite a bit, mate.
Reality bends to desire.

494
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,917
That was it, right? That's why I could
touch Fred. Write your name in the glass.

495
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:12,782
All I had to do
was want it bad enough.

496
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:20,854
And guess what I want to do now,
you prissy son of a bitch?

497
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:25,323
Cute little racket you've
got carved out for yourself.

498
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,925
<i>Prying off spirits</i>
<i>and sucking 'em down the chute.</i>

499
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:31,437
<i>Kept your own toasties</i>
<i>out of the fire, didn't it? Till now.</i>

500
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:55,391
Not so much fun
when we hit back, is it?

501
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,963
It's starting to be.

502
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,007
Make sure it's calibrated
to minus.058.

503
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,133
Make sure it's calibrated
to minus.058.

504
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:09,642
- Did you get it?
- Make it count. Told me we ain't gettin' any more.

505
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,679
<i>It talks?</i>
<i>I didn't hear it talk.</i>

506
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,806
- Maybe you weren't listening right.
- I think we're almost ready.

507
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,975
- So how do we let Spike know?
- Won't have to.

508
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:19,849
<i>This baby puts out enough juice</i>
<i>to light up Ghost City.</i>

509
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:24,392
Anything remotely spectral around here's
about to get the tinglies.

510
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,394
[Grunts]

511
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,495
[Exhales]
Learned a few of my tricks.

512
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,866
Means nothing, does it?

513
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:44,342
I've cheated hell
for hundreds of years.

514
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:48,542
Fed it other dirty little souls.

515
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,711
Left me alone.
Let me get stronger.

516
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:56,951
<i>Now, in this realm...</i>

517
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,050
I am God.

518
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:02,028
And you?

519
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,361
Wood for the fire.

520
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:17,035
This won't do.
This won't do at all.

521
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,136
- [Beeping]
- [Fred] He's here!

522
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,772
Spike, step
into the circle! Hurry!

523
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:24,647
We've only got one chance
of making you corporeal again...

524
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:30,787
Why ever would
I want to do that?

525
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:33,122
- Fred!
<i>- Pavayne. He's killing her.</i>

526
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:41,468
Decisions.

527
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:46,166
The girl... [Chuckles]
Or the flesh.

528
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:48,299
There's no time for both.

529
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,078
<i>There's hope for you yet, boy.</i>

530
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:57,276
Not really.

531
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:09,795
No! Defilers!

532
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,833
I'll cut you into nothing!

533
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:14,663
<i>I'll feast on your brains.!</i>

534
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,935
I'll swim in lakes
of your own blood!

535
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,838
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>You'll shut the hell up.</i>

536
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:24,605
Don't kill him. If he becomes
a spirit again, we'll never stop him.

537
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,171
Fine. No killing.
Just a whole lot of bruising.

538
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:37,182
Sure you're all right?

539
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:41,558
Yeah. It's just... you know.

540
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:47,494
Why don't you take a break?
We'll finish up.

541
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:51,005
Thanks.

542
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:14,188
Don't suppose you built a spare.

543
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:21,733
<i>Most of the pieces I used on this one</i>
<i>were practically nonexistent to start with.</i>

544
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:27,566
Even if I could replace them,
the chances of finding another power source...

545
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:34,138
I'm sorry.

546
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:38,276
Don't be, luv.
Made my choice.

547
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,446
Wouldn't change it for the world.

548
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:44,684
There are other things we could try.
They're a little riskier, but...

549
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:49,492
No. I'm not going to
end up like Pavayne.

550
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:53,329
Cheating hell any way he could,
no matter who it hurt.

551
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:56,800
Just proves what
I've been telling everybody.

552
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:59,874
That I'm a handsome devil
who brightens the place up?

553
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:05,913
That you're worth saving.

554
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,720
Don't have it so bad really.

555
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,313
Plenty of room.
Good company.

556
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:20,118
<i>Even picked up a few new tricks.</i>

557
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,099
I guess there's worse things
than being a ghost.

558
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:43,382
- You sure it'll hold him?
- Permanent storage.

559
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,578
If there's anything
Wolfram and Hart excels at...

560
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,850
it's keeping their
unmentionables unmentioned.

561
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:54,522
Congratulations.
You get to live forever.

562
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:56,995
Unable to move, to touch...

563
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:59,658
<i>or to feel.</i>

564
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:02,965
<i>Or to affect anything</i>
<i>in the world around you.</i>

565
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:06,802
But don't worry.
I had them give you a window.

566
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,870
- [Clang]
<i>- [Lock Locking]</i>

567
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,949
Welcome to hell.

568
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:08,367
Grr! Arrgh!
