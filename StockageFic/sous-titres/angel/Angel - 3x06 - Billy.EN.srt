1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,160
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,820
- All those years she spent in that cave.
- She trades one for another.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,330
The visions aren't from The Powers.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,429
A young man's been unfairly imprisoned,
and you're gonna save him.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,660
I do this, and you stop sending
Cordy the killer visions.

6
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,629
- It's just business.
- Don't come at me through Cordy again.

7
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,190
You play that card a second time,
I'll kill you.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,899
- Just trust me.
- I do.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,079
- Don't stiffen up.
- Yeah, you either.

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,539
Good defense is about
moving the line of attack.

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,420
When the bad guy comes at you, step off
the line like this, creating a new one.

12
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,659
Every time you do, your opponent
will be forced to adjust.

13
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,259
- Move the line, then what?
- Just keep moving the line.

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,780
You'll be able to keep an attacker
busy until.... You know.

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:03,500
What? Until he dies of old age,
or until you swoop in to save me?

16
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,349
I didn't ask you to train me so I could
stave. I already know how to stave.

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,939
- I need to learn to fight.
- You don't think that I would.

18
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,549
- Would what?
- Save you.

19
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:18,290
Menfolk not always around
to protect the womenfolk, you know?

20
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,680
Besides, what if you were the guy
I had to fight? It could happen.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,129
Okay.

22
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:32,049
When you put an adversary down,
make sure he doesn't get up again.

23
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,430
Force the other guy to counter,
and he'll open himself up.

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,379
- We'll go half-speed--
- I got it.

25
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,219
Three years of cheer squad, I only ever
had to be shown a move once.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,750
Handling a lethal weapon is a little
different than shaking a pompon.

27
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,590
Ready! Okay!

28
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,459
Go team.

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,069
- How long has he been here?
- 20 minutes.

30
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,140
You should have pulled me
out of the meeting. The family?

31
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,489
On their way.

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,689
Lilah. I was just keeping
Billy company.

33
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,379
Thanks, Gavin.
I'll take it from here.

34
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,150
Your family has been worried sick.
Where have you been?

35
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,219
- I went for a walk.
- A walk. For three days?

36
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,150
- He was feeling cooped up.
- Why don't you go close an escrow.

37
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,289
You're not supposed to be out
on your own. Remember last time?

38
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,569
You don't wanna end up in that
awful place again, do you?

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,840
Of course he doesn't.

40
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,590
No one wants that.

41
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,780
Congressman.

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,439
- I trust you've stayed out of trouble.
- No trouble.

43
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's go home.

44
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:51,210
This is the second time you've returned
our nephew safely to us. Thank you.

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,430
Our pleasure.

46
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,439
"Our pleasure," in the sense
that he had nothing to do with it.

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,120
Nice boy.

48
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,800
He's great. Had his own private
room in hell. Family connections.

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,879
Oh, by the way, get out.

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,250
- I wasn't finished.
- No. You really were.

51
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,370
You go sniffing around one of my clients
again, I think we'll have a problem.

52
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,009
You think?
Who told you you could think?

53
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,610
Why don't you try listening instead
of flapping that fat mouth of yours?

54
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:34,699
You weren't captain of the debate team,
were you? At least Lindsey knew--

55
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,579
It's inspiring to see you like this.

56
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,899
Training with Angel, taking
responsibility. I'm proud of you.

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,120
Never hurts to be prepared.

58
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,589
We should all be battle-ready.

59
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,500
Dead! So very, very dead.
Just how dead are you?

60
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm tired of being the dead one.

61
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,959
I was thinking I'd enter into a similar
training arrangement with Fred.

62
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,480
If you think she can help
you fight, why not?

63
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,269
I'm kidding.

64
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,629
Wesley, if you want
to get to know Fred better...

65
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,730
...maybe the next time you have her
over for dinner...

66
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,709
...you won't ask the rest of us
to come along.

67
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,779
I mean....
Was I that obvious?

68
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:29,769
Yeah! Yes!

69
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,680
I don't think anybody else noticed.

70
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,300
She's a rather
extraordinary young woman.

71
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,839
Still, the last thing any of us should
be doing is coupling with each other.

72
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,740
Office romances,
even under normal circumstances--

73
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,199
We don't live
in normal circumstances.

74
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,660
What are the odds of any of us
finding someone...

75
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,550
...who can deal with the stuff
that we have to deal with?

76
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:00,779
- I don't know, maybe we are meant--
- For each other?

77
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,259
Actually, I was gonna say, to be alone.
But what the heck.

78
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,959
Wesley, if you like her, tell her.
Just go right up to her and...

79
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,079
...hack her into little pieces.

80
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,199
Easy. Okay. Up.

81
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,079
Convenience store.
Man attacking a woman.

82
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,490
- His wife. It's his wife.
- How many stores on the West Side?

83
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,160
Even if you just include Santa Monica,
Beverly Hills and Malibu...

84
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,129
...the combined population is 130,000,
spread over 30 square miles--

85
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,649
- A lot.
- I was getting there.

86
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,230
- Two teams. Gunn, you and I--
- No, it's too late.

87
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,800
You can't save her.
This murder happened a week ago.

88
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,560
Why would they show this to me now?

89
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,389
- What's this?
- Everything you saw in your vision.

90
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,750
Police reports,
husband's written confession...

91
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,230
...captures from the store's cameras
and, I caution you...

92
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,790
...the medical examiner's
crime-scene photos. Cordelia....

93
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,639
You shouldn't be looking at that.

94
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,930
Tell that to The Powers.
They ran the THX version in my head.

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,480
- How did you get this stuff?
- The old-fashioned way. I bought it.

96
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,759
- The police sold you this stuff?
- Not exactly. Someone who has access.

97
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,310
Usually they sell to the tabloids
when the victims are high-profile.

98
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,959
- Charlene Baird.
- The victim.

99
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,560
She and the perpetrator were married for
30 years. No previous domestic violence.

100
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,069
- Why'd he do it?
- He says she wouldn't listen to him.

101
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,750
- He was trying to make her stop talking.
- Well, it worked.

102
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,579
This guy confessed. Crime solved.
Why are The Powers airing reruns?

103
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,439
- I don't know.
- I do.

104
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,069
11:24, 20 minutes before
the crime occurred, look who's there.

105
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,660
- Oh, boy.
- What?

106
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,319
What?

107
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,959
Okay, kind of cute.
So who is he?

108
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,870
You're sure this is him?
This is the guy?

109
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,269
You pull someone from a hell dimension,
you tend to remember their face.

110
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,460
Yeah, that's him.

111
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,669
Well, then.

112
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:59,149
Now we know why The Powers made me
experience that woman's death.

113
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,080
She died because of me.

114
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,879
- No.
- Yes.

115
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,190
Angel, if he's somehow responsible,
then so am I.

116
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,059
You didn't break him out and put him
back on the streets. I did.

117
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:16,059
- For me. You did it to save me.
- And I'd do it again.

118
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,070
- Angel....
- Hey.

119
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,480
Whatever's happening now,
you're not responsible for this...

120
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,159
...and neither am I.

121
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,629
But I know who is.

122
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,029
Dramatic entrance. Except for
the part where you can't enter.

123
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,070
- You're a little jumpy, Lilah.
- Long day at the office.

124
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,799
And you know your boy's on the loose.
You know what he's doing.

125
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,529
It's been brought to my attention.

126
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,059
- God, are you--?
- I'm fine. You should see the other guy.

127
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,820
I plan to.

128
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:07,200
- Billy never touched me.
- I know, he has some power that makes--

129
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,860
Billy never touched me, and
you can't touch him. Nobody can.

130
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:15,779
Billy, as in Blim, as in
Congressman Nathan Blim's nephew.

131
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,919
That family's the closest thing
this country has to royalty.

132
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,120
They own half the eastern seaboard.
The law won't go near them.

133
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:26,200
- I'm not the law.
- This isn't some beast you can just--

134
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,669
- Why are you protecting him?
- I'm sorry. This deep concern...

135
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,009
...coming from the only man I know...

136
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,179
...who definitely wants to kill me
is a bit much on a day like this.

137
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,269
- Your hands are shaking.
- Stay away from my client.

138
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,009
- This is it. The Blim estate.
- Not very welcoming, is it?

139
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,789
I don't suppose it'd do much good
to ring the bell either.

140
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,629
How about we sneak in dressed
as security guards or something?

141
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,480
Well, it's a possibility.
Or we could--

142
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,879
So you wanna go next?

143
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,519
- I guess we wait here.
- Yeah.

144
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,769
Why doesn't it surprise me that
I can walk in without an invitation?

145
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,830
As far as I'm concerned,
you have a standing invitation.

146
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,320
You're not a right guy.
You're not quite human either, are you?

147
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,549
Not quite. More than you.

148
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,720
You like to hurt women.
That make you feel like a man?

149
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,779
I've never hurt a woman in my life.
I just like to watch.

150
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,870
- Not anymore.
- Oh?

151
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,419
- You're going back.
- Really?

152
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,799
- I don't think so.
- L.A. Police Department!

153
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,409
Hands where we can
see them. Turn around. Slowly.

154
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,159
- You're looking for me.
- William Blim?

155
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,559
That's right. I'm the one that
called you. Did you find the body?

156
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,889
- We're taking you in for questioning.
- Oh, yes. I should think you would.

157
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,789
Sanchez, read him his rights.

158
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,240
Will those be necessary? I won't
give you trouble. I'll come quietly.

159
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,100
- Who are you?
- He's nobody.

160
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,860
You have the right
to remain silent....

161
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,460
- I told you to take Pico.
- Relax, Sanchez. We'll get there.

162
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,480
Did you just tell me to relax?
You think you can talk to me like that?

163
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,929
I'd talk to you with my finger,
but I like both hands on the wheel.

164
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,879
- Pull over.
- What?

165
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,360
- Pull over!
- What's your problem?

166
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,919
I'll tell you what my problem is,
I got a woman here that don't listen.

167
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,899
My contact at the morgue confirms it,
a body was discovered earlier tonight.

168
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,220
A young woman was reported missing
three days ago. Someone phoned in.

169
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,330
- Billy.
- Makes no sense. Even if he did it...

170
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,289
...he didn't do it. Why confess?
What does it get him?

171
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,490
Gets him out.

172
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,470
Out of his $12 million compound
and into a cell at Men's Central.

173
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,649
- Yes, but for how long?
- An impenetrable cube of hellfire...

174
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,860
...in a demon dimension
couldn't do much, so...

175
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,679
...my guess, regular bars,
not really a problem.

176
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,250
She's right. All he'll need
to get out is his lawyer.

177
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,139
- What're you doing?
- Get there before Lilah does.

178
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:23,070
- And then what?
- I'll take him out of the cell.

179
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,129
Wait. You can't barge into a police
precinct and go all Terminator,

180
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,600
- I'll be okay.
- It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

181
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,019
- What if he lays his whammy on you?
- He won't be conscious.

182
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,480
He's not there.

183
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,950
I just heard it on the police scanner.
The patrol car never made it back.

184
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,669
There's been an accident.

185
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,220
There was an altercation. One
of the officers attacked his partner.

186
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,289
She was forced to shoot him.
The female's been taken to the hospital.

187
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:02,240
Maybe she can tell us what Billy did
to her partner before he snapped.

188
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,840
Wouldn't be a bad idea if one of us was
standing by at the hospital.

189
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,379
Maybe start a conversation
with the staff or one of her buddies?

190
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,169
- Maybe.
- I'm on it.

191
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,470
The blood in that car,
some of it is his.

192
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,190
Not human.

193
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,149
He came through here.

194
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,909
And recently. It's still wet.

195
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,779
I'll take a sample and see
what sort of creature Billy is.

196
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,090
- I can't wait for that.
- I understand.

197
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,200
- I can find him.
- Be careful.

198
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,059
What you doing?

199
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,669
I'm gonna go run an errand.

200
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,879
A normal, everyday errand.

201
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,240
Cordelia.

202
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,519
I don't think you should do this.

203
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,730
How can I not?

204
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,490
Fred, you're here. Good.
I was hoping you would assist me.

205
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,399
I managed to lift
a sample of Billy's blood.

206
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,980
Maybe we can identify his demon lineage
and figure out how his power works.

207
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,759
Would you hand me the...

208
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,909
...glass slides?

209
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,870
Thank you.

210
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,539
- Cordelia Chase? Come to gloat?
- I can do that anywhere.

211
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,410
Are you gonna invite me in?
Oh, wait. I'm not a vampire.

212
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,579
Please, come on in.

213
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,759
I want you to tell me about Billy.
Everything you didn't tell Angel.

214
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,380
Help me stop him.

215
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,240
What makes you think
I'm gonna do that?

216
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,660
Well, there's your face,
for starters.

217
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,730
- I accept the risks of my job.
- Why were you crying five minutes ago?

218
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,799
There's not a thing about badly
reapplied mascara I don't know.

219
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,730
I'm not Lindsey McDonald. I don't
switch sides whenever it gets tough.

220
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,400
And since when is this your job?
I thought Angel was the dark revenger.

221
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:47,309
Angel feels responsible for this guy
because he brought him back from hell.

222
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,619
I feel responsible
because he did it to save me.

223
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,990
You, who are actually
responsible for the entire thing...

224
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,829
...feel nothing at all,
because you are a vicious bitch.

225
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,170
- So you know me.
- Please. I was you. With better shoes.

226
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,509
- These are Baracci.
- Fall collection?

227
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,630
- Next spring.
- He's widened the heel.

228
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,170
- And rounded the toe.
- Won't work with pink.

229
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,410
- Pink is out this spring.
- Billy Blim makes people crazy.

230
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,920
Not all people. Just men.

231
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,029
He brings out a primordial misogyny
in them. Turns them into killers.

232
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,859
Then why didn't he do it to Angel?

233
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,759
- Angel's seen him?
- Yes. Right before he escaped.

234
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,230
- What's so witty?
- Billy's touch works differently...

235
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,450
...on different men.
Some lose their mind in an instant.

236
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,900
Others can take hours.

237
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,220
Gee, I sure hope Angel
isn't starting to feel testy.

238
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,009
- You better hope it.
- I know. I've seen his dark side.

239
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,369
You really haven't.

240
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,839
I have to find Billy.

241
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,420
And I'm gonna help you, why?

242
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,210
You know that guy you hired
to hack into my visions?

243
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,440
What he did to me,
you know what it felt like?

244
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,190
I was cut, torn up, my face
disfigured and burning with pain...

245
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,990
...not knowing if it would end
or just get worse till I died.

246
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,220
- So you think I owe you--?
- It's not the pain.

247
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,309
It's the helplessness.

248
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,220
The certainty that there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

249
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:29,740
That your life can be thrown away
in an instant by someone else.

250
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,410
He doesn't care.
He'll beat you down...

251
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,900
...because he doesn't
even think of you as alive.

252
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,980
No woman should ever
have to go through that.

253
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,809
And no woman strong enough
to wear the mantle of "vicious bitch"...

254
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,569
...would ever put up with it.

255
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,019
Where is Billy going?

256
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,730
He seemed like a level-headed guy.

257
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,519
Always polite.
"Yes, sir. " "Thank you, sir. "

258
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,660
To lose it like that....
I didn't see it coming.

259
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,349
Hacking 14 years, I understand
why he did it. There's a point, right?

260
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,920
How many times you feel like
taking a fist to a customer?

261
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:20,069
- One of your drivers snapped?
- Yeah, he beat the hell out of a fare.

262
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,859
- A woman?
- That surprise you?

263
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,759
Probably sitting in the back telling
him how to drive. You know the type.

264
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,819
Yeah. Probably had it coming to her.

265
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,089
I'm just saying....

266
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,210
Get out of here. You're gonna tell me
what this driver's last stop was...

267
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,450
...right before he beat up
that woman. "I'm just saying. "

268
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,279
- Dylan, your cousin's here.
- Which one? There's a zillion.

269
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,339
- I think he said his name's Billy.
- Billy? Not possible. Billy's....

270
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,420
Hi, Dylan.

271
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,809
Billy.

272
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,150
I didn't know
you were having a party.

273
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,180
We agreed that you weren't gonna come
here anymore after that last thing.

274
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,720
Somebody should talk to them
about appropriate public behavior.

275
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,930
Do you want to, or should I?

276
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,170
This was taken from the print I made of
Billy's blood. Tell me what you think.

277
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,059
Looks to me as if some of the red
blood cells are supercharged.

278
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,549
Those would probably
be from Billy's demon lineage.

279
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,980
So however Billy's putting the mojo
on people, the power's in his blood.

280
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:08,839
Which means it could also be in his
sweat, his saliva or even his touch.

281
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,470
Speaking of saliva,
where is Cordelia?

282
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,029
What do you mean,
"speaking of saliva"?

283
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,809
It's a simple question.
Where is Cordelia?

284
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,789
- I think she went out.
- Out?

285
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:31,890
- Did she happen to mention where?
- She said an errand.

286
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,460
When you say you "think she went out"
you mean you know she went out...

287
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
...because you spoke to her.

288
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,609
- Well, I suppose that--
- Suppose?

289
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,839
- I did. Yes, I did.
- That's better.

290
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,740
Lie to me again...

291
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,200
...and we're going to have a problem.

292
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,650
- Where are you going?
- I was gonna call Cordelia...

293
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,240
- ...find out where she is for you.
- That's not necessary.

294
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,019
- It's not?
- No.

295
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,539
Sit down, Fred.

296
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,890
- It'll just--
- Sit down.

297
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,460
There's something
we need to discuss.

298
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,279
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
Cordelia left. Really, I am.

299
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,319
We're past that.
I put it behind me.

300
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,619
However, we will have to make
some changes around here.

301
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,559
- Change can be good, I guess.
- No more of these provocative outfits.

302
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,970
Provocative?

303
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:54,119
Maybe Mommy and Daddy never
explained to you that men, grown men...

304
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:57,730
...are wired a certain way.

305
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:04,259
You can't come in here, day after day,
waving it in my face like this.

306
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,279
- What?
- You're practically daring me to take it.

307
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,519
Is that what you want?

308
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,200
- Stop it.
- Oh, are we standing now?

309
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:16,890
- This is making me uncomfortable.
- You're uncomfortable? That's rich.

310
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,759
What do you think it's like for me
with you smelling the way you do?

311
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,940
- Wesley, please.
- You think you can taunt a man?

312
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,549
You brush up close,
bat your eyes...

313
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,730
...and when our backs are turned,
you laugh at us.

314
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,819
- I'd never--
- Humiliate us.

315
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,849
You think you can do anything
you please because you bleed?

316
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,380
No.

317
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,990
I'll show you blood.

318
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,309
What do you tell a woman
who has two black eyes?

319
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,539
Nothing you haven't already
told her twice.

320
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,740
No sense of humor.

321
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,650
- I'm looking for Billy Blim.
- You a friend of his?

322
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:26,529
Friend? To be honest,
I'm looking to kill the bastard.

323
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,200
Come on in.

324
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,450
- Is he here?
- No. He came and went.

325
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:41,349
And everybody's okay? I was expecting
blood, carnage, bad things.

326
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,369
You gotta know the rules around Billy.
Everybody in the family does.

327
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,680
Never leave him alone with your girl
and don't let him touch you.

328
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,059
- He wants money, leave it on a table.
- Is that why he was here?

329
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,589
Said he needed fun money.
I just wanted to get rid of him.

330
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:59,849
Can you explain something to me?

331
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,299
How come you invited me in after I
told you I wanted to kill your cousin?

332
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,779
You're Angel, right?

333
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,900
- Billy mention me?
- No. There was a chick here. Cute.

334
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,420
She said a melodramatic guy named
Angel would eventually show up.

335
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,640
- Cordelia. Thinks I'm melodramatic?
- You did say you'd kill my cousin.

336
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,930
That's not melodrama--
She was here?

337
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,339
- Melodrama is exaggerated--
- This is real. Where'd you send her?

338
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:31,640
Santa Monica. The family plane is there.
Billy said he wants to fly someplace.

339
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,140
He didn't say where.
Hopefully far away.

340
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,240
Fred?

341
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,890
Fred.

342
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,660
I know what you're doing.

343
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,380
What you're up to.

344
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,730
Luring me.

345
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,009
Forcing me to find you.

346
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:02,549
It's such a dog-and-pony show.

347
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,779
You beguile me
with your girlish ways.

348
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,460
I pursue you.

349
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,490
But you never give over, do you?

350
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,890
No, you just keep
laughing and running.

351
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:30,250
Well, guess what, my love,
I'm not some downy-faced schoolboy.

352
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,690
I'm a man.

353
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,680
You can't come out into the open,
can you?

354
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,859
No, you hide.

355
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,440
You deceive.

356
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,809
It's nothing new.
It goes all the way back to Eve.

357
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,740
You and the serpent,
plotting behind our backs.

358
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,160
"Here, honey, eat this.
It's just an apple."

359
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,400
That's the problem with your sex.

360
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,200
You're all weak and you're all dirty,
and you won't be satisfied...

361
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,099
...until you've brought every one
of us down into the muck with you!

362
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,170
Why do you make me do this?

363
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,440
Billy.

364
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,339
Yes? Do I know you?

365
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,829
Not exactly.
I thought we should meet.

366
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,759
I'm the woman Wolfram and Hart
tortured to get you out of your cell.

367
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,609
Oh, I see.

368
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,000
And you're here to whine.
Poor, helpless, battered woman...

369
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,130
...needs to vent her feelings
about the injustice of it all.

370
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,539
No, ass-wipe.

371
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,180
I'm here to send you back.

372
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,279
I'm still here.

373
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:18,529
I don't run away like a girl.
I see things through.

374
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,789
You think I hate you because
you're a woman. I don't.

375
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:03,640
- And I was feeling special.
- I don't hate women.

376
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:07,130
Sure, you're all whores, who sell
yourselves for money or prestige...

377
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,769
...but men are just as bad.
Maybe even worse.

378
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,400
They're willing to throw away
careers, families, lives...

379
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:17,089
...for what's under your skirt.

380
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,279
I'm wearing pants.

381
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,299
So you can dress and talk like a man....
Does that make you feel superior?

382
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,769
I'm feeling superior because I have
an arrow pointed at your jugular.

383
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,000
And the irony of using a phallic-shaped
weapon.... Not lost on me.

384
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:37,130
You don't have the nerve to do it.

385
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,210
Wrong again.

386
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,980
- I can't let you do it, Cordelia.
- You saved me again. I knew you would.

387
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,789
- You know what he is.
- Which is why I'll waste him myself.

388
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,430
Angel. He can't hurt me.

389
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,579
No, I won't hurt her.

390
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,789
I won't hurt her at all.

391
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,509
In here.

392
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,839
- What happened to Wesley?
- Somehow he got infected.

393
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,099
I figure it happened while he was working
with Billy's blood from that handprint.

394
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,369
That finger-painty-looking handprint
downstairs is Billy's blood?

395
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,819
Wes turned into a psycho killer
because of that bloody handprint...

396
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:40,079
...that I picked up and looked at?

397
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:43,509
When you put it that way,
it worries me.

398
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,440
I better get out of here.
Lock the door behind me.

399
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,720
Or maybe we'll go to plan B.

400
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,640
Oh, God.

401
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,430
You said you'd go to plan B,
but what's plan B?

402
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,400
Plan B.... Plan B....

403
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,289
Charles?

404
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,619
Plan B is the one where, if you don't
stop whining, I bash in your--

405
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,279
Oh, God.

406
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:27,490
Cordy, get out of here.

407
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:29,460
- No.
- Cordelia.

408
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,789
- I can't.
- Get out!

409
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,670
- You can fight this.
- Don't fight it, feel it.

410
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,910
You can, can't you? All that rage
and hatred bubbling to the surface.

411
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,009
I've never done this to a vampire.
Should be entertaining.

412
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,519
Please, go.

413
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,980
I can't.
I have this problem.

414
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,420
This is happening to you
because of me. Because of me.

415
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,819
So I can't leave you, Angel. I won't.

416
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:06,549
You think that's your problem?

417
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,039
That's not your problem.
You know what your real problem is?

418
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,079
Guys like him!

419
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,039
'Cause you got no power over me.

420
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,260
You're scaring me.

421
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,909
Take this and knock me out.
Knock me out!

422
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,909
- You want me to hit you?
- Yes!

423
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,619
- I can't.
- You might want to.

424
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,849
Hit me!

425
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,409
- Charles, please.
- "Charles, please." Fine.

426
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,780
Give it back to me so I can
smash your stupid head with it.

427
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,920
- What?
- Give me the damn chair leg!

428
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,869
You're gonna pay for that.

429
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,219
Would you like to hear
my theory, Fred?

430
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,400
It's about how stupid you are.

431
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,570
I believe that after five years
of living in a cave...

432
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,480
...you'll instinctively retreat
to small, dark places...

433
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,380
...rather than run outside,
where you'd be safe.

434
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,610
Let's finish this.

435
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,539
I'm sorry, Wesley.

436
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,679
You're sorry?

437
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,019
You were right about me
liking dark places to hide in.

438
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,130
But you forgot
I also like to build things.

439
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,210
I don't get it.

440
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,900
I don't get it either.

441
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,449
I mean, you're a man...

442
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,309
...so why didn't
Billy's touch affect you?

443
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,829
Maybe because I'm not human.

444
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:43,909
Oh, right. And a vampire can never
be turned into a monster.

445
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:49,659
Well, that thing that Billy
brought out in others?

446
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,590
That hatred and anger....
That's something I lost a long time ago.

447
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,110
Even when you were evil?

448
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,739
I never hated my victims.
I never killed out of anger.

449
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,820
It was always about the pain
and the pleasure.

450
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,949
Huh.

451
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:14,050
I guess you could say your demon-ness
makes you less petty than humans.

452
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:16,639
Almost noble.

453
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,340
I mean, in a twisted, dark
and really disturbing kind of way.

454
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,699
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

455
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,119
It's weird.

456
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,989
What is?

457
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,780
I'm getting used to being
creeped out...

458
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,130
...and comforted at the same time.

459
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:43,849
I get that.

460
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,860
Wesley?

461
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,670
Wesley, it's me, Fred.

462
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,469
Does that hurt?

463
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,840
Sorry.

464
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,539
I left a bunch of messages.

465
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:51,139
Yes. I meant to call you back.
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,130
I'm so sorry.

467
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,670
Wesley, you gotta come back to work.

468
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,960
- How can I?
- What do you mean?

469
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,329
How can you not? You're the boss.
We need you.

470
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,769
You took a few days off.
That's good. We all did.

471
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,789
- But now it's time to come back.
- Fred.

472
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,110
- I tried to kill you.
- That wasn't you.

473
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,000
How can you know that? Something
inside me was forced to the surface.

474
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,440
- Something primal.
- Do you wanna kill me?

475
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,989
God, no.

476
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,239
It wasn't something in you, Wesley.

477
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,409
It was something
that was done to you.

478
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:44,409
I don't know what kind of man
I am anymore.

479
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,010
Well, I do.

480
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,000
You're a good man.

481
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,469
Will I see you back at the office?

482
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,349
Yeah.

483
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,590
Good.
