1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,389
- Previously;
- Check me out. I'm Mr. Dad.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,679
I need the blood of Angel's son.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,080
- Got it? How?
- Swiped it.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,640
Things have been slow since
Cordelia and the Groosalugg left.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,350
You've been holed up with all those
prophecies and books. You okay?

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,579
That the vampire will devour
his child is certain.

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,160
- When will it happen?
- It's already started.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,489
The evil beside you.

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,960
Earthquake, fire, blood.

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,100
- It's okay.
- Earthquake, fire, blood.

11
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,090
Jeez, Wes.

12
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,750
Don't you know what you're
supposed to do?

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,099
You pick them up when they fuss.

14
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,750
Daddy's here.

15
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,420
Sorry, I don't know what I was--
I didn't sleep well.

16
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,510
You look like hell.

17
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,069
And not the fun one,
where they burn you for all eternity...

18
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,170
...but the hard-core one.
You know, Nixon and Britney Spears.

19
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,879
- You're awfully chipper today.
- Yeah, it's weird.

20
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,599
Maybe it was the earthquake, but I
barely slept, and I have all this energy.

21
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,590
I could drink a horse.

22
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:50,129
Speaking of earthquake...

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,719
- ...you realize we have no insurance.
- Yeah, bummer.

24
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,760
- And your room is--
- The wreck of the Hesperus.

25
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,150
Don't worry. The best part about owning
a hotel is there's plenty of rooms.

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,109
I'll move to another one
till it's fixed.

27
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,659
Who is that singing?

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,889
- Lorne's seeing a client in the garden.
- She's good.

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,060
Do you want to see the lady sing?

30
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,169
I fell so far

31
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,650
A light went on in my heart

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,289
You're gone

33
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:36,030
Now I'm left alone in the dark

34
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,729
Do you see anything?

35
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,419
I see you're plenty scared.
It's all right, keep going.

36
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,219
My soul is aching

37
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,659
Hey, now, no fussing.

38
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,689
Do you wanna see something cool?
Sure you do.

39
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,819
Look.

40
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,740
You like that broadsword?

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,599
That's your old man's favorite.

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,180
Wes, he's gonna be crawling
in no time.

43
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,180
We gotta start baby-proofing
this place.

44
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,949
Take him. Yeah, it's all right, it's
your Uncle Wes. He loves you bunches.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,259
He's just English.

46
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,400
Are you crazy? It's the best state.

47
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,759
What's wrong with Texas?

48
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,930
Texas doesn't hate the black man.

49
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,580
Texas loves the black man. Well,
most of Texas. Anyone with a brain.

50
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,900
- What's so great about California?
- Everything.

51
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,060
It's got the climate...

52
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,919
- ...the ocean.
- The earth that swallows you whole.

53
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,000
- The Lakers, the music.
- The traffic...

54
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,469
- ...the smog.
- It's got you.

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,580
- Okay, you win. Morning.
- Hi.

56
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,280
Glad to see you're using the
company phones for important calls.

57
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,469
- Want me to pay?
- Chain them up.

58
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,259
- What?
- Let's chain and lock the weapons.

59
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:01,729
Better safe than sorry. Isn't that
right? He likes you, I can tell.

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,069
I like him too.

61
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,180
I was thinking perhaps I'd take him to
the park or beach. Just the two of us.

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,219
Maybe in the next day or two.

63
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,520
Sounds great. Count on it.

64
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,680
Guys, there's something you should--
Can you come here for a sec?

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,959
Everybody, this is my friend Kim.

66
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,370
It's all right, they're professionals.
Take it from the chorus.

67
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,110
My heart is breaking

68
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,259
In two

69
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,209
No love
No light left, no you

70
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,420
I'll hack your eyeballs out
and rip your children in two!

71
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,540
It's all right. It's okay.

72
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,680
It's all right. It's okay.
Catchy finish, huh?

73
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,139
Kim came to see me
a couple of years ago.

74
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,980
You put me on my true path.

75
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:00,540
She was wasting in medical school
when she should've been a singer.

76
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,300
Who needs more doctors
when you can have singing demons?

77
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,620
The demon part is new.

78
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,470
Singing demons, flying nuns.
Good one, G.

79
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,350
She hooked up with this band
recently and--

80
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,829
They were mellow. Organic types. Never
did drugs or played a diminished chord.

81
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,579
I like nuns. How did the Flying Nun
fly, anyway? Was it God or magic?

82
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,620
What? You think about these things
sometimes. Please, continue.

83
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,779
They started changing. Stevie, the
lead guitar, grew a seventh finger.

84
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,660
- Seventh?
- He already had six. I just thought--

85
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,129
I don't know what I thought.

86
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,290
Raw, the drummer, sprouted
this spiny thing on his back...

87
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,120
...and they started playing this
beyond industrial, trash-noise funk.

88
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,360
Day and night. And then it
happened to me. You saw it.

89
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,350
- Am I gonna turn into that?
- No.

90
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,250
You're human, they're not.
It isn't permanent. It's an infection.

91
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,790
It's cured by taking 2O milligrams of
cylenthiam twice a day for a month.

92
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,660
A mystical antibiotic.
I'll get you some.

93
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,519
I thought your saliva was suspect,
being green and all. No offense, Lorne.

94
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,779
Under the microscope,
it showed traces of penloxia.

95
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,160
- They're Wraith-ers.
- Wraith-ers?

96
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,620
Demons that can make themselves
look human for a time.

97
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,730
Then they revert to what
they really are.

98
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,980
- Why look like musicians?
- For the chicks.

99
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,579
Musicians get the chicks. They're gonna
appear as dentists? Let's take them out.

100
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,339
- Where are they?
- In the rehearsal space.

101
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,379
It's an old loading dock behind
the Shop 'n' Go in Echo Park.

102
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,970
Wes?

103
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,829
You have to kill Wraith-ers. You, Gunn
and Fred go. Lorne, stay with the baby.

104
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,589
I have some business to do.

105
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,800
Shouldn't we call Cordelia and
the Groosalugg back into action?

106
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,980
If one of us gets hurt, say, killing
Wraith-ers, we'll need some backup.

107
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,500
I don't want to disturb her.
It's just a couple of Wraith-ers.

108
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,379
Three, actually.

109
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,180
Piece of cake. I'm up for a little
kick-ass. Who's with me?

110
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,439
Good.

111
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,709
He'd be sucking the life out of you right
now. Never take your eyes off a vampire.

112
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,500
Feel where your fellow soldiers are.
Trust each other with your lives.

113
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,279
Never, ever trust a bloodsucker.

114
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,779
Keep practicing.

115
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,779
Get him up.

116
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,429
- I don't like it.
- They'll learn, or they'll die.

117
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,720
Not that. They're coming right along.
I don't like tea in these cotton cups.

118
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,080
It's called Styrofoam.
I'll get you some china ones.

119
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,600
Thank you, Justine. Are you ready?

120
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,679
Yes.

121
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,039
- What are you not sure of? Is it me?
- No.

122
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,820
It's these people that work for Angel.
We may end up killing a lot of them.

123
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,850
We might kill them all.

124
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,779
I'd follow you to the gates of hell
to kill vampires, Daniel.

125
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,840
But people...

126
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,299
...even evil people who help vampires,
are another kettle of fish?

127
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,220
They chose Angel.
That makes them enemy soldiers.

128
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,980
So I guess that makes it all right.

129
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,850
Mr. Wyndam-Price.

130
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,159
- Nice to see you again.
- What the hell do you want?

131
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,940
Don't be rude, Justine.
He's our guest.

132
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,090
And in the throes of a very
difficult decision, I imagine.

133
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,019
You want some apple?

134
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,529
I hate your zit-face smile
That's why I cut it in two

135
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,259
Scoop out your blood
Your brain, your bowls

136
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,120
And when I'm done with you
I throg your mother, brother

137
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,549
Uncle, sister
And your little dog too

138
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,769
Dude, you're paying for that window.

139
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,730
- No, I'm not.
- Are you the A and R guys?

140
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,519
This isn't even the whole band.
We got a killer chick who sings.

141
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,080
Hey, baby.

142
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,860
Don't worry about the window, homes.

143
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,190
We're not the A and R guys.
We're just here to kill you.

144
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,049
Dude, they want to kill us.

145
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,190
Okay. But they're still
paying for the window.

146
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,240
I got first ride on the hottie.

147
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,389
- Get them out of here.
- Be careful.

148
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,779
Come on, take it like a demon.

149
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,019
That was fun.

150
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,320
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.
Your soldiers or mine.

151
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,259
I share your hatred of violence. I've
meted out less of it than Angelus has.

152
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,590
- Angel.
- Whatever you wish to call him.

153
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,820
I will never agree that he's absolved
from his past by the presence of a soul.

154
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,000
He's a vampire. End of discussion.

155
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,899
And I bet you a dollar this one's here
to stab us in the back.

156
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,539
Who did you lose?

157
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,129
What?

158
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,230
You're here in Holtz's army, ready to
kill others, die for the cause....

159
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:30,259
You must have lost someone
very important to you.

160
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,240
That's not your business.

161
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,620
Her twin sister, Julia,
was murdered by vampires.

162
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,289
You lost family. I'm sorry.

163
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,690
Angel and the people
I work with are my family.

164
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,519
When I say I don't want to see
anyone get hurt...

165
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,299
...I mostly mean them.

166
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,019
But I don't stab people in the back.

167
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,259
You're an honest man.

168
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,830
I trust you.

169
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,309
- And you can trust me.
- It's funny, I don't.

170
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:16,980
Your problem isn't me. Your problem is
your friend who's gonna kill his child.

171
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:24,250
You know you have to do something
about it. You know if you don't, I will.

172
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,919
Don't misunderstand me. I won't stand
by while an innocent child is murdered.

173
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,990
But I won't endanger other
innocent lives unless I'm forced to.

174
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,799
How long do I have?

175
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,289
I'll give you one day.

176
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,009
You may not trust me,
but I trust you to do what's right.

177
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,929
One day. After that...

178
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,919
...everyone will get hurt.

179
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,840
So Sammy's at the Flamingo.

180
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:03,649
Frank, Dino, Peter, Joey
and Shirley are all front row center.

181
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,299
Sammy starts singing
"I Did It My Way. "

182
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,950
Then he stops and says, "I can't sing
this song in front of you, Frank. "

183
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,340
The crowd loves it. They're laughing.

184
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,169
Then Frank calls out,
"Hey, you're short...

185
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,870
...you're one-eyed, and you're Jewish.
Don't be intimidated."

186
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,049
And the crowd goes wild.

187
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,649
- How'd it go?
- The Wraith-ers are no more.

188
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,840
- Tore them apart.
- Literally.

189
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,259
He has been so good the whole
time his daddy's been gone.

190
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,090
Do you miss your daddy? He's here.
I think Connor needs some papa love.

191
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,909
He needs a lot of things.
All day, every day.

192
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,399
That's how kids--

193
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,899
He needs a bath, he needs a bottle.
What Connor needs is to grow up.

194
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,289
- Something wrong?
- No, everything's great.

195
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,669
I got a kid that cries, pees, moans,
and never gives me a moment to myself.

196
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,870
- It's all right.
- It's really not. Connor, shut up!

197
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,259
- Don't yell at him. He's just a baby.
- He keeps it up, he won't be.

198
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,710
You better get a grip.

199
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,389
What's wrong with me?

200
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,690
- Something's not right.
- You could say that.

201
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,220
When did you start
drinking so much blood?

202
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,750
- I don't know. A few days ago.
- Where'd you get it?

203
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,529
Same butcher as always.
It's pig's blood.

204
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,379
This last batch just
seemed so much more....

205
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,039
What?

206
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,179
Tasty.

207
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,909
You were hyped this morning, then
you went all Tyson on those demons.

208
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,480
Then you crashed, had another drink,
then you started throwing things.

209
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,149
Like my Aunt Viola and her
Southern Comfort.

210
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,909
Hey, vampire.

211
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,779
Need to drink something red.
Doesn't make me a blood-aholic.

212
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,789
Unless someone's spiking your drink.

213
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,039
Let's find out.

214
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,610
Daddy!

215
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,309
Hey, there, kiddo. How's my boy, huh?

216
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,879
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

217
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:01,759
For God's sake. I know you're
better at following people than this.

218
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,660
So, what's the play?

219
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,160
I just need to talk to you.

220
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm alone. He doesn't know that I'm....

221
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,220
- I want to talk to you about him.
- Holtz?

222
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,859
Great guy. Not overly tall.

223
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,990
Is this the part where you offer
to help me behind his back?

224
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:35,089
Do you believe in anything?
Or is it all just a big scam to you?

225
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,880
You're a soldier. I respect that.

226
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,740
You think your boss is noble and good.
I respect that. Trouble is, he's not.

227
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,710
- You work with a vampire.
- Who, in fact, is noble and good.

228
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:52,119
Quirky, but there it is. Holtz talks
about justice, but he wants revenge.

229
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,990
He's driven by it, blinded by it. He'll
kill anybody who gets in his way.

230
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,490
You're wrong. You don't know him.
All that he's done for me, for us all....

231
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,759
It sounds like a nice cult.

232
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,279
He gave you his word. He'll keep it.
You're the one who's blind.

233
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,039
How so?

234
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:21,349
What you're about to do to your friend.
It's easier to hate Holtz than yourself.

235
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,619
There's enough to go around
for both him and me.

236
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,640
Be careful.

237
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,529
You are being careful.
I didn't even hear you leave.

238
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,509
Want to hold him? He's sleeping.

239
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,009
Maybe it's not such a good idea
right now.

240
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,190
So there's more to pig's blood
than meets the eye.

241
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:11,140
- There's just a trace of--
- Human blood in it. I feel it.

242
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,039
It's his.

243
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:17,930
It's Connor's.

244
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,079
How do you know that?

245
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:26,349
The past couple of days,
he's smelled like food.

246
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,119
They've been feeding you your son's
blood so you'll like it and want more.

247
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,549
Who's "they"?

248
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,579
Who do you think?

249
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,349
Like a cat. Can't hear you...

250
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,450
...but I'm starting to be able
to feel you when you're near.

251
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,250
Isn't that nice and creepy?

252
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,670
- How'd you find me?
- Your assistant.

253
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,710
- I'll have his arms broken.
- Already taken care of.

254
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:25,730
And am I next?

255
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:29,700
Lilah, there are so many things
I could do to you.

256
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:36,650
With transfusions, I could keep you
alive indefinitely. I am experienced.

257
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,289
My own son. How could you?

258
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,079
It's my job.

259
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:58,430
Don't you get tired of the femme fatale
act? Whiskey, straight. Lots of it.

260
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:03,019
How about just once you
talk to me like a person?

261
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,490
I've been doing this a long damn time.

262
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,539
I've had to be better, smarter, quicker
than every man at Wolfram & Hart.

263
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,789
So it's a feminist thing. It's on her.

264
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:19,319
It's a survival thing. I made a lot of
devil's bargains, and I stuck to them.

265
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:23,460
As a result, I live somewhat
dangerously and quite comfortably.

266
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,109
My mother, who doesn't recognize me,
has the best room at the clinic.

267
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,759
I put on my game face
and do what I have to.

268
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:37,809
You wear a game face long enough,
it stops being removable.

269
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,829
Wow.

270
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,140
We have spent so much time
and money on you...

271
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,109
...you're so pivotal to the coming
cataclysms, I forget how dense you are.

272
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:54,049
The game face, the one I worked so
hard to get, I became that years ago.

273
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,640
Just like you've become simpering
and good from yours.

274
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,569
You're the poster boy for human.

275
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,720
Thank you, I don't want it.

276
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,349
Speaking as one non-human to another,
I'm sorry if I hit a nerve.

277
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:11,279
You think you can awaken some buried
spark of decency in me?

278
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,109
Is that the way you
"help your helpless"?

279
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,359
I am not helpless.

280
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,390
I'm glad you came.
I was feeling a little...

281
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,970
... "what's it all about?"
And now I know.

282
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:26,279
It is all about making the rest
of your eternal life miserable.

283
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,990
Shall we drink to that?

284
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:33,690
You backstabbing, traitorous bitch.

285
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,410
I have a lot of work to do. I can't
be in every time-space at once.

286
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,910
And I find you drinking
with my sworn enemy.

287
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,769
Sworn enemy? Really? Have we met?
Because I don't remember swearing.

288
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,109
Sahjhan, he found me.

289
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,920
So you all are in cahoots.

290
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,700
Ethereal time-traveling demon.... You're
the screwball that brought Holtz back.

291
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,230
How's that working out?
He's not fond of demons.

292
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,450
You'll learn nothing from me.

293
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:12,029
Other than, you're his sworn enemy
who brought Holtz back...

294
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,130
...and when that failed,
you came to me. Idiot.

295
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,029
You think my life is easy? I'm
jumping from dimension to dimension.

296
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:25,359
I don't always hear. Sometimes it's just
a visual. I saw you two all chummy.

297
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,539
So why do you want to kill me?

298
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:33,089
He wouldn't tell me either. Not that I
need a reason. I was just curious.

299
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,220
Did he boink your demon bride?
Eat your mother?

300
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,339
You really don't know who he is.

301
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,430
You will pay.

302
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,009
For what?

303
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:53,880
Well, whatever his grudge,
I think you just made him madder.

304
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,369
What are you doing?

305
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,500
Hi. I'm taking Connor.

306
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,089
Where?

307
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,720
To my place. We're going
to the park in the morning.

308
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,329
Angel knows all about it.

309
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,890
- Are Fred and Gunn--?
- Out. Getting food.

310
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,900
That girl can put away the chow.

311
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:44,950
Here, I heated up a bottle.

312
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,460
Hey, Angel didn't say
anything about....

313
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,710
He probably forgot.
He went off in a hurry.

314
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,019
- What happened?
- He was acting weird this morning.

315
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,369
I'm sure you noticed.

316
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:01,069
When he came back
from killing the Wraith-ers....

317
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,829
It's okay. It's your Uncle Wes.

318
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:09,039
You like your Uncle Wes.
We're gonna have a great time.

319
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,720
All right. That's a boy. That's a boy.

320
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,130
Angel.

321
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:55,960
Where is everybody?

322
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,700
Fred and Gunn went for food. Lorne
had to go out. I'm watching the baby.

323
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,779
I packed up some overnight things.

324
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,289
We talked about me taking Connor to
the park, and the one near my place....

325
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,210
It's full of kids. I thought he could
spend the night with me.

326
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,599
That's probably a really good idea.

327
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,869
- You want to say goodbye?
- Okay. Hey. Hey.

328
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,230
Sleep tight, big guy, huh?
Daddy'll see you real soon.

329
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:38,579
Check on him a lot. You have his
pediatrician's number? His formula?

330
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:40,930
I've got all that.

331
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,329
You ever hear of a time-traveling
demon named Sahjhan?

332
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:46,930
No.

333
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,190
The guy that brought Holtz here.
He thinks I'm his sworn enemy.

334
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,140
I don't know him.
Can you hit the books before you go?

335
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:01,069
Where's Lorne? He doesn't show his
face pronto, Fred'll eat his hoagie.

336
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,180
I will not. I already had two.

337
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:07,599
Unless he's really not here.

338
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,829
- He had to go out.
- Where?

339
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,839
Where'd you say he went?

340
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,789
I don't know. He didn't say.
I think he had to see a client.

341
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,140
I've got better reference materials
for your demon at home.

342
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,089
And Connor's getting sleepy.
Why don't I look into it there?

343
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:32,440
Okay.
Just call me if you find something.

344
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,569
I guess....

345
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,980
I'll see everyone tomorrow.

346
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:46,069
Hey, Wes, what's the closest
emergency room to your place?

347
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:51,470
Drew Medical, one minute away.
Top infant-care center. Don't worry.

348
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:01,210
Well, my first whole night
without the kid.

349
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,369
This'll be good for both of us.

350
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,940
He can bond with his Uncle Wes...

351
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:15,089
...and I can get some rest.

352
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,759
- We'll stay up with you.
- Really?

353
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,069
Thanks.

354
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,970
He's just a little guy.

355
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,809
I'm sure he'll be--

356
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,650
Is someone in Wes' office?

357
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,400
Won't you come in.

358
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,079
How's fatherhood treating you?

359
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:55,279
I like it.

360
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,089
You know,
I met a friend of yours tonight.

361
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,579
A demon named Sahjhan.

362
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,460
- What did he have to say?
- He was cryptic.

363
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,769
Actually, he was long-winded.
I didn't get what his deal was.

364
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,730
He hates me. Do you know why?

365
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,309
I don't really care why.

366
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,839
Where is the little nipper?

367
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,490
He had to go out. Sorry.
I know he'd love to meet you.

368
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,180
I'm sure he'll turn up.

369
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:30,670
You've made a nice life here.

370
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,059
Did you come here to fight,
or should I make some tea?

371
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,500
I want to keep Angelus alive.

372
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,450
- But not well.
- Come on!

373
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,029
- Come on. Are you hurt?
- I don't think so. The baby....

374
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,299
Call Wes.

375
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,339
Jeez, Lorne, they got you good.
You better sit down.

376
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,210
What?

377
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:05,259
They didn't do this to me. Wesley did.

378
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,410
Wesley?

379
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,450
What are you talking about?

380
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,799
Earlier, when he came for the baby...

381
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,630
...Connor started crying, and Wes
hummed a lullaby, and I read him--

382
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,700
- I don't know why he did it.
- Did what?

383
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,049
He's been to see Holtz
behind your back, twice.

384
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:32,400
He's not taking the baby overnight.
He's taking the baby away.

385
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,839
For good.

386
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,369
That's close enough.

387
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:17,519
Justine?

388
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,250
He's everything you said.

389
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,319
It's true.

390
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,319
What happened?

391
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,900
Well, he didn't keep his word.

392
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,670
He took everybody...

393
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,200
...and he went after the baby.

394
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,990
And when I questioned him....

395
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,279
Bastard. I'll kill him for this.

396
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,809
You have to get out of here.

397
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,920
- You have to get to a hospital.
- No. I just need to do this.

398
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,490
It doesn't make sense. Why
would Wes do that? You misread him.

399
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,130
I read him right.
The gash on my head proves it.

400
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:36,480
He isn't answering his cell,
pager or home.

401
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,609
Where is he?

402
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,809
- Should we get them to a hospital?
- No.

403
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,130
Holtz knew Connor wasn't here.
He would've torn the place apart.

404
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,819
- He was stalling.
- Buying Wesley time to get away.

405
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,980
Holtz is the key. I want Holtz.

406
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,650
If I find Wesley with him--

407
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,420
We don't know the whole story.
I don't think getting too pumped--

408
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,319
- I don't care what you think.
- Easy.

409
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,579
- He took my son.
- I know. I'm just saying--

410
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,259
- He took my son!
- Get your hands off me!

411
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,450
Stop it, both of you!

412
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:09,170
This isn't helping, damn it! Back off!

413
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,960
Only one thing that matters now,
and that's, where is Connor?

414
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,349
- Where's Holtz?
- You think I'd tell--

415
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,099
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna bury this in your face.

416
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,159
2239 Santa Elena.
It's a big Victorian in Silver Lake.

417
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,579
- We better find Wes before he does.
- We should start at his place.

418
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,800
I'll stay here in case he comes back.

419
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,239
And this time I'll be ready.

420
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,409
What do we know?

421
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,880
No Holtz, no baby.
These don't know where Holtz went.

422
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,179
Get them off the street.

423
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,289
- So we're in the right place?
- Yeah.

424
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,849
Excuse me?

425
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,280
Yes, ma'am. But Holtz didn't come
back here after the hotel.

426
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,460
- Where'd he go?
- We had him, and we lost him.

427
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,570
We're picking him up again.

428
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,800
Just give me a moment, please.
Spring Street.

429
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,559
- Downtown.
- Near the Sixth Street Bridge.

430
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,679
- Let's go.
- Sixth Street Bridge.

431
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,460
Let's go. Hustle, hustle, hustle.

432
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,530
It went well?

433
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:15,519
Very well.
You're paying for my dental work.

434
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:27,369
Hello, son. I'm your father. That lady
with the black eye is your mother.

435
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,190
Your name is
Steven Franklin Thomas...

436
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,849
...and you'll grow up with me on
a ranch in the middle of nowhere.

437
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,159
What's it like in Utah?

438
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,019
It's pretty.

439
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,679
Let's go.

440
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,230
Come any closer, I'll snap his neck!

441
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,460
- Who are they?
- They work for me.

442
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:22,730
Oh, the attorney.

443
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,900
Yes. You are gonna give us the kid,
Captain Holtz.

444
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,130
- Don't.
- That's cute.

445
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:30,559
You'd rather see the fanatic
with the baby than us?

446
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:34,219
Those are automatic weapons.
They didn't have them in your time.

447
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,119
They fire 16 bullets per second.

448
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,349
And if they were gonna
use them, they would've already.

449
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:41,429
They want the baby alive.

450
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:44,150
Something we all have in common.

451
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,130
Not all of us.

452
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,039
You do not want the child alive. You
want him dead. That's our arrangement.

453
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,630
Yeah. I'm a lawyer. Have you met me?

454
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,809
We have a new arrangement.
I'm keeping the baby.

455
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:05,070
- You can't do that.
- Ignore the loudmouth with the bad skin.

456
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,780
He's impotent in this dimension.

457
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,679
- We're leaving.
- No one's going anywhere.

458
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,889
- Don't shoot.
- Yeah.

459
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,940
You really don't want to.
Your bullets won't kill me.

460
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:22,050
But mine will kill you, and her first.

461
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,429
He'll be dead before I hit the ground.

462
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,159
I know.

463
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,500
So I'm going to leave now, right?

464
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:37,679
With me, he gets to live.
Anyone tries to take him, he dies.

465
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,280
Take him.

466
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,059
Whoa. No!
What is wrong with you people?

467
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:53,389
I will take good care of him,
as though he were my own son.

468
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:58,190
He'll never even know you existed.
But come after me....

469
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:02,070
You will, though, won't you?
Maybe I should just--

470
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,610
No. Please.

471
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,519
Take him.

472
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:30,230
You look into the Quor-toth.
The darkest of the dark worlds.

473
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:37,219
I can widen the portal, and you'll all be
swallowed by a world you can't imagine.

474
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,900
Or you can keep your word
and kill that child.

475
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,900
Now!

476
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,210
Don't say I didn't warn you.

477
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,099
- Kill it.
- No!

478
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:58,449
Daniel!

479
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,659
Daniel!

480
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,530
No! No!

481
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,079
Wow. I didn't count on that.

482
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,940
Kind of takes care of my problem.

483
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:30,030
All right, then.

484
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,000
Have a good summer.

485
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,429
Well, I'm looking at
a mountain of paperwork.

486
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,489
Should we do something about...?

487
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,250
Yes, we should.

488
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,210
We should let him suffer.

489
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,250
Connor.
