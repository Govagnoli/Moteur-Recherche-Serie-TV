1
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,230
You look nice.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,320
- And now I look like the Joker.
- Sorry.

3
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,420
Hopefully, I'm too young
and carefree for a coronary.

4
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,440
- Can't you hum when sneaking up on me?
- I don't hum.

5
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:31,170
I'm confused here.
Why is Mrs. Bensen filed under "P"?

6
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,600
It's not a "P," it's an "F."
Or is it an "R"?

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,149
Can we be a little less
"Young and carefree" with the filing?

8
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,939
Oh, it's an "F." I remember now.

9
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,189
All right, so why is
Mrs. Bensen filed under "F"?

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,740
Because she is from France.

11
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,179
- She was such a pain.
- Made me want to drink a lot.

12
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,890
- Well, that's the French for you.
- Hello.

13
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,090
I was just patrolling the area
with my new Bavarian fighting ax...

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,180
...when I thought,
"Perhaps Cordelia's had a vision...

15
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,590
...and needs help battling evil."

16
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,129
We're evil-free at the moment.

17
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:16,310
I also packed Word Puzzle 3-D
if you have the nerve to take me on.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,920
Wesley, I'd love to, but unlike you,
I'm not in my 80s quite yet.

19
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,579
If shaking your booty at the latest
club is your idea of a life...

20
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,390
...then call me--

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,120
--sick with envy.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,010
Hi, I'm Sarina. Nice ax.

23
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,750
Oh, no, this old thing. I--

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,849
Wilson almost had phone sex with the
manager at Lounge La Brea to get us in.

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,140
- How do I look?
- Like you always do.

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,629
- Wilson's eyes will be glued on you.
- Who's Wilson?

27
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,560
- Christopher.
- Christopher Wilson.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,480
- Wilson Christopher.
- The archaeologist from Brandeis?

29
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:01,700
The photographer from L.A. Cordelia's
been seeing. Third time's the charm.

30
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,620
And that Hugh Grant thing
is starting to work for me.

31
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,469
So you've been seeing someone.
How come I didn't know?

32
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:16,060
I'm ashamed of you. You'd embarrass
me by giving him the third degree.

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,319
He could give me
the third degree anytime.

34
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,669
You're a sucker for....

35
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,139
- Cordelia, grab that file. Sorry.
- Not to worry. Whoopsie.

36
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,750
Lounge La Brea. Sounds like
that could be an evening...

37
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,389
...with all sorts of evening-type--

38
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,030
- I heard the bands--
- There are no bands.

39
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,680
- Which I like. If it's loud--
- Want to come?

40
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,259
Oh, I think I may be busy.

41
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,689
Besides, I don't lounge all that well.

42
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,479
Good one! Oh, yes.
No, he's no lounger, this one.

43
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:58,919
The good ones are always gay.

44
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,490
Cor, tick-tock.

45
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,810
So that client I'm meeting,
what's he like again?

46
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,430
Like a big baby hatching from
a big egg with really large hands...

47
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,639
...in need of a manicure.
You're meeting him here.

48
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,139
Okay.

49
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,719
Are my girls ready to party?

50
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,110
I don't suppose you need help
slaying the big baby creature?

51
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,840
Not that an evening alone with a
word puzzle isn't plenty exhilarating.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,689
Right.

53
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,139
Don't move a muscle. Demon spawn!

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,879
Cowards, don't make me thrash it out
of you. Where do you lay your eggs?

55
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,469
In the cellar?

56
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,900
- Wesley.
- In the bedroom?

57
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,029
That's right, termites lay their
eggs anywhere, such as next door.

58
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,370
And we fight termites,
wherever they may roam.

59
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,110
Sorry about the door.

60
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,889
Look out, Wesley!

61
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,569
Duck!

62
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,569
You'll pay for that!

63
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,829
- That was bracing.
- Yeah.

64
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,949
Baby just hatched. Wouldn't want
to run into him when he grows up...

65
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,639
...and gets his driver's license.

66
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,750
And thank you very much, Cordelia...

67
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,500
...for sending us to the wrong house.

68
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,310
Another five minutes, and
that thing would've been loose.

69
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,870
- Well, it all worked out.
- This time.

70
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,560
Maybe we should clean up--

71
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,860
Think a Tahval demon
has a big security deposit?

72
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,279
I'm sure of it.

73
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,120
Well, it's not my place,
Cordelia works for you...

74
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,160
...but she's not doing
her duty lately.

75
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,899
She's dealing with a lot.
Doyle's death, visions, youth.

76
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,319
- She's finding her way in the world.
- We're not in the world.

77
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,879
- Demon hunters have a higher calling.
- You....

78
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,810
I'm very fond of Cordelia.

79
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,509
- But she's gad-abouting with doxies--
- I think they liked you.

80
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,319
Really?

81
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,250
I didn't mean "doxy" in the sexually
promiscuous sense, exactly.

82
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,480
- You don't think the ax put them off?
- That was charming.

83
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,379
- The fact they think we're gay?
- Adds mystery.

84
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,000
- Here.
- Thanks.

85
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:21,100
- Don't mention it.
- I won't. But I'll tip for it.

86
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,189
Jason, moola.

87
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,670
Thanks.

88
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm not saying
it was worthy of a kiss.

89
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,730
I'm bored.

90
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,470
Emily, do you know
what it takes to get in here?

91
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,139
- Still bored.
- Well, Cordy's not.

92
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,360
So you left Sunnydale and came to L.A.
What was that like?

93
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,120
Skydiving without a parachute.

94
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,939
Except for the "smashing
your body to bits" part.

95
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,060
No, it was like that too. And the guy
who's supposed to be here...

96
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,019
- The guy?
- ...with the bag of fame and fortune.

97
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,779
- Oh, that guy.
- So, what happened to him?

98
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,550
He comes and goes.
He's sort of fleeting that way.

99
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,730
If you see him,
tell him to fleet my way.

100
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,069
- Thank you.
- For what?

101
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,259
For making me not hate dating.

102
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:22,730
Sarina's really something.

103
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,399
I'm gonna send her flowers.

104
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,540
For introducing you to me.

105
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,449
I knew that.

106
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,620
God, for the first time I like L.A.

107
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,990
In high school, I knew my place.
It was a haughty place.

108
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,980
- Maybe I was a tad shallow.
- Nobody feels like they belong here.

109
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,360
The point of L.A. is to make
you feel as insecure as possible.

110
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,330
You don't feel that way.

111
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,200
Sure I do.

112
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,559
You're doing what you came to do.

113
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,909
You're photographing all
these gorgeous, famous people.

114
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,230
- Where's the insecure?
- In the pictures.

115
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,850
Which are further proof that
everyone has a real life except me.

116
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm the guy behind the camera,
recording life, not living it...

117
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,240
...each and every moment.

118
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,179
- Like you.
- Wow, I'm living life?

119
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,669
Look at me.

120
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,179
Look at you.

121
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,950
Well, here we are.

122
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,419
Thank you for the club
and for driving me home...

123
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,809
...and listening
to my entire life story.

124
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,669
I may have left out
a few weeks in early 1987, but--

125
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,480
I had a great time,
and you didn't talk too much.

126
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,730
- I want to know everything about you.
- Me too. I mean, about you, not--

127
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,080
Because I already know about me--

128
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,250
Call you tomorrow?

129
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,429
- You don't have to--
- Call you?

130
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,519
--go home.

131
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,750
I mean, right away.
It's still early...

132
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,940
...in Australia.

133
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,210
Will you come in?

134
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,649
Nice.

135
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,029
Compared to my old apartment,
it's Buckingham Palace.

136
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,440
You live alone, right?

137
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,580
In the sense that I'm the only one
here that's actually alive.

138
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,639
That was a yes, I think.

139
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,600
Wiring. Old buildings.

140
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,830
Well, no worries.
Besides, I like looking at you.

141
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,960
Look, the truth is that my dating game
skills are kind of rusty.

142
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,320
You're the first person I've
had over in a long-- Well, ever.

143
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,070
So I'm open to suggestions.

144
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,049
Music?

145
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,470
Right. Music.

146
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,740
Hey, that's some jaunty polka.

147
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,429
Oh, I know, I know. The wiring.

148
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,600
- How about tea?
- That'd be great.

149
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,539
Okay.

150
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,240
All right, Dennis, knock it off!

151
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,799
This is the one guy
I've actually liked in a long time...

152
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,759
...and if you keep killing
the mood, I'll kill you!

153
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,179
All right, empty threat, you being
a ghost and already dead and all.

154
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,629
But I'll do something worse.

155
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,350
I'll play Evita around the clock.

156
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,370
- The one with Madonna!
- Who are you talking to?

157
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:10,370
My ghost. I have a ghost.

158
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:11,820
He's jealous.

159
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:19,330
Kidding. The apartment's great,
but things are always breaking...

160
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:24,909
...and I have no one to complain to.
So just to keep myself company...

161
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,740
...I talk to myself.

162
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,870
Wilson?

163
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,620
Somebody's gonna be late for work.

164
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,250
- What time is it?
- 12:15.

165
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,769
I left two messages.
She should have called back.

166
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,720
Maybe she unplugged her phone
or slept somewhere else.

167
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,129
Well, I guess we should....
Break open her door and trespass.

168
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,299
Cordelia?

169
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

170
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,960
- I thought it was just me.
- This isn't like her.

171
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,899
Avoiding her responsibilities?
Lately, it seems quite like her.

172
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,799
I'm sure it'll all work out once we--

173
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,519
Mother of God.

174
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,509
- Angel?
- It's all right. We're here.

175
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,899
I'm ready to wake up now.
I don't seem to be waking up.

176
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,679
- Help me.
- We will. What do you remember?

177
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,570
We went to the club. Wilson and I
just sort of hid out on this couch...

178
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,610
...and we talked and talked
and then he drove me home.

179
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,269
And I asked him in.

180
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,809
He was really nice.

181
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:55,870
And we--

182
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,850
You know.

183
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,149
It was normal. He was normal.
And it was safe.

184
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,240
It was all really safe.

185
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,059
It's okay.
Have you talked to Wilson?

186
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,490
No.

187
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,259
I haven't talked to anyone.

188
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,539
What would I say to him?

189
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,830
"I had a really great time. I think
you left something at my place."

190
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,440
This isn't right.

191
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,470
What's happening to you,
he may have some answers.

192
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,120
- I can't.
- Dial his number and I'll talk to him.

193
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,639
Oh, God. I'm being punished.

194
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,190
You're certainly not
being punished. This is--

195
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,450
We'll get to the bottom of it.

196
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,059
This number has been
disconnected, there's no new number,

197
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,990
He's not answering right now.
I want you to rest.

198
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,720
We're gonna handle this.

199
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,139
You're not alone.

200
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,250
That's sort of the problem, isn't it?

201
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,240
Could you just leave me alone for now?

202
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,100
We'll be right outside.

203
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,559
- Thanks.
- Any luck with your contact?

204
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,860
His phones are disconnected...

205
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,990
...no unlisted numbers,
forwarding addresses or record.

206
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,839
That's something.

207
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,150
I'm guessing it's some
procrea-parasitic demon.

208
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,940
A demon who can only reproduce
by implanting a human with its seed.

209
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,690
Yes, I've heard of such entities.
The human mothers--

210
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,690
Rarely live.
Ones who do, wish they hadn't.

211
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,509
She could give birth at any moment.

212
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,789
- You'll have to see what's inside her.
- Pardon me?

213
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,430
- Prenatal exam.
- Oh, of course. What about you?

214
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,690
I'm gonna find Daddy.

215
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,759
- I didn't see you.
- I get that a lot.

216
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,480
- What can I get you?
- I need some help.

217
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,410
- I'm busy.
- I won't take much of your time.

218
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,829
My friend Cordelia was here.
Big smile, really pretty?

219
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,940
We get a lot of that in here.

220
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,230
- What's this?
- Probably an insult.

221
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,460
You're always serving jerks who
think they can buy anything, right?

222
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:11,920
Yeah.

223
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,140
One of those jerks hurt my friend.
I need to find him fast.

224
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,130
- Who was it?
- Wilson Christopher.

225
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,769
Where do he and his friends hang?

226
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,670
- Wherever Sarina tells them to.
- Sarina.

227
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,240
- Yeah. You know her?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,839
They're a pack.
Guys with money, girls with pretty.

229
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,430
The girls decide what club's hot,
and Sarina rules the girls.

230
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,519
- Thanks.
- You the boyfriend?

231
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,730
No. I'm family.

232
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,549
Do you know what it is?

233
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:50,990
Boy or girl?

234
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,519
Shouldn't be long.

235
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,150
I told them it was rather urgent.

236
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,519
- You're carrying low. I bet it's--
- Shut up! Don't touch me!

237
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:11,170
You're, what,
eight and a half months along?

238
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,819
Feels like only yesterday.

239
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,589
You left a lot of blanks
on the information form.

240
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,750
Who's your previous doctor?

241
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,170
- You're the only doctor we've seen--
- In California.

242
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,150
We just moved here from England.

243
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:27,769
Lovely country.

244
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,660
So, how are you feeling?

245
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,829
I'm as big as a house,
everything hurts, I--

246
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,319
That's all normal.
Once your little one comes out...

247
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,829
...you'll feel a lot better.

248
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,269
God, it's a nightmare.

249
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,609
Hormones.

250
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,180
Mrs. Penborn, why don't you lie back?
We'll see what's baking in the oven.

251
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,059
Have you chosen a name yet?
It's the hardest part for many.

252
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,220
- Looks like somebody is having twins.
- Twins?!

253
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,940
No, there's a third heartbeat.

254
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,670
- There is another one.
- Five.

255
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,750
Six.

256
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,950
Oh, my God.

257
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,259
What is it? What's wrong?

258
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,519
I'm sure it's nothing.
But I'd like to withdraw...

259
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,710
...a little amniotic fluid just to
make sure everything is shipshape.

260
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,440
So, nurse, if you would prep
Mrs. Penborn right away?

261
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:08,140
- Sarina?
- Just leave it outside.

262
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,339
Sarina, it's Angel,
Cordelia's friend. Can I come in?

263
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,279
Okay.

264
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,650
Sarina?

265
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,049
Sarina?

266
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,259
The light hurts my eyes lately.

267
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,210
- I know the feeling.
- I thought you were the liquor store.

268
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm almost dry.

269
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,460
I know what you're thinking.
I shouldn't, right?

270
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,500
It'll hurt the baby?

271
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,849
I hope.

272
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:18,519
There's a O.5% chance
of miscarriage from the procedure.

273
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,519
- Now, it's a very small risk--
- I'll take it.

274
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,750
You'll feel a pinch. Count backwards
from five and we'll be done.

275
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,299
Five, four...

276
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,130
...three, two, one.

277
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,150
One.

278
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:40,549
One.

279
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,420
One!

280
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:44,960
All done.

281
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,400
That wasn't too bad, was it?
Now, we'll just run a few tests--

282
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,140
Dr. Wasserman?

283
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,140
This is....

284
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:01,730
Excuse me.

285
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,740
You saw what's inside of me?

286
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:16,119
- I think we should find Angel.
- Wesley, please just tell me!

287
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,269
Do they look healthy?

288
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,539
It's like it's not real.
But it is. Right?

289
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,549
It's really happening?

290
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,970
It's real. It's happening
to Cordelia too.

291
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,480
Oh, God.

292
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:41,069
I can't reach Jason. He's gone.

293
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,650
So is Wilson.

294
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,880
- I didn't know this would happen.
- But you knew something.

295
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,980
I knew the guys, Jason and Nick...

296
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,950
...and then Wilson wanted
to meet Cordelia. I don't know.

297
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,970
I knew something wasn't right.
Their money....

298
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,299
- What about their money?
- It's stupid.

299
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,690
It kind of smelled.

300
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,799
I mean, really smelled.

301
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,740
Sometimes the guys were like jumpy.
But this town-- You know.

302
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:25,609
Everything's fake. Things are weird
and you stop asking questions.

303
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,660
You sure this is happening?

304
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,440
Do you have someone you can call?

305
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,839
- Like who?
- Family.

306
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,759
No. No one. The guys seemed
like they liked that.

307
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,700
Wilson asked about Cordelia. I said
she didn't have anyone either.

308
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,359
Sarina, where can I find--

309
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,230
It'll all work out.
Everything's going to be fine.

310
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,190
- I know it will be.
- There's a brave girl.

311
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm sure Angel won't mind
if you rest in here.

312
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,160
Just relax, get comfortable.

313
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,430
Well, as comfortable
as is possible, at any rate.

314
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,740
Should you need anything,
anything at all...

315
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,809
- ...then I'll just--
- You're afraid.

316
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,130
- What?
- You're afraid of what's inside of me.

317
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,319
You think it's horrible.

318
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,180
You think I won't be
able to handle it.

319
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,970
That if I find out,
I'll do something bad.

320
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,509
Cordelia, the truth is
I haven't yet formulated a theory.

321
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,119
I need time to analyze
the ultrasound...

322
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,190
...and weigh the data.
When there's anything--

323
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,059
There's seven of them.

324
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,589
There's seven of his children...

325
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,710
...growing inside of me.

326
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,119
They're talking to me.

327
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:06,279
They're talking all at once.
I can't understand.

328
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,250
I know how difficult
this must be for you--

329
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,480
No!

330
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,589
- You don't know.
- All right.

331
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,039
You don't know what it's like
to be a partner in creation.

332
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,500
I just meant--

333
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,170
- Wesley.
- Yes?

334
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:27,529
They're not human.

335
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,519
- I imagine that's true.
- But, that could be okay, right?

336
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,960
I mean, look at Angel.
He's not human.

337
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,849
And Doyle, he wasn't either.

338
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,779
I mean, not totally.

339
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,089
He was good.

340
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,839
- Any luck locating Wilson?
- Not yet.

341
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,119
But I did find Sarina.
She's a victim too.

342
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:24,099
As big as Cordelia.
Wilson's rich pals are in on it.

343
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,700
- Who knows how many are pregnant?
- It's worse.

344
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,970
The ultrasound results.

345
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,740
Seven heartbeats, maybe more.
With multiple pregnancies--

346
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,250
- Someone's raising an army.
- Of what?

347
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,609
We need to find the demon fathers.

348
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,160
Gun clubs? Guns can kill them?
I say, that makes it easier.

349
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:47,920
Sarina said they hang out at some
private gun club, Guns and Cigars.

350
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,410
Find the species and we may find a way
to terminate this without hurting her.

351
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,170
And if we can't?

352
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,259
Find out what to do once they're born.

353
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,930
Yes, well, it mustn't come to that.

354
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,900
The odds of her even surviving are--

355
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,490
I never realized just how disgusting
that was. Get her back to bed.

356
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,019
And maybe order her a pizza
or something.

357
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,430
Good idea.

358
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,779
I was hungry.

359
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,329
Shouldn't sneak up like that in here.
Accidents happen.

360
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,349
Speaking of accidents,
I'm a friend of Cordelia Chase.

361
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:01,339
This is a private club.
Featured word: "Private."

362
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,579
You don't talk to me, I'll kick
your ass. Featured word: "Ass."

363
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,339
Angel, right? Her boss?
She told me all about you.

364
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,299
Somehow, I doubt that.

365
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,640
You're human.
Then you can't be the father.

366
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:24,430
You and your friends are just a link.

367
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,970
How does it work? Those things come
to term, she'll die, you know that?

368
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,059
- So? I'm not telling you anything.
- I was so hoping you'd say that.

369
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:46,549
Hey! Someone's mommy
didn't teach him to play nice.

370
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,230
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

371
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,500
Yeesh.

372
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,720
That's him, isn't it?

373
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,400
I'd ask that you not overreact.

374
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,480
Keep in mind that oft times...

375
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,930
...these 16th-century engravers
tended to exaggerate.

376
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,519
It seems dire, but now that
we've identified the species...

377
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,650
...there's every chance we'll
stop what's happening to you.

378
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,460
That's right. We mustn't lose hope.

379
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:41,829
You won't hurt my babies.

380
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,569
No one's gonna hurt my babies.

381
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm getting the big picture.

382
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,369
You proxy for Big Daddy Demon. You
implant his life force in these women.

383
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,329
He has trouble finding dates.
We just help him out a little.

384
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:06,849
- Shut up, Jason.
- You get money and success in return.

385
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,750
How else would losers
like you get ahead?

386
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,029
You'd have to become surrogates
for a vile demon.

387
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,849
Well, mostly, I do it for the sex.

388
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:19,339
Welcome to L.A. There are worse
things to be in business with.

389
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,240
Where is this demon you worship?

390
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,099
Even if we told, it wouldn't matter
since you're gonna have an accident.

391
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,849
I really don't like it
when people shoot me.

392
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,369
Now you'll tell me
what I need to know.

393
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,150
- Hello?
- Yeah, Wesley, it's Angel.

394
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,200
- Thank God.
- I found Wilson,

395
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,089
What Cordelia's carrying,
he's not the father.

396
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,279
I know. It's a Hacksaw beast,
an inner-earth demon.

397
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,579
Oh, this is all my fault,

398
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,779
- How's that your fault?
- She ran off. I tried to stop her.

399
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,680
She became insanely protective
when I identified the father of her--

400
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,670
- I fear she may have gone to meet it.
- She has. Miliken Industrial Park.

401
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,839
- That's where its shrine is.
- How does Cordelia know?

402
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,539
She's telepathically controlled
by it through its unborn,

403
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:07,769
A psychic umbilical cord,

404
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,800
The Hacksaw's telepathy's
sustaining its unborn spawn.

405
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,000
We have to cut the cord.

406
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:16,769
We slay this demon and poof!
No more evil pregnancies.

407
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,929
Good, we can end this
without harming the women.

408
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,179
- There's just one tiny problem.
- What's that?

409
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,780
I don't wish to use the words
"impossible to kill"...

410
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,780
...but fire won't kill it,
decapitation won't...

411
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,809
...and it's really huge.

412
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,409
- Wesley, can you shoot straight?
- Beg your pardon?

413
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,489
Cordelia.

414
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,070
Come out of there this instant.
All of you, please.

415
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,409
- We don't expect you to understand.
- I understand.

416
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:37,849
You'll die unless you come with me.

417
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:42,789
That's the vilest smell I've ever had
the displeasure of inhaling.

418
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,929
- Don't make me come after you.
- We serve our master.

419
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,230
Please come before--

420
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,590
Who is the interloper?

421
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,789
To think you could disturb
the birth of my children?

422
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,739
Who are you?

423
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:19,039
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
rogue demon hunter.

424
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,179
I'm here to fight you, sir,
to the death.

425
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,110
Preferably yours.

426
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,159
You?

427
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:31,210
As a heathen you don't know the
biblical story of David and Goliath.

428
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:35,659
I assure you it's particularly
relevant to this situation.

429
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,789
You said you came here to do battle.
Then let's fight and be done.

430
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,579
Yes, well...

431
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,199
...as a point of courtesy...

432
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,699
...I like to get to know
my opponents...

433
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,809
...before I engage them
in mortal combat.

434
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,599
Do you have any hobbies?

435
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,280
Enough talk. I'll come to you.

436
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,599
Sorry I'm late to the baby shower.
Brought a gift.

437
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,780
I really hate dating.

438
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,809
I got magazines for
when she comes back.

439
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:24,840
Excuse me, I did just neaten
this up for her.

440
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,500
Cordelia. Hi. You look great.

441
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:33,489
- Marvelous!
- You didn't have to come in so soon.

442
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:37,340
If you need more time, he can manage.
I've helped out a bit--

443
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:41,719
Someone forgot to close
the filter again.

444
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,099
- If you're ready to come back....
- I'm fine.

445
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,980
I had a great audition
for Max Crax, the crackers.

446
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,369
Terrific. Because a cracker's
something everyone can--

447
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,400
- Eat.
- Eat.

448
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,989
This producer is so nice.
He said I'm his first choice.

449
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:59,510
We're having dinner tonight.

450
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,400
Tonight?

451
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,929
Best to get back on the horse.
If he seems--

452
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:10,369
He is so sweet. All I have to do
is let him impregnate me...

453
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,300
...with his demon seed
and I've got the part.

454
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,579
Guys, I appreciate all the concern,
but I'm okay.

455
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,739
I got through the ordeal.

456
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,079
I'm a lot stronger than those
loser demon surrogates thought.

457
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,380
I'm starting to learn that.

458
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,809
I learned something too.

459
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,760
I learned men are evil.
Wait...

460
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,000
...I knew that.

461
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:39,420
I learned that L.A. is full of
self-serving phonies.

462
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,210
No, had that one down too.

463
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,789
- Sex is bad?
- We all knew that.

464
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,789
Okay. I learned that
I have two people...

465
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,719
...I trust absolutely with my life.

466
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,739
And that part's new.

467
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,400
Some...

468
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,030
...allergies.
