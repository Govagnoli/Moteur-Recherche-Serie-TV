1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,680
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,429
- You Denver?
- No other cat but me.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,800
A vampire wants to slay a demon
to help grubby humans? I don't get it.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,369
There's a hotel here
full of tortured souls...

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,949
...who need your help.

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,179
Take them all.

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:23,829
I'm trying to atone for 100 years
of unthinkable evil. I never can.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,539
Never enough. Now I got
Wolfram & Hart dogging me.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,239
You've done stellar work.
The senior partners noticed.

10
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,609
Darla had a shot at redemption,
but they took it.

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,700
For God's sake, help us.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,039
- People will die.
- I just can't seem to care.

13
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,890
Officer, wait! This man is--

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,520
You learn to live with many things,
don't you?

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,350
- This job is making me crazy.
- I know the feeling.

16
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,859
- What's next?
- "Be sure all troughs are fastened...

17
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,890
...and sacrifices tilted
as in diagram F-12...

18
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,579
- ...for drainage into sacred bowl."
- Yes, yes. And?

19
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,780
"Using a diagonal motion,
slit throat of sacrifice...

20
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,490
...with the pre-blessed
ceremonial dagger provided."

21
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,419
- It didn't see it.
- Look under the packing. Hurry.

22
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,879
- It's not in here.
- Just give me the knife.

23
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,719
You know....

24
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,770
I, well, couldn't help but
notice the goats.

25
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,819
Yeah, lot of goats.

26
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,979
Goats, many. Those goats, guys--

27
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,759
That's our pre-blessed--

28
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,659
Ceremonial dagger?

29
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,060
So sue me.
Or have your bosses do it.

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,879
This building's owned by
Wolfram & Hart, right?

31
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:48,719
What do you want?

32
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,789
I wanna know what they're
having you worship.

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,610
None of your business.
Who are you?

34
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,560
Me?

35
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,590
The type who hates to see
good blood go to waste.

36
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,150
We just get paid to do the
slaughtering and say the prayer.

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,240
- Praying to what?
- I don't know!

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,849
- How can you not know?
- The ritual, it's in Latin.

39
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,039
They said we should just sound it out.

40
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,800
- They?
- Like you said, Wolfram & Hart.

41
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,349
It has to be done by midnight,
or something will be pissed off.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,659
Good.

43
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:27,889
- I don't see anything.
- Not a trace.

44
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,610
At school the kids'll never notice
that a third eye was growing there.

45
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,430
- This will come back in soon.
- What?

46
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:39,709
The hair. I meant the hair...

47
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,889
...that was in the back--

48
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,519
Not the third eye,
'cause that won't come back.

49
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,259
- Right?
- No reason it should.

50
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,720
The curative charm seems to have
worked like a charm.

51
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,269
- We can't thank you.
- Don't worry.

52
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,680
It's what we do.

53
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,379
- Kind of a mission.
- No, I mean we can't thank you.

54
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,959
And we can't pay you either.

55
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,540
This bill, it's ridiculous.

56
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,850
What? We didn't even
charge you for the mandrake.

57
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,379
- My husband says it's outrageous.
- Does he?

58
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,069
What would your husband
consider a fair price...

59
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,370
...for the removal of the third eye
from the back of your child's head?

60
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,269
Well, nothing.

61
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,569
Steve says one can't be bitten
by a demon and have a third eye...

62
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,050
...grow on the back of one's head,
so you're runn;ng a scam.

63
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,649
And you won't squeeze
one red cent out of us.

64
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,019
- Come on, Stephanie.
- Scam?

65
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,129
The back of your kid's head
was blinking!

66
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,959
No, let her go.

67
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,300
It's easier for the Sharps to call us
con artists than to accept...

68
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,600
...that Skilosh spawn nearly hatched
out of their child's skull.

69
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,810
- Gee, wonder why?
- Great.

70
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,430
While they're indulging their denial,
we have bills to pay.

71
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,399
You know, she's right.

72
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,180
Maybe the Sharps will come round.

73
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,180
Right. People come round.

74
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,759
- Where are you going?
- To see what's up in the hood.

75
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,660
I'll do more good there
than here with you two.

76
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,170
- Things will pick up. They're bound to.
- It's L.A.

77
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,750
The evil's probably tied
up in traffic.

78
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,089
You'll let me know
when it gets here, right?

79
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,069
I've been looking for you.
Where are you going?

80
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,790
- Lunch.
- You think now is the time for lunch?

81
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:38,560
You mean lunchtime?

82
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,709
- The review's in two days.
- I'm aware.

83
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,779
So is everyone else.
They've had the fear of--

84
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,250
"God" would be the wrong word.

85
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,509
- They're just scared.
- They should be.

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,000
I dug up everything
on the last 75-year review.

87
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,279
It makes the Christmas purge
of '68 seem fun.

88
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,769
Half of mid-management was sacked.
They used actual sacks.

89
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,579
- I'll read it, Lilah.
- You better. My ass is on the line too.

90
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,910
We're supposed to be
running this together.

91
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,569
I suggested how to plump up
our portfolios by Friday.

92
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,300
Either we pass the review or we won't.

93
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,170
You think a few dark rites and
rituals will make a difference?

94
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,120
Everyone else thinks so.

95
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,560
Henderson pulled her first-born out of
company daycare to offer it up to....

96
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,089
Brownnoser. Mom was right.
I should've had children.

97
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,480
- We'll stand on our record.
- Then we're dead.

98
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,779
Remember our collective screwups?

99
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,949
Two of them are still
out there somewhere.

100
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,480
You'd tell me if they
contacted you, right?

101
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,500
He set them on fire, Lilah.

102
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,129
Even vampires need time
to recover from that.

103
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,740
- It'd be like them to pop up now.
- Don't worry.

104
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,730
Someone's got to.
We don't get a second shot at this.

105
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,360
Nothing can happen between now and
Friday to screw this up.

106
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,439
Blood sacrifices,
black masses, totems....

107
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,910
What does it mean? It's all over.
It could be a raising, but I don't....

108
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,399
The prayers, the rituals,
they're too generic. Boilerplate.

109
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,959
- Are they summoning something?
- Or trying to make it rain.

110
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,750
Why is this so important to you?

111
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,629
- Because it's important to them.
- Therefore it must be stopped.

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,569
I need you.
I don't have the resources.

113
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,829
- You need my help?
- Yeah--

114
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,509
Get them for butchering animals
without a permit.

115
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,019
I can't do anything. I'm on
desk duty till Friday's hearing.

116
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,720
Hearing?

117
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,259
Remember Atkinson,
the captain at the two-three?

118
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,259
He's blaming me for
letting in a lunatic...

119
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,190
...who broke into his office
and beat him up.

120
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,350
He's filed a complaint.

121
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,009
He raised zombie cops and
released them in the streets.

122
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,960
Once I explain that to
Internal Affairs, this'll go away.

123
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,700
They've just been
looking for an excuse.

124
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,460
You know what they say about me.

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,970
I'm a cop.
That's all I've ever--

126
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,750
I can't take a suspension.
I would just--

127
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,909
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,320
Are you?

129
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,389
Because they might want
to know about this too.

130
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,419
You'd nothing to do with that.

131
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,769
- Didn't I?
- No.

132
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,110
These dead people were threatened
by an intruder at their offices...

133
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,220
...whom I picked up
and released three hours...

134
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,100
...before they were massacred.

135
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,169
- You know who's responsible for that.
- Yes.

136
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,200
But why is Forensics saying
it looks like...

137
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,519
...the suspect or suspects
didn't break in?

138
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,710
They had to break out.

139
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,950
The victims were locked in
with their attackers.

140
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,809
I am done helping you now.

141
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:10,740
Sorry I'm late.

142
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,179
I'd come home for lunch...

143
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:17,480
...but it's crazy at the office,
with the review coming up.

144
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:26,690
I didn't call, so you wouldn't
have to get up. How do you feel?

145
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,690
Stronger today, I guess.

146
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,019
Good. You're stronger every day.

147
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,440
Only because you saved me.

148
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,620
I'd still be in that sewer
if you hadn't found me.

149
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,299
I don't know how you did it.

150
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,289
Drusilla. She came to me.

151
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,960
Remember? I told you.

152
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,809
She's gone.

153
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,179
- She'll be back.
- No.

154
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,929
You're the only one
who hasn't abandoned me.

155
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,559
And I never will.

156
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:08,909
Here.

157
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,409
It's cold.

158
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,279
It's the only way to keep it fresh.

159
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,789
Not the only way.

160
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,389
At least it's human.

161
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,059
I'm gonna go shower.

162
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,850
You always shower when you come back
from that place. Don't know why.

163
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,299
You're never dirty.

164
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,730
I'm always dirty.

165
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,980
I don't care, substitute it with
something. Be creative.

166
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,570
Not even 10:00, and
we're out of yak's bile.

167
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,919
- We gotta talk.
- You should've booked in advance.

168
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,740
- You can't go onstage tonight.
- I'm not here to sing.

169
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,600
- That's what we call it now?
- Something's coming.

170
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,159
Really?

171
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,450
I thought it was the nachos bringing
in the morally ambiguous crowd.

172
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,230
Lawyers.

173
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,610
Easy. I know what you're thinking.

174
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:38,350
The throwing-yourself-over-tables-
twisting-their-heads-off part?

175
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,090
Not a good idea.

176
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,379
You've seen.
You know what's coming.

177
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,659
You wouldn't like it
if I blabbed your personal stuff...

178
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,259
...to every Tom, Dick
and vampire that walked in.

179
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,960
Is it bad?

180
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,000
I can't divulge to you
what I read in another being.

181
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,720
But I heard something
in the men's restroom.

182
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,090
It's coming Friday.
It's got their legal briefs in a twist.

183
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,149
What?

184
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,580
Every 75 years, your friends at
Wolfram & Hart have a review.

185
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,539
The angst is not about the review,
but more about the reviewer.

186
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,980
- And let's just say it ain't Rex Reed.
- What is it?

187
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,789
It's evil.

188
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,700
It's dark. It's merciless.

189
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,919
Actually, it sounds a lot
like Rex, doesn't it?

190
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,570
Just tell me in one word what it is.

191
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,539
Not likely.
But I can tell you in two.

192
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,070
Senior partner.

193
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,759
- I need more. More information.
- We all need more.

194
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,009
You need more tether,
'cause you're at the end of it.

195
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,110
I get this. I'm not asking
you to rat out their destinies.

196
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,289
- These senior partners are my destiny.
- Are they?

197
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:09,909
I haven't seen a destiny with you
in it lately. It's all kind of murky.

198
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,570
These messy rites and rituals
you've crashed all over town...

199
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,610
...they mean nothing.
Nervous children...

200
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,149
...trying to score points
before Daddy gets home.

201
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,600
I got news.
Daddy? Not impressed.

202
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,139
Stopping those won't prevent it
from passing into our world Friday.

203
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:33,029
- What is "it" and how do I stop it?
- I don't know.

204
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,159
Can it be killed?

205
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,610
Most anything in this dimension
can be killed.

206
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,490
A downside of being here.

207
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,929
That and the so-called musicals of
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

208
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,419
"The Band of Blacknil."
I don't know what it means.

209
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,700
- I shouldn't even give you that much.
- Thanks.

210
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,649
"Home Office."

211
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,830
Picked it up from them tonight.

212
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,320
- What does it mean?
- Maybe the source. Who knows?

213
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,740
Stop pestering me.

214
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,860
I am picking up one other thing.

215
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,720
They'd really like to see you dead.

216
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,600
- Good Lord.
- Angel?

217
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,080
May we help you?

218
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,840
Excuse me, that area is for
employees only.

219
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,049
- You took the books.
- You got the waffle iron.

220
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,809
Hey, no!

221
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,649
Not that one.
I'm in the middle of it. Take this.

222
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,809
Don't make me move you.

223
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,169
Give him the book, Cordelia.

224
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,580
Just give him the damn thing!

225
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,389
Let him get the hell out.

226
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,350
Here.

227
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,889
- I don't even know what you are.
- I'm a vampire. Look it up.

228
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,879
What a jerk.

229
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:37,970
Cordelia....

230
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,179
Anybody else,
I'd say get laid, already.

231
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,850
- Cordelia....
- But no, not him.

232
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,610
One decent boff, and he switches
to evil psycho-vamp.

233
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,919
Which would be better for everyone.
Him, 'cause he'd get some.

234
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,200
Us, because then we could
stake him after.

235
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,850
Cordelia, ambulance.

236
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,740
Oh, my God!

237
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,509
If you have anything to offer in your
defense, anything at all...

238
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,960
...now would be the time.

239
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,660
- For God's sake, say something.
- What am I supposed to say?

240
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,519
They've dredged out every ugly detail.

241
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,990
It's as if nothing had a context,
and I'm supposed to explain?

242
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,039
I was doing my job.

243
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,740
Actually, you've been
isolating yourself.

244
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,579
You've withdrawn
from your fellow officers...

245
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,930
...developed a fascination with
bizarre and macabre cases.

246
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,059
Even you can't seem to give an
explanation as to why.

247
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:49,920
Now your father, he was a respected
veteran of this department.

248
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,059
You discovered his body after he was
murdered, is that right?

249
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,180
Yes.

250
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,720
And the case was never solved?

251
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,940
No arrests have ever been made.

252
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,150
That must be frustrating for you.

253
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,250
- I dealt with it.
- Did you?

254
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,690
You took no time off after his death.
You went right back on the job.

255
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,210
- That's not your business.
- It is when it affects performance.

256
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,369
It is important when we
suffer a loss of this nature...

257
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,849
...to take proper time to grieve.

258
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,549
So we understand.

259
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,609
- We're not judging you.
- No, you're just firing me.

260
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,650
- You stopped being part of the force.
- What do I do?

261
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,880
We will make available to you
psychological counseling...

262
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,869
...at the city's expense,
as part of your severance.

263
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,230
You have no idea what is going on
in this city.

264
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,589
Is this where you start
talking about monsters?

265
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,809
We'll need your gun and your badge.

266
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,470
I'm glad your father's
not here to see this.

267
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,859
You Denver?

268
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,910
I don't believe it.

269
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,269
You know, you changed
my life that day.

270
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,880
A vampire comes into my place...

271
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,089
...looking to kill a demon
to save human beings?

272
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,220
If that can happen,
there must be good in the world.

273
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,339
You've never heard of
Home Office?

274
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,599
How'd that go? It was a Thesulac.
Paranoia demon, if I recall.

275
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,490
I don't know.
I think it killed everyone there.

276
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,690
The point is, you tried.

277
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,710
I walked out and let him have
the place and everyone in it.

278
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,410
We don't know where
the Home Office is...

279
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,079
...but you think the senior partner
is a Kleynach demon?

280
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,150
Right. Kleynach.

281
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,509
Many dark entities use the form
of a Kleynach to manifest.

282
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,480
A Kleynach doesn't have to
rely on being conjured.

283
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,369
They can come and go with that ring.

284
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,509
- Tell me about the ring.
- The Band of Blacknil.

285
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,829
Simple thing. Plain.
You wouldn't notice it in a pawn shop.

286
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,690
But it's used to move
between the dimensions.

287
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,410
And that's what it'll use to get here.
And get back.

288
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,750
- Get back?
- Well, sure.

289
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,789
- Can anyone use the ring?
- Say again?

290
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,680
Will it take me back
to the Home Office?

291
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:48,569
Might. If you're insane.

292
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,920
You realize what this
Home Office probably is?

293
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,680
- I think I have an idea.
- Hell.

294
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:58,309
Why the heck do you
want to go to Hell?

295
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,809
You're gonna go down there and
destroy the whole lot of them!

296
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,769
That'd certainly make up
for the time that you--

297
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,109
Still, not a terrific idea.
Suicide, really.

298
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,420
- Will the ring get me there?
- You gotta get it first.

299
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,609
To get the ring, you gotta
kill the Kleynach.

300
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:20,809
How?

301
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,910
I'm the one guy who can tell you.

302
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,039
How?

303
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,640
To kill the Kleynach
and get the ring...

304
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,819
- ...you need the glove.
- You're making this up.

305
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,380
Legend says the Kleynach rose
from their demon world...

306
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,630
...raped and pillaged
the villages of man.

307
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,460
All who fought them
were incinerated...

308
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:46,029
...whether they struck
with fist or sword.

309
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,160
But one brave and worthy knight,
he had a glove...

310
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,390
...fashioned and blessed
by all the Powers of Light.

311
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:59,890
Whoever wore the glove could kill the
Kleynach by grabbing it at the throat.

312
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:05,220
Picked it up in '75 at a yard sale in
Covina. Been using it as an oven mitt.

313
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,089
And now I give it to you. No charge.

314
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,230
Because the truth is,
you did change my life.

315
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,759
And I got a feeling this time,
things are gonna go--

316
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:17,519
Better.

317
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,970
That's right, Angelus.
Go towards the bleeding mortal.

318
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,259
Because that's smart.

319
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,170
The ring's not about
vengeance, Angelus.

320
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,890
It's about power.

321
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,150
We'll get to the vengeance part soon.

322
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,349
I stood up to him.
That's the important thing.

323
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,710
You couldn't do it metaphorically?

324
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:05,619
With a stern word?

325
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:10,410
You had to do it in the "I'm standing
Up now and popping 6 stitches" way?

326
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,339
Before all this happened
I never really considered...

327
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,140
...how dangerous your work was.

328
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:21,460
Of course it's dangerous.
Remember how we met?

329
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,200
You were strapped to an altar...

330
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:27,880
...while the goddess Yeskah was
called forth to consume you.

331
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,390
But I grew up with that sort of stuff.

332
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,700
Creepy-crawlies and scary monsters
I can handle.

333
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,920
But guns?

334
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,660
Kind of makes it all
a little too real.

335
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:45,069
The gun was fired by a zombie,
if it makes you feel better.

336
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,009
You know, strangely, it doesn't.

337
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,490
Ooh.

338
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,480
Does it always seem like
it's a battle worth fighting?

339
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,759
Some less than others.

340
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,759
Collectively, I mean.

341
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,920
Most people don't even acknowledge
the evil, let alone fight it.

342
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,809
They don't have to use bandages to
keep their insides from falling out.

343
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,730
That's true.

344
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,210
I don't suppose you'd ever consider
maybe giving it up...

345
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,089
...for something else?

346
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,259
Could you be with someone who would?

347
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,759
I don't know.

348
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:48,210
Sometimes I feel like
I should be wrapped in bandages...

349
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,920
...to keep my insides
from falling out.

350
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,150
This is difficult for you, isn't it?

351
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,589
- I just don't like to see you hurt.
- No.

352
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,250
I mean breaking up with me.

353
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,500
You two stick close.

354
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,250
Crap! I knew you guys were
a waste of money.

355
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,930
You're not parking in the
underground lot anymore.

356
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,140
It's not safe.
What do you want?

357
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,579
I want the same thing from you
that I took from Lindsey.

358
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,059
- Hello, Ms, Morgan, Which floor?
- Fifteen.

359
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,759
You'll lead security all over
the moment you step inside.

360
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,240
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

361
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,130
Good evening.

362
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,759
Angphlmn Investigations. We help
the helpless. How can we help you?

363
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,990
What is "Angphlmn"?

364
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,809
There are some names
I'm not saying at the moment.

365
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,160
What is it, Wesley?

366
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,000
I just....
I'm not really feeling that great.

367
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,769
Oh, well, your guts opened up.

368
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,690
- Maybe I won't come in tomorrow.
- That's okay,

369
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:52,359
It's not like they're beating down
the door. Stay home.

370
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,119
Spend time with Virginia,

371
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,519
Yes.

372
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,730
And you, you should get out yourself.

373
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,940
You're young, single,
It's a Friday night...

374
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,539
...in the City of "Angphlmns."

375
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:12,369
- There must be someone you can call,
- No, then I'd have friends.

376
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,819
I don't.

377
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,119
That's not true.

378
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,730
You don't count.

379
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,099
Thank you.

380
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,640
You know what I mean,

381
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,759
Things are going to get better,
Cordelia. For all of us.

382
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,819
You'll see,

383
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,220
I'll call you tomorrow.
See how you're feeling.

384
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:42,769
That'd be nice.

385
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,329
- Good night, Wesley,
- Good night.

386
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,490
Oh, jeez, Wesley,
lip-a-dee doo-dah, all right?

387
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,779
- Hello?
- Ms. Chase?

388
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,440
Oh. Mrs. Sharp!

389
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,299
We were hoping you'd still be
in the office.

390
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:07,890
The back of your daughter's head
is still okay, right?

391
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,369
We don't offer a money-back guarantee.
But you never paid, did you?

392
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,099
You do? Right now?

393
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:17,220
No, that's great!

394
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,670
You're on my way home,
give or take 30 miles.

395
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,809
Personal check?

396
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,339
Normally not, but fine.

397
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,990
Will you give me the address again?

398
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,740
Okay, great. I'll see you soon.

399
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,990
One of them is on their way here now.

400
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,720
I don't see your co-vice president.
It doesn't look good.

401
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,809
Yes, sir.

402
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,690
Well, find it. Deal with it.

403
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:21,619
Is there a problem?

404
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,759
Someone just let a vampire
onto this floor.

405
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,769
There!

406
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:46,789
Security!

407
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:08,619
Vampire!

408
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,069
Stake the bitch.

409
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,130
Okay.

410
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,000
Home Office.

411
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:29,769
Let's finish this.

412
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,170
Congratulations. Great victory.

413
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,880
- You're--
- Holland Manners.

414
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,970
Not alive.

415
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,299
Oh, no. I'm quite dead.

416
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,369
Unfortunately my contract with Wolfram
& Hart extends well beyond that.

417
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,970
Hop on in. You've certainly earned it.

418
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,500
No, not a ghost either.

419
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,579
It's just me. Dead me. See?

420
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,809
Home Office, wasn't it?

421
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,900
I should mention the trip is one-way.

422
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:46,369
If there are no objections, I suggest
we get going. It's a long ride.

423
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,519
This is exciting, isn't it?
Going straight to the source.

424
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,039
So, what's the big plan, Angel?

425
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,579
Destroy the senior partners?

426
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,420
- Smash Wolfram & Hart forever?
- Something like that.

427
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,769
Just what do you imagine that will
accomplish? In the end, I mean?

428
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,409
- It'll be the end.
- The end of you, certainly.

429
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,710
But I meant in the larger sense.

430
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,480
In the larger sense,
I really don't give a crap.

431
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,030
Now, I don't think that's true.

432
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,530
Be honest.

433
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:37,480
You've got a tiny bit
of "give a crap" left...

434
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,769
...or you wouldn't be on this mission.

435
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,659
Now, there was something
in a sacred prophecy.

436
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,030
Some oblique reference to you.

437
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,480
Something you're supposed to prevent.
What was that?

438
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,099
- The Apocalypse.
- Yes, the Apocalypse, of course.

439
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,159
Another one of those.

440
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:59,820
Well, it's true,
we do have one scheduled.

441
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,909
If you were to prevent it,
you'd save many people.

442
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,889
You should do that, then.
Absolutely. I wasn't thinking.

443
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,440
Those people you save from that
Apocalypse would await the next one.

444
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,639
But, hey, it's always something,
isn't it?

445
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:23,969
You're not gonna win.

446
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:29,400
Well, no, of course we aren't.

447
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,050
We have no intention of doing anything
so prosa;c as w;nn;ng.

448
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,900
- Then why?
- I'm sorry. Why what?

449
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,880
Why fight?

450
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,820
That's the question
you should be asking yourself.

451
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,019
For us, there is no fight.
Winning doesn't enter into it.

452
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,610
We go on, no matter what.

453
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,670
Our firm has always been here,
in one form or another.

454
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,159
Inquisition. Khmer Rouge.

455
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:08,360
We were there when the first
caveman clubbed his neighbor.

456
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,860
We're in the hearts and minds
of every living being.

457
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,179
And that, friend...

458
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,110
...is making things
difficult for you.

459
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,489
The world doesn't work
in spite of evil, Angel.

460
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,039
It works with us.

461
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,820
It works because of us.

462
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,340
Welcome to the Home Office.

463
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,099
This isn't....

464
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,820
Well, you know it is.

465
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,360
You know that better than anyone.

466
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:53,289
The things you've seen.
The things you've, well, done.

467
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:00,250
If there wasn't evil
in all of them out there...

468
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:03,280
...why, they wouldn't be people.

469
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:07,730
They'd all be angels.

470
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,289
Have a nice day.

471
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,329
You've reached Angel
Investigations, We help the hopeless,

472
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,250
leave a message and we'll get
right back to you,

473
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,739
You did it, didn't you, you bastard?

474
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,030
You made me trust you.

475
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,659
You made me believe.

476
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,400
No, it wasn't you.

477
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,349
It was me, right?

478
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,360
I couldn't take the heat.

479
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:03,139
That's what they're gonna say,

480
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,989
And you're gonna feel all bad,
or you won 't care,

481
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,820
But I won't care either,

482
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,460
I won't feel a thing,

483
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,559
What do you want, Darla?

484
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,750
You want this?

485
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,869
Or maybe what you really want is this.

486
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,949
Maybe what you really want...

487
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,719
...is this.

488
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,719
Don't play games with me.

489
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,119
I'm not playing. I just wanna feel
something besides the cold.

490
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,099
Why are you laughing?

491
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,280
Don't you feel the cold?

492
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,250
What are you doing?

493
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,159
It doesn't matter.

494
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,599
None of it matters.

495
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,550
Thank you,
