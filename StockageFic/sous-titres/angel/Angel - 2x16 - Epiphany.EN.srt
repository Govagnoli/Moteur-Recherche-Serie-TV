1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,120
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,219
These people were threatened
at their offices...

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,800
...by an intruder who was released
right before they were murdered.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,990
- We're not judging you.
- You're firing me.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,870
How do you feel?

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:21,539
- Stronger.
- You're getting stronger every day.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,910
Do you love her?
Is that it?

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,719
Wesley doesn't need you.
We don't need you.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,320
- We hoped you'd be in the office.
- Mrs. Sharp.

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,899
One of them is on their way here.

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,159
- The ring?
- The Band of Blacknil.

12
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,679
The Kleynach use it to move
between dimensions.

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,700
Will it get me to the Home Office?

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,399
You realize this Home Office
is probably Hell.

15
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,450
Why do you wanna go to Hell?

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,950
Welcome to the Home Office.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,859
The world doesn't work in spite
of evil. It works with us.

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,020
It works because of us.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,479
What do you want, Darla? This?

20
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,430
Oh, God.

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,129
Don't fight it, my love.

22
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,579
Just let it happen.
It'll only hurt for a minute.

23
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,409
Oh, God. Oh, God.

24
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,569
Yes, I know. It was
the same for me.

25
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,349
The soul is gone, but
it leaves a bitterness.

26
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,860
It'll pass.

27
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,189
You need a fresh kill. Hot human blood
will wash away the foul memory of it.

28
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,710
I promise.

29
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,139
What?

30
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,849
What is it?

31
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,460
You saved me.

32
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,289
Yes. But I was going
to kill you tonight.

33
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,060
Take you out of this world
the way I brought you in.

34
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,000
But I didn't have to.

35
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,979
You gave yourself over
so completely, Angelus.

36
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,729
I felt you surrender.

37
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,039
I gave you everything I had left.

38
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,939
Yes.

39
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,110
I'm so sorry.

40
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,149
You don't have to be.

41
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,740
But I am.

42
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,920
I am sorry.

43
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,069
- What?
- I'm sorry, Darla.

44
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,569
- No.
- You saved me.

45
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,230
- Sorry I couldn't do the same.
- Let go of me.

46
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,500
You still have a soul.

47
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,810
- But we....
- Yeah.

48
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,810
And you....

49
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,000
I know.

50
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,930
- Then I....
- Three times.

51
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,740
You're not evil.

52
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,879
I don't understand.
Was I...?

53
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,339
Was it not good?

54
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,170
I don't accept that. You cannot
tell me that wasn't perfect.

55
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,180
I've been around 400 years. I've done
this professionally. That was perfect.

56
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,750
- We'll go again.
- No, no.

57
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,800
We can't.

58
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,089
You know we can't.

59
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,569
- We're finished.
- Finished? Why?

60
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,569
Because you suddenly decide?

61
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,199
An hour ago you wanted this!
You weren't tricked!

62
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,180
- I didn't seduce you! You wanted this!
- Yeah, and it was perfect.

63
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,199
It was perfect despair.

64
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,259
And you were the reason.
You've always been the reason.

65
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,829
You were the thing
that made me what I am.

66
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,040
I thought that
if I could save you...

67
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,379
...I'd somehow save myself,
but I was wrong.

68
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,470
- When I failed--
- Stop it!

69
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,660
When I failed, you saved me.
I have to thank you for that.

70
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,670
There's nothing I can do for you now.
I can't even hate you.

71
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,560
You knew this would happen.
You made me trust you!

72
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,699
You made me believe!

73
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,069
We're done. Let yourself out.

74
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,139
Where are you going?

75
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,569
You did me a favor tonight.
Now I'll do one for you.

76
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,329
Get dressed and get out...

77
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,240
...because next time I see you,
I'll have to kill you.

78
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,579
Kate! Kate!

79
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,779
Kate, open the door! Kate!

80
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,990
Kate.

81
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,490
Thanks.

82
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,310
Now get out.

83
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,319
Darla...

84
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:23,500
...I've been calling all night.
Why haven't you answered?

85
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,980
Get away from the window.
It's not safe.

86
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,070
They called an emergency meeting
tonight after what happened.

87
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,649
The official order on you
is to stake on sight.

88
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:56,039
You should've told me your plan.
I would've talked you out of it.

89
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,480
Helped you. I don't know.

90
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,250
Things are getting complicated for us.

91
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,019
Yes. Yes, I believe they are.

92
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,350
We should clear your stuff out.

93
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,879
Move it in my bedroom.
I just think it'd be best for us....

94
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,240
Darla, what's wrong? What is this?

95
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,879
Where'd you get this?

96
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,779
What's the difference?
It doesn't work.

97
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,779
Of course not. After Angel stole it,
there was a disenchanting ceremony.

98
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,509
How did you get this?

99
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,320
It was my payment.

100
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:52,580
Your payment?
What are you talking about?

101
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,620
- What do you think?
- I don't know!

102
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,409
What happened?

103
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,899
Nothing. Nothing happened.

104
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,450
- My God, nothing at all.
- Tell me. I have to know.

105
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,110
You want details?
Is that what you want?

106
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,980
Yes, I want details.

107
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,610
I need to know everything. All of it.

108
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,940
What did he do to you?

109
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,379
All right! All right, already.

110
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,139
I'm not deaf, you know.
Jeez, keep your pants on!

111
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,850
I see we're a little late
with that advice.

112
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,960
Probably should've killed her.

113
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,350
Kill her, give her cab fare. Whatever.

114
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,779
The point is, you've turned a corner.
Yeah, you. Zuzu's petals.

115
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,120
It's about time.

116
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,029
If it had taken you much longer to
hit your bottom, I was gonna kick it.

117
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,710
- I don't understand what happened.
- What?

118
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,679
You're not the first guy who saw
what was lying next to him and went--

119
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,259
You're not, believe me.

120
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:46,600
It's called a moment of clarity,
my lamb, and you've just had one.

121
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,289
Sort of appalling to see
where you've gotten yourself.

122
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,399
- How do I get back?
- That's the thing.

123
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,419
You don't. You go on to
the new place, whatever that is.

124
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,980
I don't know if I can.

125
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,690
I've done things.

126
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,559
Questionable things.

127
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes, you have. But you
didn't kill those lawyers.

128
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,590
That was slated to happen.

129
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,070
The Powers tried to work it
so it'd be without you.

130
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,659
You weren't much help.

131
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,830
If they wanted me to stay away,
why not tell me?

132
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,340
Would you listen? And what
makes you think they didn't?

133
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,490
Over and over and,
as for example, over?

134
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,210
They could've been more specific.

135
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,090
Isn't this the 'tude
that got you here?

136
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:53,379
If you're gonna switch back to
brood mode, we'd rather have you evil.

137
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,330
Then, at least, leather pants.

138
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,519
What now?

139
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:04,919
- What do you mean?
- What do the Powers want me to do?

140
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,580
Am I hearing voices? No, I'm not.

141
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,730
I was never your link with the Powers.

142
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,799
You lost that when
you fired your crew.

143
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,679
That's gonna be the
hardest part of this.

144
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,980
- Yeah.
- And there's a good chance...

145
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,059
...you can't put this back together.

146
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,259
It just....

147
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,909
- It depends, really.
- Whether they'll even talk to me.

148
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,070
No, it depends on whether
they live through the night.

149
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,649
And I gotta tell you, at the
moment, the odds? Not good.

150
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,330
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

151
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,740
Good night.

152
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,830
Hello?

153
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,870
Mrs. Sharp?

154
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,889
Anybody home?

155
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,649
Cordelia Chase here.

156
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,419
If you haven't gone to bed already....

157
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,289
Took me a little longer to
get here than I expected.

158
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,240
Hope you're still paying your bill.

159
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,980
Which I just happened to
bring with me.

160
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:42,870
Hello?

161
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,259
Well, that was helpful!

162
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,960
Human!

163
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,519
Destroyer of our spawn.

164
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,169
Destroyer of your...?

165
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,870
- Have we met?
- The others. Make them come to us.

166
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,500
- What others?
- Three are responsible. Three must pay.

167
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,809
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

168
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,659
I haven't destroyed
anyone's spawn. Promise.

169
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,009
Hey, you have a third eye
in the back of your head...

170
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:16,649
...just like that
little girl did before...

171
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:22,179
- ...we destroyed your spawn.
- We've located the wheeled one.

172
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,980
Where's the other?

173
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,559
The wheeled one?

174
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,970
- Angel!
- Invite me in. I haven't been here.

175
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,559
- Invite me in.
- If you'd shown interest....

176
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,230
Wesley.

177
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,130
Absolutely. I invite you in.
In, I invite you!

178
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,339
- What are they?
- The third eye indicates Skilosh.

179
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:27,380
It's the first time
I've had occasion to--

180
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,309
- How do I kill them?
- There are many ways.

181
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,549
- Wesley!
- Right, yes.

182
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,559
Hack it to pieces!

183
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,160
I think I got it.

184
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,180
I only pray Mrs. Starns isn't at home.

185
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,250
What are you doing here?

186
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,859
- She's not picking up.
- She wasn't at home before, either.

187
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,180
I stopped by before
I went to your place.

188
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,609
Did you? Just keep going straight.

189
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,440
So I guess you're probably
wondering why I'm back.

190
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,690
Hadn't occurred to me.
Take a right turn.

191
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,279
- I know how to get to your offices.
- Yes, you did pop by.

192
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,079
Stole a book.

193
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,240
- I'll avoid the bumps.
- I'd appreciate that.

194
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,910
Actually, it's kind of funny.
I recently got a gut wound myself.

195
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:44,240
Not a gunshot like you got there...

196
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,660
...but it was kind of...

197
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,059
...an antique sword, is what it was.

198
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,049
It went deep.

199
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,930
Yes, it did.

200
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,430
- Hey, guess who stabbed me?
- Darla.

201
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,049
Yeah.

202
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,759
Actually, kind of a funny story.
The reason I had this epiphany.

203
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,049
- Tell me about these Skilosh demons.
- Very well.

204
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:26,230
A family contracted us at Angel
Investigations to investigate...

205
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,910
...a third eye on the back
of their daughter's head.

206
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,700
Oh, really?
You kept the name?

207
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,650
Pardon?

208
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,160
You kept the name,
"Angel Investigations."

209
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,769
We're gonna change it.

210
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,039
- Go on.
- I diagnosed the girl's condition...

211
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,650
...as "infection by a Skilosh."

212
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,670
- With your books.
- Yes.

213
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,390
You were always so good with
your books. Made it look so easy.

214
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,900
You know, it isn't.

215
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,259
Skilosh: a violent, asexual,
self-replicating species of demon.

216
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,589
Has the habit of injecting its demon
spawn into the skull of a human host.

217
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,019
A key diagnostic symptom is the third
eye in the back of the host's head.

218
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,289
If this condition is not arrested...

219
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,049
...a newborn Skilosh will erupt
from the skull of its human host.

220
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:25,740
- But you guys saved the little girl?
- Yes, we did.

221
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,630
You did a good thing.

222
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,470
Thank you.

223
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,140
You're welcome.

224
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,480
"Hey, look behind you!" is
really not gonna work, is it?

225
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,890
Two more have been destroyed.

226
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,430
What?

227
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,250
Oh, no!
Wesley, Gunn! You killed them?

228
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,619
You horrible, ugly, three-eyed--

229
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:11,930
Three must pay.

230
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,740
Oh, two of you have
been destroyed. Okay.

231
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,890
Oh, that's bad.

232
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,289
- I'm sorry?
- More must rise.

233
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,000
No. Hey, hey, wait a sec! Guys!

234
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,200
- More must rise.
- No! No more must rise, honest!

235
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:37,890
I've been impregnated by demon spawn
before. Didn't really work out.

236
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,480
Oh, God. Please don't
do this. Please, no!

237
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:50,630
Let go! Don't! Please!

238
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,380
No! Let go!

239
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,220
She's not here.

240
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:25,970
That doesn't bode well.

241
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,349
That truck's passed three times.

242
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,799
- Maybe she's out on a date.
- That's unlikely.

243
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,450
- It's Friday night.
- So?

244
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,079
We are talking about the same
Cordelia Chase, right?

245
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:41,960
Correct.

246
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,940
- Knowing her--
- But you don't.

247
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,339
You don't know her at all.
For months now, you haven't cared to.

248
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,369
Otherwise, you'd have realized
Cordelia has become very solitary.

249
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:56,210
She's not the vain, carefree
creature she once was.

250
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,569
Well, certainly not carefree.

251
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,440
It's the visions. The visions
that were meant to guide you.

252
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,599
You could turn away from them.
She doesn't have that luxury.

253
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:12,700
She experiences this city's pain,
and because of who she is...

254
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,910
...she's compelled to do
something about it.

255
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,029
It's left her little time
for anything else.

256
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,440
You'd have known that,
if your head wasn't up your...

257
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,579
...place that isn't
on top of your neck.

258
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,200
We have to find her.

259
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:38,069
We agree on that.
She could be in grave danger.

260
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,619
And even if she's not....

261
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,180
- Something's coming.
- Turn off the lights.

262
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,180
The Skilosh may have followed us.

263
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:13,369
Gunn!

264
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,210
- What are you doing here?
- Passing by. Saw the lights on.

265
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:20,849
- Besides, I work here.
- I thought you'd gone.

266
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,240
Yeah, but that don't mean
I wasn't coming back.

267
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,559
Did you think I'd
abandon you like this guy?

268
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,180
- No, certainly not.
- English, you know you my man.

269
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,009
I see you guys have bonded.

270
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,039
- We fight together.
- Hip to shoulder.

271
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,150
- He took a bullet for me.
- It was nothing.

272
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,410
- What's he doing here?
- Saw the host at Caritas.

273
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,230
He said my friends were in danger.

274
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,410
- What's he doing here?
- He had an epiphany.

275
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,009
- Why are you hiding?
- There was a demon attack at my home.

276
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,000
- I saved him.
- We were followed.

277
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,730
- Demon attack?
- Skilosh.

278
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,009
- I thought we got rid of that.
- We did.

279
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,759
That's why we're targeted
for retribution.

280
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,200
- Where's Cordy?
- We don't know.

281
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,839
- You checked her pad?
- I stopped by.

282
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,069
You enjoying your visit to 1973?
I meant her message pad.

283
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,359
Oh, right, yeah. That's a good idea.

284
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,190
Use this to rub the impression
of the last thing she wrote.

285
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,829
- Or we could just read the carbon.
- Or that.

286
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,039
- Directions.
- Let me see.

287
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,740
That's the Sharps' address, the
family whose daughter we treated.

288
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,029
She wrote that tonight.
You think she went there?

289
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,109
- She took the original.
- What'll they do?

290
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,339
I hate to imagine. We must prepare.
Get the de-oculation powder.

291
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,789
Guys. Guys?

292
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,980
Would she go there in the middle of
the night without calling you?

293
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,160
- They owe us money.
- Let's go.

294
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:29,460
Oh, God, you're still here.

295
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:32,529
You're not leaving, are you?

296
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,000
And no one's coming for me.
No one's expecting me anyplace.

297
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,470
No one's gonna miss me.

298
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,859
And how come I can see you?

299
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,359
Oh, no.

300
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,099
Oh, no!

301
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:26,980
- What is it?
- I don't know.

302
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:29,700
Nothing, I guess.

303
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,259
So you had an epiphany, did you?

304
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,740
Yeah.

305
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,700
What, you just wake up and bang?

306
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,660
It was sort of the other way around.

307
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:46,920
That's good you can have those.
Right, Wes?

308
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,799
Epiphanies, they're handy.
When will you have another?

309
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,069
- Gunn--
- No, I'm interested.

310
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:56,410
They can strike any time.
Next time you see a lawyer...

311
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,809
...you'll get epiphanied off at them.

312
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,779
- No.
- No? You don't think so?

313
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,079
Hope you don't have one
before we find Cordelia...

314
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:13,990
...because if something happens to
her, I might just have an epiphany.

315
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,420
- You okay?
- Yes.

316
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,049
Angel?

317
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,880
We should probably go.

318
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,349
Yo, Angel.

319
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,500
- You guys go ahead.
- What?

320
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,170
If I don't stop them,
they'll flank us at the house.

321
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,569
Then I'll meet you there.

322
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,839
I'll be there. Just get to Cordelia.

323
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,890
- Thank you. What do you see?
- She's in there.

324
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:49,700
- Is she--?
- She's alive.

325
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,160
- You sure?
- Yeah, her eyes are open.

326
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,480
- All three of them.
- Oh, dear.

327
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,990
- Wait. Three more.
- Eyes?

328
00:31:58,529 --> 00:31:59,720
Demons.

329
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:04,259
The tribe's gathering. Gestation is
almost done. We have little time.

330
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,289
Where is he?

331
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,890
That's gotta hurt.

332
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:34,579
It'll hurt more when the thing
gestating inside her hatches.

333
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,430
Stop saying "gestating."
How long we gonna wait for Angel?

334
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,559
- We're not.
- Good.

335
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,319
- Why wait?
- We shouldn't.

336
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,960
- We've done fine without him.
- Yes.

337
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:48,559
- He orders us to wait and we do it?
- Hell, no.

338
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,819
- He may have changed his mind.
- True.

339
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,660
We're not going to sit idly by.
We're going in there...

340
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,730
...and we're saving our friend.

341
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,849
I say, let's do this.

342
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:02,470
- One thing.
- What?

343
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm toppling over.

344
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,319
You're gonna tell me everything.

345
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:29,359
Everything you did with her.

346
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:33,250
All of it.

347
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,390
You're gonna tell me.

348
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,619
- Why?
- Because I wanna hear it from you.

349
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,170
Tell me!

350
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,539
Tell me!

351
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:56,690
Tell me!

352
00:33:58,529 --> 00:33:59,690
No.

353
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,340
I'm sorry, Lindsey.

354
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,360
I really am.

355
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,159
I'm sorry she'll never love you.

356
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:29,789
I'm sorry you have to live with that.

357
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,719
That I didn't try harder to help you.

358
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,030
That you made the wrong choice.

359
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,539
Could've been the other one.
Be glad I had an epiphany.

360
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,750
Mind if I borrow your truck?

361
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:06,429
Gunn!

362
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,159
Wesley!

363
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,280
- We came to rescue you.
- I knew you would.

364
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,010
But they caught us
coming in the back door.

365
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,570
Thank you.

366
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,170
More must rise.

367
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:38,289
- This gonna hurt?
- A lot.

368
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,320
Angel, hi.

369
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,329
Hi.

370
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,380
You okay?

371
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:44,929
No.

372
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:48,809
- You're not?
- No.

373
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,320
You really hurt my feelings.

374
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,329
Darla?

375
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,449
I feel like such an idiot.

376
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,849
A lot of that going around.

377
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,900
I just couldn't....

378
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,800
My whole life has been
about being a cop.

379
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:03,719
If I'm not part of the force,
nothing I do means anything.

380
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,539
- It doesn't.
- Doesn't what?

381
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,019
Mean anything. In the greater
scheme, in the big picture...

382
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,079
...nothing we do matters.

383
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,849
There's no grand plan, no big win.

384
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:20,829
- You seem chipper about that.
- I guess I kind of worked it out.

385
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,940
If there's no great glorious end to
all this, if nothing we do matters...

386
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,650
...then all that matters
is what we do.

387
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:35,300
Because that's all there is.
What we do. Now, today.

388
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:41,230
I fought for so long for
redemption, for a reward...

389
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,139
...and finally just to beat the
other guy. But I never got it.

390
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,199
- Now you do?
- Not all of it.

391
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,090
All I wanna do is help.
I wanna help...

392
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,980
...because people shouldn't
suffer as they do.

393
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,110
Because if there's
no bigger meaning...

394
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:05,510
...then the smallest act of kindness
is the greatest thing in the world.

395
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:12,179
- You've had an epiphany.
- I say that, but nobody's listening.

396
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,880
I'm pretty much convinced,
since I'm alive to be convinced.

397
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,170
- You don't have to be a cop to--
- I'm okay.

398
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,590
I'm not headed for
another pill-a-thon.

399
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,409
I'm very grateful.

400
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,889
I never thought you'd
come for me, but...

401
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,900
...I got cut a huge break,
and I believe....

402
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,969
I don't know what I believe, but...

403
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,500
...I have faith.

404
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,820
I think maybe we're not alone in this.

405
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,289
Why?

406
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,599
Because I never invited you in.

407
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,500
Angel Investigations. We help
the helpless. How can we...

408
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,800
...help you?

409
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,519
The check is in the mail.

410
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:28,179
I'm sorry.

411
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,429
Before you say any more...

412
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,670
...we've discussed it,
and we're not ready--

413
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,829
It's okay, Wesley. I don't want
you to come back and work for me.

414
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,219
Oh. I see.

415
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,610
I wanna work for you.

416
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,309
You wanna work for us?

417
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,889
Yeah, I do.

418
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,369
Why?

419
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,260
Because I think I can help.

420
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,579
How do we know we can trust you?

421
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,780
I guess I'll just have to earn that.

422
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,510
No.

423
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,800
No.

424
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,130
No!

425
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:39,380
The usual big scary, rising up in
a housing project in Topanga.

426
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,329
Why am I not on the floor this time?

427
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,309
I've got you.

428
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,920
Maybe he should drive?

429
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,800
Let's go.

430
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,079
Thank you,
