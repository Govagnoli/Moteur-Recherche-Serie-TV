1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,399
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,849
Angel's feelings are the
only ones I care about.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,179
I got dosed with demon DNA
for that man.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,449
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,179
- Daniel!
- It's the Quor-toth.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,210
Hi, Dad.

7
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,129
- You're not alone.
- I know.

8
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,089
- You stole my son.
- I kept your son alive.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,059
- What will he do?
- Angel will deal with Holtz.

10
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,539
- I can't.
- You said you'd do anything for me.

11
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,649
Hi.

12
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,630
What you got there?

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,850
I know you have grave concern for
Angel's welfare, so I made Mock-na.

14
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,739
Oh, Mock-na. Which is...?

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,700
A soothing brew to relieve tension.

16
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:17,010
- Kind of looks like muddy water.
- Yes. The mud gives it body and flavor.

17
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,930
There's no plock-weed
in this dimension...

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,319
...so I made do with
creeping fig and sour grass.

19
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,810
Though it is not true Mock-na,
it is very close.

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,459
So it's mock Mock-na.

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,849
Please.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,120
Well, that's....

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,879
I can feel the tension draining. And a
little sediment going down the wrong--

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,129
Tasty.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,989
Might I relieve you by gently and then
more rapidly rubbing your schlug-tee?

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,859
I don't really....

27
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,390
Maybe later, at home.

28
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,629
I don't feel comfortable
doing it in the office, Groo.

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,000
Doing it?

30
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,219
- Sex.
- You wish to have sex?

31
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,199
What? No! Sh!

32
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,060
I was proposing a massage of your
schlug-tee, your tense neck muscle.

33
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,860
But it is always an honor
to make sex with you.

34
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,219
Later, at home.
I understand perfectly.

35
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,770
Angel.

36
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,419
Is not who I am, princess.

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,789
I know. He's back.

38
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,069
You didn't happen to hear?

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,629
- Hear what?
- Good. So how did it go?

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,530
- I found Holtz.
- And?

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,300
I didn't kill him.

42
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:03,569
Maybe you're growing as a person.
What did you do?

43
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,719
- We talked.
- About Connor-- Steven.

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,729
Yeah. Did he come home?

45
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,430
No, he's still out with Gunn and Fred.
You said "home."

46
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,919
It's a long story,
but Holtz wants what's best for him.

47
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,629
And what's best for him
is living here with us?

48
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,550
That's great! Oh, my God,
I'm so happy for you.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,469
Yes, it is a happy time.

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,229
This didn't have to happen.
Your father was gonna leave.

51
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,090
- He just wanted to talk to Angelus.
- Leave?

52
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,610
Angelus won.
He could've just walked away.

53
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,800
It's my fault.

54
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:01,030
- He'll pay.
- I'll help you kill him.

55
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,389
No.

56
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,539
You don't want to kill him?
After what he did?

57
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,860
What do you want to do?

58
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,240
This one might work better.

59
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,339
He'd have southern exposure.
Not too close to my room.

60
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,699
I don't want him to
feel like I'm hovering.

61
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,939
But not too far.
I want to keep an eye.

62
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,439
What do you think?

63
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,350
I think it's just as good as
the last five we looked at.

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,949
It's not about the room,
it's about Connor--

65
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,920
I can't get used to calling him Steven.

66
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,279
Neither can I. It's what Holtz--

67
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,620
It's what he wants to go by.

68
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,850
Okay, Steven, Connor, whatever.

69
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,689
It's about your son living here,
getting to know his father.

70
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,199
I don't even own a TV.

71
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,839
He'll want to watch TV. Not too much.
After homework and chores.

72
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,459
He'll need clothes, weekly allowance.

73
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,269
- What's good? 50 cents? A dollar?
- Yeah...

74
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,060
- ...if you're Tom Sawyer painting a fence.
- See? I'm so out of touch.

75
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,910
He's gonna hate me.

76
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,800
No, he's not. He's gonna love you.

77
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,149
How do you know?

78
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,230
Because you're you.

79
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,060
- Me. A vampire.
- You. A vampire.

80
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,199
Who drinks blood, stays in shadows
and is older than all his friends combined.

81
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,930
You're all those things, plus cheap.

82
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,610
But none of that matters.

83
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,370
Why not?

84
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:48,019
Because you have the biggest and best
heart of anyone I have ever known.

85
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,970
He's a smart kid. He'll figure it out.

86
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,870
It's gonna be all right.

87
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,379
- You're really--
- Aren't I?

88
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,720
Feeling better, or do you
need to keep looking at rooms?

89
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,209
Both.

90
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,569
- He can have mine.
- What do you mean?

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,639
Leaving.
On the midnight train to Georgia.

92
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,850
Actually, it's the 9:18 p.m. flight to
Vegas, but where's the poetry in that?

93
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,790
Is this because of Connor?

94
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,870
- Steven.
- This is because of me.

95
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,310
Buddy of mine's got a club,
and he needs a singer and a seer.

96
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,300
- What about rebuilding your club here?
- That's a great idea.

97
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,480
Except every time I do,
you all destroy it.

98
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,199
It was only...three times.

99
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,860
I got the big love here, and I'm
grateful, but it's time to move on.

100
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,310
- But some of this is because--
- The not-so-little nipper?

101
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,250
Not gonna lie. Kid's in the mix.

102
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,050
Clearly not loving the demon-kind.

103
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,360
I know it's his upbringing,
but I loved that baby.

104
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,160
I just wouldn't....

105
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,850
What?

106
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,660
Turn my back on him anytime soon.

107
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,009
No white cliffs?

108
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,850
Not in this neck of the woods. Sorry.

109
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,080
- Looks like where he came from, though.
- England?

110
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,750
Maybe it's like the ranch.

111
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,230
- The ranch?
- Where I was supposed to grow up.

112
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,250
In Utah.

113
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,399
He told you about that?

114
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,730
- That was our dream.
- He always told it. Before sleep.

115
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,159
Him and me,
where no one else could ever find us.

116
00:08:58,649 --> 00:08:59,769
Yeah.

117
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,789
We should-- We need to bury him.

118
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,509
No.

119
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,950
I'll do it.

120
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,789
No. He was bitten by the beast.

121
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,370
He may rise again.

122
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,149
You said you'd do anything for me.

123
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,830
I will do as you taught me.

124
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,639
I will cling to the good,
and I will lay waste to the evil.

125
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,659
Sleep now, Father.

126
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,710
And forgive me.

127
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,039
Mind if I join you?

128
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,889
On many levels
and with great intensity.

129
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,289
How's your throat?
You want a lozenge?

130
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:38,840
Life's something, huh?

131
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,720
One day you're pivotal in the battle.
Next thing you know, you're on your own.

132
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:51,419
No one even cares what you think
anymore. Well, I care.

133
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,809
You care?

134
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,049
As one human being to another.

135
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,409
Just kidding. I care that your
great, big brain is going to waste.

136
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,129
Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't Angel Jr.
without precedent in human history?

137
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,370
You're wrong.

138
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,080
Mesopotamian, Greek,
Hindi, Celtic myth, the Bible...

139
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:20,470
...even Darwin, all support the coming of
something that wasn't possible before.

140
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,820
Okay, the impossible is here.
But what does it mean?

141
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,379
Is it the herald of a new age,
better things to come...

142
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,759
...or the mass destruction
of everything we hold dear?

143
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,570
Yes.

144
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,820
Every child carries into the world the
possibility of salvation or slaughter.

145
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,250
And one born to two vampires
carries it in spades.

146
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,899
My people will root for slaughter.

147
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:49,740
And your people--
Sorry, your former people...

148
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,830
...they won't know what to do
if things turn sour.

149
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,240
No.

150
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,269
If the kid's the next Stalin, do you
kill him? You can't. He's Angel's son.

151
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,230
On the other hand, if you just
watch while he kills Angel...

152
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,850
...or somebody else,
that cute girl from Texas, say....

153
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,169
Wow. Times like this,
glad I don't have a conscience.

154
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,240
I think you should leave now.

155
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,250
What was it like when she cut you?

156
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,519
Are you terribly anxious to find out?

157
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,409
- Nobody's here.
- Good.

158
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,389
Bad. We gotta find Angel and tell him
we screwed up. I get your point.

159
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:58,129
- Where is everybody?
- I am here.

160
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,240
Cordelia and Angel are upstairs
trying out bedrooms.

161
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,389
For Angel's son.

162
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,519
I'm not telling a
16-year-old boy that.

163
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,629
He's gotta know the facts of life.

164
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,070
My record with the man-woman thing
isn't.... I don't wanna say "tragic farce."

165
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,799
- Why not? You're still telling him.
- You could help. He'll have questions.

166
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,700
Like, "What do you do
with a woman's schlug-tee?"

167
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,669
You and your vampire hearing.
Next time you eavesdrop, I'm gonna....

168
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,590
Easy there, sailor.
You use that kind of language at home?

169
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,250
Where is he?

170
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,289
- Uh....
- He ran away.

171
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,570
He overheard us say
you were going to Holtz.

172
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,269
- Then that's where he went.
- We were there. We didn't see them.

173
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,629
All he'll find is an empty room.
He won't know what's happened.

174
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,580
- What's happened?
- Holtz left. He wants Steven to live here.

175
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,320
That's good!

176
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,190
- As long as we tell him before--
- He is here.

177
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,230
How can you tell him before he's--?

178
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,320
Oh.

179
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,649
Hey. You all right?

180
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,850
I went to see my--

181
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,220
He wasn't there.

182
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,990
Yeah. I'm sorry. He's--

183
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,159
He left, Steven.

184
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,750
He gave me this letter for you.

185
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,509
He says my place is here now.

186
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,879
With you.

187
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,100
It wouldn't have to be forever.
Maybe just give it a try for a while.

188
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,960
Okay.

189
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,740
We'll give it a try.

190
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:47,879
It's me.

191
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,639
Can I come in?

192
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,899
Brought you a bookcase and some of my
favorite books when I was your age.

193
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:03,539
Want to get some breakfast?
Are you hungry?

194
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,480
Not really.

195
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,820
We can go out.

196
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,899
I'd have to wear a burka or something.

197
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,899
Hey, we'll stay in, hang out together.
Tonight, we'll do something special.

198
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,519
You ever been to a movie?

199
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,210
No.

200
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,340
We'll go to an action movie.
You'll love it.

201
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,529
Anything else you want to see or do,
just say the word.

202
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,669
There is one thing.

203
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,360
What?

204
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,350
I want to know how you do that.

205
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,879
Fight?

206
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,169
Yes.

207
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,570
- You got that down pretty good already.
- I want to learn...

208
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,710
...to be like you.

209
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,029
Well, there might be a thing or two
that I could show you.

210
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,980
Stake! Vampire!

211
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,700
Behind you. Civilian!

212
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,319
Protect her. Protect her!

213
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,230
Where's your balance, huh?

214
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,420
You lose it...

215
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,059
...you lose. Don't worry, I got you.

216
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,549
- You're doing good, kid. You got heart.
- I want to be the vampire.

217
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,940
- I wanna be in a hot tub.
- Who's gonna clean this stuff up?

218
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,660
Yeah, it's been a long day.

219
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,190
- Had enough?
- No. I want to learn.

220
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,089
Is this kid a chip off
the old block or what, huh?

221
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,359
- He's chippy.
- Hey, Cor...

222
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,970
- ...do you wanna go to the movies?
- Yeah!

223
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,230
I mean, I'd like to. I can't.
Groo and I are supposed to...

224
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,809
...have some one-on-one time, so....

225
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,059
Right. You should do that.

226
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,369
Okay. Vampire.

227
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,000
You're a vampire, you're not in Cats,

228
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,259
- Innocent bystander.
- By-sitter.

229
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,829
Close your eyes. Feel it.

230
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,940
Where's the attack gonna come from?

231
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,819
Good. Good!

232
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,200
Hi, honey.

233
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,230
It's me. And I got your favorites:
tuna and ice cream.

234
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,440
How about tonight you
try not mixing it together?

235
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:40,369
There you are. Wow, you look nice.

236
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,930
What's wrong?

237
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,240
I am.

238
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,369
Wrong. For you.

239
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:53,970
What?

240
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,869
I am not the one you love. He is.

241
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,019
He is? Who "he"?

242
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:03,880
Yo.

243
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,250
- Hey, Lorne. Come on in.
- Well, you're in a good mood.

244
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,539
Yeah. Taking the kid to the movies.
He's gonna love it.

245
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,710
No subtitles or dreary leitmotif,
all bloody action?

246
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,890
- You bet.
- He'll love you for it.

247
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:22,509
I thought I'd stop by
and say arrivederci, Angel-hair.

248
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,130
- You're really going.
- I'm really going.

249
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,140
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

250
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,420
Here. I got you something
to remember me by.

251
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,740
"Songs for the Love. Lorne."

252
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,609
I get it.

253
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,119
- "Lovelorn" because your name's Lorne.
- My publicist's idea.

254
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,269
Her name's mud now, but the tunes are
good. And that's not my real gift.

255
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,420
This is. It's mutual.

256
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,819
The way you feel about Cordelia is
how she feels about you.

257
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,089
I love Angel?
What are you talking about? I love...

258
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,470
...you know, us.

259
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,009
You two are so obviously connected.

260
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,869
- You finish each other's...
- ...sentences, you laugh at the same...

261
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,480
...jests.

262
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,829
When he grieves, when he is hurting....

263
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,059
Her heart breaks for you.

264
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,950
In my heart I've known the truth
for some time.

265
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,029
I have just been struggling to find
the courage to do what is right.

266
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:31,720
Bubelah, stay open. Connor's back,
your whole life's coming together.

267
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,640
Sometimes things do work out.

268
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,450
I gotta skidoo.

269
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,779
Take good care of yourself.
And keep in touch.

270
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,470
I'll drop you a line. Let you
know where to send the gift basket.

271
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,940
I don't know what to say, Groo.

272
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,480
Tell me I am wrong.

273
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:56,190
That I should stay.

274
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,289
That you love only me.

275
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,119
Pretty cool, huh?

276
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,789
You emptied the jumbo tub?

277
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,920
Free refills.

278
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,789
- I love this woman.
- Sh!

279
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,480
Don't skimp on the butter.

280
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,789
It's all right. It's make-believe.

281
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,700
How'd they do that?

282
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,130
Go, go, go!

283
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,650
Get down!

284
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:47,940
Out!

285
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,309
Tie me up, threaten me with sharp
objects, but don't let me go.

286
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,799
Chowder-head.

287
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,119
Kid's pretty good.

288
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,829
I can't wait to get my hands on him,
cut him open, see what makes him tick.

289
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:14,970
- Get back!
- No,

290
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,990
- He wants to protect his son.
- We were counting on that.

291
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,640
What weren't you counting on?

292
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,140
- Get off!
- The kid wanting to protect him.

293
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,470
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

294
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,150
Abort! Abort!

295
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,789
Abort! Abort!

296
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,190
Drive! Drive!

297
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,650
Okay. Easy.

298
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,579
- Now we're even.
- Now you're dead.

299
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:03,809
What, you're gonna kill a human in
front of your son? Set an example?

300
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,150
I vote yes.

301
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,829
You're not human.

302
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,829
We should probably both--

303
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,230
Stay away from my father.

304
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,890
I'm not your enemy.

305
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,829
We can help you, Steven.

306
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,259
My name is Connor.

307
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,500
Let's go home.

308
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,059
I don't feel....

309
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,329
And even if I did, it's impossible.

310
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,730
- It's ridiculous.
- That's right, it's-- Whoa.

311
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,150
Maybe on some level
I've always known it's true.

312
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,549
I have? It is?

313
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,980
- I'm in love.
- I am? I am. With Angel, right?

314
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,670
- With Angel.
- Just checking.

315
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,319
I'm scared. But I know it's right.

316
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,380
I know somehow
it's all gonna be all right.

317
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,089
It is?

318
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,849
Really?

319
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,299
Thanks for the tip.

320
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,859
I got it!

321
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,609
He's whistling.
Never heard him whistle.

322
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,490
He's happy.

323
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,609
- Angel Investigations. We can help you.
- Hi,

324
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:42,890
- It's me.
- Hi, Cor.

325
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:45,789
- How are you?
- I'm good. You?

326
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,079
- I'm pretty good.
- Angel...

327
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,190
...I need to talk to you in person.

328
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,170
Is it something bad?

329
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:02,150
No. No, it's something good, I think.
It sort of depends on how you feel.

330
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,279
- About what?
- Well, about me.

331
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,670
Oh.

332
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,710
Could you meet me tonight?

333
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,069
Tonight? Sure. Okay. Where?

334
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:21,210
I love Point Dume, There's a viewpoint,
it's the first turn north of Kanan,

335
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:25,349
- Really pretty spot.
- Point Dume, viewpoint,

336
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,859
First turn north of Kanan.
We'll meet there.

337
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:32,630
- About an hour?
- Yes.

338
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,569
- Okay.
- Okay.

339
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,859
- Yes.
- Good, Okay, then, we'll do that,

340
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,890
Oh, God, oh, God.

341
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,420
- I have to go out for a while, son.
- With Cordelia?

342
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,740
Yeah. You gonna be all right?

343
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:00,789
She's beautiful.

344
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,740
And she cares about you. I like her.

345
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm glad.

346
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,339
It's good to see you happy, Dad.

347
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,349
- Now he's humming.
- He's really happy.

348
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,180
- But not perfectly happy, I hope.
- No.

349
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,400
Just checking.

350
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,109
You know that sinking feeling you
sometimes get the morning after?

351
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,059
It arrived early.

352
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:46,609
It's like a little death.
Several, in fact.

353
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,410
Get out.

354
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,930
What, no sweet kiss?
No "When can I see you again?"

355
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,480
Watch the dirty looks. That's what
got me going in the first place.

356
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,349
I'll give you this:

357
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,430
You sure know how to channel
your rage, frustration and hate.

358
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,009
Always a bigger turn-on than love.

359
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,569
You still here?

360
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,359
I'm starting to like you. But don't go
making more of this than it is.

361
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,529
I'm not one of the doe-eyed girls
of Angel Investigations.

362
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,640
Don't be thinking about me
when I'm gone.

363
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,019
I wasn't thinking about you
when you were here.

364
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,740
So your former boss has a soul,
and you're losing yours.

365
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,430
Well, you're just new all over,
aren't you?

366
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:24,259
Slowpoke! I'm late, I'm late.
And it's not a date.

367
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,250
I hate those things.

368
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,480
We're just gonna talk
like two grown-up adults.

369
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:04,670
I have some feelings.
He may have some feelings.

370
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:09,299
He may not even know I'm
insane until he hears my feelings.

371
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,460
Oh, no. No, no, no! Not now!

372
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,529
Oh, sh--

373
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,529
Connor.

374
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,369
Dad.

375
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,339
What are you doing here?

376
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,319
We're family, and I wanted to show you
how I feel about that.

377
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,000
Connor.

378
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,359
It's all about balance. You lose it...
You lose.

379
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:03,730
Don't be...

380
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,359
...frightened.

381
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,589
- It's a little late for that.
- Sorry. You remember me? I'm--

382
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,140
Yeah. Skip. You tend to
remember your demon guides.

383
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,970
What is going on?

384
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,299
I think you know.

385
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,230
I'm dying.

386
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:26,700
No, no. You're not dying.

387
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,569
- Not dying?
- No.

388
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,690
- Say that part first.
- Sorry.

389
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:36,009
It's not the end, it's the beginning.
You're a great warrior, Cordelia.

390
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,599
The battle we're all a part of is fought on
many different planes and dimensions.

391
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,819
You've outgrown this one.

392
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,849
You've become a higher being.

393
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,529
- Me?
- You.

394
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,690
You took on the visions at the cost
of a happy, normal life...

395
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,680
...and even when they were killing you,
you wouldn't let them go.

396
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,940
The big test was The Powers making you
part demon. They bet the farm on you.

397
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,750
Power corrupts,
and they gave you a lot of power.

398
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,559
The glow-y thing.

399
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,289
Which you used well,
to fight evil and heal Connor....

400
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:16,420
And only that one time as a
night-light. Bad dreams.

401
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,910
Skip, I don't understand.

402
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:22,960
I think you do.

403
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,299
It's ridiculous.

404
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:30,470
I'm just a somewhat normal girl...

405
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:36,000
...who has visions, glows and sometimes
blows things up with her new power.

406
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:41,240
- I'm a higher being.
- Yes.

407
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,240
And when you say I've "outgrown this
level," it sort of implies--

408
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,480
You're moving on to a new one.

409
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,509
- Now I'm really scared.
- I know.

410
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,609
- I also know you're ready.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

411
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,720
The universe begs to differ.

412
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,529
- And deep down inside, I think--
- Yes.

413
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,500
All right? Stop saying I know.

414
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,869
Maybe I do know.

415
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,500
Maybe, if given enough time, I might
even get used to the idea. But...

416
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,989
...I don't have enough time, do I?

417
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,130
Easy. Talk to me. Talk to me.

418
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,820
- Okay?
- Okay.

419
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,889
I don't know what's wrong with you,
but you're gonna talk!

420
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,010
No.

421
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,059
Of course not.

422
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:23,769
Why would The Powers give me time for
the most important talk of my life?

423
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,219
I'm on my way to--

424
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,530
I'm in love, with Angel.

425
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,010
What you're being called to do
transcends love.

426
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:40,070
How is that fair? I can't leave
without telling him. I won't.

427
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,440
He has to know how I feel.

428
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,840
Why does this have to be now?

429
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,159
There's work to be done
in the higher realms.

430
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,480
Can you at least tell Angel for me?

431
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,550
Sorry. Not allowed.

432
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,489
Then I'm not going.

433
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:09,559
How could they possibly
do this to me now?

434
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,389
This is the last test, isn't it?

435
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:41,639
Connor...

436
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,949
...why are you doing this?

437
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,650
You murdered my father.

438
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,909
No, I didn't. I swear.

439
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,199
He's lying.

440
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:57,090
I'm not lying. She knows it.

441
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,460
You're the prince of lies.

442
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,780
That's why you wouldn't let them kill me
at the drive-in. So you could.

443
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,289
Killing is too good for you.

444
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,679
You don't get to die. You get to live.

445
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:14,389
Forever.

446
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,170
Cordelia?

447
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,769
I ever encounter those Powers That Be,
we're gonna have a talk. A big talk.

448
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,769
You're doing the right thing.

449
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:37,929
I'm scared.

450
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,690
But I know it's right.

451
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,199
I know somehow
it's all gonna be all right.

452
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,369
What do I do?

453
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,000
Just say yes.

454
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,340
I already have.

455
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:28,780
Some day you'll learn the truth,
and you'll hate yourself.

456
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,309
Don't. It's not your fault.

457
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,409
- I don't blame you.
- Liar!

458
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,909
Listen to me. I love you.

459
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,099
Never forget that.

460
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,769
Connor!

461
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,030
Connor, never forget that I'm your
father and that I love you.

462
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,400
Connor! Connor!

463
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,329
Connor didn't want to come for
a midnight snack?

464
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:37,079
It's okay.
I'll scrounge something up here.

465
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:39,760
He's not in his room.
You didn't see him?

466
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:43,639
No. He's gone? Again?

467
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,420
Did you ask Lorne if--? No, because
Lorne doesn't live here anymore.

468
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,730
Not used to that yet.

469
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,230
I'm sure Connor'll--

470
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:59,239
I'm sure it's nothing, but we should
tell Cordelia or Angel.

471
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,889
I've been trying. No one's answering.

472
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,710
I don't like the sound of that.

473
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,659
Where'd everybody go?
