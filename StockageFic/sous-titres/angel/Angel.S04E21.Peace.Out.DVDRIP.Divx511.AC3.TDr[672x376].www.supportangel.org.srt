<i>For so long you've all been drowning.</i>

4
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:11,446
The fighting and the pain.
I'd like to help.

5
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:14,605
I scrubbed the other one till my
fingers bled, but I couldn't get out the...

JASMINE: Fred?
...blood.

7
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:21,444
Jasmine's blood. Somehow it breaks
her spell when it mingles with ours.

8
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:26,164
ANGEL: We hoped Cordy's blood
would have the same effect.

- We loved her first.
- Jasmine?

Soon you'll go out with all
of my strength behind you.

17

She has a name and it has power
over her.

18
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,365
That's why she keeps it a secret.

that's worshipped Jasmine for millennia.

WESLEY: I've got it.

has to live through this.

All your talk about

Well, now somebody's gone

- It must hurt so terribly.
- Don't get all gloat-y.

Not the worst beating
we've ever taken.

I meant the pain you've caused
yourselves, letting go of me.

Nobody asked.

- Where's Angel?
WESLEY: You're omniscient.

76
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,771
You tell us.

77
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:28,164
Connor, please.
I don't want to see that.

WESLEY:
The creature in the sewer...

79
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:37,007
...you recognized it, didn't you?
- Yes.

80
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:39,164
Just another one of your zealots.

81
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,245
A sentient, living being wanting
what's best for his own.

82
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:49,613
Is that so wrong? A few millennia ago,
his world was not unlike yours.

83
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:53,527
Full of hatred and fear,
wars scarring its landscape.

84
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:57,163
Until, let me guess, you came
along and made it a paradise.

85
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,803
Well, as much of a paradise
as one could...

86
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,203
...with a bunch
of insects to work with.

87
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:07,082
I helped them along,
kicked their evolution up a few ticks.

88
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,811
And how'd that work out for them?

89
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,289
It was a trial run...

90
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:16,366
...an early experiment to work
out the bugs, so to speak.

91
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:19,843
I won't make that mistake again.

92
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:23,046
I know where Angel is, and I
know what he's looking for.

93
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,245
He's wasting his time.

94
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:29,567
If you really believed that,
you'd have killed us already.

95
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,407

96
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,007
Yes, ma'am?

00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,925
JASMINE:
The news people have arrived.

98
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,129
Please ask them to set up
in the lobby.

99
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,204
I'll speak with them
after I've eaten.

100
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,892
Mm-hm.

101
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,731
So it's time, is it?

102
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:50,205
Time for what?

103
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,642
Too much trouble conquering a
primitive dimension, wasn't it, Jasmine?

104
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,605
Or whatever your name is.

105
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,923
Must be nice for you
that we have satellites...

106
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,323
...to beam your message
to the rest of the world.

107
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,767
You're not wrong.

108
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,721
Oh, God. Connor, you can't let her
do this. She'll enslave everyone.

109
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:09,361
- She'll bring them together.
- You don't...

110
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,444
She's not what she pretends to be.
She's...

111
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,171
- A monster.
FRED: Yeah.

112
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,085
Cordy's blood that we put in you...

113
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:20,325
...was supposed to break the spell,
show you what she looks like.

114
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:22,843
I know what she looks like.

115
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:27,012
She's beautiful.

We're bargaining chips
to keep Angel quiet.

119
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,252
- Quiet about what?
- Connor...

120
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,371
...this address is going to be
very draining for me.

121
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,444
While I'm feasting
to build my strength...

122
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:46,524
...I'm going to be
out of touch with you...

123
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:50,329
...with everything. You'll be my
eyes and ears, you understand?

124
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:51,767
Yeah.

125
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,164
I want you to stand guard over them,
make sure they don't escape.

126
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,563
If Angel so much as shows his face...

127
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,293
What is he looking for? Angel?

128
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:04,365
The unattainable.

dead thing, only to fail.

130
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:36,048
Don't worry. The way down
will be much, much quicker.

131
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:39,364
Thanks for the tip. Maybe I can use
your body to cushion the blow.

132
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:42,286
HIGH PRIEST: I doubt my form
would provide you much protection.

133
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,366
But you're welcome to try.

134
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:49,966
You? You're...? You're the...?

135

ANGEL: Well, Blessed Temple's
kind of empty, Padre.

138
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:05,082
So where are the other true believers?
Or are you it?

139
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:08,649
Ha! Betrayers. Blasphemers.

140
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:12,647
Centuries of waiting for a return
have caused most to doubt.

141
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,242
But not you, her faithful P.R. Flak.

142
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:17,884
She is the light.

143
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,011
- She is the way.
- She is not coming back.

144
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:25,003
She will, when she's through
with your world.

145
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:29,323
You know, maybe we're not talking
about the same person here.

146
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:31,245
What's the name of yours again?

147
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:35,403
That's why you're here, dead thing,
what you've come for.

148
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:38,087
The Word. The Name.

149
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,572
Good.

150
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,527
You got that.
So I don't have to ask it again.

151
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:44,367
What is it?

152
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:50,085
Fool. You can take away her power,
but you've already lost everything.

153
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,324
I've just gotta know one thing.

154
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:59,929
The reason our little blood ritual
didn't raise any veils for you.

155
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,570
You've always seen Jasmine's
true appearance, haven't you?

156
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,931
You gotta be kidding me.

157
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:11,006
You know what maggot-face looks like,
and you're still big with the worship?

158
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,489
I grew up in Quor-toth.

159
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,251
A hell dimension, full of all sorts
of things you can't even imagine.

160
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,769
So, you know, appearance...

161
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,970
...not that important to me.
- What is important to you, Connor?

162
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,408
Not us, apparently, or his own father.

163
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,451
FRED:
What about Cordelia?

164
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,808
She needs help, medical attention.

165
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,248
I mean, who knows what
that coma's doing to her?

166
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,530
- She's fine.
- Are you sure? Have you checked on her?

167
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,126
If you don't care for her...

168
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,931
She isn't...

169
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:44,366
She's been moved.

170
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,171
Moved? What do you mean?

171
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,166
Someplace safe, okay?
She's taken care of, so just quit...

172
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,166
- Connor, what does Jasmine eat?
- What?

173
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,931
The creature in the sewer,
it called her the Devourer.

174
00:11:58,293 --> 00:11:59,567
Devourer of what?

175
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,245
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

176
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:07,610
The followers she randomly chooses
to come to her room.

177
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:10,651
The ones she sent to meet
her in the banquet hall.

178
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,087
They're the banquet.

179
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,165
Wait. People? She eats people?

180
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,607
FRED:
Oh, no.

181
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,333
"To Serve Man."
It's "To Serve Man" all over again.

182
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,051
And now she's going global.

183
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:22,771
- You don't think Cordy's...?
WESLEY: I hope not.

184
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,208
But we really have no way
of knowing, do we?

00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,085
HIGH PRIEST:
I know all about you.

186
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,370
She who brought us up from the mud
and molded us into what we are...

187
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,206
...has given me sight into the hearts
and minds of others.

188
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,091
I see you. I know all about...

189
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,767
Then you know I'm kind of in a hurry.
Give me her name.

190
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,961
- Keeper!
- That's it?

191
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:47,447
Caper?

192
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:52,369
Her true name is known only
by the Keeper of the Name.

193
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,524
Right. That's you.

194
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,729
No! I am the Guardian of the Word.

195
00:12:56,893 --> 00:13:00,044
- You said the word is the name.
- Yes, and I guard the Keeper of it.

196
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,523
- So you are the Keeper's keeper?
- I am the Guardian of the Word.

197
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,491
Yeah, yeah, okay. So where's
this Keeper of the Name?

198
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,567
Swell.

199
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,042
The Keeper will not be forthcoming.

200
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:25,049
Only with its last breath will it divulge
the true name of the Blessed Devourer.

201
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:28,923
Okay, big guy,
you got a name I need.

202
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,205
So we can either do this the easy
way or the hard way.

203
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,444
But you're gonna give me
her name, or...

205
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,083

I'm so glad you're here.

207
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,967
WOMAN:
Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:55,923
Before you came, my life was a mess.
I had no job. I was being evicted.

209
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,367
It's all right, Susan.

210
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,888
You'll never be burdened
with those worries again.

00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:04,211
WOMAN: The emptiness, the weight I've
been carrying all my life, it's gone.

212
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,012
- All that I feel now is...
- Connor. Is everything...?

213
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,970
I need to talk to you.

214
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,125
- Excuse us a moment.
WOMAN: Of course, Jasmine.

215
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,287
Can we do this later? I really hate
to keep these lovely people waiting.

216
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,046
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:26,892
I was... I was just wondering.
I...

218
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:29,284
I wanted to know...

219
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,092
Cordelia.

220
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,847
Yeah.

221
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,288
What did you do with her, exactly?

222
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,887
I told you. She's exactly where
I need her to be.

223
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,327
Out of harm's way.

224
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,163
Yeah. I think I should know.

225
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,403
But there's no reason for you
to know.

226
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,133
Just take comfort in my words.

227
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,523
She's safe and...

228
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,408
- You think I ate her.
- What?

229
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,611
No. No.

230
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,807
It's all right, Connor. I'm not offended.

231
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:04,605
But who would put such
a ridiculous idea in your head?

232
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,606
No one. I never thought...

233
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,364
So, no then, about the eating?

234
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:16,049
I could never hurt Cordelia Chase
any more than I could you.

235
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:19,728
You're my parents,
my tether to this world.

236
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,445
It was your love
that brought me here.

237
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:26,691
I understand. You miss her.

238
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:30,892
So she's still here?
She's not in some alternate dimension?

239
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,327
Of course not.

240
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:37,328
I had a few of my faithful move her
to a secure location for her protection.

241
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,884
Who? Who took her?

242
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:45,171
It doesn't matter.
Just know she's alive...

243
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:47,604
...and, well, comatose.

are supposed to be.

00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,407
Thank you, Connor.

00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:09,092

Valor? What you call justice?

00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,642
Your friends are dead, most likely.

00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:25,763

So it's not for them you fight.

HIGH PRIEST: Your world.

253
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,011
A world that doesn't care for you,
doesn't want you.

00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,246
It needs me.

So your Powers That Be tell you.
Maybe they're right.

But it's not why you're here.

00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,971
Okay, Bugsy, you wanna tell me
what I'm fighting for?

258
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,851
- Him.
- Him?

259
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,925
The boy. The woman you've already lost.

260
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,569
The boy is what you're fighting for.

261
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,248
But you're going to fail.
You're going to lose him too.

Yeah. I read this was her

Don't you think we're really
fortunate to be here?

I just feel so blessed to
actually have this opportunity...

So tell me, and I'll crush your windpipe.

Yeah, well, first things first.

you know?

- Leaving us unguarded.
- Yeah.

If he's not careful, we might
move about freely in our...

for a little tender, loving...

00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:49,367
Is that some kind of ritual
she has him doing? Because... ew.

328
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,967
What?

329
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,044
Oh, no, I was just thinking.

330
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:55,681
Cordelia's blood,
it had the same power...

331
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:59,243
...as Jasmine's to break the thrall
she had over us.

332
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:02,485
So we figured. Mother and daughter,
they share the same blood.

333
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:07,365
And now she's been moved.
Cordelia. Why?

334
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,570
I guess so people like us don't use
Cordy's blood against Jasmine.

335
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,043
There are no people like us,
not anymore. We're it.

336
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,522
She had us on the run.

337
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:22,164
And if Cordelia's so dangerous to her,
why not kill her and be done with it?

338
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:25,491
Because maybe she can't.

339
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:29,612
Exactly. I think Jasmine
may be dependent on Cordelia.

340
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:33,402
She can't hurt her,
not without hurting herself.

341
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:37,286
But maybe Cordelia can hurt Jasmine.

342
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:39,250
- It's a lot of maybes.
WESLEY: Maybe.

343
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:42,928
But if I'm right, Cordelia might be
our only hope to stop Jasmine.

344
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,210
If we can wake her up.

345
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,763

Well, not order per se.
More like a request, really.

actually gives orders.

382

hurt anyone else.

514
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:02,887
- You're already dead.
- You know what I mean.

515
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:04,930
It ends right here.

516
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,010
Why do you hate me so much?

517
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:09,448
Let's run down the list, huh?

518
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:12,207
Rain of fire, blotting out the sun...

519
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:14,489
...enslaving mankind.
And yeah, oh, yeah.

520
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,291
Hey, you eat people.

521
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:18,011
Like you never have?

522
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:21,370
Thousands of people are dead
because of what you've done.

523
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,366
And how many will die because of you?

524
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:26,922
I could've stopped it, Angel.

525
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:28,446
All of it.

526
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:32,526
War, disease, poverty.
How many precious, beautiful lives...

527
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:35,924
...would have been saved
in a handful of years?

528
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,567
Yes...

529
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:41,442
...I murdered thousands
to save billions.

530
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:47,724
This world is doomed to drown
in its own blood now.

531
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:51,163
The price was too high, Jasmine.

532
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:56,450
Our fate has to be our own
or we're nothing.

533
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:57,887
Like me?

534
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,887
Look, we've all done horrible things.

535
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:12,326
All we can do is try
and make up for it.

536
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:15,845
So okay, you know, it's not
the world that you wanted.

537
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,924
Maybe you could help us
make it better...

538
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:20,288
...even if you have
lost your powers.

539
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:23,767
Not all of them.

540
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,290
ANGEL: Run.
MAN: Run! Run!

541
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,886
Think the price was too high?

542
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,408
You haven't begun to pay.

543
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:14,927
Maybe you're right.

544
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:18,565
Maybe I can still make this world
a better place.

545
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:28,204
One body at a time.

546
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,204
I loved this world.

547
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:35,082
- I sacrificed everything I was for you.
- So you could rule us?

548
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:37,642
Because I care.
The other Powers don't.

549
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:40,532
Never really did.
You know that's true in your heart.

550
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,530
It's a shame now I gotta rip it out.

551
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:56,723
I was forged in the inferno
of creation, vampire.

552
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:59,771
You really think a little electricity
would destroy me?

553
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,492
Worth a shot.

554
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,491
JASMINE:
You remember the prophecy?

555
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:16,009
The one that says in the time of the
Apocalypse, you'd play a major part?

556
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:19,722
How you never knew whether you'd
be on the side of good or evil.

557
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:23,566
Well, now you know.

558
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:26,486
Next to you, this frail
little Power that was...

559
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:30,612
...has just enough strength in her
to wipe out your whole species.

560
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:32,843
And it's all on your hands.

561
00:37:33,693 --> 00:37:35,331
This isn't my fault!

562
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,930
- Go to Hell.
- You first, baby.

563
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,611
CONNOR:
Always the same, Dad.

564
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:45,333
I get a girl, you've gotta
make a play for her.

565
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,203
Connor.

566
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,372
Find anyone?

567
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,366
We've got ourselves a ghost hotel.

568
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:07,009
Garden's empty.
This is incredibly creepy.

569
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:12,409
Only in a post-apocalyptic,
<i>Night of the Comet</i> kind of way.

570
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,608
FRED: Do you think they're all...?
LORNE: Dead.

571
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,847
Dead air. TV stations going off-line.

572
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,007
Something big went down.

573
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:34,492
Yeah. Here's its head.

574
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,285
- Angel.
- You sure?

575
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,327
Where we going?

576
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:45,053
We have to find him and Cordelia
before Jasmine does.

577
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,804
Oh, my God.

578
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:57,168
Connor, I still have you.
Angel's ruined everything.

579
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:00,288
But he can't defeat both of us.

580
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:04,406
You still believe in me, don't you?
You still love me?

581
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:06,847
Yes.

582
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:19,012
ANGEL:
Connor.

583
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:23,688
It's okay. It's over.

584
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,722
I know this is difficult for you.

585
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,767
I'm...

586
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,163
...just happy to have you.

587
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:37,487
Connor. Connor.

588
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,850
Connor. Connor.

589
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,644
Connor!

Oh, my God, you're alive.

WESLEY:
Angel.

594
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,851
Jasmine's dead.

595
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,844
Brought back her name
and her powers were destroyed.

596
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:22,611
Connor killed her.

597
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:24,886
Connor?

598
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,332
- Um, there's something...
- I've never seen him like this.

599
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:33,849
He wasn't hurt or angry. He just...

600
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,208
He just killed her.

601
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:39,442
And his face...

602
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:43,891
...it was just blank,
like he had nothing left.

603
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:50,085
- Angel, you really...
- I got a bad feeling...

604
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:53,851
...he's just given up.

605
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,564
I think he's gonna do something.
He might...

606
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:59,043
LILAH:
End world peace?

607
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,411
You already took care of that.

608
00:41:03,973 --> 00:41:05,247
Congratulations.
