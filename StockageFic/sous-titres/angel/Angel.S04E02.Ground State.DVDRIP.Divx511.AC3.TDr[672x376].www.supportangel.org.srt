00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,093
But who listens to the dead?

177
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,327
The Axis of Pythia rests close by.

178
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:31,567
What you seek can only
be found inside the Axis.

179
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,208
The Axis?

180
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,607
An ancient power
bridging all dimensions.

181
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,646
Find the Axis
and find your lost one.

182
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,768
Why should I trust you?

183
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:48,249
Because I'd love to keep you...

184
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:53,124
...but you have so much more to lose.

185
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,086
I thought I said discreet.

186
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,492
What? Do you see nipple?

187
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,564
- You're late.
- You're screwing me.

188
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,691
The Axis of Pythia is worth
33 million dollars.

189

You told me it was worth 6.

190
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,292
The Axis is merely a mystical object.
It has no inherent monetary value.

191
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,889
Blah, blah, polysyllabic blah.

192
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:40,562
I need a drink.

193
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,043
Waiter, I'll take a redcoat, up,
double the voddy.

194
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,647
And can I get one of those
little swizzly things?

195
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:49,008
Just love those. You were saying?

196
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:53,651
- My appraiser priced the Axis at exactly...
- At 18 percent of its true market value.

197
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,202
And seeing as how I steal stuff
on commission...

198
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,443
...that's like getting me
for 80 percent off.

199
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:02,686
Now, let's be honest, Elliot. Do I
look like a Blue Light Special to you?

200
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:07,525
The street value is irrelevant. I want
the Axis for my own private collection.

201
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,685
As I recall, we had already settled
on a rather substantial fee.

202
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:14,732
Say it with me, big guy:

I'll be in the penthouse, and we'll
transfer the balance of your fee.

207
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:37,567
Which is going to have a lot more
zeros on the end of it, right?

208
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:40,725
Gwen, you came to me very highly
recommended for your...

209
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:44,842
For your talents.

210
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:49,211
But I have to admit, I was expecting
someone a bit more...

...professional.

212
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,644
I am a professional...

213
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,931
...and we professionals
don't like taking the bone.

214
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,570
Gwen, that is a $ 12,000 watch.

00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,689

Forged from the tripod
of the Delphic oracle, the Axis...

219
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,968
...a metal arch set into a marble base,
stands approximately...

220
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,567
...2 feet high and weighs
18 pounds.

223
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,807
Is that...?

224
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:47,772
You didn't draw that?

225
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:52,048
Huh? Yeah, I just scribbled
it down out of one of the books.

226
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:55,441
Nice.

227

The Axis is said to have been imbued
with many mystical qualities...

228
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:04,089
...one of which is finding souls
or entities across dimensions.

00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:07,802

So we need the Axis.
How do we get it?

00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,801
Currently, the Axis is being held
in a vault in Chandler's Auction House...

237
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,841
...an establishment firmly rooted
in the black market.

238
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:30,562
Black market means money.
Money means security.

239
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,611
But not to worry, because
I beat the building plans...

240
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,729
...out of a snitch
who thought I was dead.

241
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,366
The plans are only half of it.

242
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,570
Just because we know where it is
doesn't mean we can get to it.

243
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:45,532
- Surveillance cameras, electric gates.
- Laser sensors, handprint recognition.

244
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:47,570
Not to mention armed guards.

245
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:50,367
But if it's an auction house,
can't we just eBay it?

246
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,648
How much is it?

247
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:52,928
33 million dollars.

248
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,044
I think my lungs have coffee.

249
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,283
I'm still working on a plan...

250
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:03,207

prison and becoming somebody's bitch.

You're not counting the time we
stole the crazy-making death shroud...

...that nearly killed us, right?

256
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,732
This is how we find Cordy,
so this is what we're gonna do.

257
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:26,566
Okay. I'm just gonna take these
and go over the details...

258
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:30,851
...and see if I can, I don't know,
whip something up.

259
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,685

stepped up while I was gone.

to find her. What then?

267
00:17:55,613 --> 00:18:00,368
Then we do whatever it takes to get
her back home where she belongs.

268
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,173
So, what are we gonna need
for Operation Chance in Hell?

heard a few things too.

Did you at least break his nose?

511
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:04,171
You're gonna use that Axis thing
to find her, aren't you?

512
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:09,286
Figures.

513
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:13,972
Anyone that bad at stealing stuff's
gotta be doing it for love.

514
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:16,727
Bummer.

515
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:41,604
Do you think he found her?

516
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:51,566
Yeah.

517
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:19,404
She was beautiful?

518
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:21,765
God...

519
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:26,725
...there was all this light around her.

520
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,804
And the light seemed to be made up...

521
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,565
...of pure joy.

522
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:36,852
And warmth.

523
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:41,562
You think higher beings
get to take vacations?

524
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,845
The way I saw it,
it felt sort of permanent.

525
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:50,442
Too bad. Could have all gone to Vegas.

526
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:54,330
We should've known back when she
started doing that glowy thing...

527
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:57,803
...the Powers were up to something.
GUNN: Who thought it would be this?

528
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:02,122
Tell you the truth, doesn't surprise me.

529
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,609
In some small way...

530
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:09,403
...maybe it even makes it easier
knowing the good she's doing up there.

531
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:15,691
Even if I can't see her or talk to her,
it's like she's still on my side.

532
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:20,930
- Doesn't mean you miss her any less.
- No.

533
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:27,093
All those months under the water...

534
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:30,643
...I kept thinking to myself,
"I gotta get home to Cordelia."

535
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:34,809
I get back, and I find out
that she's gone.

536
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:38,608
I keep thinking,
"I gotta get Cordy back home."

537
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:43,090
Finally I find her, and I realize...

538
00:39:44,893 --> 00:39:46,770
...she already is home...

539
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:55,523
...where she belongs.

540
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:13,445
What are you, deficient?
Get me out of here!

541
