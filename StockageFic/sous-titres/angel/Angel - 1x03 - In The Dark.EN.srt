1
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,710
Lenny, please.

2
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:23,800
Don't.

3
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,390
You think I'm not gonna find you
after you humiliate me again?

4
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,870
I didn't do anything.

5
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,460
- I swear, I never--
- No!

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,340
I know what you're doing. I see.

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,750
The men, the lies.
This is the last time, damn it.

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,200
What do you want, baby?

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,630
You only get like this when you're--

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,020
What are you gonna do?
Pulverize me right here?

11
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,429
Somebody will hear me scream.

12
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,960
In downtown L. A. at night?

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,500
Who's gonna hear, Rach?

14
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,820
Nobody who cares.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,010
Besides...

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,409
... this will be over fast.

17
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,530
Please...

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,650
... no.

19
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,930
I' m sorry.
I just can't take this anymore.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,060
Poor Lenny. Terrorizing your
girlfriend too much for you?

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,989
I can make it stop.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,640
Are you all right?

23
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,450
- Is he... ?
- It's okay.

24
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,739
He's not getting up for a while.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,950
I can't believe
you actually showed up.

26
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:43,670
That was the deal, right?

27
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:49,450
"How can I thank you, mysterious,
black-clad hunk of a night thing?"

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,109
"No need, little lady. Your tears
of gratitude are enough for me.

29
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,519
You see, I was once a bad-ass vampire.

30
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,629
But love and a pesky curse
defanged me.

31
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,569
And now I'm just a big, fluffy puppy
with bad teeth."

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,610
"No, not the hair. Never the hair."

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,590
"But there must be some way
I can show my appreciation."

34
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,479
"No! Helping those in need's my job.

35
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,620
And working up a load
of sexual tension...

36
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,759
... and prancing away
like a magnificent poof...

37
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,379
... is truly thanks enough."

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,150
"I understand.
I have a nephew who's gay, so--"

39
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,870
"Say no more ! Evil's still afoot.

40
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,569
And I'm almost out of that
nancy-boy hair gel I like so much!

41
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,139
Quickly! To the Angel mobile! Away!"

42
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,370
Go on with you.

43
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,930
Play the big, strapping hero
while you can.

44
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,020
You have a few surprises
coming your way.

45
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,110
The ring of Amarra...

46
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,810
... a visit from your old pal Spike...

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,789
... and oh, yeah...

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,719
... your gruesome, horrible death.

49
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,099
Another 40 minutes
of uninterrupted music,

50
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,090
You're listening to the sounds of
L.A.'s only modern alternative...

51
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:17,529
...KLA Rock,

52
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,079
It's 11;O5,
Do you know what your karma is?

53
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,649
This is so awesome.
Our first walk-in client.

54
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,769
It's all according to plan.

55
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,779
See girl in distress. See Angel save
girl from druggie-stalker boyfriend.

56
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,259
See boyfriend go to jail.

57
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,500
And see...

58
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,860
...invoice!

59
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,160
Ta-da!

60
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,449
- What?
- Nothing.

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,709
You're doing a lovely job.
Very official.

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,670
So why not rejoice
at our first paying client?

63
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,810
Because that's not money
in your hand. That's mail.

64
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,310
There's a difference
between that and getting paid.

65
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,410
But she has to pay. Invoice.

66
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,920
That's the rule of our whole society.

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,009
Defaulting. Another popular rule.
Especially with the down-and-outs.

68
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,370
Not that I've perpetrated
said heinousness myself--

69
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,730
What are you saying? Why bother?

70
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,029
I'm saying if you and I hope to take
that cruise to the Bahamas together...

71
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,439
...we'll need
a lot more clients of means.

72
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,189
And a reality where
you're Matthew McConaughey.

73
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,029
Hello, L.A.

74
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,709
Oz? Oh, my God!

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,500
Oz, I am so happy to see you!

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,930
Good old Oz.

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,870
Oz. Oz!

78
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,120
Let me just take a stab at this,
but you'd be Oz?

79
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,730
- Good guess.
- This is so cool.

80
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,480
I mean, here you are in L.A...

81
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,240
...and you're the embodiment
of all things Sunnydale.

82
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,019
Well, it's a burden, but I manage.

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,829
Okay, we have serious
catching up to do.

84
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:56,420
- How's everything? How's the Bronze?
- The same.

85
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,879
- And the gang?
- Good.

86
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,199
Good? Good!

87
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,220
Good.

88
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,009
- We done?
- Completely.

89
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:10,639
Oh, this is Doyle.
He, air-quote, "works here."

90
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,990
I heard the rumors.
You can fill me in on the real deal.

91
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,689
- You guys are detectives?
- No. I'm an actress.

92
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,360
Quite a captivating one at that.

93
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,990
And between my many gigs,
I choose to help Angel.

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah, he's the detective.

95
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,560
Does he have a hat and gun?

96
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,319
Just fangs.

97
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,040
Well, that works. Where is he?

98
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,990
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

99
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,050
- Oz.
- Angel.

100
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,170
- Nice surprise.
- Thanks.

101
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,639
- Staying long?
- A few days.

102
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,899
They always like this?

103
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,490
No, we're usually laconic.

104
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,040
Come on in.

105
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,860
So.

106
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,399
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

107
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,459
I came primarily for a gig,
but also to give you this.

108
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,300
Wait a minute,
is that what I think it is?

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,649
It's the Gem of Amarra.

110
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,279
One and the same.

111
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,850
Buffy wanted you to have it.

112
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,300
Hey, Buffy.

113
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,839
- How is good old Buffy, anyway?
- She's--

114
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,189
Still the brave little slayer,
or moping like...

115
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,250
...nobody around here.

116
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,970
She's good.

117
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,300
She's Buffy.

118
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,160
For right now, can we concentrate
on the mother lode Angel just hit?

119
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,060
Why are you waiting? Put it on.

120
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,250
You're getting weird with this ring.

121
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,040
When did you care about accessorizing?

122
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,629
Since the accessory's priceless...

123
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,120
...and renders the wearer unkillable
if he's a vampire.

124
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,500
Unkillable?

125
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,639
Not even stakes?

126
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,209
Not nothing. Not stakes, not fire...

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,449
...and best of all, not even sunlight.

128
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:06,129
Just think of it.
poolside tanning...

129
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,269
...bargain matinees,
plus several strip clubs...

130
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,339
...that have a luncheon buffet
that's quite tasty.

131
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,500
I've heard.

132
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,439
- And it's from Buffy.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,120
Spike dug up Sunnydale
looking for it...

134
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,079
...but got a fistful of Buffy
and left it.

135
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,610
She wanted it in good hands.

136
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,040
- So she sent you?
- I was heading this way.

137
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,050
She didn't even send a note?

138
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,500
Wow.

139
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:30,839
That's really--

140
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,019
This is one of those times I should
shy away from the topic, isn't it?

141
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,250
This will boost your spirits.

142
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,950
Put it on, and here, I'll stake you.
It'll be fun!

143
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,720
Maybe later.

144
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,120
- Are you out of your mind?
- I said, later.

145
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, you have it your way, but...

146
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,200
...I'm still going to celebrate
with a drink.

147
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,759
He'd celebrate the opening
of a mailbox with a drink.

148
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,590
- You coming, Oz?
- Yeah, I could eat.

149
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,500
Go ahead.

150
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:54,470
God.

151
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,330
Know what would feel really good?

152
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,269
One of those mind-numbing...

153
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,590
...head-cracking visions
I get from time to time.

154
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,409
Because that would really kill me.

155
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,019
Is there some kind of trick to this?

156
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,320
The trick is laying off the ale before
you start quoting Angela's Ashes...

157
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,960
...and weeping like a baby.

158
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,159
- That's a good book.
- So I've heard.

159
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:21,039
But I doubt the main characters
are Betty and Barney Rubble...

160
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,870
...as you so vehemently insisted
last night.

161
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,629
Also, I don't think Oz appreciated
being called "my little Bam Bam."

162
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,740
Hello.

163
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,399
Hello?

164
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,759
- Angel,
- Rachel? Is that you?

165
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,820
They let Lenny out.
The lawyer said something about...

166
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,200
...a technicality,

167
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:06,899
I'll be right there,

168
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,240
Angel.

169
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,549
You have something I'm looking for.
A shiny bauble.

170
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,480
Might as well go home, Spike.
The Gem of Amarra stays with me.

171
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:35,019
Why? Because you're
"Angel, Vamp Detective" now?

172
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,970
I'm so scared.

173
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,720
What's next, vampire cowboy?

174
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,639
Vampire fireman?

175
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,179
Oh, vampire ballerina.

176
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,840
I do like to work with my legs.

177
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,730
So, you and I duke it out, huh?

178
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,809
This your strategy to get the ring?

179
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,399
I had a plan.

180
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,409
- You? A plan?
- A good plan.

181
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,740
Smart, carefully laid out.

182
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:15,470
But I got bored.

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,379
All that watching, waiting.

184
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,200
My legs started to cramp.

185
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,870
Enough with this.
Tell me where the ring is!

186
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,610
It wouldn't go with your outfit.

187
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,320
Cordelia.

188
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,090
You look smashing.

189
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,289
- You lose weight?
- Yes.

190
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,759
There's this great gym on--

191
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,139
Hey.

192
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:54,929
I'll get that ring.

193
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,419
This isn't over until one of us
is a pile of dust.

194
00:12:58,929 --> 00:12:59,870
You okay?

195
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,710
- More importantly, how's the ring?
- It's fine.

196
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,320
I can't say the same
for you two, though.

197
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,179
Better get out of sight.
Spike's out for blood.

198
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,440
Take her to your place.

199
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,690
His place? Why can't I just go home?

200
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,450
Because he knows you.
He can track you down.

201
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,159
He's not invited, right?
He can't come in.

202
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,279
He can burn the place to the ground.

203
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,230
Doyle's place it is.

204
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,740
What about you?

205
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,610
He'll be coming back for you.

206
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,289
- I know.
- So, what will you do?

207
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,919
Find him first.

208
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:34,809
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

209
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,419
Not Spice,

210
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,500
That's the bird that works down on
Broadway. Spike, as in railroad.

211
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,720
Yeah, vampire. Right.

212
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,419
No.

213
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,570
Okay, then. Thanks.

214
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,490
Frankie Tripod, a big "no."

215
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,220
Frankie Tripod? I get it. Some kind
of three-legged monster, right?

216
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,169
No, he's human.

217
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,460
Then, what's his name supposed to--?
Oh.

218
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,940
Listen, why don't you sit down,
get comfortable?

219
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,419
Angel said to go through every contact
until I find where Spike is hiding.

220
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,950
Could be a while.

221
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,250
I couldn't get comfortable here
if the floor was lined with mink.

222
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,690
How can you live like this?

223
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,600
I didn't until last week. Then I saw
your place and called my decorator.

224
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,230
No way.

225
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,970
My apartment is nowhere near...

226
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,950
...this yucky.

227
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,629
- Smells like bong water in here.
- Okay...

228
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,149
...some laundry may be
a couple of days past due, but--

229
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,340
Yeah.

230
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,139
Hey, Kizzy.

231
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,009
Yeah, a vamp called Spike.

232
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,840
No, huh?

233
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,889
What? A C-note?

234
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,389
No, I absolutely paid that back.

235
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,179
No, sorry.
There goes my other line, got to--

236
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,230
He was mistaken.
But I didn't have time to get into it.

237
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,279
I'm on a mission here.

238
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,230
So, what about this Spike?
Is he as bad as all that?

239
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,929
Should I be sweating?

240
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,570
No, he's not so--

241
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,419
Sweat.

242
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,840
That's what I figured.

243
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,129
Keep showing up like this,
I'll think you're a man of your word.

244
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,690
Stranger things....

245
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,629
Not many.

246
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,799
We'll get you out.
There are places you'll be safe.

247
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,320
- Like a shelter?
- It's a start.

248
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,220
He won't be able to find you, I swear.

249
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,570
No, it's not the shelter.
It's just--

250
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,549
Half the time, you know how this whole
thing starts up, Lenny and me?

251
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,179
You call him.

252
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,340
I just--

253
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,799
I start to jones for him...

254
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,129
...the way he joneses for rock.

255
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,220
And I call or find him in some dive
and drag him home.

256
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,809
And it's good for a while.

257
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,330
But it doesn't last.

258
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,179
This last time
he would have killed you.

259
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,429
I'm scared, Angel.

260
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:26,590
I'm more scared of me
than I am of him right now.

261
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,750
You're at a crossroads. I know.

262
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,409
It's either go for the easy fix
and wait for the consequences...

263
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,309
...or take the hard road
and go with faith.

264
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,139
Oh, God.

265
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,059
You're not from that freaky church
on Sunset, are you?

266
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,909
In yourself. That kind of faith.

267
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,929
I'm saying, if you leave
Lenny for good, it'll hurt.

268
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,440
But, eventually,
you'll be stronger for it.

269
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,679
And maybe you'll find your way
to the kind of love you deserve.

270
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,269
You mean the kind that comes
without 911 calls?

271
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,889
That's the general idea.

272
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,150
Oh, yeah,

273
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,900
Spike's nearly killed Buffy. I mention
he's killed two slayers already?

274
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,079
You did.

275
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,400
And one time he and Dru
raised a demon...

276
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,400
...that burned people alive
from the inside.

277
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,299
It was this whole weird thing
with an arm in a box.

278
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:19,960
An arm in a box?

279
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,180
- House of Pies.
- Doyle?

280
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,880
Is that you?

281
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,559
Just laying low,
the calls to past acquaintances...

282
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,779
...stirred up a few resentments.

283
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:33,759
I hope it was worth it,

284
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,250
Manny The Pig said he didn't know
about a vampire called Spike,

285
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,049
- So?
- He said that...

286
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,940
...before I mentioned
anything about Spike.

287
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,220
So you'll find him at a joint
on 3rd called the Orbit Room,

288
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,230
Okay. I'll start with Manny The Pig.

289
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,210
Work your way down,

290
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,190
He left for the club!

291
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,309
Try the game.

292
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,099
Put them down.

293
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:10,180
He'll kill me if I talk.

294
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,039
How healthy do you think it is
to stay quiet?

295
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,049
He's out back.

296
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,309
Let her go.

297
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,890
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a hell of a buzz-kill?

298
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,720
Run!

299
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,259
Caught me fair and square, white hat.

300
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,829
Guess there's nothing to do now
but go along quietly...

301
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,660
...and pay my debt to society.

302
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:56,380
You think you can come to my town
and pull this crap?

303
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,750
You never learn, Spike.

304
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,829
I may be a slow learner, but...

305
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,890
...eventually I catch on.

306
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,339
Angel should have called by now.

307
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,859
This is bad.

308
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,619
Maybe not.

309
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,599
Maybe he did away with Spike in short
order and decided to try surfing.

310
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,079
Right. What am I worried about?
Angel has the ring.

311
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,490
- Right?
- Absolutely.

312
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,869
I bet he's hanging 10 off the sandy
shores of Malibu right now.

313
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,640
Wind in his hair,
bikini babes a-whistling,

314
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,509
Marcus is an expert.

315
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,420
Some say "artist" but I've never
been comfortable with labels.

316
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,779
He's a bloody king of torture, he is.

317
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,460
Humans, demons...

318
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,059
...politicians, makes no difference.

319
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,740
Some say he invented
several of the classics...

320
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,710
...but he won't tell me which ones.

321
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,230
Beneath the cool exterior,
you'll find he's rather shy.

322
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,660
Except with kids.

323
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,720
You like kids, don't you, Marcus?

324
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,369
Well, likes to eat.

325
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,230
And other nasty things.

326
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:47,829
His skin.

327
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,700
Annoying, isn't it? Still attached.

328
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,819
Over 200 years of living
and so little external damage.

329
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,460
What about internal?

330
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,599
Do you two need to be alone
or can we get on with it?

331
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,329
He's known love.

332
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,440
And with a slayer no less.
How's that for perversion?

333
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,910
And he has a soul.

334
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,450
Right, a vampire with a soul cursed
to walk the earth, trying to do good.

335
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,509
That's not a problem, is it?

336
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,000
On the contrary. Creatures with souls
have something to lose.

337
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,109
Souls, fingers, toes,
let's get chopping, shall we?

338
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,089
I want my damn ring.

339
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,240
What do you want, Angel?

340
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,049
Are you gonna torture me
or just bore me to death?

341
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,309
Probably a little of both.

342
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,990
Someone's having shish kebab.

343
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,900
What do you want?

344
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,690
What do you want, Angel?

345
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,859
House in the country.
Running shoes you can wear to dinner.

346
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,299
Why do you keep asking that?

347
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,309
And why do you keep playing Brahms?

348
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:59,329
Actually it's Mozart. Symphony 41.
I find it very effective.

349
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,470
Personally, I like his
older, funnier symphonies.

350
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,589
Look, I want my ring!

351
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,990
And if I don't get it pretty soon...

352
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,470
...I'll stake him right here and now!

353
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,609
He knows you won't kill him
until you get the ring.

354
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,240
He knows you're lying.

355
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,839
Then you get it for me.

356
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,880
Soon he'll tell me everything
and then some.

357
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,789
And he knows I'm not lying.

358
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,710
I believe he does.

359
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,759
- You're an idiot.
- You think?

360
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,819
Because I'm not the one
with the hot pokers in my side.

361
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,329
You hired a vampire.

362
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,099
What do you think he'll do with it
when he finds it? Hand it to you?

363
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,940
Oh, good lord, why didn't I think--?
Oh, half a mo. I did.

364
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,210
I hired a guy who doesn't care
about the ring or anything else...

365
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,490
...except taking blokes apart
one piece at a time.

366
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,480
It's called addiction.

367
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,589
We all have them.

368
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,430
I believe yours is named
Slutty the Vampire Slayer.

369
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:05,900
Thank you.

370
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:10,250
Speaking of little Buff...

371
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,849
...I ran into her recently.
Your name didn't come up.

372
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,670
Although she has been awful busy...

373
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,019
...jumping the bones of the first
lunkhead who came along.

374
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,809
Good-looking fellow.
Used her shamelessly.

375
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,470
She is cute when she's hurting,
isn't she?

376
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,369
She's cuter when she's
kicking your ass.

377
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,299
I think I'll get some fresh air,
leave you two kids to it.

378
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,789
Now that's music.

379
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:01,589
If I was a ring...

380
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,250
...where would I be?

381
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,130
Well, this is fun...

382
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,569
...but it's gonna get old real fast.

383
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,910
Most things that live and breathe...

384
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,220
...hate the dark and love the light.

385
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,599
We're different though, aren't we?

386
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,920
We hate the light of day
and it hates us back in kind.

387
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,339
You hid the ring, Angel.

388
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:02,109
You could be walking in the light
right now. So I have to wonder...

389
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,440
...what do you want if not the ring?

390
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,490
It's through the pain that we find
the truth of who we are.

391
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,069
It strips us of our defenses.

392
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,109
We are made innocent again,
like children.

393
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,829
I like children, Angel.

394
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm here to help you
find that innocence...

395
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,279
...here...

396
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,289
...with the light.

397
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,430
When you're through giving the place
the Johnny Depp-over...

398
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,410
...I hope you have the cash
to pay for all this.

399
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,180
Cordelia.

400
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,680
- Love the hair.
- Wish I could say the same to you.

401
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,630
That's close enough, dimwit.

402
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:43,750
What is it with you good guys
running in packs?

403
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:46,400
- Who's this one?
- More than meets the eye.

404
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,150
The mick's got spine.

405
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,269
Maybe I'll snap it in two.

406
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,390
Do you want me to use this?

407
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,809
You'll be dead
before the arrow leaves the bow.

408
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,660
Now where was I?

409
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,109
Tired of looking for that ring.
You two should take over.

410
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,960
Where's Angel?

411
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,829
Tall, brooding guy? Caveman brow?

412
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,380
He's having the hell
tortured out of him.

413
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,529
You know how stubborn he is.

414
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,210
He might die
before he gives up the ring.

415
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:19,960
Why don't you two find it real fast
and give it to me.

416
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,009
I'll let Angel go.

417
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,200
I don't trust you.

418
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,740
To coin a popular Sunnydale phrase,
"Duh."

419
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,609
But you do have until sundown.

420
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,809
I'll be behind Peterson's Fishery,
between Seward and Westminster.

421
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,720
Don't be late.

422
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,509
You did terrible things
when you were bad, didn't you?

423
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,079
And now you're trying so hard
to do good.

424
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,670
But Angel...

425
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,250
...there's nothing bad or good...

426
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,869
...but thinking makes it so.

427
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,960
Now, I can make the pain go away...

428
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,609
...and, as you know,
I can bring it bank again.

429
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,670
What do you want, Angel?

430
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,019
I think I know,
but I'd like to hear it from you.

431
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,210
The truth.

432
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,049
I'll know if you're lying.

433
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,890
I want...

434
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:31,900
...forgiveness.

435
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:33,240
Yes.

436
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,690
That's the truth.

437
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,589
And you want to earn it.

438
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,160
You don't take the easy way out.

439
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,599
Which is why I like you so much.

440
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,230
In the end...

441
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,640
...you won't feel guilt or remorse...

442
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:49,500
...or anything but pure darkness.

443
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,859
In the end, the ring, the past...

444
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:55,500
... none of it will mean anything
anymore.

445
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,730
You'll be free.

446
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,289
I promise.

447
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,470
And I promise...

448
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:03,269
...to kill you.

449
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,460
Staking the torturer...

450
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,720
...is strictly prohibited.

451
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,329
Easy, big fella.
Still need that ring.

452
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,609
Now you've made him mad.
Wouldn't want to be in your chains.

453
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,630
It won't be long now.

454
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,779
Well, what say I grab a pair of
needlenose pliers and give a hand?

455
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,309
- Drat.
- What?

456
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,099
It's not in the freezer or the toilet.

457
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,710
In the movies,
it's always in one of those.

458
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,160
- It's not here.
- No.

459
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:37,890
We looked everywhere.

460
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,529
- Except?
- The rat-infested tunnels...

461
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,140
...he uses to get around
in the daytime.

462
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,769
This is not a needle in a haystack.

463
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,609
This is a needle in Kansas.

464
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,410
I know, you're right.

465
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,119
We just gotta keep looking.

466
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:21,900
Here!

467
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,759
How did you do that?

468
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,859
- You gotta get lucky sometimes.
- I could hug you!

469
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,720
Not that lucky.
Come on, we gotta save Angel.

470
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,759
By giving Spike
what he wants so he can kill us.

471
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,180
Right. No. We need a plan.

472
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,849
So where's my ring?

473
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,500
- Not on us.
- But we know where it is.

474
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,849
And suddenly I'm so painfully bored.

475
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,430
Time runs short, children.

476
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,460
Give me that ring
as if Angel's life depended on it.

477
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,640
Listen, you little Cockney,
take us to Angel, now.

478
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,150
Show us he's still in one piece...

479
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,329
...we'll tell you
where to find your ring.

480
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,049
He's still alive, I think.

481
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:09,369
"In one piece" was never
a part of the deal.

482
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,750
Lucy, I'm home!

483
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,369
- Angel!
- Hey. Hey.

484
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,240
A deal's a deal.

485
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:18,829
Cordelia.

486
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,980
Our deal was for the ring. So...

487
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,589
...you've wasted enough
of my time, I'd like it...

488
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,500
...now!

489
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,289
You want the ring, you dog?

490
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,329
Fetch!

491
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,819
Okay. Good.
You've got the ring, we've got Angel.

492
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,690
Now you'll leave us alone
and we'll leave.

493
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,019
Come on. You don't really think
we're gonna do that, do you?

494
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:46,640
- Not really.
- No.

495
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,339
Spike.

496
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:14,880
Where's the ring?

497
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,180
Bloody hell.

498
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,450
Son of a bitch!

499
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,069
I do the work...

500
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,049
...I do the digging...

501
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,710
...fight off a slayer...

502
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,210
...drive to L.A...

503
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,730
...hire the help...

504
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,990
...and what do I get?

505
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,920
Royally screwed is what!

506
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:05,819
Well, that cinches it.
No more partners.

507
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,930
From now on, I'm my own man.

508
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,900
Lone wolf.

509
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,329
Sole survivor.

510
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,630
Look out!

511
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:21,130
Here comes Spike,
the biggest, baddest mother--

512
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,470
I really hope they kill each other.

513
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,009
- How is he?
- He'll live.

514
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,519
He needs a hospital.

515
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,660
Which one?
They all specialize in humans.

516
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:03,140
He's right. Too risky.

517
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:04,690
Know any first aid?

518
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,829
Your basic 6th grade,
but I can improvise.

519
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,480
- If we find someplace dark--
- Turn around.

520
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,200
- He's delirious, ignore him.
- Turn around.

521
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,240
Why? It's daylight
and you're ringless.

522
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,559
Unless you change the act
to human torch, no.

523
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:20,359
She's right. You're death on toast.

524
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:22,690
No shape to fight a torture demon.

525
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,710
God!

526
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,029
Okay, he's got a thing for children.

527
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,630
Oz, turn around.
He can't have gone far.

528
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,259
Hello, boys and girls.

529
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,039
Run. Move your little scout legs.
Now! Go!

530
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,460
Damn it, I'll get him.

531
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,139
Doyle!

532
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,190
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.

533
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,949
Where is he?

534
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,719
- Are you planning to kill me?
- Well, after all, I promised.

535
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,599
You never cracked me.

536
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,440
You tried, but you failed.

537
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,940
Now that's gotta be torture.

538
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,349
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'm--

539
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,329
Thanks for the help.

540
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,659
You were key.

541
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:04,719
You're...

542
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,800
...incredibly pale.

543
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,789
Look, you should lie down.
We should take you home.

544
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,190
Just give him a minute.

545
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,329
He's very pale.

546
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,360
Paler than most people.

547
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,710
So, how long has it been
between sunsets?

548
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,960
Two hundred years, give or take.

549
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,099
You gotta be feeling
damn good then. This ring...

550
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,849
...changes everything, don't it?

551
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:15,730
It's spectacular, but I promise there
will be another one again tomorrow.

552
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,170
Not for me.

553
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,719
What are you saying? The city will
get hit by a meteor before tomorrow?

554
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:27,059
No, it's too horrible to say.
I can't bring myself to say the other.

555
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,829
I'm not gonna wear the ring.

556
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:30,599
That was the other.

557
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,429
You got an addiction to the brooding
part of life. Anyone tell you that?

558
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,619
Once or twice.

559
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:42,630
Care to explain?

560
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,340
This ring is redemption.
What you're waiting for.

561
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,699
No, it just looks like it.

562
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,940
- Think what you're saying.
- I have.

563
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,690
I've thought of it from every angle,
and I figure I did a lot of damage.

564
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:00,210
More than you can imagine.

565
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:06,059
You don't get it because your period
of self-flagellation isn't over?

566
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,920
Think of all
the daytime people you could help.

567
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,969
They have help.

568
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:14,070
The whole world is designed for them.

569
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,070
So much that they have no idea
what goes on after dark.

570
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,559
They don't see the weak ones
lost in the night...

571
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,920
...or the things that prey on them.

572
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:28,050
And if I join them...

573
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,449
...maybe I'd stop seeing too.

574
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,059
And who'd look out
for all the insomniacs?

575
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,960
I was brought back for a reason.

576
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:42,019
And I don't think it was
for 18 holes at Rancho.

577
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,900
That Rachel girl
with the crazy boyfriend called...

578
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,530
...and said to say thanks
and that she found a little faith.

579
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,760
Said you'd know what that means.

580
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:32,429
I don't know about you,
but I had a nice day.

581
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:39,090
Except for the bulk of it
where I was nearly tortured to death.

582
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,039
You stood up.

583
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,900
Oh, God. I was this close
to telling him everything.

584
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,280
One more hot poker
and I was giving him the ring...

585
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,530
...your mom, everything.

586
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,010
How is your mom?
