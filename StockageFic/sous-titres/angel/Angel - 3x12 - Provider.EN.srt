1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,070
- Previously:
- His son's part of the prophecy.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,179
The Nyazian scroll said
it wouldn't be born.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,169
Darla died during childbirth.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,699
She sacrificed herself for the child.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,699
I'm his family. My job is
to be everything for him.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,199
- We have to get that baby.
- Bogey at the back door!

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,420
Everyone will come for him.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,859
- No one will touch this child.
- The visions are killing me.

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,309
Humans can't handle the visions.
Only demons can.

10
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,189
So demonize me already.

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,399
We have to solve my vision.
The one I'm having now.

12
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,799
- Cordy....
- What?

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,549
Holtz, Daniel.
Vampire killer. Circa 1754.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,289
I know what it's like to grieve.
I want to help you.

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,219
Stay the hell away from me.

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,020
- I'll teach you to fight.
- What's in it for you?

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,060
- Help me kill a vampire.
- You don't need me.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,719
I do. This vampire is strong.

19
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,180
Sixty. Seventy. Eighty.

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,659
One. Two. Three.

21
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,640
Angel.

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,549
How's the Connor fund?

23
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,090
There was $1.83 in change
in the cushions.

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,510
That's perfectly good money
just laying around.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,670
- How's it going?
- Moments away.

26
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:43,500
Make that bigger.

27
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,480
Bold but, you know, tasteful.

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,819
Tasteful. Sure.

29
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,959
You are so cute. Yes, you are.

30
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,209
You're just the best little boy
in the whole world.

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,129
- How's my little man?
- Where has his father been?

32
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,819
Papa's got mouths to feed.

33
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,330
I have a mouth too.
Always have had one.

34
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,259
Kind of known for it,
and we've fed it fine for years. Yes.

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,169
Angel, I'm glad you wanna
take care of your son. I am.

36
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,000
Just don't lose sight of the mission.

37
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,750
We have to earn money.
Not just for Connor.

38
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,719
First and foremost,
we work for The Powers.

39
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,169
Help the helpless.
Promise me we won't neglect that.

40
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,990
I promise. I promise. Well?

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,270
We hired some guys.
6000 of these all over town.

42
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,900
Nice! I'd call me. Wouldn't you?

43
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,849
Hey, the website's up. We're live.

44
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,189
We're live, little guy. Come on.

45
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,050
Beautiful. We're online.
We got flyers, yellow pages.

46
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,789
Welcome to a new era
of Angel Investigations.

47
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:08,750
All we do now is wait for that phone
to ring and the money to roll in.

48
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,379
Because someone's gotta clothe and
educate and feed this little guy, huh?

49
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,300
Yep. All we have to do is wait.

50
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,360
It's just a matter of time.

51
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,289
Don't worry. This town's full
of people with problems.

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,490
Come on, come on!

53
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,409
Come on!

54
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,629
Fabrizio's Pizza.

55
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,699
Is this the right phone number?

56
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,430
That's the last of them.
Six thousand new ones.

57
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,279
- Adorable.
- So sweet.

58
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,699
- I meant the baby.
- I meant the hot mama.

59
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,600
- Sorry about the mix-up.
- We can't afford more mistakes.

60
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,180
Making mistakes costs money and
money's our number one priority. Lorne.

61
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,000
If this is about the baby
formula I snagged, sorry.

62
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,250
It was that or a glass of pig's blood.

63
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:10,250
By the way, baby formula
and Kahlúa, not bad.

64
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,459
Find out what Holtz is up to.
He's out there. We can't forget it.

65
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,870
- He's our number one priority.
- I thought--

66
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,610
Finding Holtz and making money
are our two priorities.

67
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,769
Helping the helpless, Holtz...

68
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,750
...and making money are
our three number one priorities.

69
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,209
Hey, look, we've got
some hits on our website!

70
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:34,889
Angel Investigations.
May I help you?

71
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,889
Angel Investigations.

72
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,250
- Absolutely.
- We're in business.

73
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,540
You should be thanking me.

74
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,189
For disobeying an order?

75
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,610
For dusting two vamps.

76
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,740
Two vampires from whom
I had told you to walk away.

77
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,060
- Guess I misunderstood.
- Which is why we're here.

78
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,689
Would a couple light bulbs
and some plumbing kill you?

79
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,240
We are here to determine
whether or not...

80
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,660
...you have the commitment
necessary for the work at hand.

81
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,850
At hand? That's a joke, right?

82
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,879
Why are you wasting my time?

83
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,459
What do you want from me?

84
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,949
I just told you. Commitment.

85
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,660
Something you must now
convince me you have.

86
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,509
So I've explained why
I'm doing this. Why are you?

87
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,040
Let's just say feeling something
is better than feeling nothing.

88
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,949
Take it out anytime you like.
If you're here when I return...

89
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,709
...we'll consider the next phase
of our partnership.

90
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,709
Welcome to Angel Investigations, Mr...

91
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,170
...Bleeshusengrung.

92
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,589
Have a seat and an associate
will be right with you.

93
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,189
- Lorne, non-human on deck.
- Coming.

94
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,720
The guys with the face plates,
they're Nahdrahs.

95
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,169
I speak their lingo, sort of.

96
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,289
They have a job for our leader
and a lot of money.

97
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,779
- Let's not keep them waiting.
- Our leader being Wesley.

98
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,679
They saw his web articles on DNA
fusion comparisons in Tri-ped demons.

99
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,289
Wesley, Wesley.
Talk to the Nahdrahs.

100
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,879
- Office free? It's kind of personal.
- Yeah, go.

101
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,429
This keeps up, we may
have to incorporate, huh?

102
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,559
- We're getting stretched thin here.
- We can handle it.

103
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,659
Really? Why don't you handle it by
picking up lines two, three and four?

104
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,500
Angel Investigations.
Your problems are ours.

105
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,110
Okay, how urgent is it?

106
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,720
What do you do for a living?

107
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,269
Good company. You own it?
Okay, hold on. Pen, paper, quick.

108
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,470
I don't sleep. I'm afraid to go out
or answer the phone.

109
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,029
I hate stalkers.
We'll put a stop to it. Have a seat.

110
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,370
Thank you.

111
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,529
- So do you know who this guy is?
- Yeah. It's Brian, my ex-boyfriend.

112
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,399
- Have you been to the police?
- Yeah.

113
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,059
They act like I'm some kind of nut.
Like I'm just making it up.

114
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,269
The cops don't do a thing
till somebody's dead.

115
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,039
- Somebody is dead.
- Who?

116
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,110
Brian. Isn't that the kind
of stuff you guys deal with?

117
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,740
All the time. So your dead boyfriend
is stalking you?

118
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,830
Well, I mean,
he's not my boyfriend now.

119
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,289
The article I'm currently
writing posits a formula...

120
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,120
...for the genome mapping
of creatures without genes.

121
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,700
It's an exciting arena.

122
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,070
One we can download at I'll-never-
know-the-love-of-a-woman dot-com.

123
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,850
Let's get to business.
They wanna buy your head.

124
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,889
A little rusty with the lingo.
I should clarify that.

125
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,990
They want your mind.
They're celebrating the prince's....

126
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,870
It's like a birthday,
only they're disgorged, not born.

127
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:44,169
They need you to solve a puzzle
so they can give it to him.

128
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,669
- Could be interesting.
- They're puzzle people.

129
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,389
Did you see their tunics?
Geometric shapes.

130
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,500
Each a prime number,
if you count the edges...

131
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,950
...arranged in order
of exponential accumulation.

132
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,070
Yes, I did...not notice that at all.

133
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,179
They wanna know why your girlfriend
was pointing. I better tell them.

134
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,960
She's not my-- Silly.

135
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,250
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, they liked you.

136
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,830
So much they ran away?

137
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,039
They either have to consult
with the prince or eat a monkey.

138
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,490
Wes, I think I need you.

139
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,600
Great. I'm on my way.

140
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,539
- Big case. Gotta run. Here.
- Oh.

141
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,039
He needs changing.
Oh, and a bottle, 3:00.

142
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,559
Hi, there.

143
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,059
Right. Yeah, okay.
That's good for us.

144
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,169
Tell him a six-month million-dollar
guarantee, and we'll cover the cost.

145
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,090
Yeah. No, I get that. But we
need a decision by tomorrow.

146
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,480
Somebody walked into my office.
I'll call you.

147
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,500
- Mr. Angel.
- Just Angel.

148
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,669
Harlan Elster.
Thanks for meeting me.

149
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,779
No problem. I know what it's like when
your name's on the letterhead and....

150
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,809
- You're not exactly what I pictured.
- No?

151
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,009
You're pretty well-coifed. You're not
afraid to get a little mussed, are you?

152
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,789
That's what you'll be
just by going in there.

153
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,649
- In where?
- 83rd and Vermont.

154
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,759
Used to be low-income housing.
Now it's a nest.

155
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,590
Boarded-up windows, no electricity,
sewer access. They like it dark.

156
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,759
- Vampires.
- Whole gang.

157
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,330
Those photos were taken
by the last guy.

158
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:42,419
What happened to him?

159
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,200
He got mussed.

160
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,779
You have much experience
with vampires?

161
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,970
- Some.
- Well, not like these.

162
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,669
They're not out for blood.
They want money.

163
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,480
- Money?
- Yeah, I know.

164
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,240
Whoever heard of a vampire
out to make a buck, right?

165
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,009
They're putting the squeeze
on businessmen.

166
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,070
We pay them a protection fee,
and they don't eat our employees.

167
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,389
- They're demanding $5000 by midnight.
- Wow.

168
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,659
I'm prepared to pay you 10
to make this problem go away.

169
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,629
Five thousand now.
Remainder when the job's finished.

170
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,740
That would make 10.

171
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,730
Which is more than
they're asking you for.

172
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:32,279
- But this isn't about money.
- No, of course it's not...

173
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,090
...about that, money.

174
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,269
I'll get right on this.

175
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,970
- Thanks.
- Sure.

176
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,669
- What are you doing in my office?
- Mr. Elster.

177
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,000
Decided to stick around.

178
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,490
You asked me what I wanted from you.

179
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:28,759
Go out and find others like you.
People who have suffered as we have.

180
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,610
People with the same rage,
the same fire.

181
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:37,860
You'll know them when you see them.
Their eyes will look like this feels.

182
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,340
Are we clear? Have we learned
our lessons, Justine?

183
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,919
We're clear.

184
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,970
You son of a bitch.

185
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,990
Is this country great, or what?
5000 smackaroos.

186
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,549
All I have to do to get 5000 more
is clean out a vamp nest.

187
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,340
- Where's Wes and Gunn?
- On a case.

188
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,519
A young woman's dead boyfriend
is stalking her.

189
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,519
- That's terrible. Did you--?
- I ran her credit.

190
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,169
Nice. How's my little magna cum laude,
Notre Dame, class of 2020?

191
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,240
I don't think it's a great idea to be
working on so many cases at once.

192
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,059
What if we're out making money and
some poor devil comes in for our help?

193
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,909
- Buon giorno, everybody!
- Have you been drinking?

194
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,769
I can hold my liquor. Unfortunately
I can't say the same for fire water.

195
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,179
- Aren't they the same?
- Hey, Fred.

196
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,370
This is special fire water, used
to loosen up my Gar-wawk snitch.

197
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,240
They light the water on fire and
a bong and look out, Houston!

198
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,230
- You learn anything about Holtz?
- Yeah. He's not fond of you.

199
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,850
I'm led to believe that he
and his Grapplers had plans to...you.

200
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,440
- Is my breath stinky?
- Yeah.

201
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,649
Holtz is using the Grapplers
as soldiers.

202
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,259
No, he poisoned them, and he's
looking for human replacements.

203
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,039
- We know where he is?
- I got rats looking all over town.

204
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,139
Not real rats, except two of them.
I don't feel good.

205
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,649
We've got company.

206
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,100
Lorne? It's all
snap-crackle-pop to me.

207
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,590
These are the guys that wanted Wesley.

208
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,039
- Not anymore. Now they want Fred.
- For what?

209
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,639
They think she can solve the puzzle
they wanna give to their prince.

210
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,169
- They weren't offended, but impressed.
- Really?

211
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:54,840
Where would she have to go
and how long would it take?

212
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,879
They live on a barge
docked in the marina.

213
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,970
And a day or two. Depends on
how long it takes her to solve it.

214
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,519
- You game?
- Sure.

215
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,049
You have to go.
Tell them it won't be cheap.

216
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,240
They're getting two employees.
That's salary, per diem, overtime.

217
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,859
Okay, okay.

218
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,369
They apologize for the paltry offering
and hope you'll accept.... $50,000?!

219
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,319
- Fifty...
- ...thousand...

220
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,630
...dollars?

221
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,309
We accept.

222
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,380
I consider myself independent,
and it's hard to ask for help...

223
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,140
...but it feels good
for you to be here.

224
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,109
That woman's right.
You inspire confidence.

225
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,299
- Which woman?
- Brunette. Really cute. Texan, maybe.

226
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,779
- Fred.
- Fred.

227
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,450
Said I inspire confidence.

228
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:03,890
- The comment was directed at me.
- Really? Because I don't think so.

229
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,880
Here, this is Brian.
Not exactly a rocket scientist.

230
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,970
But he's so sweet.

231
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,809
Ever meet somebody and know
you belong together? It feels--

232
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,210
- Comfortable.
- Comfortable.

233
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,230
- You read the same science journals.
- Laugh at the same jokes.

234
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,940
And the sex.
Oh, God, do I miss the sex.

235
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,559
Tell me about it.

236
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,539
So explain this. How can Brian
be stalking me if he's dead?

237
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,220
Witchcraft, black magic, voodoo...

238
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,259
...zombification,
demon possession, vampirism.

239
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,079
Why's he here?
What does he want?

240
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,930
Perhaps he left something unfinished.
Something he wants to say.

241
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,720
He may just want
to eat your intestines.

242
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,700
We don't know that he's a zombie.
And the flesh-eating's a myth.

243
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:54,470
Zombies mangle, mutilate
and occasionally wear human flesh.

244
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,369
So there's no reason
to be frightened.

245
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,900
Right, then. Zombie it is.

246
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,940
Are you okay?

247
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,720
I was seasick when
we were still on dry land.

248
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,849
- Do I look greener than usual?
- A little.

249
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,480
Nice décor. It's sort of a Jules Verne
meets Leona Helmsley.

250
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,089
Come on.

251
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,170
Oh, great.
They want to take our picture.

252
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,589
Oh, terrific.

253
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,430
This is the puzzle.

254
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,269
I'm guessing it fits together in a sort
of algorismic sequence.

255
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,750
Any hints?

256
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,930
Just one. He said if they knew
how to do it, you wouldn't be here.

257
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:03,369
So.... Causation corollary.

258
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,119
Causatum corollary.

259
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,470
Are we talking a closed curve
in a simply connected domain of zero?

260
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,119
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?

261
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,609
Oh, hors d'oeuvres. I couldn't.

262
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,970
I had eyeballs and insects
for breakfast.

263
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:41,259
Aren't we just the scary
serial vamps...

264
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,869
...with the spooky lair?

265
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,390
And the taking of the trophies
of our victims?

266
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,640
Lame.

267
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,779
Next time you hit the yard sales,
avoid the wooden furniture.

268
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,650
I hear wicker's nice.

269
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,789
Oh, great. Two more.

270
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,400
Dibs on the coat.

271
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:48,890
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

272
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,069
- I'm looking for Harlan Elster.
- I'm Harlan Elster.

273
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,549
- That's bad.
- How's it bad?

274
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,259
Well, because the Harlan Elster
I'm looking for gave me this.

275
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,289
Really? Well, he gave me this.
At least mine's real.

276
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,390
The man who forged my name,
your height? Less beat up?

277
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,450
Yeah, that's him.

278
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,599
Sam Ryan. Used to work for me.
Fired him six months ago.

279
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,789
He came to me to bankroll
his kooky scheme.

280
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:28,519
- Kooky scheme?
- He's been off since his friend died.

281
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:33,640
Wanted me to pay some ghostbuster
to clean out an abandoned rat-hole.

282
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:37,519
He was convinced vampires
were nesting there.

283
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,390
Some people would take advantage
of a guy like that.

284
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,859
Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:47,329
Immortals living in a rat-infested
building, guarding their treasure.

286
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,920
Right.

287
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:51,829
Treasure?

288
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,299
There's an ascending and descending
causation instantly proved by...

289
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,329
...that.

290
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,509
I think I'm onto something here.

291
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,599
Yeah, me too. Unfortunately
it requires a vomitorium.

292
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:09,170
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

293
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,880
I'll just go use the facilities.
Keep up the good work.

294
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,930
Thanks.

295
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,230
Hm. Well, I figured it was a long shot.
But I really can float, you know.

296
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,200
Well, I did at one time
during my last vision.

297
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:35,009
Somebody needs a change.

298
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,589
Before that, believe me...

299
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:41,680
...there was no "floaty at peace
with my destiny" to the visions.

300
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:45,140
There was just killer pain.

301
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,670
Unfortunately,
that's not an exaggeration.

302
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,900
They really were killing me.

303
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,809
So The Powers That Be
put a little demon in me.

304
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,410
And as far as side effects go...

305
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,470
...the visions are a breeze now.

306
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,890
I don't know
what else might be in store.

307
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,369
I'm keeping an eye out
for horns and a tail.

308
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:15,839
It just occurred to me what
a weird life you're in for, little guy.

309
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:20,750
Your Aunt Cordy gets visions
and your daddy's a....

310
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,650
Well, you won't see him
aging a whole lot...

311
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,930
...or catching surf and sun in Malibu.

312
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,859
But he is a good man, a champion,
and he loves you very much.

313
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,539
Plus he's quite the natty dresser.

314
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,950
And your daddy's out right now
fighting evil for money.

315
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,910
- Give it back.
- I've earned it. Is it a Rolex?

316
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,430
Timex.

317
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,069
Considering the trouble you went
through, we know it's not just a watch.

318
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:22,299
- That's true. It's not.
- Probably worth more than 10 grand.

319
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,460
A lot more.

320
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,740
What's it do? Open a portal?
Raise an army?

321
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:33,170
It glows in the dark.
Probably about all it will do now.

322
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,930
They cracked it
when they took it off him.

323
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,440
I told him to let them have it,
but he wouldn't give it up.

324
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:45,660
- It was the first thing I bought him.
- These vampires killed your friend.

325
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:50,009
I'm sorry about what I did.
I didn't know what to do.

326
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,400
- So you lied to me.
- I'm sorry.

327
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:58,190
I didn't kill three vampires for
nothing. Ten grand, that was the deal.

328
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:00,740
- Seven.
- Fine, I'll take seven.

329
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,130
You said three vampires.
There were seven.

330
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:11,009
- Which would make four more?
- Four more.

331
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,359
You're gonna discover there's
a lot of cool things in this world.

332
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:19,849
Fifty grand,
way up there on the list.

333
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,069
We're just gonna lock this up
in the safe and--

334
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:27,670
Right after this vision.

335
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,299
Oh, God.
Fred, don't solve that puzzle.

336
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,579
Shouldn't be long now.

337
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,250
Do you know how much longer we'll be?
I've got plans this evening.

338
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,019
We've taken every precaution,
secured every entrance--

339
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:01,150
With the exception of the skylight.

340
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,569
Allie! Allie, baby, I just--

341
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,009
Into the bedroom!

342
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,359
Well, your Uncle Wes and Uncle Gunn,
not picking up either.

343
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,779
And your daddy, he doesn't know how
to work voice mail or keep a promise.

344
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,690
So we'll go down to the marina,
return the money...

345
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,500
...and explain it was all
a big mistake.

346
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,490
Allie, why won't you talk to me?

347
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:48,480
Because you're dead! Now, go away!

348
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,140
I'm paying good money here.
Can you please get rid of him?

349
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,529
Just give me another chance, baby.

350
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,390
- Who are they?
- We're protecting her from you.

351
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,230
Protection?
I thought you were dating them.

352
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,099
This is exactly
why I broke up with you.

353
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,480
You're suffocating me. Now, get lost!

354
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,869
- What's he doing?
- Pouting.

355
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,660
Okay, that's it.

356
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,460
You know, this is so typical of you.
You're all bluster, then you pout.

357
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,349
- I thought we had fun together.
- We did. But you're needy.

358
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,619
Needy? Because I cared?

359
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,650
Caring didn't entitle you to read
my diary, follow me....

360
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,279
I never-- Okay, I read your diary.

361
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,069
Does that give you any reason
to poison me?

362
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,500
What?

363
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:03,450
- You'll believe a zombie?
- She killed you?

364
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,519
- I'd forgive her if she took me back.
- You're kidding.

365
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:08,430
No.

366
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,710
I've seen the guys you're going out
with, and you're not having any fun.

367
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,420
Come on. Let's give it another shot.

368
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,509
What do you say, baby? Me and you.

369
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,089
- I can't. It's creepy.
- Come on. I miss you.

370
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:32,980
Well, I don't know.
Maybe I was a little...

371
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:37,009
...hasty.

372
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:48,130
Will that be cash or charge?

373
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,990
All right, you're kidding me, right?

374
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,950
Sorry. I don't get paid,
I can't fight.

375
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,750
- I can't hold this by myself.
- Yeah, I see that.

376
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,150
- They're coming through.
- Okay.

377
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll help barricade it. But that's it.

378
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,700
I'm sorry I lied to you.

379
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:12,730
You did the wrong thing.
Your heart was in the right place.

380
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,289
- Your motives were noble.
- Thank you.

381
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:20,809
- I've been accused of nobility.
- Well, then you understand.

382
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,730
Being a champion's not all
good deeds and happy endings.

383
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,890
A lot goes on behind the scenes.
People don't consider that.

384
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,809
- We got real trouble here.
- We can work something out.

385
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,549
- Own a car?
- The bank owns it.

386
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,839
- House?
- I rent.

387
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,609
How's your credit?

388
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,319
I spent everything I had
tracking these guys.

389
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,859
I don't know what to say. I can't kill
on deferment. Sets a precedent.

390
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:58,009
Oh, it was nothing.

391
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,500
Are we going somewhere to celebrate?

392
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,740
Say, has anyone seen
my friend with the horns?

393
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,970
He wasn't feeling so good,
and I'm a little worried about him.

394
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,220
And me, now.

395
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,079
Yeah, I know.
We're in a bit of a situation here.

396
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,710
Oh, God. I don't have
to marry him, do I?

397
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:31,500
In fact, no. And that's something
we can be grateful for.

398
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:33,519
What are they gonna do?

399
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,420
The prince's head, or heads,
wear out every so often and they--

400
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,299
Cut off someone else's
and give him a new one?

401
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:42,029
Uh....

402
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,650
Lorne, help! Help!

403
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,069
Hey! I'd just like a word here.

404
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:56,450
You guys are so gonna
get your butts kicked.

405
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:57,859
- Lorne.
- Sorry.

406
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,119
I yield
to the person not tied up.

407
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,750
- Translate.
- Okay.

408
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,779
There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

409
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,630
And I know you're men of honor,
and I know we can make an exchange...

410
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,460
...in a civilized manner.

411
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,539
We return your gift,
and you return Fred.

412
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,260
Sorry, but we need her head at work.

413
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:29,139
- Firmly attached to her body.
- That goes without saying.

414
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,329
Say it.

415
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,210
I told them what they had to do
and what would happen if they didn't.

416
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,670
We are in no position to threaten.

417
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,130
Sure we are. Angel, Wes
and Gunn can take them.

418
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:53,030
- Where are they, anyway?
- Out making money.

419
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,710
So when I said they were surrounded
by warriors, I was stretching the truth?

420
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,739
Just enough to get us all killed.

421
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,469
What about the complimentary
barricading?

422
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,960
It's gonna give.
I'm getting you out of here.

423
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,829
- Let's go.
- No, you go.

424
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,449
- What?
- I'm not leaving. I can't.

425
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,730
- You can take four vampires alone?
- Probably not.

426
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:35,710
But they killed Jack.
If I run now, I'll run forever.

427
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,179
Do you think this is
what Jack would want?

428
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,710
I think Jack would want to be here,
but that's never gonna happen.

429
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:54,840
You take on a job in good faith,
you expect to be compensated.

430
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,989
You provide the best service
you can offer. Quality service.

431
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,329
But there's overhead, there's rent,
three phone lines, advertising.

432
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:10,409
It adds up. Here.

433
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,780
Thank you. I can't even
begin to express my....

434
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,590
I owe you.

435
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:20,010
- You're a real champion.
- Whatever. Hello?

436
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,800
Hello? Hello?

437
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,750
- I think that's your voice mail.
- Damn it.

438
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,619
- Lorne, do these guys have groins?
- Is that important right now?

439
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:37,309
- Work with me here.
- I think so.

440
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:40,409
I never knew one intimately.

441
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:07,269
Help! Help her!

442
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,639
- Fred!
- Fred!

443
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,800
Well, I guess you cut
off the snake's head....

444
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,510
You piss the other snakes off.

445
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,980
- I should have listened to you.
- Yeah.

446
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,489
- I shouldn't have left you two alone.
- Well, yeah.

447
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,139
If you can keep your head when those
about you lose theirs, you're lucky.

448
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:09,139
I could kiss you both.

449
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,449
Still tied up down here.

450
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,630
- My hands are turning pink.
- Can I say something?

451
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,559
Money's important,
but it isn't everything.

452
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,099
I got carried away.

453
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:39,840
I just never had a life that was
totally dependent on me before.

454
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:45,039
But that's no excuse....

455
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,210
- Where was I?
- Money's not the most important....

456
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:53,469
No, it's not.
What's important is family...

457
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,139
...and the mission.

458
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,300
They tried to cut Fred's head off.
We earned every penny.

459
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,199
- Hold the baby.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,840
Spending money. All right!

461
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:27,139
I'm just saying, a boat.

462
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,130
No. College fund.

463
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,239
Yes, college fund. And pay our bills.

464
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,309
And put a down payment on a boat.

465
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,030
I'm not getting a boat.

466
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,179
They're fun.

467
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,639
They're expensive.

468
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,159
And when would I go on this boat?

469
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,550
Moonlight sails.

470
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,389
Okay.

471
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:13,300
College fund, pay our bills
and rent a ski condo in Aspen.

472
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:15,969
Ski condo?

473
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,949
There's gotta be some fun
in our lives.

474
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:24,599
I like a ski condo.

475
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,690
Sure.

476
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:29,960
Snow.... Trees....

477
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,300
Chipmunk robots on ice....

478
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:43,059
Chipmunk robots on ice.
