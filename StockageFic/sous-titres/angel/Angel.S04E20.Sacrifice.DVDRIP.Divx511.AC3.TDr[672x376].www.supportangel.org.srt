When the circumstances called for it,
you did what you thought you had to.

what anybody else thought.

But what I can do...

...is take that spear away from you
and snap it into kindling...

Hello again, children.

509
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,849
I believe you've met my father.

00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:25,084
Little mice.

513
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:28,651
They always soft inside.

514
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:32,289
Wretched little...

515
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,650
Time to go dead, mouse.

519
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,247
A little soft yourself in there.

Devour this meat...

521
00:36:57,493 --> 00:37:01,486
...I give unto thee.

522
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:07,722
That creature, he came from a world
that's worshipped Jasmine for millennia.

523
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,806
- A world that we can reach through this.
- What?

524
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:16,483
I think the universe just handed us
our first break.

I really hate today!

526
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,486
More worried about tomorrow myself.
Come on!

527
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:25,522
No inscriptions.
No markings of any kind.

528
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:27,770
No moving parts, as far as I can tell.

529
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:31,369
- So this high priest holds the true name.
- Exactly.

530
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,801
What else do we know about him?

531
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,567
I'm just guessing
that he's bigger and meaner...

532
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,849
...than our big,
mean friend over there.

533
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,965
Wouldn't surprise me.
What about...?

534
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,449
Wes, something is going down.

535
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:52,047
Something?

536
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:55,289
Something bad.

Guys!

542
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:21,162
No words. No word magic.

543
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,361
- Angel, it's Connor. He's here.
- I know.

544
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:27,093
LORNE:
And the National Guard, I think.

545
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,887
- No!
- No word magic. Powerless.

546
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:34,169
Much more power...

547
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,451

Angel, I got it!

- Okay, I'll hold it. You guys, get going.
- No, we can't go, only you.

ANGEL:
What are you talking about?

551
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,881
That thing's world,
the atmosphere will kill us.

We can't help there.

553
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:03,563
But someone who knows the truth
has to live through this.

00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:07,009
- Angel, that's you.
- I can't.

Angel, wait!

00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:34,292
- We can't hold it.
- Time for the big fight scene.
