1
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,549
There's a 503 on the corner
of Wilshire and Vermont,

2
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,429
Owner says he spotted his auto
two blocks around location,

3
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,230
One Mary 20, do you have a name?

4
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,900
- Where?
- There, detective.

5
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,269
It's the same guy.

6
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,760
This makes three.
He's just getting started.

7
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,219
It's the city of dreams.
A mystical oasis...

8
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,539
...willed from a desert.

9
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,860
But even sunny, blond L.A.
has its trashy, dark roots.

10
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,930
And you've learned that
the hard way.

11
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,789
You've talked to the police, but they
can't help, so you've come to us.

12
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,879
I think it's about to speak.

13
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,770
Nobody likes a smart-ass rogue demon
hunter. What do you want, Wesley?

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,530
Just thought we might compare battle
plans from our respective fronts.

15
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,509
I thought you worked alone.

16
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,930
Even a solitary soldier
such as myself recognizes...

17
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,270
...that an exchange of intelligence
benefits the common struggle.

18
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,639
- I brought in your mail and newspaper.
- Oh, thanks.

19
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,509
- So, what have you got?
- Got?

20
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,330
You wanted to compare
skinnies on evil.

21
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,150
Yes, skinnies. Precisely.

22
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,530
Right. Well...

23
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,319
...everything seems quiet.

24
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,219
Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by.

25
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,189
And you?

26
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,400
How's your end of the fight?

27
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm selling to an empty chair.
What do you think?

28
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,879
Quiet all around then.

29
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,620
Well, I'll keep myself available.

30
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,780
The situation can only escalate.
We made a most effective team.

31
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,110
Vanquishing that empathy demon
in short order.

32
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,930
Nobody gouged out my eyes,
so I'm happy.

33
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,060
Yes, most effective.
Your cryptic visions. Angel's brawn.

34
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,879
My highly developed
powers of deduction--

35
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,930
- This isn't our mail.
- Sorry?

36
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,669
See here?
The dentist office next door.

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,719
Oh, I see. I didn't...

38
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,439
...realize.

39
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,770
Something wrong?
You stopped yammering.

40
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,920
I suppose I should return
these items to their proper owner.

41
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,699
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

42
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,850
And Wesley.

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,300
Remember that license plate
we got on that runaway case?

44
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,360
You were gonna follow up.

45
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,410
No go. The DMV's stalker-phobic and--
Wow, you look half dead.

46
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,370
Which, for someone who's completely
dead, would be kind of neat?

47
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,259
License plate, Cordelia?

48
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,560
I thought you could have Police Woman
run it for us on the QT.

49
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,279
- Kate.
- Are you sure you're okay?

50
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:04,879
For a guy who's 200-plus,
you're not usually with the bags.

51
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,439
- I'll do this now.
- Hey!

52
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,839
Look, I'm fine, Cordelia,
all right?

53
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,379
All right.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,649
I'll take the tunnels.

55
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,110
I'm not supposed to release
that information to a civilian.

56
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,920
I know.

57
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,759
- If it were anyone else.
- I appreciate it, Kate.

58
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,519
I know you do. So I don't mind.

59
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,560
- I'll run it myself by morning.
- No rush. Late afternoon.

60
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,040
Evening will be fine.

61
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,819
I won't mind getting
my head out of this case.

62
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,720
- Even for a minute.
- Tough one?

63
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,199
The first victim, Reggie Sparks,
volunteered as a crossing guard.

64
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,019
Jinny Markem, just started 10th grade.

65
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,269
And Jessica Halpren, 25,
worked as a waitress.

66
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,480
Do you know what they have in common?

67
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,339
What he did to them. That's all.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,990
That's not all. They have you.

69
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,319
- The crime scene photos you wanted.
- Thanks.

70
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,019
Stop by tomorrow.

71
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,639
By then, I'll have invaded
a citizen's privacy for you--

72
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,509
It's pretty grim.

73
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,860
I've spent the last 48 hours
creating a profile.

74
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,379
Being inside this guy's head
hasn't been a whole lot of fun.

75
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,680
Tabloids call him "The Pope."
Probably thinks he's doing God's work.

76
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,100
No.

77
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,149
Just the opposite.
This is about mocking God.

78
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:10,779
That's my guess.

79
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,509
- Detective, they're ready for you now.
- Yeah, okay.

80
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,579
Looks like it's show--

81
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,329
--time.

82
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,649
Our suspect will be a white male.

83
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,790
To the observer
he won't seem a monster.

84
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,720
His victims put up little struggle,
so he's likely charming, attractive.

85
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:34,920
At his core, he's a loner.

86
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,370
Possibly a dual personality
who, once the crime's done...

87
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,920
...retains no memory of the act,

88
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,620
He doesn't see his victims as subhuman
but himself as more than human.

89
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,029
A superior species. Stalking
his prey, getting to know them.

90
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:53,699
He's likely unmarried...

91
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,000
...though he may have recently ended
a long-term relationship badly.

92
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,000
We look for a precipitating event
in these cases.

93
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,389
A painful breakup is always
at the top of our list.

94
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,300
Before failing, the relationship...

95
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,959
...may have marked
an inactive period in his life,

96
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,269
He would've regarded it
as a lifeline, his salvation,

97
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,660
But once ended,
resulted in his recidivism,

98
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,189
What's not in question
is his experience,

99
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,170
He's been doing this for a very long
time and he will do it again,

100
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,389
Jeez, Wesley. Hover much?

101
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,769
- Where is he? Where's Angel?
- Not here.

102
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,759
- What's that?
- What it looks like.

103
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,639
It's rude coming into a vampire's
office with one of those.

104
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,860
- Could be misinterpreted.
- You recall this morning...

105
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,240
...that mix-up with the
dentist's mail and newspaper?

106
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,120
That's when I saw this.

107
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,679
Oh, my God. You cut up
Dr. Folger's newspaper?

108
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,590
- You'll get us kicked out of here.
- What? No, the clipping.

109
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,309
"Third Body Found in Alley."
Not exactly front-page news.

110
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:23,769
That is the front page.
Still, note the modus operandi.

111
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,549
- Mutilation with the religious icon?
- I'm against it?

112
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,049
I think you'd better sit down.

113
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:38,409
During my duties as Watcher in
Sunnydale, I did extensive research.

114
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:42,970
Specifically on Angel, given his
uncomfortable proximity to the Slayer.

115
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,840
He looked comfortable to me.

116
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,220
When I saw this story,
it rang chillingly familiar.

117
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,500
So I reacquainted myself with facts.

118
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,990
Confirming, I' m sorry to say,
my grim suspicions.

119
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,950
In the 1700s, it was Angelus'
custom to sign his victims...

120
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,370
...by carving a Christian cross
into their left cheek...

121
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,940
...to let people know he'd been there.

122
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,730
Okay. You get to leave now.

123
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,190
You're not gonna accuse Angel
like this.

124
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,570
- Cordelia--
- No!

125
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,600
I don't care how many files
you have on the things...

126
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,419
...he did back in
the powdered-wig days.

127
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,279
He is good now. He's my friend.

128
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,049
And nothing you can say
will make me turn on a friend.

129
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,320
- Cordelia. He's right.
- You stake him, I'll cut his head off.

130
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,399
Come no closer.

131
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,200
I won't hurt you.

132
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,019
That what you told
Miss Third Body Found in Alley?

133
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,320
Why should we believe you?

134
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,539
Because I could take you
if I wanted to.

135
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,559
We're listening.

136
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,279
I don't remember doing these things.

137
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,580
Not exactly the confidence-inspiring
denial I was looking for.

138
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,120
- I've been having dreams.
- Dreams?

139
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,299
Killing dreams.

140
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,309
Always the same.

141
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,210
I stalk them, toy with them,
mark them while they're alive.

142
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,460
Before they can die from fear,
I feed on them.

143
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,809
So you've had nightmares.
It doesn't mean you--

144
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,700
They're not nightmares.
I've enjoyed them.

145
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,029
Oh.

146
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,120
You fear it may be more than dreams.
An acting-out in a hypnogogic state.

147
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,129
- Hypno-what-gic?
- Sleepwalking.

148
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,850
Vampires can't sleepwalk. He steps
out the door, and he'd be in flames.

149
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,809
Unless it were happening
in the pre-dawn hours.

150
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,120
Which is when all
these murders took place.

151
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,320
There's only one way to be sure.

152
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,970
- You've got to make it tight.
- Like I need instructions from you.

153
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,809
My glamorous life. I make coffee
and chain the boss to the bed.

154
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,950
- Gotta join a union.
- It's tight enough.

155
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,460
If it turns out we're back on a liquid
lunch? Better safe than cocktails.

156
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,279
All we can do now is wait.

157
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:16,799
Yeah.

158
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,940
Maybe you're committing
horrible crimes in your dreams.

159
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,139
But I don't want to stay
for your nocturnal commissions.

160
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,440
- I understand.
- Okay.

161
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,710
Well, pleasant-- I mean, sleep tight.

162
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,909
That's pretty much a given.

163
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,259
There now. Isn't that better?

164
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,740
Wakey-wakey.

165
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,389
- We made it.
- Great news, sports fans.

166
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,679
There's been another killing.

167
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,960
Maybe not-so-great news
for the dead person...

168
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,019
...but at least now we know
Mr. I'm So Tortured didn't do it.

169
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,600
Yes, I did.

170
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,710
There now. Isn't that better?

171
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,309
Better.

172
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,059
First kill. Aptly done.

173
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,279
- Strange. She was my sister.
- Yet you feel nothing.

174
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,659
No.

175
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,870
- I feel hungry.
- You do learn quickly.

176
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,309
And my father would disagree.

177
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,470
It's time you shared with him
what a fine student you've become.

178
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,809
My father. Yes.

179
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,320
- They'll be eating dinner.
- A feast! Excellent.

180
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,950
When you're invited, savor it, Penn.
You won't recapture it.

181
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,919
Family blood is always the sweetest.

182
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,320
- I taught him well.
- A real Psycho Wan Kenobi.

183
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,019
Two hundred years' practice.
I imagine he's got it down by now.

184
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,919
Gallagher's changed his act more times
than he has in the last two centuries.

185
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,370
- Why is he doing the same old shtick?
- It's a classic, isn't it?

186
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,950
Every time he smashes that watermelon
with the sledgehammer--

187
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,720
I don't know why.

188
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,470
You suppose he's trying
to draw you out?

189
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:26,139
That he knows you're here?
That might explain the dreams.

190
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,629
I have a connection with those I sire.
It means he's close.

191
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,220
Neat. We can't find him and the cops
stand zero chance of stopping him.

192
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,419
- Kate.
- What are you doing?

193
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,409
- She's no idea what she's up against.
- You're not going to tell her.

194
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,559
You can't walk into a precinct
with knowledge of these murders...

195
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,159
...and claim a 200-year-old
Puritan's responsible.

196
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,759
You'd be locked up faster
than Lady Hamilton's virtue.

197
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,409
- My apologies.
- I don't know what that meant.

198
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,059
She's good.
She has resources we don't.

199
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,210
- Eventually, she'll find him.
- Bad for her.

200
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,450
Or good for us.

201
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,809
Hey.

202
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,190
I have the info on your license plate.

203
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,519
Are you okay?

204
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,029
Not that the "brooding man of mystery"
thing doesn't work. It does. A lot.

205
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,750
- Can we talk somewhere in private?
- Sure. Of course.

206
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:47,840
What is it?

207
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,549
- How's the investigation?
- It's nowhere.

208
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,240
Some inconsiderate serial killers
often fail to leave us any clues.

209
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,660
- He's reliving it.
- What's going on?

210
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,380
- It's complicated.
- So make it simple.

211
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,910
- Kate, do you trust me?
- You know I do.

212
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,640
Trust me when I tell you
this is the man you're looking for.

213
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,329
- Where did you get that?
- Do you trust me?

214
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,180
I don't get it.
Are you protecting a source?

215
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes. I trust you.

216
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,180
His next victim will be a teen white
male from a low-rent neighborhood.

217
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,430
Probably near a bar or a liquor store.
He'll kill him...

218
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,630
...unless you use every resource
to make sure he's not successful.

219
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:27,009
- You told her everything?
- Just enough to get her killed.

220
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,410
We'll make sure that won't happen.

221
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,829
Once you hook this up,
she finds something, we'll know.

222
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,380
- Where'd you get the radio?
- Police car.

223
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,180
Oh, dear.

224
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,240
Let's add patrols here and here.

225
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,240
Anything matching
the profile gets reported.

226
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,849
Okay. Mitchell, you'll ride with me.

227
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,109
Could you buy me some beer?

228
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,359
- Take a hike.
- I left my I.D. at home--

229
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,910
Wipe.

230
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:14,019
Ma'am, can you possibly pick me up
some beer? It's for my mother.

231
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,180
Are you old enough to buy beer?

232
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:43,589
You sure about this? There's no
discount liquor store here.

233
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:48,599
- You remind me of a brother I had.
- Whatever. We're going nowhere here.

234
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,240
You! Right there!

235
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:11,299
All units, backup requested
at 3336 Channel Avenue,

236
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,079
Use caution, homicide suspect
believed to be at location,

237
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,680
Search teams are on their way.

238
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:28,519
He went in through there.
Exits are sealed. We'll find him.

239
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,579
- Watch your backs.
- We got him.

240
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,859
I'm going in.

241
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,059
Meet you back here.

242
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,890
Don't move!
Do not move. I will fire!

243
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,000
Ouch.

244
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,730
Angelus?

245
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,140
Angelus.

246
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,759
- My God. It's been a lifetime.
- At least.

247
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,450
- We were to meet in Italy.
- I remember.

248
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,109
Hell, I waited till the 19th century.
What happened?

249
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,819
- Got held up in Romania.
- Romania?

250
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,869
- What's in Romania?
- Gypsies.

251
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,950
- Request assistance.
- Join me for a drink.

252
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,309
- That's not why I'm here.
- Request assistance. Suspect sighted.

253
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,369
Yes. Why are you here?

254
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,250
- To kill you.
- Detective Lockley,

255
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,029
Go, Kate! Get out of here! Go!

256
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:38,720
You know its name?
Angelus, what's happened to you?

257
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,890
- People change.
- We're not people.

258
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,900
Where are you?

259
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,079
I shot him three times.

260
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,950
I know I did.

261
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,609
Then he got up.

262
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,740
If I pull this trigger,
will you get up too?

263
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,690
- What are you?
- You know the answer.

264
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,210
A detail's been left out
of the press reports.

265
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,420
Something you've held back.
Isn't that right?

266
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,680
- What do you know?
- The puncture wounds.

267
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,720
The victims were all drained
of their blood, right?

268
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,009
Should I trust you more or less now?

269
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,539
- You're not gonna stop him.
- What do you mean?

270
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,059
It'll take sunlight, decapitation,
or a stake through the heart.

271
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,819
- Children's stories.
- It's the truth.

272
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,039
No. I don't believe you.

273
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,880
Even after what you saw, you won't
let yourself. So you'll lose.

274
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,029
- I've heard enough.
- You haven't heard a word.

275
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,569
And you won't. Not now, not yet.

276
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:09,130
Because there are some things
you're not ready to face.

277
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,019
Here's everything with the M.O.,
dating back as far as I could find.

278
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,759
Thanks, Chris.

279
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,859
So you think this guy's a copycat,
a history buff?

280
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,559
Something like that.

281
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,680
So you've discovered the seamy
underbelly of a candy-coated America.

282
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,990
Well, you've come to the right place.
Here at Angel Investigations...

283
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,680
...we won't judge, but we will charge.

284
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,339
Tell me how you heard of us.

285
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,490
- From the police.
- Really?

286
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,980
Yes. The detective I spoke with
was very enthusiastic.

287
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:11,710
For the truly human touch,
she said that I should come to you.

288
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:13,549
Oh, good.

289
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,759
Is it cold out?

290
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,339
I'm trying to remember her name.
What was it?

291
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,579
She's about yea tall,
attractive, natural blond.

292
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,759
- Oh, yeah, Kate. Detective Lockley.
- Lockley.

293
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,759
Yes, that's it.

294
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,599
She and Angel are tight.

295
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,289
Really? So this is more...

296
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,029
...than just a professional
relationship? He cares for her.

297
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,140
Yeah. More than he knows.
But that's our Angel...

298
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,660
...dour, but not afraid to get
personally involved in his work...

299
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,420
...and you're pumping me
for information, aren't you?

300
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,160
Oh, crap. You're him. He. The guy.

301
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,670
Apt pupil boy.

302
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,160
You realize you'll never make it
to the exit before I--

303
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,470
Go up like a match?

304
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,009
Well....

305
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,789
He's back from his
Up with People meeting.

306
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,839
- Get me a stake.
- It's 8 in the morning.

307
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,200
Oh, you mean like-- Okay.

308
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,690
What? You don't drink,
so now no one gets to?

309
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,509
I don't expect you to understand.

310
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,069
I understand.
I was a Puritan, remember?

311
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,250
- It's gotta end.
- Why? Because you say so?

312
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,710
Yeah, how does that work, exactly?

313
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,029
You wake up one morning
and decide, "Okay, now I'm good!"

314
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,500
No, Angelus. It doesn't end.
It never ever ends.

315
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,769
It just goes on and on.

316
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,049
That's not the only thing
that goes on and on.

317
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:51,099
Here. Dust him.

318
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:52,900
I'm sorry what I turned you into.

319
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,269
A first-class killer?

320
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,720
An artist?
A bold reinterpreter of the form?

321
00:27:59,089 --> 00:27:59,960
Try "cheesy hack."

322
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,869
You've been getting back at
your father for over 200 years.

323
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,710
It's pathetic. You've probably
got a killer's shrine on your wall.

324
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,309
News clippings, magazine articles,
maybe a few candles.

325
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,049
Oh, you are so prosaic.

326
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,410
Nothing about a new vampire in town--

327
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,329
Maybe because he's here
and has me by the throat.

328
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,789
- Let him go.
- You're right.

329
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,220
My work was getting stale.
I appreciate the critique.

330
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:36,369
So look for something new, innovative.
Something shockingly original.

331
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,630
Think of the worst possible thing you
can imagine, and I'll see you there.

332
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,170
Hi. Can I come in?

333
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,779
Oh, that's right,
you have to be invited in.

334
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,500
- You've been doing your homework.
- Quiz me. I'm full of fun facts.

335
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:15,500
Your friend was in L.A. before.
Did you know that?

336
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:17,910
Yeah. At least twice.

337
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,089
Once in 1929 and again in 1963.

338
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,460
Oh, and there was something
in Boston in 19O8.

339
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,440
I think he was there too.

340
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,109
- So you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you.

341
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,950
- He's planning--
- Angelus.

342
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,990
Isn't that what he called you?

343
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,269
I looked it up. It's all right there.

344
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:37,609
The demon with the face of an angel.

345
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,240
A particularly brutal bastard
by all accounts.

346
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,019
- And, no, you can't come in.
- I can't make up for the past.

347
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,599
No, you can't.
In fact, what's happening now...

348
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,509
...is really because of you.

349
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,380
You made him, didn't you?

350
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,710
Let me help end it, please.

351
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,809
"Please." There's a word I imagine
you heard a lot of in your time.

352
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,450
Please. No. Don't.

353
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,569
Thanks, but I don't need your help.

354
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:07,029
I know what to do.
Drive a stake right through his heart.

355
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,630
When that happens,
I suggest you don't be there...

356
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,789
...because I'll do the same to you.

357
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:21,349
Here it is. Los Angeles Globe, 1929.

358
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,579
"The suspect seemed like a quiet,
normal type. The search is ongoing."

359
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,539
- What are we looking for exactly?
- I don't know yet.

360
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,859
"In 1963, police tracked the killer...

361
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,309
...to a residential hotel
called the Cloverwood Apartments.

362
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,630
By the time they made their move,
he'd already fled."

363
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,109
They never caught him.

364
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,930
It's the same place.
New name and a face-lift.

365
00:31:57,329 --> 00:32:01,119
- That's happened before in this town.
- Good old predictable Penn.

366
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,089
- I invite you in.
- That's only for humans.

367
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,799
Breaking and entering
a vampire's lair isn't a problem.

368
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,849
Right.

369
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:23,789
He's not here.

370
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,430
So then we wait?
Raid the icebox and try to think...

371
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:32,579
...of the worst possible
thing we can imagine?

372
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,799
Stop imagining.

373
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,460
Good Lord.

374
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,609
All those schoolchildren.

375
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,750
He's finally changing his act.

376
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,619
All right, listen up.

377
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:08,089
You've all received one of these.

378
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,380
This is the man we're looking for.

379
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,910
And this man is how
we're going to find him.

380
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:17,049
His name is Angel.
He's a private detective.

381
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,200
Our suspect may make an attempt...

382
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,710
...to contact Angel,
possibly as his next target.

383
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:24,220
So we'll stake out Angel's place.

384
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,599
How many men do you want?

385
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,309
- Lots. We'll work in rotating teams--
- This is a terrible likeness.

386
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,210
The mouth. It's all wrong.

387
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:36,640
No!

388
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,089
Attention, all units....

389
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:54,890
We're in.

390
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,240
What about the schoolchildren?
Shouldn't we be--?

391
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,549
Stop! Stop!

392
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:02,759
Hold it right there.

393
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:10,530
He's here.

394
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:15,320
Twelfth Street Station House,
Secure area, use caution,

395
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:38,900
- What are you gonna do?
- I thought I'd stop everything...

396
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,389
...and tell you my plan.
But better yet...

397
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,849
...why don't I just show you?

398
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,119
Smell that fear.

399
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,000
It makes the blood sweeter.

400
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,929
- You know who taught me that?
- I'm not afraid to die.

401
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,730
Oh, I'm not going to kill you.
But when I'm finished, Angel will.

402
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,869
A bus full of schoolchildren, Penn?

403
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,269
You really thought
I was gonna fall for that?

404
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:23,050
- Well, you could have.
- No. Too original.

405
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,929
You were right
about one thing, Angelus.

406
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,280
The last 200 years has been
about me sticking it to my father.

407
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,300
But I've come to realize something.
It's you.

408
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,130
You made me!

409
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,429
You taught me!

410
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,480
You approved of me in ways
my mortal father never did!

411
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,269
- You're my real father, Angelus.
- Fine!

412
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,619
You're grounded.

413
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,190
You forget your own lessons, teacher.

414
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,909
Never give up the advantage, remember?

415
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,119
Living among them has made you weak!

416
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,619
It sickens me to think
that there was a time...

417
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,369
...you would've done whatever
was necessary.

418
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,380
- You missed.
- No, I didn't.

419
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,809
This vein on my temple
is doing the cha-cha...

420
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:52,139
...because I just had one of those...

421
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:54,750
...bone-crunching, mind-splitting
vision headaches.

422
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:00,719
New job.

423
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,780
This place is like where I grew up.

424
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,210
Right.

425
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,190
Yeah, I could see that...

426
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,659
...except for the cars, the buildings
and the, you know, everything else.

427
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,400
It's not so different.

428
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,360
People moving through their lives.

429
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,800
I wonder if anything changes.

430
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,059
Sure it does.

431
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,980
They do. You have.

432
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,480
They were just dreams.

433
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:34,980
They weren't even yours.
It didn't mean anything.

434
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,289
But I enjoyed it.

435
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:40,590
It'd probably be okay if you never
mentioned that part ever again.

436
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:42,789
It's still in me.

437
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,610
Sure it's in you.
We all have something.

438
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,090
But it's not the only thing
that's in you.

439
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,369
You're not him, Angel. Not anymore.

440
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,019
The name I got in my vision--

441
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,570
The message didn't come for Angelus.
It came for you, Angel.

442
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,199
And you have to trust that whoever
The Powers That Be, be--

443
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,920
Are. Is.

444
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:07,659
Anyway, they know the difference.

445
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,750
- Yeah.
- People really do change.

446
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,230
Yes, they do.

447
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,090
And sometimes they change back.

448
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,550
- If the day ever comes that I--
- Oh, I'll kill you.

449
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,699
Thanks.

450
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,929
What are friends for?
