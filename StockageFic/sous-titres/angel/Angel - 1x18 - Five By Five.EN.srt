1
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,879
What the hell you
burning there, man? Stinks like--

2
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,640
You in the wrong place.

3
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,859
My boys won't be happy when
they see what kind of mess you--

4
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,030
Your name Marquez? Good.
I hate saving the wrong guy.

5
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,879
Never know who you'll meet
in this part of town. Ride?

6
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,549
- Careful.
- Thank you.

7
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,240
New in town, right?
You got that "new in town" look.

8
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,909
It's a dangerous part of town
for a young lady.

9
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,300
Many would take advantage
of this situation.

10
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,080
Especially if you have no money,
no place to stay.

11
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,500
- I might be able to help.
- I'm cold.

12
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,080
Oh, yeah? "Warm" is my middle name.

13
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,180
Now I got money. And a place to stay.

14
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,659
Think I'm gonna like it here.

15
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,680
- Can I take off this blindfold yet?
- No.

16
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,159
- Can I take off something else?
- After I give you your present.

17
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,939
You can never have enough of those.
Come on.

18
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,730
Happy birthday, Angelus.

19
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,910
She's a gypsy.

20
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,379
- I looked everywhere.
- What would I do without you?

21
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,750
Wither and die.

22
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,879
But she's not just for you.
I get to watch.

23
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,410
- Want to live? Do the right thing.
- Right for who?

24
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,920
Next time they come after you, I won't
be there, nor will your friends.

25
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,579
This guy will never do it.
What a waste of a good vision.

26
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,759
- Going badly?
- I knew when you brought him...

27
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,670
...someone with that much body art
has a different idea of civic duty.

28
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,040
After we saved his life?

29
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,129
When was the last time
you wrote a thank you card?

30
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,529
Well, I have faith in Angel.

31
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,540
- He can convince him to testify.
- You don't change a guy like that.

32
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,779
Generally speaking,
you don't change a guy.

33
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,360
What you see is what you get. Scratch
the surface, you find more surface.

34
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,720
- One could have said that about Angel.
- Please. He was cursed by gypsies.

35
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,129
Will Angel get gypsies to shove
a soul down this guy's throat?

36
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,199
The ruffian's already got a soul...

37
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,980
...and, deep down inside,
an urge to do what's right.

38
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,350
- No way, I'm gone.
- Shut up and sit down.

39
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,949
You're right, Wesley.
He's just like the Dalai Lama.

40
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,680
You're gonna have to face
your demons sometime.

41
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,629
- What if I don't want to?
- Then you'll have to face mine.

42
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,730
Excuse me!

43
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,620
Okay. You're excused.

44
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,819
- That's my boyfriend.
- Really?

45
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,379
I don't see your name on him anywhere.

46
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,459
- Billy, do something.
- Yes, Billy, do something. Like this.

47
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,339
While the arguments presented
are entertaining...

48
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,480
...the case hinges on witnesses
they don't have.

49
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,529
If Wolfram and Hart wouldn't
tamper with the witness--

50
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,290
That's a serious allegation.

51
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,709
I'm filing a grievance with the ABA.

52
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,079
They have no witness and no case.

53
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:34,779
I request a dismissal of all charges.

54
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,220
My client's reputation is damaged.

55
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,850
He's a law-abiding and upstanding...

56
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,480
...citizen.

57
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,850
He is. Except for that "drug
and murder" stuff.

58
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,769
Your Honor, the state
calls Mr. Marquez.

59
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,740
Raise your right hand.

60
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,139
Swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?

61
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,690
I accept full responsibility.
I thought...

62
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:08,730
...we'd done everything possible.
I didn't foresee the intervention.

63
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes, sir. Angel. I don't disagree.
He's proven to be a costly liability.

64
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,840
I can-- Absolutely. I can do that.

65
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,200
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

66
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,809
I hate failure
when there's no one to blame.

67
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,480
I think I've found
the solution to our problem.

68
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,179
Lee, there you are.
Tell them that's our drop-dead offer.

69
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,320
Assure them we mean
literally, not figuratively.

70
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:45,690
- How you doing?
- Good. You?

71
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:49,570
Great. I hear you came up
with a good idea.

72
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:52,429
How to deal with our friendly vampire?

73
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,490
No, it's a great idea.
How did you find out so fast?

74
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,720
Part of my job. How did you
find out about the rogue slayer?

75
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,779
Part of my job. I've been
reading the police reports.

76
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,399
- She's been a busy little beaver.
- But you don't know where she is.

77
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,970
- I will soon enough.
- I already do.

78
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:21,009
- I'll make the contact.
- It's my deal. I'll make the contact.

79
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,029
- Let me think about it. No.
- Why not?

80
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,840
It's your people skills.
You don't have any.

81
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,629
- You bitch.
- See?

82
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,950
If you behave,
I'll let you ride in the limo.

83
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,039
Unfortunately, we don't
really do divorce cases.

84
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,220
No. It's not about the money.

85
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,539
It's about that much money.
How soon can we meet?

86
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,019
Yeah, I know where that is.

87
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:58,039
We'll see you there tomorrow.

88
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,620
Thanks for calling. Bye.

89
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,460
How'd it go?

90
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,230
- We won.
- Gang guy testified?

91
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,720
- Stood up and told the truth.
- What did I tell you?

92
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,690
- That he never would.
- Well, more good news.

93
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,450
I may have landed a new client,
and he can afford to pay.

94
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,259
What's the case?

95
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm still gathering information,
but we have lunch with him tomorrow.

96
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,370
You happy with the way
things turned out?

97
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,870
You can tell when he's happy.
His scowl is slightly less scowly.

98
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:38,909
- That kid's lucky he ran into you.
- I pushed him in the right direction.

99
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,440
I wonder how Wolfram and Hart
will push back?

100
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,389
We can go talk, but I'm not much
of a talker. I'm more of a doer.

101
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,169
I think you might have
misunderstood my intentions.

102
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,809
No. I think you misunderstood mine.

103
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,750
I like that watch.

104
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,539
Diamonds, right?

105
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,029
- Faith--
- How do you know my name?

106
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,669
I don't think I told you.

107
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,970
We are well aware of who you are
and what you do.

108
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,980
We know you've had some difficulties.
We can bring order back to your life.

109
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,769
We do, do we? Who is "we"?

110
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,649
Why do they know about me
when I don't know jack about you?

111
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,590
Green is my favorite color,
I look good in diamonds...

112
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,480
...and I love riding in limousines.

113
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,409
Faith, can we talk?

114
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:47,990
I like black.

115
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,509
Angelus?

116
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,009
Are you here?

117
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,779
Angelus?

118
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,320
Not everyone screams.

119
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,419
What?

120
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,740
When you kill them...

121
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,250
...some just stand there. Frozen.

122
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,620
While others....

123
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,019
What are you doing?
Are we playing a game?

124
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,899
The children. They usually scream.

125
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,500
Yes, they sound just like little pigs.
Have you brought me some?

126
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,539
You don't think I'll share? I can't
believe you think I'm so insensitive.

127
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,029
We've drunk and killed for
how long now, 140-odd years?

128
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,039
We've drunk them all up,
and they're all dead.

129
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,049
- Where have you been?
- Don't!

130
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,480
What is this?
Have you met someone else?

131
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,639
Let go of me. Let go of me!

132
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,100
What happened to you?
Angelus, what happened?

133
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,250
That gypsy girl you brought me.

134
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,600
Her people found out
and did something to me.

135
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,669
- A spell.
- Funny...

136
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,309
...you'd think with all the people...

137
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,919
...I've maimed and killed...

138
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,519
...I wouldn't be able
to remember every single one.

139
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,830
Help me.

140
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,830
The spell. They gave you a soul.

141
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,629
A filthy soul!

142
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,659
- You're disgusting.
- Darla--

143
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,799
- No, get away from me!
- You brought her here.

144
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,679
- I am like you.
- You're not like anything.

145
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,440
Get away from me. Get out!

146
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,529
I'll kill you!

147
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,059
A felony arrest warrant from Sunnydale
was issued in your name. For murder.

148
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,259
Physical description's accurate.
The photo, however, is not flattering.

149
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,860
There's personal stuff too, but they
don't mention that you're a slayer.

150
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,110
Which is why we find you so appealing.

151
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,039
You have a problem, we have a problem.
I had a murder case go up in smoke...

152
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,320
...and you seem to have a certain
expertise in that area.

153
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,460
So to make a long story less long...

154
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,480
...I think if a service is rendered,
we can get you off.

155
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,450
You know how many men
have promised me that?

156
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,190
You won't be disappointed
in our performance.

157
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,409
Who am I supposed to kill?

158
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:40,360
Understand that we'd never advocate
the killing of another human being.

159
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,009
His name's Angel.
He's somewhat of a private--

160
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,860
No problem.

161
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,139
- Don't you want to know more?
- Besides getting me off...

162
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,899
...how much will you pay?

163
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,919
It might behoove you to know
more about your intended.

164
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,820
So before we discuss remuneration--

165
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,470
Payment.

166
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,460
Make sure you understand this firm
is not connected to anything you do.

167
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,890
It's my ass on the line.
I don't want you to make me look bad.

168
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,559
How do you look now?

169
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,740
She shows initiative.

170
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:29,960
- Jesse.
- Sir?

171
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,680
Make it three for dinner
instead of four.

172
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,160
Very good, sir,

173
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,140
He's kind of a busy man,
so lunch was the only time he had.

174
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,410
It's not our usual case,
but we must consider finances.

175
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,750
- What kind of demons are they?
- It's not exactly a demon thing.

176
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,549
What kind of "thing" is it?

177
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:53,529
It's kind of a husband-
and-wife-breakup thing.

178
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,480
- A divorce case?
- You're kidding.

179
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,339
- What's wrong with it?
- It's not what we do.

180
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,210
According to the husband,
the wife's a real witch.

181
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,519
- Seems a bit seedy.
- This is not seedy.

182
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,490
He's in government. Just talk to him.

183
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,960
We pay for lunch. Nothing says
success less than splitting the bill.

184
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,829
- I didn't bring any money.
- Okay, Elvis.

185
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,579
Only big stars don't carry cash.

186
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:23,740
Speaking of which, one of us
should apply for a business loan.

187
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:28,259
Just to get us through the rough spot.
What's a 30-year loan to you?

188
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,349
That was so cool!

189
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,089
This is gonna be fun.

190
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:43,079
- Oh, my God. Faith.
- I thought she was in a coma?

191
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,630
Pretty lively coma.

192
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,650
Giles said she left Sunnydale a
week ago. She's borderline psychotic.

193
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,230
- Explains her outfit.
- This isn't right.

194
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,690
A slayer trying to kill
your boss is wrong.

195
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,710
I meant Giles. Why didn't he warn me?
I was Faith's Watcher.

196
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,960
He should've called
as soon as she awoke.

197
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:11,910
Maybe he was busy trying to keep her
from killing everybody?

198
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:16,460
He didn't know she was coming for me.
He was worried about Buffy.

199
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,720
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

200
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,880
- What can we do?
- Help me track her down.

201
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,789
Check last week's police reports
for beatings, killings.

202
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,119
Possibly near bus stations and bars.
And then you make yourself scarce.

203
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,029
You've been targeted by a psychotic.
I'm not going to run and hide.

204
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,809
- I like the plan where I'm scarce.
- Strength in numbers.

205
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,390
- Two's a number.
- She wants me.

206
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,420
- Don't get in the way.
- But we were a team.

207
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,619
We're not a team. I'm your boss.
You go where I tell you.

208
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,990
- You're taking this personal--
- She shot at my personal back.

209
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,150
Did she do something to Buffy?

210
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,150
Giles just said it was rough.

211
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,900
If you let emotion control
you now, one of you will end up dead.

212
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,710
- That's what she wants.
- She's not a demon, she's a sick girl.

213
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,369
- If there's a chance to reason--
- I had a shot at saving her...

214
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,740
...but some British guy
kidnapped her...

215
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,779
...and made sure
she'd never trust again.

216
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,460
Angel, it's not Wesley's fault
that some British guy ruined your--

217
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,329
Oh, wait. That was you.

218
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,630
- Go on.
- You don't need to.

219
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,569
Let's just get to work.

220
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,569
Hey, baby. Come give us a hug.

221
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,619
I was hoping you'd stop by.
Always good to see old friends.

222
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,119
What's this? Wooden bullets?

223
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,059
Good idea, but no. This is for you.

224
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,339
You know, I'm gonna kill you
slowly and inventively...

225
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,089
...so I'm gonna give you
one chance to--

226
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,990
Blanks.

227
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,109
Nice.

228
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,529
Didn't shoot to kill.
Gotta up the stakes.

229
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,279
- Get you in the game.
- What's the game?

230
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,440
Boredom? Revenge?

231
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,099
I'm getting paid.
They hate you almost as much as I do.

232
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,700
- This might be more fun for me.
- You think?

233
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,710
What if you kill me and experience
that one true moment of pleasure?

234
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:17,170
I'd get off on that.
Go ahead. Do me.

235
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,319
Let's take that hell ride together.

236
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,559
I'm all yours.
It's an open invitation.

237
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:27,160
You're pathetic.
You and your tortured soul.

238
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,319
Gotta think everything through.
Think fast, lover.

239
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,079
You don't do me, you know I'll do you.

240
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,240
Gosh. That one wasn't a blank.

241
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,910
Let the games begin.

242
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,569
I'm telling you it's off.

243
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,230
I read the file.
It needs to be handled. I gotta jump.

244
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:04,930
You...

245
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,109
- ...were in the Gruber meeting.
- Right.

246
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,369
What's going on with them?
Is this a negotiation or a cotillion?

247
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,890
- That's what I told Frank.
- Who?

248
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,339
- Works in contracts.
- The problem's not contracts!

249
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,289
- That's what I was trying to tell--
- Go.

250
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:28,470
Yes.

251
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,720
Yes. No, no--

252
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,380
Thursday!

253
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:36,720
We have to close Gruber now
before the stock goes--

254
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,170
- Through the roof!
- In the toilet!

255
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,099
I want to know the instant they fold.

256
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,849
They are folding?

257
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,410
- Gotta go, E-mail me, good to see you.
- You too.

258
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,890
- Have you no respect for the law?
- Nice office. Good view.

259
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:42,619
Where's Faith?

260
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,859
- What are you talking about?
- Your new hire.

261
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:50,650
It's a big firm. Personnel will be
glad to handle your problem.

262
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,769
You remember her.
Pretty, dark hair. Kills.

263
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,049
We have strict hiring practices.

264
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,200
How's it work for a guy like you?

265
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,089
Successful lawyer in a big law firm.

266
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,789
Company car. Nice office.

267
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,210
Bonus. Can hire a killing
whenever you want.

268
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:12,829
We'll add slander
to breaking and entering.

269
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,549
While we're on the subject,
you threw my client through a window.

270
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,279
- Killed him, if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes. I seem to remember.

271
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,450
The window was just about that size.

272
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,450
Too bad the body burned up.
I might've needed a lawyer.

273
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,700
- We have a certain class of clientele.
- I've killed enough people to qualify.

274
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:39,759
Where is she?

275
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:44,900
Vampires can't enter without alerting
our sophisticated security system.

276
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:50,089
Spent a fortune on mystical barriers.
Nice knowing our investment paid off.

277
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,599
- It was a waste of money.
- One down, more on the way.

278
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,690
The police are coming and all this
has been digitally recorded.

279
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,309
Although it'll be entertaining
to watch you fight for your life...

280
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,619
...not to mention the fortune
I can make off the video...

281
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,680
...I do have a dinner.

282
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,730
Good to see you again, Lindsey.

283
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,450
We'll do this real soon.

284
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:32,410
Just when I think I got you
figured out, you show up in a suit.

285
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,339
There's another assault.
Fight in a bar, arrests made.

286
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:45,640
A woman fitting Faith's description
was involved but not arrested.

287
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,839
She charmed her way out?

288
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,750
She broke a policeman's jaw
with his own handcuffs...

289
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:56,720
- ...before she disappeared.
- For Faith, that is charm.

290
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:07,559
Phantom Dennis, let us in!
It's all right. It's only Wesley.

291
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,319
- Dennis, your ghost, I presume?
- Yes, he's jealous.

292
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,200
Don't worry, hell will freeze over
before we have sex.

293
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,650
Thank goodness for small favors.
I'll call Angel again.

294
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:32,089
- I'm gonna pack a bag.
- Not too much. We're not on safari.

295
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,779
I got a little problem.

296
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,269
I don't feel Angel's in the game.

297
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,170
But, somehow, I think
you guys are the key.

298
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:45,259
Now what can I do
to really make him hate me?

299
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,910
- Faith.
- Shut up, Wesley.

300
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,740
- Listen to me. It's not too late.
- For cappuccino? It just keeps me up.

301
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:58,140
- It's not too late to let me help you.
- Yes. We want to help you.

302
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,299
I realize there have been
failures on both sides.

303
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,650
I also believe in my heart
that you are not a bad person.

304
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,720
What do you believe now?

305
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,569
All right, Wes. My turn.

306
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,950
- Cordelia.
- Oh, Angel.

307
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,710
She was already here. I didn't know.

308
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,720
I made Wesley come with me
just to get a couple of things.

309
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,549
She was like an animal.
She said that you weren't in the game.

310
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,289
- There was nothing we could do.
- Take it easy.

311
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:07,769
I'm sorry.

312
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,970
- What about Wesley? Is he okay?
- He's not here.

313
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,900
All these little cuts and bruises
just bring out the mother in me.

314
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,180
Come on. Now, now.
Don't poop out on me, damn it.

315
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,569
Otherwise this is all
going to be over too fast.

316
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:59,960
And you'll be dead and I'll be...

317
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:02,720
...bored.

318
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,279
Come on, Wesley.
Where's that stiff upper lip?

319
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,230
Now, we've only done one
of the five basic torture groups.

320
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,779
We've done blunt.

321
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,759
But that still leaves sharp,
cold, hot and loud.

322
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,309
Have a preference?

323
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,269
That's great. It's always better
with audience participation.

324
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,690
May I take your order, please?

325
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,019
I was your Watcher, Faith.

326
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,880
I know the real you.

327
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,240
Even if you kill me,
I want you to remember one thing.

328
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,240
- What's that, love?
- You are a piece of shi--

329
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,440
You should talk, huh?

330
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,279
I'll just have to try a little harder.

331
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,000
We'll switch to "sharp" for a while.

332
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,470
On Monday, a guy was beaten here.
His wallet and car stolen.

333
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,670
He's still in the hospital.

334
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,059
Four blocks over is a restaurant where
they had a major fight on Tuesday.

335
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,210
Then here, a guy ran into something
he called "the bitch from hell"...

336
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,809
...who sent him home with paramedics.
That was Wednesday.

337
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,460
This was the first. Took his wallet
and keys. He still in the hospital?

338
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,309
- Yeah. We were gonna talk to him.
- Where does he live?

339
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,710
That's refreshing.
But I'm feeling a little cold.

340
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,180
Why don't we warm the place up?

341
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,579
You wonder if things would've
been different if we never met?

342
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,380
And what if you had Buffy
and Giles had been my Watcher?

343
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,059
Think we'd still be here? Or would
Giles be sitting in that chair?

344
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,019
Or is it just like fate,
where there's no choice?

345
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,240
You were gonna be here no matter what.
Ever think about that stuff?

346
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,449
Fate and destiny?

347
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,739
I don't.

348
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,010
Not that any of this
is your own fault.

349
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,030
Since this may be the last chance
we have to unload on each other...

350
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,989
...it's my duty to say that
had you been a better Watcher...

351
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,420
...I might've been
a more positive role model.

352
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,480
Face it, Wesley.
You really were a jerk.

353
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,659
Walking around like you had a big
stake rammed up your English Channel.

354
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,380
I think I want to hear you scream.

355
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,670
You never will.

356
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,369
Admit it, Wesley.

357
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,760
Didn't you always have
the hots for me?

358
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,619
About time, Soul Boy.

359
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,019
Ready to play now?

360
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:23,050
I'm ready.

361
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,780
You showed. But how do I know
if you're really in this?

362
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,409
If I kill him, would that help
or just be really funny?

363
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,170
I know what you're after.

364
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,119
You I have to kill.
Wesley's for the hell of it.

365
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,190
- It's not about him. It's about us.
- He's payback.

366
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,769
Why? I thought you were happy.

367
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:25,400
You never told me how much
I'm worth dusted.

368
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:29,599
- Fifteen thousand plus expenses.
- You're kidding.

369
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,030
Hey, I'm young.
Willing to work my way up.

370
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,320
You feel young, do you?

371
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,659
You're looking worn-out to me.

372
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,730
That all you got, vampire?
Get in the game.

373
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,159
Come on, Angel!
I thought you were bad!

374
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,449
You can't take me.
No one can take me.

375
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,400
Come on!

376
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,929
You're gonna die!

377
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,210
You hear me?!

378
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,070
You don't know what evil is.

379
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,650
I'm bad.

380
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:37,260
Fight back!

381
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,039
Nice try, Faith.

382
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,769
I know what you want...

383
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,010
...and I'm not gonna do it.

384
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,360
I won't make it easy for you.

385
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:18,019
I'm evil! I'm bad! I'm evil!

386
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,079
Do you hear me?! I'm bad!
Angel, I'm bad!

387
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,699
I'm bad! Do you hear me?!

388
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,409
I'm bad! I'm bad!

389
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,380
Please.

390
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,590
Angel, please, just do it.

391
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,119
Please, just do it.

392
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,239
Just kill me.

393
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,130
Just kill me.

394
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,469
It's okay. I'm here.
