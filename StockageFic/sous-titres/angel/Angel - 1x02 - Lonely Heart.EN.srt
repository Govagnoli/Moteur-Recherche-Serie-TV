1
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,489
Maybe we should go
over this thing again...

2
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,839
...of you getting out
and involving yourself with people.

3
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,160
It's Friday night,
the most social night of the week.

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,250
A couple of lookers like us should be
out there enjoying the night life.

5
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,079
You're sitting here moping
in the dark like--

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,109
A vampire?

7
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:41,829
Well, yeah. I was gonna say slacker,
but, yeah, to you, Mr. Obvious.

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,670
- You gotta come out, man.
- Why?

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,630
Because I think we deserve
a night of fun.

10
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,210
It breaks up those nights
of death and mayhem.

11
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,320
Plus, we could toast to new business.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,689
The three of us.

13
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,979
Doyle, if you want to ask Cordelia
out, just do it yourself.

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,420
I don't even know if she likes me.

15
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,670
Put in a good word for me.
Tell her what a great guy I am.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,019
- I barely know you.
- Perfect, that should make it easier.

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,719
Hello?

18
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,739
When you're talking me up to her,
whatever you do...

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,930
...don't let her in on me
being half demon.

20
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,650
Women get a little funny about that.

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,780
They're finally in!

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,969
They're in.

23
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:24,730
Okay.

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,239
- Your cards.
- The cards.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,469
Your cards to leave with people
so they can reach you.

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,790
Great idea. You don't have a signal
folks can shine when they need help.

27
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,150
Look at that. There's our number.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,689
It's right next to...

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,090
...a butterfly?

30
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,819
It's obviously not a butterfly,
you idiot.

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,010
It's a bird.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,640
No, it's an owl.

33
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,680
A bird that hunts at night.
Brilliant.

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,599
It's an angel.

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,459
An angel. Right. It's an angel.

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,030
So obvious, and yet so clever
on so many levels.

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,299
- Shut up.
- Jesus.

38
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,799
Don't be a baby. I barely hit you.

39
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,300
Doyle?

40
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,240
- You okay, man?
- I'm okay.

41
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,479
Sit up. What'd you see?
What'd you see?

42
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,620
It's a bar.
I think I recognize it.

43
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,520
One of those terminally stuck
in the '80s places.

44
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah, and...?

45
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,879
No faces popped out at me, man.

46
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,669
Just a feeling.

47
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,840
What feeling?

48
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,919
Something's gonna happen.

49
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,469
Looks like you got your wish.
We're going out.

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,789
Excuse me.

51
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,090
- May I?
- What?

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,039
Oh. Sure.

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,490
Please.

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,870
Kevin.

55
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,599
Sharon.

56
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,699
God, I really hate places like this.

57
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,090
Don't you?

58
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,319
When I was a kid I thought,
"You grow up, you meet her...

59
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,199
...and everything falls in place."

60
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,810
Yeah, I had that.

61
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,750
Only I had a him where you had a her.

62
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,389
Really I just had a Ken and a Barbie.

63
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,689
Ken and Barbie had it easy.

64
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,079
They didn't have to come
to places like this.

65
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,730
But you gotta try.

66
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:06,230
I mean, what if she was here
and you missed her...

67
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,279
...because you were too,
I don't know...

68
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,279
...burned out to still believe.

69
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,319
You know what I mean?

70
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:16,870
I know exactly what you mean.

71
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:20,069
You have to believe that someday
you'll meet someone special.

72
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,000
I think I have.

73
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,420
Oh, God, I can't believe I just said
that. You are, but it sounded so--

74
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,750
No, it sounded nice, Kevin.

75
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,790
Ooh, classy.

76
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,899
Okay, now what?

77
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,750
Split up. Look for someone
who might be in trouble.

78
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,220
Or something that's about to cause it.

79
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,290
What can I get you?

80
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,670
Just wondering, you noticed
anything unusual here tonight?

81
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,089
Unusual?

82
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,990
You know, out of the ordinary.
Possibly even dangerous?

83
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,750
It's early yet. The real hot women
don't mosey in till around 11.

84
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,949
Hi. If you're in trouble,
just call this number.

85
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,930
We can help.

86
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,709
Hi. Being harassed by someone
or something?

87
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,660
Dial us up, day or night.

88
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,180
Hey, you look troubled.
Or is that just your lazy eye?

89
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,149
Call us. We're very discreet.

90
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,689
Hi. How are you?

91
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,720
Hey. This isn't a marketing
seminar, princess.

92
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,050
We need to operate more below radar.

93
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,769
What radar?

94
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,730
The police.

95
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,420
The service our friend Angel provides
might make them think of the "V" word.

96
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,689
- Vampire?
- No, vigilante.

97
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,550
There's laws against
that sort of thing.

98
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,439
You need to be a little bit
more casual-like.

99
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:06,949
"Hi, what's your name?"
"How's life?"

100
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,379
"Minions from hell getting you down?"

101
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,850
Excuse me, but I am an actress.

102
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,730
A student of the human animal.
I don't need talk to know their story.

103
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,089
Jazz hands over there?

104
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,629
Mama's boy. Peter Pan complex.

105
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,740
Self-absorbed with a big "the world
owes me" chip on her shoulder.

106
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,519
Check out "Sarah, Plain and Tall."

107
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,720
Has or comes from big money.

108
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,529
How do you know?

109
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,660
You gotta be rich to snag the guy
she's leaving with.

110
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,040
All riveting insights, but we need
to find someone that's in trouble.

111
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,019
How's Angel doing?

112
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,949
Seriously, I wasn't hitting on you.

113
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:54,879
Are you okay?

114
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,209
- What?
- Oh, nothing. Sorry.

115
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,220
Am I okay?

116
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,410
Well, you just looked bad.

117
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,089
You don't look bad,
you look very nice.

118
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,389
I'm just gonna have my drink.

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,680
Thanks.

120
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,180
For thinking you look bad or good?

121
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,029
You choose.

122
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm Angel.

123
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,129
I'm Kate.

124
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:25,939
Do you come here a lot?

125
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,410
No, it's the first time. It's--

126
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,279
Easy? Yeah.

127
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,379
I prefer those cool bars that are hard
to get into, but I can't get in.

128
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,570
Anyway, this is close to home.

129
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,409
So did you just stop in?

130
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,230
- I'm looking for something.
- I'm keeping you--

131
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,179
No, no. I'm just looking
for someone to rescue.

132
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,360
Are you in need of some rescuing?

133
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,870
That's the strangest line
I'll hear tonight.

134
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,279
No, no, it's not a line, I'm--

135
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,350
Oh, I didn't mean--
That was harsh.

136
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,730
You know, I'm not very good
at this talking.

137
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,070
I'm the expert, I'm sure you see.

138
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,100
But no, I don't need rescuing.

139
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,009
I gave up on "knight in shining armor"
a while ago.

140
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,450
I don't expect to find him
at the International House of Posers.

141
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:22,549
People can surprise you.

142
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,230
I sound like a big hypocrite, don't I?

143
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,289
Ragging on this place?
I come here every night.

144
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,769
How else you gonna meet somebody
outside of work? It's this...

145
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,029
...or sit home alone in the dark.

146
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,029
Wouldn't want that.

147
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,169
So, what do you do?

148
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,139
- Do?
- For a living.

149
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,929
Well, basically, I'm.... I help--
I'm a veterinarian.

150
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,340
Really?

151
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,450
I always say a man that loves
animals is a man you can trust.

152
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,889
You got everyone figured out?

153
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,889
Not everyone.
I mean, you I don't get.

154
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,730
Me?

155
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,049
What's with those visions of yours?

156
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,559
They're messages I get from
the higher powers, whoever they are.

157
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,309
- It's my gift.
- If that was my gift, I'd return it.

158
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,070
You get those headaches and then
you do this thing with your face.

159
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,269
- What thing with my face?
- Plus, your visions are lame.

160
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,750
A bar? That's nice and vague.

161
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,870
They should send you one of those
self-destructing tapes with a dossier.

162
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,519
- I'll be sure to mention it.
- Hey!

163
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,279
You the one handing out these cards?

164
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,149
Do you need help?

165
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,360
Do you mind if I
ring you up some time for a date?

166
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,110
- Yeah, she minds.
- I can handle this.

167
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,409
Yes, I mind. This is a business card.

168
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,950
Our services are for people in need.

169
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,960
I might need a little service.

170
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:55,830
You charge by the hour?

171
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,070
Excuse me?!

172
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,960
Just relax here a little bit.
The lady's with me.

173
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,350
- No, I'm not!
- Nobody's talking to you, wipe.

174
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,889
Well, I guess I just....

175
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,580
I just have a hard time, you know,
trusting people.

176
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,549
Male people, particularly.

177
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,279
In a place like this, nobody will
show you who they really are.

178
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,700
Everybody's too busy trying to get
whatever it is they're looking for.

179
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,299
- What are you looking for?
- Depends how many daiquiris I've had.

180
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,509
Oh, God, way to come off
like a drunken slut.

181
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,830
Slut's better than a hypocrite, right?
I'm moving up?

182
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,970
You're kind of hard on yourself.

183
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm a self-flagellating hypocrite slut.
What was your question?

184
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,340
What are you looking for?

185
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,419
I'm just trying to make a connection.

186
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,029
The more I come to places like this,
the harder it gets.

187
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,210
What are you looking for in here?

188
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,149
I honestly don't know.

189
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,230
I'll know it when I see it.

190
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,799
Would you?

191
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,320
- I'm sorry, forget it.
- What?

192
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,799
I was gonna ask if you wanted
to go someplace...

193
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,889
...more quiet.

194
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,389
I can't.

195
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,250
I have to stay here.

196
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,139
Right.

197
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,120
- I would....
- No, that's okay.

198
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,549
Listen, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

199
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,139
- What's the trouble?
- No trouble.

200
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,259
I said we didn't want any trouble.

201
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,309
We are trouble-free.

202
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,299
She's a hooker and her pimp
is giving me a hard time.

203
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,529
- That's it!
- Down, Cord.

204
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,259
Did you hear that?

205
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,500
Simmer down here. Violence is not
gonna solve a thing, all right?

206
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,889
Though it's kind of festive.

207
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,769
Oh, my gosh.

208
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,570
Oh, my God.

209
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,580
Those jerks started it.

210
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,360
Hey, not a word.
Every time with you guys.

211
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,110
Out. Come on, let's go.

212
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,070
- Wow. Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks.

213
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:45,919
I'm okay.

214
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,240
Are you okay?

215
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,970
Well, now, that's for you to find out.

216
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,000
I'd really like to know.

217
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,629
So, how do you want to do this?

218
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,070
Twenty questions?

219
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:12,269
Marcie from Barstow.
That doesn't even rhyme or anything.

220
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:17,110
It's wild,
us meeting over a bar fight.

221
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,679
Isn't it great when two people
make a connection?

222
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,519
It's late.

223
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,250
Yeah.

224
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,830
- I should--
- I know.

225
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,070
Well....

226
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,610
Well, I mean,
if you have to leave, I understand.

227
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,769
But I'd just like to hold you.

228
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,769
I'm having a hard time believing
the vision meant I was to come here...

229
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,659
- ...and break up a bar fight.
- If it was...

230
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,740
...I'm in for some serious
workman's comp.

231
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,919
Did you sense anybody here
needed help?

232
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,259
Yeah, everybody.

233
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,620
This socializing thing is brutal.

234
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,090
I was young once. I went to bars.

235
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,950
- It was never like this.
- I used to go to taverns, man.

236
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,840
Small towns.
Everybody used to know each other.

237
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,419
Like high school. It's easy to date.

238
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,190
We all had so much in common.
Being monster food, for instance.

239
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,809
You're in the big bad city now.

240
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,009
Where everyone's a stranger.

241
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,500
Hiding behind walls. Keeping secrets.

242
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,340
Sorry. Gotta kick you out now.

243
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,100
Sure.

244
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:39,149
The single life's really hard for you.

245
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:41,759
Why?

246
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,620
Before, you only had to worry
about a hangover.

247
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,210
Now because of your curse thingy,
you can't sleep with anyone...

248
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,110
...or you might feel true happiness
and lose your soul...

249
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,649
...become evil again
and kill everyone.

250
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,970
I always appreciate your perspective.

251
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,309
No problem. The last thing I want
is to show up at the office...

252
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,629
...and find that I'm working
for a homicidal monster.

253
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,299
This is whacked.
I don't know what I'm looking for.

254
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,509
You're looking for anything
in and around that bar.

255
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm in the newsgroup search engine.
What's the name?

256
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,399
D'Oblique. Capital D, apostrophe--

257
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,679
Not so fast. Okay, capital D.

258
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,399
Apostrophe, apostrophe, apostrophe....

259
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,789
Oh, I got it. Okay, now what's
after that again?

260
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,309
I need a break.

261
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,119
Let me get in here.

262
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,490
How'd you get computer skills?

263
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,829
Downloading pictures of naked women?

264
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,089
That's more or less accurate.

265
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,400
Hello. We got two hits.

266
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,269
Look:

267
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:29,069
"Search continues for Heather Nolan.

268
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:32,450
Missing since late last month,
the 24-year-old paralegal...

269
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,059
...vanished after leaving D'Oblique."

270
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,220
Missing girl. That's up your alley.

271
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,529
What's the second one say?

272
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,930
"A badly mutilated body found
nearly three weeks ago...

273
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,640
...described by the coroner's office
as eviscerated...

274
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,299
...has been identified as 28-year-old
Martin Haber.

275
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,140
Last seen with an unidentified female
at D'Oblique, a singles bar."

276
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,269
Probably been more disappearances
not traced back to the bar yet.

277
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,750
We got a missing girl and a stiff.

278
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,109
An eviscerated stiff.
Use the library.

279
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,109
Narrow down a list of eviscerating
demons who'd prey on young singles.

280
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,099
- Where are you going?
- The bar.

281
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,109
See if I can meet a killer.

282
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,359
Excuse me.

283
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,960
- Well, hello.
- Hi. Kate.

284
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,319
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Really?

285
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,339
I owe you an apology for last night.

286
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,609
You don't owe me anything.

287
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,339
It was rude.

288
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,410
Okay, then...

289
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,490
...maybe you can buy me a drink
and we can start fresh.

290
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:47,240
You shouldn't go in there tonight.

291
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,369
What do you mean?

292
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm not sure it's safe.

293
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,039
What's not safe?

294
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,230
I can't really explain it.

295
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,029
I have a problem trusting people,
and you're not making it any better.

296
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,000
- I'm asking you not to go.
- Where are you going?

297
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:04,640
In there.

298
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,650
Well, I'll tell you what.

299
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:10,460
I can go wherever I want,
and you can go to hell.

300
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,049
Been there, done that.

301
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,490
- The usual?
- Thanks.

302
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,180
You know, some guys have got
real problems.

303
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:53,769
I'm sorry, you were saying?

304
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,490
Oh, nothing. It's just my job.
You know, it's hard...

305
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,839
...to meet people.

306
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,740
I mean, everybody is watching
their own back. It's tough...

307
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,650
...knowing who you can trust.

308
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:10,390
Still, I'm surprised. I'd think
you could have your pick of girls.

309
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:12,549
Yeah?

310
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,420
I don't know. I was pretty much
a spaz in high school.

311
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,779
I mean a real
"something's out there" geek...

312
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,890
...with a gang of geektoid minions.

313
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,430
I couldn't get a date to save my life.

314
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,170
It's good high school's over.

315
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,440
Yeah.

316
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:45,549
Where's Kevin?

317
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,650
Hell if I know. I haven't seen him.

318
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,650
Dude didn't come to work today,
and he's not answering his phone.

319
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,470
Pretty sure he hooked up last night.

320
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,210
- Probably sleeping it off.
- What girl?

321
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,400
You know what, here's another one:
"Piasca."

322
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,359
It's a flesh-eating Indian demon...

323
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,710
...that enters victims through
the mouth and eviscerates from within.

324
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,240
- You gonna put that one down?
- Yep.

325
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,930
Demons. Is there anything
more disgusting?

326
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,599
You think so?

327
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,009
Come on.

328
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,200
Look at this one.

329
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:29,970
This demon wears a wreath
of intestines around its head.

330
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,380
What kind of statement is that?

331
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,829
It really depends, doesn't it?

332
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,710
Demons could be actually nice,
given the opportunity.

333
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,500
You'd have to get to know them.

334
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,710
I've known a lot of demons,
and, slime aside...

335
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,059
...not a lot there.

336
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,269
Sharon. Her name is Sharon.

337
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,690
- Counter regular.
- Sharon. That dowdy chick.

338
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,910
Kevin. Scraping the bottom
of the barrel.

339
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,250
- Look, where can I find Sharon?
- She's here tonight.

340
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,920
No Kevin, though.
Guess it wasn't true love after all.

341
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,089
She was just there
with some screech.

342
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,000
That's more her level.

343
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:15,430
- Any idea where she lives?
- No.

344
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,109
- What about a last name?
- Last name?

345
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,509
Not a lot of last names
in a place like this.

346
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,670
It's Reichler.

347
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,339
I asked her out a couple times.

348
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:46,140
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,599
I wanted this to go better.

350
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,359
Maybe I was trying too hard.

351
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,170
I just really like you.

352
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,670
Next time it'll be better.

353
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,140
Roll over.

354
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:09,970
Okay.

355
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,740
This is nice.

356
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:27,769
I think sometimes--

357
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,809
You're not human.

358
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,150
News flash, pal. You're a bit off
the evolutionary chart, yourself.

359
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:19,089
This has to stop
You have to stop.

360
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:23,460
I will when I find the right one.
The one I can stay with.

361
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,980
The right body?
What's wrong with this one?

362
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:31,160
Nothing. Yet.

363
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,809
It's new and different. It's great.

364
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,339
But it won't last.

365
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:43,160
I already know it's not the one.

366
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,539
It'll be the one you die in.

367
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:33,700
What are you doing here?

368
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,420
I know what this looks like.

369
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,230
So do I.

370
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,140
- You have the right--
- I waive it.

371
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,019
- How'd you find me?
- I've been tracking you.

372
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,140
Don't move. Not a step.

373
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,779
- Backup is on the way.
- We're on the same side.

374
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:01,289
- I'm after him too.
- You're an investigator?

375
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,460
More or less.

376
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,119
Where's your license?

377
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,059
- That's the less part.
- Right.

378
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,809
You didn't see--

379
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,589
What I see is the carving job
of an impotent sicko.

380
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,710
It's frustrating, isn't it?
Not being able to connect?

381
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,099
To love like other people?
How do you get them to trust you?

382
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,730
Give them the "I'm not good
with talking" speech?

383
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,859
He gives them
what they're longing for.

384
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,200
- And that is?
- Hope.

385
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,019
That their loneliness might end.
He'll keep doing it.

386
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,660
Unless I let you go
so you can stop him.

387
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,470
Save me the lines.
I've heard them.

388
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,990
I've heard yours.
Not being able to trust people?

389
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,450
Turn around.

390
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,740
- I'm sorry.
- Is that a confession?

391
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,890
I didn't do that.
I'm sorry for this.

392
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,150
Wow, this place is....

393
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,660
I thought girls liked pretty things.

394
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,519
Don't start.
Angel told us to meet here...

395
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,390
...so we are. That doesn't mean--

396
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,220
That is so high school. "Cordelia
wears bras. She has girl parts."

397
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,329
Take it easy. You're defensive.

398
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,150
It's refreshing to see a woman
living like this.

399
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,259
You're not so uptight.
You live for the moment.

400
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,460
You're disgusting.

401
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,359
- Who is it?
- It's me.

402
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,750
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

403
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,319
Look, I can't--

404
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:55,940
Invite him in. If you're alive...

405
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,799
...vampires can't cross the threshold.

406
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,920
- Promise you'll stay good?
- Cordelia.

407
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:03,069
I'm kidding. Come in.

408
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,839
What the hell happened to you?

409
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,609
That woman that I was talking to
at the bar last night, Kate.

410
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,940
- She's the killer?
- She's a cop.

411
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,980
- Followed me to another body.
- She thinks you did it.

412
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,940
So we don't have a lot of time--

413
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,150
- You actually live here?
- Yes, okay?

414
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,690
Is it my fault maid
service was interrupted?

415
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,380
It was supposed to go, home, hotel,
hotel, husband. Now can we move on?

416
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:37,549
We put together that list of
eviscerating demons you asked for.

417
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,059
- We narrowed--
- I saw it. It's a burrower.

418
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,019
It's a donkey?

419
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,730
We didn't see any donkey demons.

420
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,309
- Burrower.
- Oh.

421
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,319
It eviscerates its victims
as it goes from body to body...

422
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,960
...and maybe only after some kind of
a sex act, exchange of fluids thing.

423
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,769
Lovely.

424
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,039
Find out anything you can about
this thing, weaknesses.

425
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,980
It was amazingly strong.

426
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,140
It may be hard to kill.

427
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,000
- Hey, we're on it.
- Good.

428
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,839
I'm going back to the bar.

429
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,299
But it knows you're after it.

430
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,960
It'll be out there. It's gotta keep
trying to make the connection.

431
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,089
Why?

432
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,220
Because that's what lonely people do.

433
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,710
- Morning.
- Hey.

434
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,079
- Any luck, yet?
- No, not yet.

435
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:27,890
I know I'd recognize it
if I saw it in another body.

436
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:31,950
That narrows it down to about, what,
five million suspects in the city?

437
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,339
Did you find anything?

438
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:41,650
Yeah, we found a name for
this burrower guy. Talamour?

439
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,519
He's been around forever.
A dawn-of-time kind of dude.

440
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,950
- Any weaknesses?
- Few and far between.

441
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,109
This kid is strong, like you said.

442
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:51,539
He's not too crazy about fire, though.

443
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,559
Something we have in common.

444
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,920
It's a parasite, and when it starts
to leave one body for the next...

445
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,789
...not gonna gag here,
but the first one goes gerploohy.

446
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,539
Curdles like cream on a hot day.

447
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,500
I covered that with nondairy
gerploohy.

448
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,549
I'm gonna need help
to find this thing.

449
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,450
- Who are you calling?
- Kate.

450
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,019
I thought we were hiding from her.

451
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:16,990
She's been tracking this
thing a lot longer than we have.

452
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,200
- Lockley.
- It's me,

453
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,200
Help me find the killer.

454
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,289
I'm talking to him.

455
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:29,259
That would make things nice and clean,

456
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,180
But it's not true, and I think some
part of you knows.

457
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,710
He's still out there.
We should share information.

458
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:39,099
- That's not possible.
- All I need is five minutes.

459
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:42,000
If you still think I'm your man,
arrest me.

460
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,369
Meet me at the bar at 1,

461
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:48,170
That's on my to-do list:
Walk into a serial killer's trap.

462
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:52,299
I don't care if you come armed, wired
and covered by sharpshooters.

463
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,809
I can help you, Kate.

464
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,319
You just have to trust me.

465
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,069
The usual?

466
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,009
That's not your usual.

467
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,579
I'm in the mood
for something different.

468
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,849
You know that guy, tall, nice-looking,
helped out in the bar fight?

469
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:25,549
Sure. Sure.

470
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:28,059
- Let me know when he's here.
- Yeah, you bet.

471
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:29,819
Thanks.

472
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,210
I hate places like this, don't you?

473
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:37,549
I do, but....

474
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,039
I guessed that. You don't look
like you're in your element here.

475
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,130
Which is a compliment, by the way.

476
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,339
Thanks. Look, I would love to chat,
but actually...

477
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,210
- ...I'm waiting for someone.
- That guy.

478
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,910
I think he's in the alley.

479
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,829
- What is he doing?
- I took out the trash and there he was.

480
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,619
- Looked like he was ready to rabbit.
- Show me.

481
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,549
Sorry. You'll have to keep trolling.

482
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,420
Call this number.
Tell the sergeant I need--

483
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,409
Can you move?

484
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,179
Move!

485
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:44,719
I guess you're done with that body.

486
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:49,909
It's tough being a guy.

487
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,980
You don't get to finish,
you come apart at the seams.

488
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:13,869
I can't let him go.

489
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,940
He's not gonna leave.
He's gonna kill again, now.

490
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,010
- You think so?
- He has to.

491
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey. How's it going?

492
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,760
I was noticing your grace...

493
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,380
...and wondering if you were a dancer,
because I wish I could move--

494
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,619
Hey, excuse me, that's really
a beautiful dress you're wearing.

495
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,010
It really brings out your skin tone.

496
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,599
Now what?

497
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,449
Would you like a drink or something?

498
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,380
I'm, like, the bartender here.

499
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,119
Just want to talk to somebody.

500
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,760
Open up. Want to make a connection.

501
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,099
We're going out that window.

502
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,250
It's almost 20 feet up.

503
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,849
Who are you?

504
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,159
Please, I just want to hold you.

505
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,000
Run!

506
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,539
It all seems to add up.

507
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,630
He was connected to everyone.

508
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,619
I talked to him a dozen times.
I never had a clue.

509
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,500
It's hard to get to know people.

510
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,179
Yes, it is.

511
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,110
I didn't thank you
for saving my life.

512
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,170
Saving mine was a start.

513
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,230
I think you should know
I searched your place.

514
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,920
Illegally. No warrant.

515
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,699
- Why are you telling me?
- I don't know.

516
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:24,099
I guess so we can start fresh.
No secrets.

517
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,690
That's some weird stuff
for a veterinarian.

518
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:33,840
If you ever need me,
or if I can help you in any way....

519
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,179
What is this, a lobster?

520
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll be around.

521
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,949
Detective Lockley?
May I speak with you?

522
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,789
Yes, sir.

523
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,230
What's up?

524
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,030
You've been working hard...

525
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:08,849
...cooped up inside a lot.

526
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,889
To show my appreciation,
I was thinking...

527
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:15,869
...the night being, you know, young
and all, that the three of us...

528
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:22,469
...could, well, should maybe...

529
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,920
...go out.

530
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,099
You know...

531
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:31,760
...for fun.

532
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:36,199
Or we can go home.

533
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,050
And you could sit in the dark, alone.

534
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,150
God, yes.

535
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,880
Thank you.
