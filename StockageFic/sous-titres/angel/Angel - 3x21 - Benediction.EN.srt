1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,320
- Previously on Angel:
- Go find others like you.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,890
I'm not your boyfriend. Find somebody
else to smack you around.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,000
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,059
I'm your father.

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,629
What you're looking into is
the Quor-toth, darkest of the dark worlds.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,989
To punch through to Quor-toth
would require dark magics.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,920
There's always some cosmic
price to using primordial powers.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,359
- Hi, Dad.
- Connor?

9
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,600
- My name is Steven.
- Listen to me.

10
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,859
A couple weeks ago, he was
in diapers. Now he's a teenager?

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,200
No!

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,320
I lost you once already,
but you're back.

13
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,649
- You're not alone.
- I know.

14
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,100
We just sit here with a fissure
from the hell dimension in the lobby?

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,929
- It's closed.
- Did anything else come in?

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,200
Hi, Dad.

17
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,630
- Still no answer on his cell phone.
- If only he knew how to use it.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,159
Maybe we should head back out,
try to pick up the trail.

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,530
- A wise plan. I'll assist with tracking.
- No.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,879
But if something
is looking for Connor...

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,620
- ...and if Angel did find him--
- He did.

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,599
- Angel.
- Oh, my God.

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,329
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,170
- You found him?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,609
And?

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,780
And...

27
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,640
...we talked.

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,010
Looks like he talks with his hands.

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,120
He didn't do this to me.
Not most of it, anyway.

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,049
So that kid really was Connor?

31
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,459
Steven. His name's Steven now.

32
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,150
He's still my son.

33
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,120
- So where is he?
- I'm not sure.

34
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,329
But he knows where I am.
He'll be fine.

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,209
- Actually, he might not be.
- What do you mean?

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,180
Something may have escaped from
Quor-toth before we closed the portal.

37
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,120
Lorne's dimensional-magic expert
was picking up bad vibes.

38
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,590
- Nobody saw anything else come out?
- Well, not exactly.

39
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,879
- If my son was the last thing through....
- Right.

40
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,650
What if it was some vengeance-y
else thing that's after Connor?

41
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,819
He survived Quor-toth this long.
He can take care of himself.

42
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,699
So he survived an unspeakable
hell dimension. Who hasn't?

43
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,129
You can't just leave him alone
in Los Angeles.

44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,599
He's gotta come back on his own.

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,979
He will, just as soon as he realizes
what he needs.

46
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,340
And what's that?

47
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,340
A father.

48
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,780
A room.

49
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,469
I need a room for me and my father.

50
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,519
I found food
in a big metal box outside.

51
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,769
Dad?

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,060
Good boy. You got it.

53
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,120
Now, let's have a look at the date.

54
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,529
Days.

55
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,360
We've been gone only days.

56
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,439
I don't like this place.
So many people....

57
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,360
It's not like home.

58
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,279
Quor-toth was never our home.
It was our prison.

59
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,790
I should've known that one day
you'd find a way out.

60
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,930
Cracks were there already.

61
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,680
I just made the sluks show me.

62
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,769
Frightened rats,
forced to flee to daylight.

63
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,550
My boy's smart.

64
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,189
- You shouldn't have followed me here.
- How could I not?

65
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,339
I would have come back to you
after I killed him.

66
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:32,300
I'm sorry I couldn't.

67
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,470
Of course you couldn't.
It's not in you.

68
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,189
- I've killed lots.
- Only when you had to. Only to survive.

69
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,170
And that's not the real reason
why you worked so hard to get here.

70
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,449
- You wanted to see him.
- No.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,290
There's no shame in it.
I knew this day would come.

72
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,589
That's why I've never lied to you.

73
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,199
I have always told you the truth
about what your parents were...

74
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,639
- ...how you and I came to be together.
- God gave me to you.

75
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,990
Yes. God delivered you to me
that I might keep you safe...

76
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,990
...and lavish upon you the love
I could never give my first children.

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,310
- Because he took them from you.
- Right.

78
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,079
I wish I had killed him.

79
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:23,069
If you had, then you wouldn't be the boy
I'd raised, or the man I know you'll be.

80
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,149
There's more to learn, Steven.

81
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,959
- And I want to.
- Good.

82
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:35,720
Then you must go to him.

83
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,170
- What?
- Walk in his world. Learn all you can.

84
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,920
Discover what of him is in you,
that you might fight against it.

85
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:48,839
But be on your guard.
Remember what I've taught you.

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,269
The devil will show you bright things.
Many colors.

87
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,120
I had to get it enchanted.
Cedrian crystals don't come that way.

88
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,079
- Will it work?
- It should.

89
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,810
Cedrian crystals contain millennia
of stored mystical energy.

90
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,600
And it's about the size
of a D battery.

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,389
- That's gorgeous.
- And priceless.

92
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,079
Though in this instance, priceless
meaning "without price." As in free.

93
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,769
A six-horned Lach-nie Hag
owed me a favor.

94
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,660
- Don't ask.
- I meant that.

95
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,139
- Standard issue Geiger counter.
- We picked it up at a yard sale.

96
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,519
Shiny.

97
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,620
- What's its purpose?
- To see what came through the portal.

98
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,610
Anything from Quor-toth should've left
a kind of para-plasmic radioactivity.

99
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,649
Of course, I'm assuming that everything
in nature seeks a relaxed or stable state.

100
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,850
I know I do.

101
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,009
Hey.

102
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,870
- So how is he?
- Still being all mature.

103
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,660
- Really? Where?
- Upstairs.

104
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,149
I'm gonna go talk to him.

105
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,930
So I guess Fred's working on a way...

106
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:16,129
...to determine if anything else
came out of the portal.

107
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,259
That's good.

108
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,600
So maybe if we're very lucky, later
today we'll be able to kill something.

109
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,310
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Sure.

110
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,429
Well, I just wanted to check in,
let you know I was on the clock...

111
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,299
...and tell you that you're doing
the right thing.

112
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,100
What if he doesn't come back?

113
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,299
Hey, something troubling you, bubby?

114
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,250
- Indeed. I am confused.
- About what?

115
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,379
Angel. His inaction puzzles me.
When Connor was taken from him...

116
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,340
- ...he moved heaven and Tarkna.
- He sure did.

117
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,389
Hence our weekly scrubbing
of the lobby floor.

118
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,490
Now that his son is here,
he does nothing.

119
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,820
Sometimes nothing
is the best something.

120
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,370
If a thing's meant to be,
sometimes it's best not to force it.

121
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,429
If a thing is meant to be,
then how can it be forced?

122
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,100
- I guess it can't.
- And if a thing is not meant to be?

123
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,049
Well, then it really can't.

124
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:38,659
Just 'cause someone hops a dimension
is no guarantee things will work out.

125
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,889
Well, aren't you just sneaky
with the subtext.

126
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,700
It is a beautiful day.
If my princess asks...

127
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,159
...tell her I have gone for a walk.

128
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,940
If she asks.

129
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,509
He feels further away from me now
than when he was first taken.

130
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:17,480
All that time, I don't think I ever
really believed that I lost him.

131
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,879
Not really. Then he shows up again,
and I knew I had.

132
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,879
- It's only temporary.
- Yeah. Everything's temporary.

133
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:35,659
There's just so much I thought we'd
be able to do together before he....

134
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,690
- Grew up?
- Hated me.

135
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,120
Angel, he doesn't hate you.
He doesn't even know you.

136
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,659
But he will.
He's gonna come back, Angel.

137
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,500
- How do you know?
- Because he has to.

138
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,809
Because he's family.

139
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,750
Getting a good, strong reading here.

140
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,820
Should we be wearing lead?
'Cause I actually have something.

141
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,860
This is where the portal was...

142
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,389
...so it makes sense that I'd be
getting a reading here. Mark that.

143
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay, looks like something
might have come in here, or...

144
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,210
...here.

145
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,889
Wait a minute.

146
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,610
Wow. Something here is pretty...

147
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,909
...hot.

148
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,820
Angel's son. Hi!

149
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,070
I didn't mean to click at you.

150
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,950
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,629
I thought I'd come by, like you said.

152
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,159
Glad you did.

153
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,850
Everyone, this is Steven.

154
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,049
Steven, this is Fred, that's Gunn,
Cordelia, and that's Lorne.

155
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,639
Hello, young man.

156
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,389
So are we about done here?

157
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,590
- I think we've covered everything.
- Maybe we could take this outside.

158
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,580
We'll do a perimeter search,
then recalibrate for wider areas.

159
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,870
That'd be a good idea.

160
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,220
It was very nice to meet you, Steven.

161
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,370
Yeah, I have a thing.

162
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,580
I'll just be sure to hold
all your calls. You just--

163
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,620
- You guys take your time.
- Thanks.

164
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,070
So....

165
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,419
You hungry?

166
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,389
What do you have?

167
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,460
- We can go out.
- What? Where?

168
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,950
- Cordy?
- It's a bar! Vampires! A gang of them!

169
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:10,690
Angel, can you hear me?

170
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,460
I can see her. A woman. Angel!

171
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,570
She's all alone.
She doesn't see them.

172
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,000
- Angel, you have to hurry!
- Slow down.

173
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,090
There's a woman at a bar.
Vampires are after her.

174
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,860
- You have to help her.
- So much for holding my calls.

175
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,690
- Sorry.
- Listen...

176
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,490
- ...I have to go out for a while.
- It's okay.

177
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,580
- It's kind of my job.
- Yeah, whatever.

178
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,820
It could be kind of dangerous.
There's killing and violence.

179
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,259
You wanna come?

180
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,009
See you got my invitation.

181
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,309
Lilah.

182
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,240
Obviously.

183
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,370
I thought the "come alone"
was a particularly ironic touch.

184
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,450
I mean, how else would you come?

185
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,610
Don't rush off. Just look over there.

186
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,059
I went through a lot of trouble
to arrange this show for you.

187
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,809
Goodbye.

188
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,929
Leave now, and you'll miss
her big death scene.

189
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,169
Wouldn't you like to see the bitch that
slit your throat and left you to die...

190
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,970
- ...get a little of her own back?
- What's going on?

191
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,539
Some source, can't imagine who...

192
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,490
...tipped her off that this place
would be filthy with vampires.

193
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,990
Which, as it turns out, is true.

194
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,549
Right. Because that same source...

195
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,269
...tipped off the vampires
that she'd be here.

196
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,200
She has been pissing off a lot
of un-dead Americans.

197
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,100
And you thought I'd enjoy
a box seat for her slaughter?

198
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,200
Well, yeah.

199
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,450
- You don't know a thing about me.
- Probably not.

200
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,730
Like, will he go straight to his car,
or will he stop to warn her first?

201
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:47,070
He has to think about it.
That's good.

202
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,070
That's all I really needed to know.
You can go.

203
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,029
- A test, Lilah?
- Don't look so grim.

204
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,970
I needed to know
if I was wasting my time.

205
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,039
To prove we're friends, I'll pull her
out before anything lethal happens.

206
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,440
So you don't have to torture yourself
as to whether you did the right thing.

207
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,359
I don't think that will be necessary.

208
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,240
You wanted to kill a vampire.
This might be your chance.

209
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,440
- Make sure you go straight for--
- The heart. My father taught me.

210
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,549
Yeah, I'm sure he did.
There are innocent people here.

211
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:36,309
Don't nail anyone until
they show their game face.

212
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,109
- Will it look like yours did?
- Yeah.

213
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,660
So why do you do it?

214
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,609
Do what?

215
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,950
Why kill them if they're like you?

216
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,279
- They're not like me, Connor.
- I'm not Connor.

217
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,220
- Another?
- Stay there.

218
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,930
- No, I'm done.
- You're not wrong.

219
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,900
- She thinks she's a slayer.
- She'll learn different.

220
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,740
Nice! Take the one on the--

221
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,170
Well, yeah, that makes the most sense.

222
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,109
Who's the boy wonder?

223
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,900
- He moves just like--
- His father.

224
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,140
Go! Get out of here!

225
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,589
Go!

226
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,170
Now tell me you're not interested.

227
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,920
They don't need to breathe
or make any sound.

228
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,250
You gotta be careful.

229
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,519
You know, you were good in there.

230
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,539
I mean, normally I'd take you
to a ball game or a museum...

231
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,240
...or something.

232
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,740
It's just good to know that you
can handle yourself in a fight.

233
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,099
It's good to know you can do that too.

234
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,210
Whoa.

235
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,710
Father.

236
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,160
He was everything that you said.

237
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,450
He tried to deceive me by saving
people, but it didn't work.

238
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,990
- I've seen his true face.
- And I've seen yours.

239
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,119
The kid was born for it,

240
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,670
The way he anticipated....
I'm telling you, it's in his blood.

241
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,230
You don't say.

242
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,910
It was like we had never been apart.

243
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,400
He felt it too. I know he did.
You should've seen us.

244
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,630
I did.

245
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,269
What do you mean, you did?

246
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,930
After you left,
I went back into my vision.

247
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,450
You went back in?

248
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,710
Don't ask me how.

249
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,619
I don't know if it's a part of my new
semi-demon-ness...

250
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,220
...or if they just let me go back in.

251
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,589
But I was there.

252
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,099
I saw the whole thing.
You and your son together.

253
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,930
It was beautiful.

254
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,079
- Stop saying that,
- It's true, son.

255
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,630
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

256
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:13,819
Anyone who saw you together would
realize it's where you're meant to be.

257
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,559
- At his side.
- No!

258
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:18,619
Your need for him drove you
across the dimensions.

259
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,190
- I don't need him!
- Go back to him, Steven.

260
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,950
Why are you doing this? Why?

261
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,180
God gave me to you.

262
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,140
Yes. It was God's plan
for us to be together.

263
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,349
Nothing will ever persuade me
otherwise.

264
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,339
But now it's time for me
to give you back.

265
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,960
- He's a demon.
- You're the bastard son of two demons.

266
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,119
- Then I'm a demon.
- You're not.

267
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,150
God help me,
I don't know what you are...

268
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:54,089
...but I am not the one to give you
answers. And there are answers.

269
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,990
Go and find them out.

270
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,140
Except for the hotel, the strongest
emissions are coming from this vicinity.

271
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,269
Now what? Do we go door to door and
ask if anyone's seen any bogies?

272
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,539
I'm not sure. I don't even know if
we should be looking above ground.

273
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,930
You told me not to be deceived,
but you've let yourself be deceived.

274
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,400
If I could stop this, I would, son.

275
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,029
But we were brought here by forces
beyond our control.

276
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,700
You're wrong.

277
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,019
Hey.

278
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,130
Check it out.

279
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,849
We've been following Angel's
son's emissions the whole time.

280
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,339
There's a sentence I don't ever
need to hear again.

281
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,109
But it's good, right?

282
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,970
No big scary came out of the portal.

283
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,829
How about a short scary?

284
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,890
Hey, kiddo. Didn't see you.

285
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,710
Looking for your dad?
Come on, he's upstairs.

286
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,259
I'll show you the room.

287
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,109
- This way.
- I'm not going with you, demon.

288
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,359
I'll tell you what.

289
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:16,779
Since you were raised in a hell
dimension by a psychopath...

290
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:21,329
...and since I know something
about that, we'll let that slide.

291
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,039
- I'll fetch your pop for you.
- Filthy demon.

292
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,029
Actually, that's
"Uncle Filthy Demon" to you.

293
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,309
A week ago, I was changing
your diapers, you little pr--

294
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,509
Hey.

295
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,289
What's the problem?

296
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,900
Steven?

297
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,900
Steven.

298
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,819
You haven't been
in this world very long...

299
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,779
...and I imagine things are pretty
Wild West-y where you're from...

300
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,769
...but Lorne's a good guy.
Honestly.

301
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,069
- It's a demon.
- Right, true. He is.

302
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,890
But demon doesn't always mean
evil in this dimension.

303
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:12,869
I mean, look at me.

304
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,210
Well, I'm part demon.

305
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,460
Yeah. By choice.

306
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,460
I did it to help people, and so that
the back of my head wouldn't explode--

307
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,839
Cordy!

308
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,839
Let it go, honey.

309
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,869
Just let it go.

310
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,339
You don't need that.

311
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,470
You don't need any of that.

312
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,390
That's right.

313
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,490
Just let it go, baby.

314
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,710
It's okay, sweetie.

315
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,690
That's right. It's okay.

316
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,079
I know.

317
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,519
It's okay.

318
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,509
How do you feel?

319
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,240
Okay.

320
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,869
Drained, but okay.

321
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,819
Well, you got some serious
mojo going on, girl.

322
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,839
The deal you struck with The Powers,
they gave you the full package.

323
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,359
All the extras.

324
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,339
That kid was toxic when he came here
tonight. Heavy on the "ick."

325
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:17,940
- What actually happened out there?
- In my professional opinion?

326
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,779
Miss Demon-y Britches gave
that child some kind of soul colonic.

327
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,579
- Flushed him out.
- Flushed what out?

328
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:27,509
It was that place.
Quor-toth.

329
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,769
It crept into every part of him.
He was sick with it.

330
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,460
- Fred's readings--
- He nearly broke the needle.

331
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,569
My guess? She wouldn't even get
so much as a click off of him now.

332
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,880
Thank you.

333
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:48,190
Thank you for doing this for him.

334
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:55,269
I know what it was like for him there.
The darkness and confusion.

335
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,920
He thought it was where he belonged.

336
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:07,289
Hey, pal.

337
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,109
How you doing?

338
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,900
I tried to kill your friend.

339
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,640
Yeah, well, you know, she's used to it.

340
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,869
I think I should go.

341
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,019
Look...

342
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,109
...why don't you just stay here.

343
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,210
I know it doesn't feel like it yet...

344
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,710
...but this could be home for you.

345
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't have a home.

346
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,819
That's not true.

347
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,500
You just don't remember, that's all.

348
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,839
Your home is here.

349
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,960
This is where you're
supposed to be, son.

350
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:05,829
You speak as though you're my father.

351
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,289
- Well--
- He said the same thing.

352
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:17,400
He said we came back for a reason.

353
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,210
Did he?

354
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,500
Daniel.

355
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,349
I told him you two were gonna
take him out.

356
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,529
- And he's good with that?
- Yeah, he seems to be.

357
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,450
Where do you want us to take him?

358
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,549
Someplace where this world
isn't as ugly as he thinks it is.

359
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,799
- How long you need?
- Couple of hours.

360
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,509
- What if he asks where you're at?
- Don't tell him.

361
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,509
Wait, we have to do that thing.

362
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,369
- What thing?
- That thing we do.

363
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,500
Where I say, "Do you know what you're
doing? Please think about this."

364
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,799
Then you ignore me
and rush into trouble.

365
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,990
Right. That thing.

366
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,839
- We done?
- Please think about this.

367
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,569
Don't go.

368
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,279
- I have to.
- I know, but don't.

369
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,049
I won't kill him, though he deserves it.

370
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,710
I don't care if you kill him.

371
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,369
He stole Connor's childhood,
so kill him.

372
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:40,809
But don't lie to your son.

373
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:44,200
He's been here, like, a day.
Way to build the trust.

374
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm not lying to him.

375
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,160
You're distracting him while you confront
the man he thinks of as his father.

376
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,950
I'm his father.

377
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:58,359
Before you, there was nothing,

378
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,460
I was dead.

379
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,579
They had taken my sister.
They had taken a part of me.

380
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,450
You gave me a reason again.
Even if it was all lies.

381
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,180
Not all.

382
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,700
I still think I'd do anything for you.

383
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:20,339
I'd have followed you into hell
if you would've let me.

384
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,369
Thank God you didn't.

385
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,059
I can't believe you survived it.

386
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:31,250
How did you?

387
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,930
- My hate kept us alive.
- Hate gets a bad rap.

388
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,039
It can keep you going sometimes
when nothing else will.

389
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,250
Yes. I found that I had to stay alive
that I might pass on my legacy of hate.

390
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,529
But something happened in that place.
Something changed.

391
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,079
Amidst the most unspeakable ugliness...

392
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,650
...the hate turned into love.

393
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,619
Love for a son. Hate's not enough.

394
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,410
I found that love is far more powerful.

395
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,680
Now there's just one thing
I need you to do for me...

396
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:13,670
...and then I can finally be done
with vengeance.

397
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,289
What is it?

398
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,970
The ocean. Pacific.

399
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,130
Ocean.

400
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,940
My father taught me about oceans.

401
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,240
He never said it was so....

402
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,460
Big?

403
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,569
Empty.

404
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:42,009
It's not.
It's just all under the surface.

405
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,839
A whole other world, actually.

406
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,869
Everything's so different here.

407
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,509
I know how you feel.

408
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,630
I got lost once, like you.

409
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,200
When I came back,
nothing seemed real.

410
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,309
Like I was seeing everything
from the bottom of the ocean.

411
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,210
I don't remember being lost.

412
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,700
Steven? Yo!

413
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:18,650
Maybe we should just give him a minute.

414
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,569
- I wish Angel was here.
- Yeah.

415
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,619
His kid's seeing the ocean
for the first time, he's missing it.

416
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,869
That's not what I meant.

417
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,190
I just feel sort of creepy.

418
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:47,440
- Keeping him distracted while Angel--
- Confronts the kidnapper?

419
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,549
Well, if you're gonna
put it like that....

420
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:56,200
- What do you think he'll do?
- I don't know.

421
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:01,559
I know what I'd do, but Angel
will deal with Holtz in his own way.

422
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,230
Uh-oh.

423
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,750
No way.

424
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,599
He couldn't have heard us.

425
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,440
He did.

426
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,000
Angel. Oh, my God, do you know how
happy this makes me?

427
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,719
I asked you not to go,
and you didn't go.

428
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,260
I am so glad to see...

429
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,130
...you.

430
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,190
Hi.

431
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,650
I can't recall...

432
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,769
...would you require an invitation for
a place like this?

433
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,300
Public accommodation.

434
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,989
- No.
- No.

435
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:20,210
You'd think I'd remember something
like that. It seemed important once.

436
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,769
Details begin to escape me.

437
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:28,789
You stole my son.

438
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,000
I kept your son alive.
You murdered mine.

439
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,849
I was different then.

440
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,059
Yes. So was I.

441
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,530
You feel remorse.

442
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,380
You feel remorse,
yet you can't express it.

443
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:08,949
You want me to say I'm sorry?

444
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,920
How can I? It wouldn't mean a thing.

445
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:20,449
It would mean a little.
Not much, but it would be something.

446
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,260
Then I'm sorry.

447
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,579
For whatever little it might mean.

448
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,039
It's all I've got.

449
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,550
Not all. You had a son.

450
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,130
So there it is.

451
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,570
I thought by depriving you
of that son...

452
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,039
...it would allow me some measure
of justice. I was wrong.

453
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,550
Taking Connor from me was
never justice.

454
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,900
- It was vengeance.
- Or maybe vengeance is what I do now:

455
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,559
- Give back what I took.
- What?

456
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm an old man now.
I have nothing to offer the boy.

457
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,550
You can give him what I can't:
his purpose.

458
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:31,070
But every time you look upon his face,
every time he calls you "Father"...

459
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,500
...you'll be reminded of that which
you took and can never give back.

460
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,050
And if that is vengeance,
I find I have no taste for it.

461
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:57,090
All I ask is that you give him this.
It's not sealed.

462
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,659
I expect you'll examine it.
You should.

463
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,639
Why are you doing this?

464
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:08,170
I thought I made that plain.
I love my son.

465
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,250
And it's the only way I know to ensure
he'll go on loving me.

466
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:34,929
He won't accept this at first.
He'll try to find me.

467
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,400
He never will.

468
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,039
Dearest Steven, This is a most
difficult letter for me to write,

469
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,659
You mean more to me than anything
in this world or any other,

470
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,559
But your best interests
must come first...

471
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,969
... which is why by the time you
receive this, I will be gone,

472
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:26,360
I hope one day you will be able
to forgive an old man 's weakness...

473
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,210
... which compels him to say
these things in a letter,

474
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,139
But to attempt a goodbye in your
presence would be impossible for me,

475
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,800
I fear I would never let you go,
and I must let you go,

476
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,000
I know that if I didn 't you would
only end up hating me...

477
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:46,340
...and that I could not bear,

478
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,489
Don't make me do it. I can't.

479
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,840
We already know you can.
You promised.

480
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,019
You said you'd do anything for me.
Come on, Justine.

481
00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm not asking you to follow me into
hell. Just help send me there.

482
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,809
Your destiny lies with Angel,
I know that now,

483
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,280
You will have a better life with him,

484
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,139
I'm comforted by that certainty
and in the knowledge that with him...

485
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,960
... you'll discover your true purpose...

486
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,519
...and come to know who it is
you are meant to be,

487
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,199
Steven.

488
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,090
Connor.

489
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,929
Dad! Dad?

490
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,960
My only prayer...

491
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,170
...is that I have prepared you
well enough for whatever lies ahead,

492
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,550
I trust I have, Be brave,
lovingly, your father,

493
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,489
Angelus.
