You want to get into that
limo when it gets here...

170
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,170
...that's up to you. It's not
a decision I can make for you.

171
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,292
For any of you. But know this.
Before the ride's even over...

172
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:19,241
...before you even cross through
their doors, you'll be corrupted.

173
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,688
- Where are you heading to?
- I'm gonna find my son.

174
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,129
See if I can get lucky,
pick up his trail.

175
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,246
- I can't believe he thought you meant...
- I'm going to bed.

176
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,770
Yes, I should be heading home
myself.

177
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,130
It's late.

178
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:40,289
Well...

00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:44,690
...night, all.
- Night.

180
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:46,845
Good night.

181
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:30,332
I don't know how long
it's been here.

182
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,847
Since before I arrived.

183
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,087
I thought I'd be the only one.

184
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,603
And I thought for sure I wouldn't be.

185
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:44,482
Although I wasn't expecting it
to be you.

186
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,405
I just figured...

187
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,564
...well, if they are
up to something...

188
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,248
We should know what it is.
I get that.

189
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:59,048
- Well, we three.
- Looks like.

190
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,362
What are the odds the humans
would be the most corruptible?

191
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:07,525
Maybe we should just
go back inside.

192
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:10,969
- What if Angel's right?
- Yeah, and what if he's not?

193
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:13,249
All we're gonna do is take the tour.

WESLEY:
Hmm.

195
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,930
Go into this with our eyes
open and our wits about us.

196
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,607

Does that mean you don't
restock the cherries?

201
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,127
Hi.

202
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,368
- Mr. Angel, good morning.
MAN 1: Morning, Mr. Angel.

203
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,892
Good morning, Mr. Angel.

204
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,327
Good morning, Mr. Angel.

205
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,883
- There's no way this is gonna go well.
- Good morning, Mr. Angel.

Good morning, Mr. Angel.

209
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:30,372
Well, you've all made it.
What a shock.

210
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,969
We've got a lot of ground to cover,
so best we get started.

211
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,170
- Let me introduce you to your guides.
- Guides?

212
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:39,087
Separate guides?

213
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:43,088
Of course. There are five of you,
all with specific interests...

214
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,971
...unique areas of expertise.

215
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:49,445
It seemed the most efficient way
of doing this. Prioritize and personalize.

216
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:53,043
- Divide and conquer, you mean.
- Oh, you're so cynical.

217
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:54,965
See?
This is gonna work out great.

218
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,805
We don't split up.

00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:00,010
We came here together.
We're gonna take the tour together.

- Right, guys?
- Do I get her?

221
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:08,208
Look, if we'd wanted to harm you,
we'd have blown up the limo, right?

222
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:14,126
If you'd prefer to be armed during
your stay here, we'd have no objections.

223
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,925
Just because we tried to kill...

224
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:20,449
...or corrupt each and every one of you
at one time or another...

225
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,251
...doesn't mean we can't be trusted.

226
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,963
She's right.
We've made deals with them before.

227
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,569
They are honorable, in their way.
I doubt we'll be in any danger.

228
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,724
She was right about the limo.

229
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:33,647
Do I get her?

230
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,849
I think we'll be okay.

231
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,211
Lorne, Preston will show you around
our entertainment division.

Hi. Big fan. Huge.
Love your work.

233
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:49,204
I had this prepared. Confidential list.
Peepers only.

234
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:52,046
Thought you might want to
take a gander at our roster.

235
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:54,773
Just a rundown of some
of the talent we represent here.

236
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:59,370
I don't think you have to tell me
what you represent here, young man.

237
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,970
I know. Evil.
Pure evil and the...

I think you'll find you two
have nothing in common.

246
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,845
- This way, Chuck.
- Are you gonna try to corrupt me?

247
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,322
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- We'll have to work on that.

00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,329
Well, this should be...

00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,812
...fun.

254
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,932
Yeah.

00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,685

00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:20,849
...giving each of us
our own little tour.

262
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:24,403
- It's a good way to isolate Angel.
- Is that what we're doing?

263
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,041
Be a big coup, bringing Angel
over to the dark side.

264
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,010
Vampire with a soul. Champion.

265
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,164
It's gonna look good
on anyone's letterhead.

00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,883
LACEY: Why do you assume Angel
is our priority?

267
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,523
GUNN: You telling me he isn't?
LACEY: A priority.

268
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:40,685
Though you each possess
gifts we feel would be useful.

269
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,242
Well, I see what the others got.

270
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,564
Fred's big brain. Wes' training.
Lorne's mind-reading thing.

271
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,851
Guess I just don't know what
you guys expect me to do around...

00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:52,287
...here.

273
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:55,122
Though I think maybe
I'm starting to figure it out.

274
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,488
Bet I'd look real smart
in one of them blazers.

275
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,245
Oh, I'm sure you would.

276
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,530
But we have much grander plans
for you, Mr. Gunn.

277
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,968
You do? Grander?

278
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:07,332
Let's go upstairs.

279
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,529
FRED:
So are you a lawyer?

280
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,968
You don't look like a lawyer.

281
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,522
No, I'm strictly R & D.

282
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,366
Although, occasionally
some D & D.

283
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,607
D & D. Dungeons and...

284
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:25,207
We actually have a dungeon.
I can show it to you later if...

285
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:28,048
I manage the science division.

286
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,921
Seem young to be a head
of a whole science division.

287
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,881
Oh, I'm not the head, I just manage it
for the department head...

288
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:38,125
...which I guess, you know,
would be you.

289
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,365
- Wow.
- I know.

290
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,884
Everything modern technology
has to offer, at your fingertips.

291
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,005
Everything state-of-the-art,

292
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,050
That's one of my creations.

293
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,883
You might want to get out
of the lab more.

294
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,567
Personal organizers
have been around for a while.

295
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:09,521
I mean, not that it's not
a nice PalmPilot.

296
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,445
I'll bet your buddy Matthew Partney...

297
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:15,083
...at 6200 Crestwood Boulevard
in Lubbock, Texas would agree.

298
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,369

You're like the MacGyver

You're not wrong.

303
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,561

- Looks as if your wing's been clipped.
- Appearances can be deceiving.

307
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,648
It's actually the most
comprehensive collection...

308

...of prophesy archives
to be found anywhere.

309
00:19:56,733 --> 00:20:00,612
Choose something to read. Go on,
anything at all. Something rare.

310
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:03,925
All right.

311
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,924
The <i>Devandire Sibylline Codex</i>.

312
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,648
Translated or Sanskrit?

313
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,764
- Surprise me.
- I'm sure I will.

314
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,284

provides access...

...to anything stored
in the firm's locked archives...

317
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,893
...relating to prophesies, omens,
revelations and so on.

318
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,532
Impressive.

319
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,571
And does the Watchers
Council know...

320
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,442
...you stole the only known copy
of the Codex when you left?

321
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:46,685
There is no Council.

322
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,643
Not anymore, no.

323
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,368
So you opted to, what...

324
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,205
...play for the other side?

325
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,125
Cross the line?

326
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:59,888
These are complicated times.
Lines become blurry.

00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:01,884
How did you know?

328
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:05,009
Something about Watchers and...

329
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,332
...libraries.

Money, clothes, women.

331

ANGEL: This is what you came back for?

332
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:26,531
To play <i>Let's Make an Evil Deal</i>?

333
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,605
LILAH: Show him what's behind
door number one, Bob.

334
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:31,845
I know it's not much, but...

335
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:34,368
...the Taj Mahal
was a bit of a commute.

336

00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,403
You let him get me.

505
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:10,932
You let him get me.

506
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:20,165
Cordy...

507
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,731
...you swore you loved me.

508
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,604
Where are you now?

509
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:33,326
Connor, you have to believe that
there are people who love you.

510
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,802
Jasmine believed you
when you said you loved her...

511
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,487
...but it was all a lie.
- Jasmine was the lie.

512
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:40,052
No!

513
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,051
She knew if you found out
who she was you'd turn against her.

514
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,329
And she was right.
That's just what happened.

515
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,410
People like you...

516
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:53,921
...people like this, none of you
deserved what she could give you.

517
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:58,402
She wanted to give you everything.

518
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:00,891
I know how that feels...

519
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,642
...because I want to give you
everything.

520
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,691
I want to take back the mistakes...

521
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:11,245
...help you start over.

522
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,925
You can't start over.

523
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:16,932
We can.

524
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,568
You and me, we can change things.

525
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:23,567
There's only one thing
that ever changes anything...

526
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,212
...and that's death.

527
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,568
Everything else is just a lie.

528
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:36,487
You can't be saved by a lie.

529
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,569
You can't be saved at all.

Run. Hurry up, all of you.

Go!

532
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:38,609
I really do love you, Connor.

533
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,049
So, what are you gonna do about it?

534
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:47,727

Hi.

537
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:17,212
Oh, let me tell you, when
this cruise ship sets sail...

538
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:19,568
...I will be on the Lido deck.

539
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:22,122
I mean, it's unbelievable.
Secrets of the universe.

540

Like Siegfried, evil.
Roy, not so much.

Oh, and balance?

542
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:31,366
Very, very important.

543
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:37,045
Guess we're all straggling back.

544
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,408
Some more straggly-like than others.
Are you...?

545
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,484
Just...

546
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:43,405
...a lot to take in.

548
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,485
Did they make you taller?

549
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,565
I'm doing this.

550
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:01,248
Hope it's not just me.
But if it is, that's all right too.

551
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:05,050
As much as it pains me to admit it,
there's probably a great deal...

552
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:08,364
...we could accomplish
with the resources available here.

553
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,569
I can't believe it.
Are...?

554
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,644
Are you saying we should
take the deal?

I already took it.

What?

558
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:21,687
You took the deal?

559
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:24,530
Executive decision.

560
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:29,522
- I didn't think you'd...
LILAH: Know a silver platter?

561
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:37,446
I'm impressed with the lot of you.
Team Angel, all growed up.

562
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,405
It's taken care of?

563
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,172
Cordelia's safe and sound.

564
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,484
Probably getting a manicure
and a blow dry as we speak.

565
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:46,644
You found Cordy?

566
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,684
- And she's...?
- Still in a coma.

567
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,683
But, hey, doesn't mean
she can't look her best.

568
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:55,922
She'll receive the finest care,
medical and metaphysical.

569
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:59,250
If there's a way to get her back,
we'll find it.

570
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,608
Good. Just one more piece of business.

571
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,126
I gotta see him.

572
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:07,404
I'm sorry, Angel, but that
wasn't part of the deal.

573
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:11,202
Value of compromise.
Remember, Lilah?

574
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:13,845
I need to see him.

575
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:16,332
You're the boss.

576
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:22,042
There will be a limo waiting outside.
It'll take you to see Connor.

577
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,846
Thank you.

578
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:37,965
Who's Connor?

579
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:37,684
CONNOR: You just opened up
a whole bottle for yourself, didn't you?

580
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,129
I don't know what you're saying.
You know, you've got your pick.

581
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:43,807
- Any college you want to.
- It's really not a big deal.

582
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:47,045
- Top tenth percentile is.
- Is Tracy going to the same college?

583
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,602
DAD: Bad idea.
- We haven't really talked about it.

584
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:52,532
No, I love Tracy.
It's a bad way to go.

585
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,285
- Tracy's a vegan.
AUNT: So?

586
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,241
- At least she doesn't live on Pop-Tarts.
- Maybe I'll go to school overseas.

587
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:00,802
Like Russia.
Is anything further away than Russia?

588
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:04,852
- Don't you even joke about it.
DAD: I feel a toast coming on.

589
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,283
AUNT: There he goes.
- To the top 10th percentile.

590
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:11,287
Okay, whoa, whoa. Enough.
That's all I had to hear.

591
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:14,365
Since it's my special day,
and I'm all brilliant...

...and I'm forced to spend
a few months with you freaks...

I get to make the toast, okay?

595
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,685
To family.

596
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,205
SISTER: I should get wine for the toast.
