1
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,730
The Hyperion Hotel.

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,080
- It seems to be abandoned.
- 68 rooms, 68 vacancies.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,980
- I'd say, built in the late '20s.
- That's my guess.

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:18,530
It's in what used to be old Hollywood.
Probably empty for years.

5
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,559
From the look of it.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,550
English Breakfast tea...

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,500
...coffee, O-pos.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,820
Is its current condition due to more
than just the tourist trade drying up?

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,100
Something the matter?

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,200
I, uh....
I think it's gone bad.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,439
It's starting to coagulate.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,829
No, that's cinnamon.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,530
I can't try something?

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,009
What do we do?

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,609
I need you two to find out
about this place.

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,840
- Who's the client?
- No client. I'll check back later.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,689
- Cryptic much?
- This goes beyond real estate.

19
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,489
Look at cold police files.
Homicides, missing persons...

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,180
...everything from
the beginning to now.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,370
You think whatever lived there
did so for some time.

22
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,200
Probably right up to the end.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,000
Returned mail for 315.

24
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,819
Mr. Ferris should try using stamps.

25
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,469
Mrs. Miggins' breakfast from Val's
Liquors. They've cut off her credit.

26
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,829
And the weekly bill for 217.

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,709
Whoa, whoa, why me?
I did it last time.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,090
Guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,759
Say, how about instead
I deliver an eviction notice?

30
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,569
We cannot evict residents
because they're strange.

31
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,379
If we did, we'd close down.

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,680
Ever look into his eyes?

33
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,050
There's nothing there.

34
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,159
Hello? Bellman. Anybody home?

35
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,030
Okay. Well, I guess
you've gone out, so....

36
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,020
I'll just leave this here...

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,860
...and you can pick it up
when it's convenient.

38
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,710
Come on, come on.

39
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,879
Are you now or have you ever been a
member of the Communist Party?

40
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,079
I'm framing my answer in the
only way an American citizen--

41
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,610
Then you deny....

42
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,199
Come on, honey. This is how
Lana Turner got started.

43
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,879
No messages for 217.

44
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,379
Mr. Carter's bag to 515. Thanks.

45
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,910
I know what the sign says,
but we have no vacancies right now.

46
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Sign's wrong. Sure it is. Come on.

47
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,560
Yes....

48
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,730
Yes....

49
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,709
I understand.

50
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,040
Of course.

51
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,180
I am.

52
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,789
I'll be finished in two shakes, sir.

53
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,919
You're not the maid.

54
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,769
What do you mean?

55
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,679
You're no maid.
There's no trolley outside...

56
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,120
...those sheets are dirty...

57
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,330
...and you're the wrong color.

58
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,019
I'm sorry.
The door was open. I just--

59
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,970
There's nothing to steal.

60
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,570
No, I wasn't stealing.
I can explain--

61
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,360
Not interested. Just go.

62
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,889
- I can't.
- I'll help you.

63
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,580
My boyfriend,
he's the jealous type.

64
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,250
Then you shouldn't
wander into men's rooms.

65
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,549
He can't find me.

66
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,970
Where is she?

67
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,179
Look, pal,
this is none of your business.

68
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,220
That's why you're gonna go away.

69
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,509
I know you're hiding her in there.

70
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,279
- I'm not hiding anybody.
- No?

71
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,649
Then send her out here
so I don't have to get her.

72
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,990
You're not coming in here.

73
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,659
You won't mind if I come in
and look around, then?

74
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,299
Guess I do mind.

75
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,309
He's going down.

76
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,210
Gosh. That was.... Gosh!

77
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,409
Listen, I know we got off on
the wrong foot. My name is Judy.

78
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,970
The hotel closed its doors
on December 16, 1919,

79
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,299
That morning, the concierge made
his rounds with a 12-gauge shotgun...

80
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,830
...room to room.
It's been empty ever since.

81
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,629
According to city records,
it was declared a landmark.

82
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,460
The company that owns it has been
trying to sell for 10 years...

83
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,649
- ...no buyers.
- Well, no wonder.

84
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,169
These records indicate
a storied legacy...

85
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,879
...of murder and mayhem
dating back to '28...

86
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,659
...when a roofer killed himself
and two others.

87
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,399
Wow. That's really interesting.
What are we doing?

88
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,450
- Doing?
- Yes.

89
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,399
Angel never told us
the point of all this.

90
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,070
Ah, well. I mean, clearly...

91
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,759
...he has us organizing data,
compiling incidents so that....

92
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,659
Yes, I did notice that,
the "no point" thing.

93
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,389
Frankly, I haven't the slightest idea
what to do with all this.

94
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:05,120
Wesley.
Look who was staying here in '52.

95
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,820
Well, now we know
one thing for certain.

96
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,690
Yup, vampires do photograph,
they just don't do it well.

97
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,500
I mean, we know that Angel had
a connection to this place.

98
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,320
So why didn't he just tell us?

99
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,490
Perhaps he was ashamed to.

100
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,909
Yes.

101
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,850
Yes, I did.

102
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,320
Yes, I do.

103
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,750
She was cleaning
when she found him.

104
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,159
- She touch anything?
- Consuela? Does she ever?

105
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,009
Oh, my goodness.

106
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,519
This is the third one in three months.
Why does this happen here?

107
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,659
- The guy seemed depressed.
- How could you tell?

108
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,629
Kind of cheap, though. The
death-wishers usually tip better.

109
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,730
Take a look at the way his body
is laid down. You can tell....

110
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,990
Three in three months,
they'll shut you down,

111
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,750
Yes. They will.

112
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,720
Who do you want me to call first?

113
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:57,559
What?

114
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,330
- The carpet cleaners or the cops?
- Don't call anyone.

115
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,049
- They'll shut us down.
- What about him?

116
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,769
- What about him?
- We can't leave him.

117
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,750
Right. Store him in the meat locker.

118
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,940
Store him?

119
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,110
We're gonna store him?

120
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,720
The salesman in 215 shot himself.

121
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,909
- Really, suicide?
- In this hotel.

122
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,909
- They're not reporting it.
- Terrible!

123
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,429
Why? It was a suicide.
Why involve anyone else?

124
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,210
- Are all writers crass?
- Are all actors naive?

125
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,600
Do you want the press
to get involved?

126
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,690
- Nothing wrong with discretion.
- That's what I say.

127
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,659
Maybe this wasn't a suicide,

128
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,169
Are you sure you're safe here?

129
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,220
The world ends in 10 minutes.

130
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,940
I saw you over here.
I thought I'd say hello. Hello!

131
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,179
Have you seen the show?

132
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,730
You should.

133
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,409
It makes whatever problems
we have seem insignificant.

134
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,379
The entire universe explodes.

135
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,539
- Sounds exciting.
- Well, it's air-conditioned.

136
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,000
And it's cheaper than
going to the pictures.

137
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,669
I had to get out of the hotel.

138
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,789
Did he come back?

139
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,740
Come back?

140
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,620
Your boyfriend.

141
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,049
Oh. No.

142
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,889
I mean the guy in 215.

143
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,210
- He killed himself.
- Yeah. I guess so.

144
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,620
Imagine that wallpaper being
the last thing you ever see?

145
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,390
Maybe it was the wallpaper
that drove him to it.

146
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,069
I sort of hate it there.

147
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,180
I guess it's nicer than some places.

148
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,180
It's a place.

149
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,150
Listen, I know you didn't
want to help me before...

150
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:29,000
...but you did.
And I want to thank you.

151
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,799
You're gonna miss
the end of the world.

152
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,160
Right.

153
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,000
See you around.

154
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,140
Yeah.

155
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,240
Put Frank Gilnitz in '52.

156
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,579
But he wasn't executed until '54.
Shouldn't he go there?

157
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,230
He wasn't executed until '54,
but the crime...

158
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,359
...of murdering a salesman and
storing his body in the meat locker...

159
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,640
That occurred in '52.

160
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,710
It's like a puzzle.

161
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,559
The who-died-horribly-because
Angel-screwed up-50-years-ago game.

162
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,099
--so the guy asks me:

163
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,460
- "Do they serve peanuts here?"
- So?

164
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,819
- So he was thinking about peanuts?
- Maybe he was hungry.

165
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,700
- This wasn't suicide.
- I thought his door was locked.

166
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,319
- Exactly.
- It's too perfect.

167
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,380
Locked-door mystery.
I've written it a hundred times.

168
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,420
Hey!

169
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,500
Can you come in for a sec?

170
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,170
Did you hear?

171
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,420
Hear what?

172
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,119
The guy in 215.

173
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,670
It wasn't a suicide.
He was murdered.

174
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,430
- I don't think so.
- So it's true.

175
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,710
There's gonna be police
and questions...

176
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:38,839
...and I thought that you might
want to know, in case maybe--

177
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:44,549
- Not that you're hiding anything.
- Everyone here's hiding something.

178
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,470
Yeah....

179
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,680
I kind of owe you one, on account
of what you did for me before.

180
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,569
Thanks.

181
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:02,910
I guess if we left now,
it would look bad.

182
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:04,890
That all depends.

183
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,940
This have anything to do with
that P.I. I tossed out of here?

184
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,099
You knew he wasn't my boyfriend.

185
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,329
I had a hunch.

186
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:23,210
I think he works
for my former employers.

187
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,559
City Trust Bank of Salina, Kansas.

188
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,380
I was a teller there.

189
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,339
I think maybe they want this back.

190
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,789
I haven't spent any of it.
Not a dime. I won't touch it.

191
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,089
- Why take it?
- I don't know.

192
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,920
I was angry. I panicked.
Things were going so well.

193
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:02,940
I loved this job
and I loved this guy.

194
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,349
We were engaged and...

195
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,089
...they found out about me
and I got fired.

196
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,140
And then Peter dumped me
and I just couldn't go back there...

197
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:18,329
...so I took this and I just ran.

198
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,329
Aren't you gonna ask
why they fired me?

199
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,019
Why did they fire you?

200
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:34,329
Because I'm not what I say I am.

201
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,630
- I've been passing since I was 15.
- Passing?

202
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,720
For white.

203
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,869
My mom was colored. My father...

204
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,950
...I didn't know him.

205
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,769
My blood isn't pure. It's tainted.

206
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,839
It's just blood, Judy.

207
00:21:57,809 --> 00:21:59,980
It's all just blood.

208
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,509
Nobody believes that.

209
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,009
Not even my mother's family.

210
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,900
I'm not one thing or the other.
I am nothing.

211
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,779
I know what that's like.

212
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,559
Yes. Yes, I am.

213
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,890
I am something.

214
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:29,660
I'm a thief.

215
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,900
I've never stolen anything before
in my life. I swear it.

216
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,200
- The things they called me.
- Fear makes people do stupid things.

217
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,930
It was stupid. And I'm sorry.

218
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,730
I didn't mean you.

219
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:48,190
I meant your employers.
They were afraid so they fired you.

220
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,339
What am I going to do?
I am trapped.

221
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,890
- You're not trapped.
- I am!

222
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,519
If I leave now, it'll look suspicious,
but if the cops find this--

223
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,559
They're not gonna find it.

224
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,130
Because I'm gonna help you.

225
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,710
So where do we put her?

226
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,880
When did she die?

227
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,900
Doesn't say. Just that she was
tracked by the FBI for robbery.

228
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,690
She checked into the Hyperion in '52
and was never heard from again.

229
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,660
- '52?
- '52.

230
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,690
It'll be okay down here.

231
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,970
For a few days,
until the cops are gone.

232
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,480
Judy, there are no cops.

233
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, not yet.

234
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,059
God, I can't go to prison.
I just can't.

235
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,670
The thought of being confined,
trapped. It'd be like death.

236
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,890
No, it'd be something
worse than death.

237
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,309
It'd be like being buried alive.

238
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,099
Go back to your room. Stay there.

239
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:22,410
There's something in this hotel.

240
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,779
And it makes people crazy.

241
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,630
If somehow the money ended up
on the bank's doorstep...

242
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,289
If they saw that I didn't spend it...

243
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,359
...you think they'd call off that P.I.?

244
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,430
- Maybe I could go free.
- Maybe.

245
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,650
There is such a thing
as forgiveness, right?

246
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,390
I can sense it.

247
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,640
There's a pattern here.

248
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,980
A force lived at the hotel
in the last decades...

249
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,160
...affecting staff and residents.

250
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,170
- I just fear there's no way to--
- A Thesulac.

251
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,680
Paranoia demon.

252
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,470
Whispers to its victims,
feeds on their innate insecurities.

253
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,319
- Angel wants to talk to you.
- Hello?

254
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:03,549
Thesulac's been here
since the day it was built.

255
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:09,160
Thought maybe we could track it,
but it's still here.

256
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:15,019
I want you, Gunn and Cordy
here ASAP. We're gonna raise it.

257
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,940
- Raise it?
- We have to in order to kill it.

258
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:23,000
You want me to research
the raising ritual?

259
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,339
Already done it.

260
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,940
A zany redhead? Could be a brunette,
for all I can tell.

261
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,799
I'll have to take their word for it.

262
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,920
You Denver?

263
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,670
That's me. What can I do you for?

264
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,240
I need information on demons.

265
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,369
Do you now?

266
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,759
Possessing entities...

267
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,930
...demonic suggestions, exorcisms,
cleansing rituals....

268
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:55,690
Try this one.

269
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,029
That's right.
Run, coward of the night!

270
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm seriously thinking of putting
my bed right in here.

271
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,740
So you can't come in here.
Do you know who I am?

272
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:15,869
You've got a reputation.
Now I will draw blood...

273
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,720
...if you pull any more crap.
Understand?

274
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,970
I want the books in the back.

275
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,039
- What took you so long?
- He wouldn't fit.

276
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,420
What?

277
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,529
- What'd you do with him?
- He's in there.

278
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,049
I had to make him fit.

279
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:40,269
- Any chance I'd get in trouble for that?
- Don't be paranoid.

280
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,160
- You had reasons to kill him!
- What?

281
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,470
I didn't know him.

282
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,960
But if he saw you
with one of your trysts...

283
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:52,859
...he could expose your little
peccadilloes to the press.

284
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,430
You hack! Just because the studio
won't take your calls, comrade!

285
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,779
- Pansy!
- Red!

286
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,089
- There's a murderer here.
- And we're gonna find him.

287
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,180
They know, they'll turn you in,
You'll go to prison,

288
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:21,940
How long do you think someone
like you will last in prison?

289
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:35,960
So you were my age
when you were made?

290
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:40,259
- I don't know. How old are you?
- Just north of 30.

291
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,599
No.

292
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,440
How do I kill Thesulac?

293
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,220
- You don't. You run away.
- There's got to be a way.

294
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:52,170
Well....

295
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,339
You gotta make it fat, corporeal.

296
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,230
But that only happens after it eats.

297
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,650
Or if you raise it. But that's tricky.

298
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,569
How?

299
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,759
The incantation's in the book,
but you need an Orb.

300
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,150
- I'll sell you one cheap--
- For free.

301
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,299
For free.

302
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,660
Now, you also need sacred herbs...

303
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,359
...divining powder,
and something to hit it with.

304
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,690
- That'll kill it?
- Maybe.

305
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,109
It wouldn't hurt
to have a lightning strike.

306
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:36,589
Short of that, I'd go with
something big and heavy.

307
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,000
Pack it up.

308
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,650
A vampire helping humans?

309
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,630
- I just don't get it.
- To be honest, I don't either.

310
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,190
Right! You once asked me
where you could get a gun.

311
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,880
- For protection.
- From a salesman about to bust you.

312
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,769
- He shot himself.
- Did he? Were you there?

313
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,690
Consuela found him!

314
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,650
She could have shot him.

315
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,359
Hey!

316
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,660
Name's C. Mulvihill, P.I.

317
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,059
He looks suspicious.

318
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,990
I'm looking for this woman.

319
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:48,730
Let's do this.

320
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,299
We call thee forth,
Thesulac of the netherworld...

321
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,619
...and command you to join us
on the physical plane.

322
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,299
- The Orb of Ramjarin.
- How about a "please"?

323
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:12,079
Please. And be careful.
Conjuring orbs are very fragile.

324
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,910
- Angel!
- Don't listen to it. Just ignore it.

325
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,720
- They were like this in the car.
- Oh.

326
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:26,480
We invoke thee by the power
of all the priests of Ramjarin.

327
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,349
What was once in our thoughts...

328
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,359
...be now in our midst.

329
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,960
Why are you hiding out up here?

330
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,589
- You're hurting me! Stop!
- Then start talking.

331
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,119
- You registered under a fake name.
- We have proof!

332
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:54,789
What else has the slut lied about?

333
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,259
I'm sorry. It wasn't me!

334
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,170
Sorry for what?

335
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:02,059
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

336
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,490
It was him! Look in his room.
He's got blood! He's a monster!

337
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,109
What kind of maniac are you?

338
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,920
Grab him! Get him!

339
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,250
We got you now!

340
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,309
String him up!

341
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,849
Push him! Push him!

342
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,849
Come on, push him out!

343
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:21,319
Swing, you freak!

344
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,630
Yeah, you had that coming.

345
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,670
Lord, what did we do?

346
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,130
What?

347
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,849
What's wrong?

348
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,930
I don't get it.

349
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,819
Where's everybody going?
It's just a....

350
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,090
I don't know about you...

351
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,030
...but I'm stuffed!

352
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,239
God, I love people.

353
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,159
Don't you?

354
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,199
They feed me the worst.
And I serve it right back.

355
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,610
And the fear and prejudice
turns to certainty and hate...

356
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,199
...and I take another bite
and mmm, mmm, mmm!

357
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,030
What a beautiful, beautiful dance!

358
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,829
You got your feelings hurt,
didn't you?

359
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:59,079
Stick your neck out...

360
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:02,710
...and they throw a rope around it.

361
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:05,500
And you thought you made a friend.

362
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,949
News flash, you had!

363
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:11,210
That's what made her
the yummiest morsel of all.

364
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,019
You reached her.
Restored her faith in people.

365
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:19,260
Without you, she would've been
just another appetizer.

366
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,409
But you plumped her up good.

367
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:27,550
Now she's a meal
that's gonna last me a lifetime!

368
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,590
Hey, you know what?

369
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,750
There's a whole hotel here
full of tortured souls...

370
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,579
...who could really use your help.

371
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,920
What do you say?

372
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,179
Take them all.

373
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,219
- Watch his tentacles.
- Pardon?

374
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,019
Tentacles.

375
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,170
I didn't order takeout...

376
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,130
...but this looks good.

377
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,570
Not as good as the last one...

378
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,199
...but full of tasty paranoia
just the same.

379
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,940
Especially that one.

380
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,130
What did he mean by that?

381
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,570
You've had your last meal.

382
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,630
- You should've gotten out then.
- Gotten out?

383
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,179
Now why would I want to do that...

384
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,980
...when the room service is so good?

385
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:39,530
Has been for 50 years.

386
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,349
The paranoia here is like fine wine.

387
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,670
It gets better with age.

388
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,429
You're still feeding. Gunn!

389
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,030
Kitchen's closed.

390
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,429
What did it mean,
"especially that one"?

391
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,500
Judy?

392
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,730
I don't hear them anymore.

393
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,369
Are they gone?

394
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,130
Yeah.

395
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,320
- It's you.
- Yeah, Judy...

396
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,690
...it's me.

397
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,039
You look the same.

398
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,510
I'm not.

399
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,329
They killed you...

400
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:13,059
...because of me. I killed you.

401
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,800
No.

402
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,960
He kept them from the door.

403
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,309
He told me I'd be safe.

404
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,670
Am I safe?

405
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,389
You're safe.

406
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:41,039
- Can I go out now?
- Yeah. You can go out.

407
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,639
Let me help you.

408
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,739
I just....

409
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,190
I need to take a little rest first.

410
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,300
Just a little rest.

411
00:39:57,969 --> 00:39:59,409
Easy.

412
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm so sorry I killed you.

413
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,889
Can you forgive me?

414
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,050
Of course.

415
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,119
I'm just going to rest.

416
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,909
Just for a minute.

417
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,750
And then I'm going to go out.

418
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,699
I've been called many things before.

419
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,260
But paranoid has never
been one of them.

420
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:52,690
Unless people have said
it behind my back.

421
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,820
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

422
00:40:57,969 --> 00:40:59,900
We finished?

423
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:02,159
I think so.

424
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,579
Good. I will be glad
to see the last of this place.

425
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:07,530
It scares me.

426
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,239
No lie. And it stinks.
You notice that?

427
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,260
70 years of violence
and mayhem? Bad vibes.

428
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,940
- We're moving in.
- What's not to love?

429
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,710
Angel?

430
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:20,690
Surely you realize...

431
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:25,190
...that this place has housed
not only a demonic presence...

432
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,519
...but the worst faces of humanity.
This is a house of evil.

433
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,800
Not anymore.

434
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:47,320
Angel, you don't find me
especially paranoid, do you?

435
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,340
- Not especially.
- Oh, thank God.

436
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:55,420
I was worried.
