504

Oh, think, bubblehead.

505
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,733
How do I...?

506
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,648
Huh?

MAN:
Got a winner.

509
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:50,285
Take them out in the desert
and shoot them.

510
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:53,650
Bring the demon.
I'd like him to watch.

511
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:57,049
SPENCER: Mr. DeMarco.
- Not now, Spencer.

512
00:34:57,213 --> 00:35:01,252
Sir, we have a winner.

513
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,092
That's impossible.

514
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:12,767
SPENCER:
He's won a little over $300,000.

515
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,292
And a car.

516
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:17,808
Pretty good haul for somebody
with no destiny, huh?

517
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,206
What are you doing?

Hi.

521
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,853
I want answers.

522
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:40,403
And they better be the right ones,
or you're dead.

523
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:43,167
I know this room.

524
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:49,371
Now, I'll start again.

525
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:52,087
How did you win on that slot machine?

526
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:56,565
I put a quarter in the slot,
and I pulled that little lever.

527
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:02,642
Are you playing games
with me, vampire?

528
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:05,805
I have to play to win.

529
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,083
It was a fluke.

530
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:16,046
A glitch in the machine.

531
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,771
There's nothing there.

532
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:24,042
Pay him his winnings in quarters
and take the others on their desert tour.

What am I paying you for?
Shoot them!

537
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:59,282
No, no, no, no, no!
Maybe I went about this wrong.

538
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:03,088
We can still come to terms, right, kid?
I mean, it wasn't all bad here.

539
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:05,847
I mean, not all the time.
What's it gonna take?

540
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:09,011
A bigger suite? Fewer shows?
You got it. What do you say?

541
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,931
- Duck.
- No!

542
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,606
This room, there's something familiar.

Angel?

544
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:47,846
You're my friend, I know.
I'm not stupid.

545
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:55,926
Oh, now I remember that room.

546
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:59,483
Elvis and Priscilla's
wedding reception, 1967.

547
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,484
Yes!

548
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:04,770
All right. It's not like that I was,
you know, really invited.

549
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:07,242
They just put me near the dais.

550
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,324
I think somebody thought
I was in the band.

551
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:12,565
Probably because
I was all drunk and surly.

552
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:16,883
They had these little fried
peanut butter and banana sandwiches.

for at least six months.

Hey, you okay?

00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,205
ANGEL: Doesn't make sense,
winning on that slot machine.

557
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:35,489
Maybe DeMarco was right,
glitch in the machine.

558
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:37,644
Or maybe lady luck
was smiling down on you.

able to fight when I had no reason to.

570
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:14,087
...maybe I can help with
one or two hard-to-reach spots.
