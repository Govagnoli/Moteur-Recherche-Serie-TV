Why was it trying to kill everyone?

649
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:07,727
I don't think it was.

650
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:09,729
It may have just been processing
the conflicts...

651
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:12,493
that Lorne normally
deals with in his sleep...

652
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:15,502
acting out on the emotional responses
he has to the people around him.

653
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:19,938
I guess Lorne makes
some judgments after all. Eve--

654
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:24,603
So, I guess we should--
I don't know-- talk?

655
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,114
About what?

656
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:27,138
About what?

657
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:31,447
About what happened,
you know, back there, with us.

658
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:35,011
Angel, it's not like this is
the first time I've had sex...

659
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,057
under a mystical influence.

660
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,059
I went to U.C. Santa Cruz.

662
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,699
How you doin'?

663
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,772
I don't know.

I'm a slob.
[ Laughs ]

666
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,787
Hey, I spoke with Sebassis's people,
explained what I could.

667
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:18,559
Yeah, so what've we got?
Lawsuit? Demon war?

668
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:22,603
No. Seems like they enjoy a little
blood sport at their social functions.

669
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:26,435
- Looks like we're okay.
- We're not okay.

670
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,839
We've been so focused
on the dangers outside...

671
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,742
that we didn't see the ones within.

672
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:35,248
This place is tryin'
to change us, Gunn.

673
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,250
We can't ever forget that.

674
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,686
Pretty damn good party though.
I'll see you tomorrow.

675
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,589
Well, you know, today, but later.

676
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:48,128
<i>- Oh, and your chair--</i>
- What?

677
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,222
Don't sit in it.
I already called Janitorial.

678
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,631
Why can't I--

679
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:57,262
You pissed in the big man's chair?
That's fantastic.

680
00:41:57,372 --> 00:41:59,306
Spike, can you please turn off
that warm fuzzy?

681
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:02,103
What, the Lorne thing? Wore off.
I just think that's bloody fabulous.

682
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,576
All right, guys. Good night.

683
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:07,204
Let Lorne get some sleep, all right?

684
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:09,442
Out.

685
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:12,019
All right.Just this once.

Hey, it's okay, Lorne.

689
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:25,328
-Just try to get some rest. Get some sleep.
- Mmm.

690
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:29,597
Yeah. 'Cause it's-- it's hard to--

691
00:42:29,704 --> 00:42:32,172
It's hard bein'--
bein' the host of the party.

692
00:42:32,274 --> 00:42:34,242
Bein'--

693
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,310
Stop tryin' to be.

694
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,296
Grr! Arrgh!
