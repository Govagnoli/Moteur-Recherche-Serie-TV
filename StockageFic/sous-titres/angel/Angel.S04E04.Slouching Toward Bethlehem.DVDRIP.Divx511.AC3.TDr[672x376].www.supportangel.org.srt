There's a something, but this isn't it.

a fatal habit of snacking on humans.

Back to the something.

Is that why you ran out while
Cordelia sang?

Well, A, I wasn't running, I was fleeing,
and B, yes.

521
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,764
Is he alive?

522
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:01,282
What happened? Who did this?

523
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:03,967
- Wo...
- Wesley? Not again?

524
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:07,726
- Wolfram and Hart.
- Okay, but why?

525
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,965
- I thought Cordy was their target.
- They must know Lorne read her.

526
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,641
Wait. Are you saying that Connor's
place was a decoy?

527
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,606
We fell for it like rookies.
They weren't after Cordy.

528
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,809
They were after what Lorne
saw when she sang.

529
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:23,012
- They sucked it out of his head?
- How much? What did they get?

530
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:27,529
They had a demon. I wouldn't talk.

531
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:31,291
And the thing burrowed inside...

532
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,286
...and took Cordy out.
ANGEL: Lorne?

533
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:37,846
How much did they get?

534
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:41,972
All of it.

535
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:45,522
They tricked us.

536
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,046
Wolfram and Hart or Wesley?

537
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:50,649
He showed up with the tip about Junior.
How do we know he's not playing us?

538
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:51,802
We don't.

539
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,409
But Wolfram and Hart may know more
about Cordy's doom-and-gloom thing...

540
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,006
...than we do.

541
00:39:57,973 --> 00:39:59,645
And that's a problem.

543
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,929
- Oh, a drop-by. That's a surprise.
- Is it?

544
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:16,282
Well, that it took you so long, yeah.

545
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,930
You played me.

546
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:21,208
LILAH:
You played yourself.

547
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:24,649
On the phone. You wanted me
to hear that so I would tell Angel.

548
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:26,848
Free will.

549
00:40:27,013 --> 00:40:28,128
- Look it up.
- Lilah...

550
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,244
I was just doing my job.

551
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:33,211
You're the one who decided
to take what you overheard...

552
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:35,170
...and give it to the good and plentys.

553
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,807
So before you go all righteous fury...

554
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:40,368
...figure out who you're
really mad at here.

555
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:56,652
- What was the real plan?
LILAH: Let's just say...

556
00:40:56,813 --> 00:41:01,125
...I could have Lorne's brain in a jar but I
left it in his head since he's your friend.

557
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:06,246
What's that supposed to do?
Lull me into trusting you again?

558
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:10,287
If I thought you'd ever trust me,
I would've never played you like that.

559
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,728
It's never simple, is it?
