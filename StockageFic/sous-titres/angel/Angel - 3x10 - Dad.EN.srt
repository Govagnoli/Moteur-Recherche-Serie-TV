1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,470
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,000
His family, his children....

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,630
It will be 200 years before you
can confront Angelus or Darla.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,730
I'm tired of waiting!

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,050
I want your word
you will show no mercy.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,920
- Who's the pirate with a sword?
- He's not in the system.

7
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,140
- This is impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,030
This might be
that bad thing we expected.

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,030
We need to dissect it
and find out what it means.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,250
- It's human.
- I'm gonna have a son.

11
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,719
The prophet says
there will be no birth.

12
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,750
She wants to have it here?
She can't have a baby here.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,429
This child, it's the one good thing
we ever did together.

14
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,429
You make sure to tell him that.

15
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,130
Now's your chance. Do it.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,920
Finish it while you still can.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,200
You can't just let him walk away!

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,849
I swore that I would show no mercy.
And I won't.

19
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,750
We'll need to make
some changes for safety.

20
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:18,140
Covers for the outlets, kidproof
the locks on the weapons cabinet--

21
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,500
Right after we gut and remodel
the entire hotel.

22
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,379
Be careful.

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,900
Whatever was in those cages
could still be loose.

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,329
There's blood over here.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,980
Some bastard's blown
a hole in the lift.

26
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,019
Sorry, my bastard.

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,689
Oh. Well, not like we ever use it.

28
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,650
- Is that a welcome for a houseguest?
- Houseguest?

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,420
I figured since you all
destroyed my club twice...

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,950
...I wouldn't be imposing,
asking for a place to stay.

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,030
Maybe I should reconsider a marginally
attractive Mulix demon's offer.

32
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,740
If he, she or it has
suitable accommodations--

33
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,430
Come on, hand over the little nipper.
Let Uncle Lorne take a gander.

34
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm sure everyone else
has already had their turn.

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,370
Wow, I'm sensing a serious
mama-bear vibe.

36
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,129
- We're all still waiting our turn.
- I get it, "Looky, don't touchy."

37
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,849
- He's got a little scratchy.
- During the rush to leave the alley.

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,860
Let me put some ointment on that.

39
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,580
- Here.
- I got it, I got it.

40
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,689
Easy. Right there.

41
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,250
All right, let your arms out.

42
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,449
Okay. Sh.

43
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,069
- What did I do?
- You don't have a woman's touch.

44
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,639
Whatever your taste in clothing
may indicate.

45
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,800
- I don't wanna know.
- Could you throw it?

46
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,169
- I guess. Why?
- There!

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,509
Bogey at the back door!

48
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,439
This isn't over, is it?

49
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,849
No. Angel's son is part
of the prophecy.

50
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,719
Everyone and everything
will come for him.

51
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,500
Which means we need a plan.

52
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,169
Think I figured it out.

53
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,599
He wet himself.

54
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,199
We could use your help.
When you finish--

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,319
--changing the baby on my desk.

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,899
Sorry, I needed the space.

57
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,839
You nearly had sex
on my desk...

58
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,430
...so I shouldn't be surprised
there's a baby on it.

59
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,139
That was some guy
who switched bodies with me...

60
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,060
...and can we keep the S-E-X talk
away from the baby?

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,430
Do you need help?

62
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,779
No, Wes, I know how
to change a diaper.

63
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,829
A normal one, with pins.
It's these newfangled fasteners....

64
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,649
Did you know these nappies are lined
with material designed for astronauts?

65
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,529
That's interesting.

66
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,480
Now I'm picturing men wearing
nappies, and I'm disturbed.

67
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,589
Okay, little guy,
you're ready, aren't you?

68
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,680
Great.
How's the list coming along?

69
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:38,649
We divided it into two categories.

70
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,649
One, those who we know pose
a threat to the baby.

71
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,019
Holtz, Wolfram and Hart,
the vampire cult that attacked us.

72
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,660
Two, those who could pose a threat
once they know of the baby.

73
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,500
"Order of Phillius,
Beltar the Cremator. Frank"?

74
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,079
Local mobster,
specializes in kidnapping.

75
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,629
What? You can't be wet,
I just changed you.

76
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,689
Are you hungry?
I got a bottle all ready for you.

77
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,360
Where did I put his bottle?
I had his bottle ready for him.

78
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,639
Okay. Here's your ba-ba.

79
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,089
Take your ba-ba.

80
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,889
You take it like this:
You drink and you're happy.

81
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,199
Let me take him for a little while.
I helped raise my cousin.

82
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,430
I can handle it.

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,100
We have to erase
everyone on the list.

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,720
- I can do that.
- Fred?

85
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,279
What?

86
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,990
You meant erase in a squish-and-kill,
violent kind of way.

87
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,420
I'll just put that back.

88
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,860
Come on, it's a nice ba-ba.

89
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,670
You wanna stop crying and take
your ba-ba, yes you do. Please?

90
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,680
That was thrilling.
Not like I waited for you...

91
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,449
...to take vengeance on Angel,
just to have you let him go.

92
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,779
Why didn't you tell me
Darla was pregnant?

93
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,980
- You're supposed to kill them.
- She sacrificed herself.

94
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,329
Darla did your job for you.
At least one is dust.

95
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,899
Angel's demise will be
a great deal more painful.

96
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:15,040
You use words like "death,"
"no mercy," but I haven't seen bupkes.

97
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,720
Listen to me.
We've got prophecies to fulfill.

98
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,620
We don't need some deep,
dark plan for Angel.

99
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,860
You put a stake in him,
you watch him go poof.

100
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,009
Step one is getting rid
of these minions.

101
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,019
No, step one is poof,
and then there are no more steps.

102
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,939
We can't get rid of the grapplers.
I signed a two-week contract.

103
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,209
You don't wanna piss them off.

104
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,519
They're soulless beasts,
bred to maim and kill.

105
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,399
Maim and kill.
Two more words I like.

106
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,019
You'll need them,
unless your painful plan is...

107
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,459
...to kill Angel with candy clowns
and marshmallow pies.

108
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,759
What's happening?

109
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,339
- I need more than fighters.
- They're choking! Know the Heimlich?

110
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,439
I can't do it in this dimension,
my arms will go through them.

111
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,600
What did you do?

112
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,959
- I poisoned their drink.
- Why?

113
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,870
I don't need mercenaries
who kill for anyone willing to pay.

114
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,089
I need warriors who will die
for my cause.

115
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,829
Like that.

116
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:30,149
Great. So step one is, I'm stuck
with four costly and dead demons.

117
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,389
What's step two?

118
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:35,629
We can find information
using this box.

119
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,389
- Correct?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,289
You won't believe how fast
my connection is.

121
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,460
- What do you want to find?
- Obituaries.

122
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,090
What about the ninja guy?

123
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,029
- The vampire cult killed him.
- There could be more.

124
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,909
The world is a sick place.

125
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,679
There are already three websites
offering money for the baby.

126
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,000
- Fred, help her trace the websites.
- Right.

127
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,440
It's good. Try it, you'll like it.

128
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,019
So good.

129
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,250
See?

130
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,399
Teddy likes it, and I like it too.

131
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,419
See?

132
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,830
What was that?

133
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,440
Listening to those furies
gives me whiplash.

134
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,159
Thank God they left.
My head was about to pop off.

135
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,320
- Granted, not a big deal.
- That was their spell kicking in?

136
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,690
They put a force field over the hotel.
Nothing can get in or out.

137
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,590
So the baby's safe?
We're all safe, right?

138
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,720
Unless one of those killers
throws a firebomb in at us...

139
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,620
...like they did at your club, which
had a similar safety spell around it.

140
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,860
- Sorry.
- She's right. He won't be safe here.

141
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,950
We can get out. I installed
an emergency exit in the sewers.

142
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,129
A mystical barrier opens
with a password.

143
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,190
- Pylean word for "hedgehog."
- Oh. Oh!

144
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,840
It means something
different in English?

145
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:19,009
We'll have to use it.
The baby needs to see a doctor.

146
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,840
What? He's not sick.

147
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:25,470
- Does he look sick?
- No, but he needs his newborn checkup.

148
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,159
The baby book says that he's supposed
to have a vitamin K shot...

149
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,500
...and a PKU test after he's born.
Are you gonna circumcise?

150
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,559
I think he heard you.

151
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,190
Are there fluorescent lights in here?
I keep hearing this hum.

152
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,909
Plus, fluorescents, green light,
green skin, it's all bad.

153
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,529
I'll take the blank stares
as a big, fat no.

154
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,980
- Gunn?
- Yeah?

155
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,309
I'm in a war,
I'll need serious firepower.

156
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,500
- Beyond swords and spears?
- Way beyond.

157
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,580
- Leave it to me.
- Thanks.

158
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,539
- We getting to the websites?
- Not yet.

159
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,740
Normally, we'd hack into the e-mail
and trace the relays.

160
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,710
- But they're using remailers.
- Which means?

161
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,850
There's no direct I.D.
It'll take time.

162
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,039
We don't have it.
Are those all the names?

163
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,159
Working on other leads.
We're all doing the best we can.

164
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,940
- Do better.
- Angel.

165
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,570
I promised his mother.

166
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,730
No one is gonna put their hands
on this child.

167
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,700
No one.

168
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,600
"No one is going to put
their hands on this child."

169
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,759
Is this meant to be ironic?

170
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,909
According to our highly, and I'm now
thinking overpaid, translators...

171
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,340
...the Nyazian scroll said the child
would never be born, yet here he is.

172
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,840
A technicality.
Darla died during childbirth.

173
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,960
Dusted during childbirth.

174
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,500
Our sources say she staked herself...

175
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,240
...leaving the baby alive
but never actually born.

176
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,539
Macduff was from his mother's womb.
Untimely ripped.

177
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,610
Clever loophole.

178
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,259
We could use those scroll writers
in Contracts and Negotiations.

179
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,480
We have to get that baby.

180
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,019
He has a knack
for stating the obvious.

181
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,299
I have a tactical team working
on intercept scenarios.

182
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,409
Lilah would have thought of that,
given time.

183
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,440
Moving on, children.

184
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,409
I want everything there is
on this character.

185
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,899
He slaughtered some
of our best-trained men.

186
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:35,009
- He's gonna be a problem.
- We're locating him.

187
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,179
Preferably before he locates us.

188
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,100
Now, that's a cute little baby.
Yes, you are.

189
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,419
And your daddy is a vampire
with a soul.

190
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,330
And sometimes he reverts
to a creature of pure evil...

191
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,019
...who could rip your tiny throat out.

192
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes, he does.

193
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,720
I like kids. The senior partners took
mine before I really got to know them.

194
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,669
Turn it up.

195
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,940
Turn it down.

196
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,049
Teddy isn't crying.

197
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,809
Do you see Teddy crying?

198
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:18,159
Teddy isn't crying. Do you see
Teddy crying? No, he's not crying.

199
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,409
Come on, kid, you gotta
give me something here.

200
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,340
All right, last-ditch effort.

201
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,509
Here, let me give it a try, huh?

202
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,419
He doesn't like Smokey Robinson
and the Miracles?

203
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,460
- You said he had a soul.
- You know what?

204
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,700
You're fed. You're changed.
I hold you, you cry.

205
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,299
I put you down, you cry.
What do you want me to do?

206
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm a terrible father.
I can't even get him to stop crying.

207
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,090
It's getting a little tense.
Your vibe, that is.

208
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:50,889
My vibe? What vibe?

209
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,629
The anxious one that's been
coming off you since he was born.

210
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,250
He's connected to you.

211
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,860
If you're wound tight,
how do you think he feels?

212
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,340
He's not a day old, and he's got an
enemies list. Wouldn't you be edgy?

213
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,809
Yeah. I'd also be in awe.

214
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,750
Look at him.

215
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,139
He's more than a mission, bro.

216
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,009
Look at him.

217
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,659
Look at him.

218
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,929
Okay, it's all right.

219
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,740
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

220
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,240
It's gonna be all right.

221
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,090
Hey. Sh.

222
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,809
Do you like that?

223
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,440
No, obviously.
Okay, how about this one?

224
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,610
Okay.

225
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,539
I only got one more.

226
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:33,620
That's my little guy.

227
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,879
You like that, don't you?

228
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,809
Lilah Morgan, clearance 0112773.

229
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,549
There we are.
What can I do for you?

230
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,450
I want everything the firm
has on Angel.

231
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,039
His life history, unlife history,
intercept records...

232
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:03,629
...victim lists, everything.

233
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,750
I'm looking for someone he crossed
paths with 100 years ago or more.

234
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,759
And make it fast. The boys upstairs
are at Defcon, like, 1000.

235
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,190
Sure thing, Miss Morgan.
Just a sec.

236
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,910
Everything's in there?

237
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,400
Down to the baby that wasn't
supposed to be born.

238
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,910
How do you know about that?

239
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,470
I'm Files and Records, it's my job.

240
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,609
Great. I'll be back when I--

241
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,890
Miss Morgan? There aren't
any documents in there.

242
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,180
That's just a reference key
to the full file.

243
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,849
The reference key.

244
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,240
So where is the full file?

245
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:54,089
The key helps locate which section
of the file you'd like to look at.

246
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,130
That whole thing is Angel's file?

247
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,779
Just the first 35 cabinets.

248
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:01,759
Right.

249
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,809
Does China Palace deliver here?

250
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,279
You'd punch quicker
without so much to drink.

251
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,920
It's a tradeoff. Because without that
much to drink, it hurts a lot more.

252
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,400
- You stick to the shadows.
- I'm not much of a day person.

253
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,140
- I'm not here to fight.
- Your bad luck.

254
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,900
I know you're in pain.
I know what it's like to grieve.

255
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,410
Nice goatee. Kind of rounds out
the whole creepy stalker look.

256
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,450
I'll be moving on now.

257
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,779
Justine.

258
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm not finished.

259
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,779
- How do you know my name?
- I know everything.

260
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,779
You live at 7221 Spaulding.
You stay out all night, sleep all day.

261
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,730
Ever since your sister
was murdered six months ago.

262
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,680
Your twin.

263
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,259
It wasn't a mugging
like the papers said, was it?

264
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,559
Major blood loss.

265
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,450
Two unidentifiable neck wounds.

266
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,009
So?

267
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,740
My name's Holtz.
I want to help you.

268
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,710
I'll tell you what I want.

269
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:31,109
I want you to stay the hell
away from me.

270
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,160
Thanks.

271
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,480
We still haven't traced the websites.

272
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,400
Relax.

273
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,650
Get any sleep?

274
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,369
No, I was up all night watching him.

275
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,170
If you let us take shifts, we--

276
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,259
No, I wasn't watching him
like that, I was....

277
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,660
I was just...

278
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,599
...watching him.

279
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:19,230
He looks a bit like me,
don't you think?

280
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,460
Oh, yeah. Look at that brow.
He's a miniature you.

281
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,849
Hand him over
and catch some shuteye.

282
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,269
I'll sleep when I know he's safe.

283
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,799
Which will be when?
Around never?

284
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,549
Angel, I understand
you want to protect him.

285
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,470
But you gotta let go a little,
share the responsibility.

286
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,140
- You can't be everything for him.
- I'm his only family.

287
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,180
My job now is to be
everything for him.

288
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,599
Really? Okay.

289
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:55,829
Follow me.

290
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,130
Come on.

291
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,170
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

292
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,170
Cordelia, wait.

293
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,250
We're going outside.

294
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,759
Where your son's gonna
want to go play.

295
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:18,720
Where you'll have to rush him
to the hospital, but I see your point.

296
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:24,369
You can't go outside in the day like
other parents, because you're a vampire.

297
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,000
And even if you weren't,
you can't do everything for him.

298
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,740
If he has to get
to the hospital at noon...

299
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:40,049
...on the sunniest day of the year,
he'll get there.

300
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,519
Even if I don't.

301
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,869
Angel.

302
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,859
Stop. Angel!

303
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,819
Good morning, all.

304
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,220
Is that bacon I smell, or did somebody
fall asleep with the curtains up?

305
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,819
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like this...

306
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,519
...the only truly safe room
would be the janitor's closet.

307
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,250
Thanks for the tip.

308
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:07,720
Could you sleep,
or did you hear humming?

309
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,900
I put some earplugs in
and slept like a baby.

310
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,970
Cried and wet the bed all night.

311
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,390
- Tough room.
- Mission accomplished.

312
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,130
You said you wanted firepower so:

313
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,509
- Good work.
- We got company out front.

314
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,579
- They see you?
- No. I doubled back through the sewer.

315
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:31,819
- Who are they?
- Two cars of the vampire cult...

316
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,319
- ...and a biker gang I recognize.
- Humans?

317
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:36,980
Into extortion and kidnapping.

318
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:40,720
There's some fellows in a van
wearing hooded cloaks.

319
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,420
Lilliad demons.

320
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:47,420
They make a magical broth from the
bones of human children. Two L's.

321
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:52,710
They probably want to find out how
a vampire's child affects the recipe.

322
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,200
They use strong magic. They may
be able to break the furies' spell.

323
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,400
- What are they waiting for?
- Their power links to the lunar cycle.

324
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,619
We're safe now,
but when the moon rises...?

325
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,099
Tonight's a full moon.

326
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:10,569
We won't be able to fight off the
world once that force field is down.

327
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't see that we have a choice.

328
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:17,779
This is impossible.

329
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,490
Two hundred and seventy-five years
of the most inane....

330
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,200
What kind of wussy name
is Liam, anyway?

331
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,559
Okay, you're at the hotel.

332
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,259
The pirate's about to kill Angel,
Angel calls him....

333
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,799
What? What was it?

334
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,440
Hose.

335
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,339
- Hope.
- Holtz?

336
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:46,720
What?

337
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,509
Holtz, Daniel, vampire killer,
circa 1754.

338
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,980
Hunted Angel and Darla until
his mysterious disappearance in 1773.

339
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:58,680
Larson McMillan, Vampiricus
Conquestus, page 412.

340
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,839
- How did you--?
- I'm Files and Records, it's my job.

341
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,390
You mean, I've been sitting here
for the last 14 hours...

342
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,920
...to find that you know
everything in this case file.

343
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,369
No, Miss Morgan.
I know everything in every case file.

344
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,170
- I'm Files and Records, it's my--
- Your job. Unbelievable.

345
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,559
What's the skinny on Holtz?
Why the hate for Angel?

346
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,650
Just a moment.

347
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,019
1764, Angel and Darla kill
Holtz, Caroline; Holtz, Sarah...

348
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:32,740
...and Holtz, Daniel, infant son.

349
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,950
Massacred his family, that'd do it.

350
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,519
Holtz vows to avenge their blood,
May 1764.

351
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:42,519
Pursues Angel and Darla
for nine years...

352
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,869
...incidentally killing 378 vampires
in the meantime.

353
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,589
We're dealing with a single-minded
vengeance machine with bloodlust.

354
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,950
That's just awesome.

355
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,579
- What in the hell are you doing here?
- Watching you fight.

356
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,809
- Why'd you wait?
- To see if you could win.

357
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,440
I would have kicked his ass
if you hadn't distracted me.

358
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,700
- I wasn't your problem.
- Really?

359
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,900
You fight wild.
Your passion works against you.

360
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,470
- You'll teach me about passion?
- I'll teach you how to fight.

361
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:50,099
- What's in it for you?
- You help me kill a vampire.

362
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,490
- You don't need me for that.
- I do.

363
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,460
This vampire is strong.

364
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,720
Are we talking about some kind of
Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi groove thing?

365
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,029
Wax on, wax off.

366
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,079
You'll find references to modern
culture are lost on me.

367
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,750
What a shocker.

368
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,339
But I know you're interested
in more than the trivial.

369
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:15,480
Your life has been ruined.
You can't sleep.

370
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,420
Instead, you make others pay
for what happened to your sister.

371
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,250
That's where I can help.

372
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,980
I see your talent, and I see your hate.

373
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:32,170
And I know that I can shape and hone
you into an instrument of vengeance.

374
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,029
Sounds like fun.

375
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,130
It won't be.

376
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,599
Guys, the Lilliad demons are starting
their mojo on the force field.

377
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,680
All right, sun's down.
Vamps can come out too.

378
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,950
- They're headed toward the bikers.
- What are they doing?

379
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,299
Having a brawl
over who kills us first.

380
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:34,980
- We must hold our ground.
- If we can't?

381
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,130
Fall back towards the cellar.

382
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,809
We can retreat through the sewer.

383
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,569
- This won't work.
- It's primed and ready.

384
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,089
Not the weapon, the plan.

385
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,029
I'm glad someone said that.

386
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,009
Sitting here waiting to die
never was much of a plan.

387
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,359
Sorry.

388
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,559
So, what genius idea you got
hidden up your sleeve?

389
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,849
- Plan is, I take the baby.
- What?

390
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,279
He was born in a siege,
he won't die in one.

391
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,390
Not if you stay and help fight.
We're in a war.

392
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,319
- I'm in a retreat.
- What about taking them out?

393
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,869
There's too many of them.
I can get out through the sewers.

394
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,539
- You're just gonna run away?
- It's what he's good at.

395
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,309
You don't want to fire us
before you leave us to fight?

396
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,210
We already established this
as a bad idea.

397
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,369
You'll be all right.

398
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,240
Once they realize that the baby's
gone, they'll go after me.

399
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,970
Wesley, stall them if you can.

400
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:34,799
Tripping over our
dead bodies will slow them down.

401
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,640
You really didn't hear anything
I said earlier, did you?

402
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,089
I heard you.

403
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,990
Angel? Don't leave us.

404
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,390
He's running away.

405
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,690
He's sneaking away.

406
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,140
And giving us a chance
to get the jump on everyone.

407
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,349
- Alpha Team, he's in the sewers.
- Copy,

408
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,859
Today, the world is different.

409
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,029
A vampire has sacrificed herself
for her baby.

410
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,160
- Know what that means?
- Something's good about the kid?

411
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:25,049
This child could grow up and hunt
each and every one of us down.

412
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,549
- Let's not let that happen.
- No, sir.

413
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:32,150
- We'll find the baby, dead or alive.
- Are you crazy?

414
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,299
Worried we'll hurt
the itty-bitty baby?

415
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,640
I'm afraid you'll kill him
before we can cut him open...

416
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,480
...while he's alive and find out
how he's alive in the first place.

417
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,759
- Alpha Team, where are you?
- We're here,

418
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,250
What are you doing?

419
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:27,319
Imagining myself as John Wayne
in Rio Bravo. You?

420
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,380
Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13,

421
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,490
If we live through this, trade in
the DVD players and get a life.

422
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:06,960
Got him.

423
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,319
I have a visual. Let's go.

424
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,420
Alpha Team,
we're in pursuit, tracking northbound,

425
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,299
Where's the child?

426
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:29,299
Upstairs, Room 312.
Why don't you go get him?

427
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,049
Wait, I have a better idea.

428
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:51,809
Master, it's a trick.
He's taken the child.

429
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,180
Now they're all after him.

430
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:21,039
- I hope we stalled them long enough.
- Whatever.

431
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,220
Running away was his call.

432
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,089
We'll get through this. Vampire demon
biker posse, that's the easy part.

433
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,800
The part that scares me
are all the questions:

434
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,329
Why is the sky blue?
Why do people get sick?

435
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,650
Why is there always pig's blood
in the fridge?

436
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,380
I don't have all the answers.
Well, I do to that last one.

437
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:31,929
Here we go.

438
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,579
He's braking left.

439
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,530
Could be worse.

440
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,329
At least you're not crying.

441
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,750
Give us the baby.

442
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,480
You want the baby?

443
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,000
You can have the baby!

444
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,880
Grab the baby!

445
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:42,030
- What is it?
- It's a--

446
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,199
Sorry for the wait. Let's go.

447
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,289
Good morning, all.

448
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,699
Is that bacon I smell, or did somebody
fall asleep with the curtains up?

449
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,239
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like this--

450
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,510
Back it up.

451
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,769
--fall asleep with the curtains up?

452
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:30,380
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like--

453
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,360
Stop it right there.

454
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,969
Magnify 100 times.

455
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,039
Again.

456
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,150
There.
That's where he gives Angel the note.

457
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,349
--the only truly safe room
would be the janitor's closet.

458
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,730
Thanks for the tip,

459
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,260
And tells him to read it
where we don't have surveillance.

460
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,769
That green houseguest could hear
your transmit frequency.

461
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,150
That Sturm und Drang about Angel
running out on them, a performance.

462
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,400
Who knew Angel had the acting chops?

463
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,539
Are you kidding?
It was one-note. Forced.

464
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,789
- Funny, you bought it at the time.
- It worked.

465
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,099
For us.

466
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:16,639
Angel's little trick thinned the herd.
Any word about Holtz?

467
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,679
No reports that he was among
Angel's pursuers.

468
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,440
I hoped he would
be among the casualties.

469
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,489
- What do we know about him?
- He's a vampire hunter.

470
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,619
Angel killed his family.
He spent his life seeking revenge.

471
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,639
And one more thing,
this all happened 200 years ago.

472
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,440
- I thought Holtz was human.
- He is.

473
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,699
A time traveler.

474
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:42,769
The Nyazian scrolls
foretold his arrival.

475
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:45,659
- He's a player.
- Yes, he's a cog in the machine.

476
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,269
And aren't we all?

477
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:51,059
What do you think he wants?

478
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,940
Other than to tear out Angel's heart
and wear it as a brooch?

479
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,420
We need information.
How he got here, who he works with.

480
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,230
It's only a matter of time before
our needs and his come into conflict.

481
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,610
Maybe sooner than we think.

482
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,840
My son's got a tiny scratch
on his cheek, and now so do you.

483
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,110
I'm holding you responsible
for anything that happens to him.

484
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,150
A cold, a sunburn, a scratched knee.

485
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:25,570
Whatever happens to him,
happens to you, and then some.

486
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,719
Not only are you not coming
after him...

487
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,349
...you'll make sure he lives
a long, healthy life.

488
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,000
You just became his godfather.
Understand?

489
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,510
- Sir?
- I believe I do.

490
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,590
It's all right.

491
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,070
One more thing, college fund.

492
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,199
Start saving.
I got my heart set on Notre Dame.

493
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,349
I'm happy to report
you have a healthy baby boy.

494
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,769
- Great, but I'm not the mother.
- I apologize.

495
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,079
That's okay.

496
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,730
- I'm happy to report you--
- Me neither.

497
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,340
The mother is no longer
in the picture.

498
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:11,789
I see.

499
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,090
Well, his height and weight
are in the 90th percentile...

500
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,139
...we gave him his vitamin K and
his PKU, and he's doing very well.

501
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,590
We don't seem to have his--
What's his name?

502
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,599
Connor.

503
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,730
- His name is Connor.
- Connor.

504
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:35,250
Thank you, Mr. Angel.

505
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,139
And congratulations.

506
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,820
- Thanks.
- Sure.

507
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,150
Hey. Hey.

508
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,139
- Mr. Angel?
- Your first name's Geraldo.

509
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,170
- We had to tell them something.
- Geraldo Angel.

510
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,719
You're a pet psychiatrist
with a small practice in Pacoima...

511
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,420
...and you fight crime.

512
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,929
We just told them the name part.
The rest is me having fun.

513
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:03,849
I don't know what to say.

514
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,969
How about, "Thanks, I appreciate it,
you guys rock, way to go"?

515
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,340
What she said.

516
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,110
Got the best one a very small amount
of money could buy.

517
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:18,710
Oh....

518
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,230
Connor, you wanna go for a ride?

519
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:27,550
- Oh, goodness.
- Connor. That's a lovely name.

520
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,469
I don't suppose you ever
considered Wes--?

521
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,380
No.

522
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,559
Not to be negative or anything,
but we're okay, right?

523
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,949
Nobody else is coming
after Connor or us?

524
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:43,480
No, we're safe for the time being.

525
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,409
Let's go home.

526
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:49,409
- Nice stroller.
- Thank you.
