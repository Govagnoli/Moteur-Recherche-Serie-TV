1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,080
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything lovelier?

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,230
So graceful. So full of life.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,880
And those eyes....

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,600
Make you feel like
the only man in the room.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,510
Plus, six breasts.
Any man's gotta love that.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,570
Fred doesn't have six breasts. Right?

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,750
Sorialus the Ravager. And, yeah,
she's the one from my vision.

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,829
Coming to destroy the humans
that killed her mate.

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,799
But not for another month or so.
I'll file her under "pending."

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,810
- You gonna ask her out?
- The Ravager?

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,270
Fred.

12
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,299
Yes. But, you know, timing.
I'll make my move when the iron's hot.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,079
Get it done, Johnny Reb, so I can hear
about something besides your hot iron.

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,549
Am I very boring on the subject?

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,049
There was a time when you thought
I was the loveliest thing in the world.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,500
Well, I....
You're an extraordinary woman.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,819
- I....
- At ease, soldier.

18
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,489
Just like to hear it every
now and then.

19
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:19,269
I was the ditsiest bitch in Sunnydale.
Could've had any man I wanted.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,120
Now I'm all superhero-y,
and the best action I can get...

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,439
...is an invisible ghost
who's good with a loofa.

22
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,129
I'm sorry, I missed that last part.

23
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,120
- You are a gentleman.
- Who's doing what with a loofa?

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,510
Not loofa. Loo-fah-nooc....

25
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,500
- It's a demon.
- So you went with dark colors today.

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,659
- Ask me why I'm smiling.
- I will, because it's scaring me.

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,250
We are stepping out.

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,510
You are a remarkable woman.

29
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,579
The way you shovel food into your
mouth.... That is some Olympian feat.

30
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,609
Was I a pig? It's just that breakfast
goes so quick and I'm always so--

31
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,140
I just wonder where it goes
in that stick-figure body you got.

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,669
- Stick? You're a beast.
- Come on. You know you're gorgeous.

33
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,419
Morning, friends and neighbors.
Are those the tickets?

34
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,699
- See, I got to the ticket place--
- Morning, Fred.

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm paying you back. This is on me.

36
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,939
Mahta Hari is the tightest band in L.A.
You guys'll be tripping out.

37
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,659
- The thing is--
- I'm good for it.

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,270
Don't worry about
Connor's college fund.

39
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,849
The time I saw Mahta Hari, they were--
The Blinnikov World Ballet Corps.

40
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,189
I got to the ticket place, and boom!
Tonight only.

41
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,060
You got ballet on my
Mahta Hari tickets?

42
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,360
- The Blinnikov World Ballet Corps.
- He says that like it has meaning.

43
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,680
This is a premier company.
And they're doing Giselle.

44
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,800
This is all like some horrible dream.

45
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,409
I've heard of them.
Very ahead of their time.

46
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:59,009
I saw their production of Giselle in 189O.
I cried like a baby. And I was evil.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,419
- I think it sounds exciting.
- Yes.

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,580
No! This is not Mahta Hari.

49
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,110
This is tutus and guys with their
big-ass packages jumping up and down.

50
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,879
- I will never trust you again.
- Get over it. Do we get dressed up?

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,900
- Of course.
- I'm in.

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,909
Guys, seeing real ballet live,
it's like another world.

53
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,099
These guys are tight.
You'll be tripping out.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,520
Don't be using my own phrases
when we've lost the trust.

55
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,259
Come on. Working day, cases to solve.

56
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,439
I'm not still paying, right?
'Cause this is like a nightmare.

57
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,300
It's such an honor
to have the company here.

58
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:50,789
All of L.A. is buzzing. To have
the Blinnikov performing Giselle....

59
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,500
I can't imagine
what tonight's going to be like.

60
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,349
It will be the performance
of a lifetime.

61
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,900
I guarantee it.

62
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,790
Are you certain
this is the place for us?

63
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,300
We could go to Cavegirl's House
of Burlap, but that's so last season.

64
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,660
The guys are renting tuxes.
We've gotta step up.

65
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,069
But aren't we, you know, poor?

66
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,680
There's a custom amongst my people:

67
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,889
Buy a dress, wear it once
and return it the next day.

68
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:21,750
It's all about hiding
the tags while it's on.

69
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,819
Oh. Okay.

70
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,810
I'm very excited. I love the ballet.

71
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,410
I haven't seen much, but my family
used to go to The Nutcracker...

72
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,069
...and I had my first sexual dream
about the Mouse King.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,860
Face me.

74
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,600
Hm.... Uh-uh.

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,670
- Can I ask you something?
- You guys are perfect for each other.

76
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,120
- I have magic powers, remember?
- It's not like we've said anything.

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,060
But he's so sweet and commanding.
I feel so comfortable around him.

78
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,279
- I don't even know if he feels--
- He feels.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,550
- Feelings?
- There's definite feelings.

80
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,750
We find the right outfit for tonight,
there may be actual feeling.

81
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,949
And we have to find a dress for you,
something that will make Angel crazy.

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
Fred, sweetie, Angel is crazy.

83
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,180
I know he's gonna want
to look his best for you.

84
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,550
That's right. The world's champion is
gonna worry about his outfit.

85
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,800
Is it gonna be all right?
Is there a stain?

86
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,680
Relax, crumb cake.
I got this soda water working overtime.

87
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,170
- Connor burps like a champ.
- At least he's sleeping.

88
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,839
Who wouldn't, with that sweet
Irish lullaby you crooned?

89
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,540
Just a hair flat on the bridge,
but, more to the point, Cordelia?

90
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,129
What about her?

91
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,740
I read you while you
were singing, you big corn-muffin.

92
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,990
And can't say as I blame.
I mean, what a woman she's become.

93
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:02,339
You're not supposed to be reading me.
Anyway, you read me wrong.

94
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,550
Sorry, strudel.
It's not just when you're singing.

95
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,810
We got a term in Pylea: "Kyrumption."

96
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,569
- I know it.
- When two heroes come together--

97
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,180
There'll be no coming together.
All anybody wants to talk about is--

98
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,370
Can't fight kyrumption, cinnamon buns.
It's fate, the stars. Kyrumption is--

99
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,779
Stop saying that.
And stop calling me pastries.

100
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,930
You're a man of many limitations,
Angel, but you're a man.

101
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,529
You got a heart.
And Cordelia's a hell of a lady.

102
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,230
If I thought she liked to wear green,
I'd be elbowing you out of the way.

103
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,170
But she's out of my league.
She's a champion, Angel.

104
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:49,180
Old school. And besides...

105
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,230
...we all know you got a thing
for ex-cheerleaders.

106
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,790
- What have I got to offer her?
- Do I even have to answer that?

107
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,139
You just have to act.
Let her know what's brewing inside...

108
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,600
...because it's real.
You don't want to miss that shot.

109
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,730
- Lorne, Cordelia, she's--
- She's what?

110
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:23,970
I was just saying that
you're not much of a ballet fan.

111
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,399
Disregard everything I said.
I forgot how homely she was.

112
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,000
- You look like....
- Like a ballet fan?

113
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,289
An aficionado? A devotee, in fact?

114
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,470
Tonight I've decided that we don't have
to be our incredibly dreary selves.

115
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,629
Tonight we're a couple
of young sophisticates...

116
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,990
...enjoying an evening
of classical dance.

117
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,509
- How's that sound?
- Sounds just right.

118
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:00,610
- You gotta promise not to laugh.
- I promise.

119
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,519
It's gotta come from the heart.

120
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,429
Will you stop being such a little girl?
I said, I promise.

121
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,799
This is what your promises are worth?
I'm having trust issues.

122
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm sorry, it's just....

123
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,419
My God, you're so pretty.

124
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,549
There's not a lot of people
could say that to me and live...

125
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,620
...but the way you look...

126
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,980
...there's no way I can fight you.

127
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,500
Tonight feels, I don't know,
kind of magical.

128
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:52,070
- Is that stupid?
- Not at all.

129
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,779
- Finally came out of hiding.
- And look at my reward.

130
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,129
- Yes. Isn't she a vision?
- There's a lot of that around.

131
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,700
No, thank you.
There will be no visions tonight.

132
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,480
- How can you be sure?
- I had a vision.

133
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,029
Thank you.

134
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,269
The iron is hot.

135
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,299
Sorry they're not closer.
Getting five seats together--

136
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:50,919
Don't be silly. Best place.
Got the whole panorama from here.

137
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,730
Back here we stand less chance
of setting off the under-70 alarm.

138
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,629
Back in the day I'd always get box seats.
Or just eat the people who had them.

139
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't let's reminisce.
We're here. Enjoy.

140
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,139
- Bravo!
- I loved it.

141
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,679
- Bravo!
- It's just intermission.

142
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,129
- That isn't drool, is it?
- It's okay. It matches the back.

143
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,429
Gloat all you want. These guys
are tight and I am tripping out.

144
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,940
They certainly
live up to their reputation.

145
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:06,379
- Has the choreography changed since--?
- No. Nothing's changed.

146
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,830
- It's wonderful they're able--
- I mean, nothing's changed.

147
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,730
These are the same dancers
I saw before.

148
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:17,500
Impossible. We're watching the
exact same troupe you saw in 1990?

149
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,759
I think he said 1890.

150
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:22,970
That's much more impossible.

151
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,659
Somebody want to tell me how we're
watching a show starring people...

152
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,879
...who should have died
60 years ago?

153
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,909
Well, it's a puzzler.

154
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,820
Are there snacks?

155
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,970
- So, what are we thinking? Vampires?
- They're not a tanned bunch.

156
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,250
That would explain
the precision and athleticism.

157
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,110
Some of those jumps were....

158
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,870
You know,
I was cool before I met y'all.

159
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,779
- Dancing vampires. Who's not scared?
- Not it. I'd know. I'd sense it.

160
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,080
Even all the way back there?

161
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,759
With the panoramic view.

162
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,179
- We should check it out.
- After the show we should go backstage.

163
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:11,320
I was thinking now.
You guys go back. I'll snoop.

164
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,929
I'm with Snoopy. Magic of the ballet,
not really getting to me.

165
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,779
How will the dancers keep time
without your rhythmic snoring?

166
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:25,620
- That's gonna come back to haunt you.
- Go.

167
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:26,720
Hurry.

168
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,789
- Check out the zeppelin.
- Lot of muscle for a ballet company.

169
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,080
Should I distract him
while you slip by?

170
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:45,549
Don't be stupid. I'm him and the most
beautiful woman is making eyes at me?

171
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:49,340
It's either a bachelor party
or a scam.

172
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,909
What did you just call me?

173
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,700
- Sorry. You're not stupid.
- No, after that.

174
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,740
I think I'll go with my patented
sudden burst of violence.

175
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,600
Hey, hold on. I have an approach
that's a little more subtle.

176
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,029
- Say, do you like bribes?
- Do I ever.

177
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,610
We really want to go backstage.

178
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,100
Okay. But this isn't so much
a bribe as it is a tip.

179
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,120
And since I'm not parking your car,
there's really no way--

180
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,649
Okay. That's how we do it.

181
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,379
Okay, you saw the building
when we drove by...

182
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,049
...do you remember it going on forever?

183
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,620
It's clearly a spell
or a time flux or something.

184
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,159
I don't think we want
to be rushing in here.

185
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,720
Let's get the others
and talk options.

186
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,529
Works in theory.

187
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,139
This is her dressing room.

188
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,639
Prima ballerina.

189
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,899
It's unchanged.

190
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,909
She would wait for him here.

191
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,119
It's warm. It's very warm.

192
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,559
I feel it.

193
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,339
Something happened here.

194
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,809
- Angel?
- Yeah?

195
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,759
I want you to undress me.

196
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,170
You what?

197
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,869
It's just another costume.

198
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,789
I want you to see who I really am.

199
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,690
You're the only one who can.

200
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,150
I....

201
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,099
This isn't us.

202
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,210
We're acting this out.
Someone is....

203
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,869
Whoa.

204
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,089
- Did I just ask you to undress me?
- Is that what you want?

205
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,359
Please, I....

206
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,730
- You want me to make love to you?
- You know I do.

207
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,990
- But you're afraid.
- What if he finds us?

208
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,039
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid of anything.

209
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:29,029
I'm only alive when you're inside me.

210
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,400
- Cordelia.
- Yes.

211
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:05,990
I'm sorry.

212
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,460
- No. We so need to be out of here.
- Yes.

213
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,500
- This isn't out of here.
- I know. All right.

214
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,599
- Open the damn door.
- It's kind of hard.

215
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,809
I kind of noticed.

216
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,519
Whoa.

217
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:40,079
- That's a fair assessment.
- What the hell is that place?

218
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,529
Spirits in there. Energy trapped
in time. It took us over.

219
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,029
Scary. Well, it's a good thing
it wears off right away.

220
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,420
Yeah. It's a good thing.

221
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,140
Go to sleep lullaby

222
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,069
You've been fed and you're sleepy

223
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,680
You'll be with Uncle Lorne

224
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,420
Who in no way resents
Not being asked to go to the ballet

225
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,940
And is certainly not thinking

226
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,349
Of selling you to the first
Vampire cult with a decent offer

227
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,809
You just sleep on, little nipper.

228
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,299
Uncle Lorne's gonna
make sure we're alone.

229
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,130
Won't be gone a moment.

230
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,680
Oh, my God.

231
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,990
- You sure this is the way?
- I'm sure it's a way.

232
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,730
Place is a maze. I'm hoping
there's another room we can--

233
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,920
- Damn it.
- What?

234
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:11,349
I said something back in that room.
Something important. Do you remember?

235
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:16,329
- You're only alive when I'm--?
- Not that.

236
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,039
No, of course. I was just--
Oh, hey. I said you were afraid.

237
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,279
- And I said, "What if he finds us?"
- She had a secret lover.

238
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,069
They were afraid of someone.

239
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,829
I'll bet that someone is the reason
why we're stuck here. We left too soon.

240
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,910
We? Who? The room?

241
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,240
It's a clue. Those spirits or energy
or whatever are still in there.

242
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,420
We can figure out what happened.
We have to go back in.

243
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,819
- I'm marveling at the wrongness of that.
- You want to wander around forever?

244
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,019
There are other rooms that....

245
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,140
All we have to do is play the scene.
Get in, get out. No one gets happy.

246
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,529
What if there is no more talking
in that scene?

247
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,059
I've been possessed by the spirits of
old lovers before. It never goes well.

248
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:07,259
I've got my little cross
if things get out of hand.

249
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,279
It's awkward, but it's not us.

250
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,789
So long as nothing is removed
or inserted, it's all forgotten.

251
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,430
It is us, Cordelia.

252
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,140
It's you and me.

253
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,460
Kissing you, it's....

254
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,160
- It's not something I can just--
- Come on. It's not that horrible.

255
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,990
Up to his ass in demon gore, fine.

256
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:39,940
But ask him to mack on a hottie
and he wigs.

257
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,480
My champion, ladies and gentlemen.

258
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,369
- Angel!
- Huh?

259
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,890
- What?
- And Cordy.

260
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:17,609
They've been gone way too long.

261
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:20,500
You're right. Come on.

262
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,720
- We're gonna miss the end.
- Sorry.

263
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,180
Anything coming?

264
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,490
Okay, let's take it from the middle.
I want you to undress me.

265
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,500
- You want to have sex.
- Yes, but I'm scared.

266
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,259
- But you're afraid.
- And afraid. What if he finds us?

267
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,109
- But I'm not afraid of anything.
- Only good inside. Blah-blah-blah.

268
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,339
Maybe it only works the one time,
when the energy--

269
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,849
At least Angel left us a trail.

270
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,630
Deal with them.
I can't be bothered right now.

271
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,980
- This is wrong.
- Hush.

272
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,680
You don't know him. He has power.

273
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,559
The power to do this?

274
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,019
Stefan, his power is unnatural.
He could....

275
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,289
What? Kill us?

276
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,609
Worse.

277
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,279
Kurskov owns the company.
He doesn't own you.

278
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,569
He doesn't know that.
He thinks I'm his.

279
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,700
That I dance for him.

280
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,180
He's nothing but a deluded fan.
He thinks I love him.

281
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,380
Come away with me tonight.
We'll disappear. Even he won't find us.

282
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,200
Stefan, everything
I've worked for is here.

283
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,039
- You can still dance.
- Can I? I don't....

284
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,809
- Not yet. Maybe when we're--
- Don't. Don't make promises.

285
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,369
Help me.

286
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,809
Help me be not afraid.

287
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,410
This is very not right.

288
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:48,380
- Do you hear--?
- There's something.

289
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,789
Someone's in pain.

290
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,759
Either that, or someone's in fun.

291
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,009
Oh, no. Oh, no!

292
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,420
Oh, thank God.

293
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,549
Good. They were probably interrupted
by Kurskov or his lackeys, right?

294
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:33,690
We're done with--
We're done!

295
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,460
Now that sounds less like fun.

296
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,440
Charles!

297
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,279
Fred, stay between us.

298
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,750
Wesley!

299
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,569
Can you handle the other?

300
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:07,059
Well, then, just us.

301
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,759
A little help!

302
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,690
Thank you.

303
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,519
- You all right?
- Yeah. We gotta move.

304
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,289
- You think they're not dead?
- You just looked really hot doing that.

305
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,319
Yeah.

306
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,950
Run.

307
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,349
Who's laughing now?

308
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,839
Well, you. But I still win.

309
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,109
That's good. Should hold.

310
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,410
You okay? You hurt?

311
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,349
I'm fine. I just thought--

312
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,980
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't fall apart like this.

313
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,630
- Scared I'm gonna die on you?
- Don't even--

314
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,440
And all I ask is one last kiss...

315
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,359
...as the light is dimming.

316
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,150
- You think that's funny?
- It's just a scratch.

317
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,549
But I thought it was....

318
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,819
Hey. Hey.

319
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,849
You really that worried about me?

320
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,119
Probably think I'm an idiot.

321
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:08,259
I think if you care that much...

322
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,400
...the wound is definitely deep.

323
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,299
The light is dimming.

324
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,230
And all I ask...

325
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:24,250
...is one last....

326
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,640
- You guys all right?
- Charles got stabbed.

327
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,440
- Couple of stitches' worth.
- Same guys that attacked us.

328
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,960
- Cordy, your tag's showing.
- Any idea where we are?

329
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,470
Cordy and I hit a mystical hot spot
back in one of the dressing rooms.

330
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,329
The prima ballerina had a lover
back in the day...

331
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,750
...and there was this Count Kurskov
who owned the company.

332
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:51,599
He had a thing for the girl
and they were mightily afraid of him.

333
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,950
- He had powers of some kind.
- He was a wizard.

334
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:57,779
He was obsessed with the girl.

335
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,660
When he found her with the other man,
he went insane with jealous rage.

336
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,180
Pulled her out of time...

337
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,289
...out of any reality
beyond his theater, his company.

338
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,339
He swore she would dance
for him forever.

339
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,069
- How did you--?
- I hit a hot spot too.

340
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,819
And now we're stuck here?

341
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,930
This kind of temporal shift can't
just exist. It has to be maintained.

342
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,289
That requires power and concentration.

343
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:39,559
If we overload him somehow, we might
be able to slip back to the real world.

344
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,220
- Man with a plan.
- Great. So how do we overload him?

345
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,670
I imagine that requires some energy.

346
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,109
- The more we kill, the more he makes.
- Look.

347
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,140
And that's draining his energy.
Angel, go to the stage.

348
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,140
- The Count will be watching.
- I bet he has a box.

349
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,490
Find his power source
and destroy it. We'll loosen his hold.

350
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,690
By making more monsters?
Man with a frightening plan.

351
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:22,940
Back here. They can't surround us.

352
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,299
You two.

353
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,190
Stay close together.
I'll take point.

354
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,359
- I hope you're in the killing mood.
- I should do all right.

355
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,430
Hello?

356
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,920
Who are you?

357
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,220
There's no one. You're new.

358
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm pretty old, actually.

359
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,819
I've seen you dance.

360
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,180
Everyone sees me.

361
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,339
It was Giselle then as well.

362
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,210
Always.

363
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,430
I know what's happening.

364
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,660
Count Kurskov...

365
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,059
...he's punishing you.

366
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,109
He made me. He owns me.

367
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,599
When I dance, it's only for him.

368
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,340
Do you believe that?

369
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:10,949
It really doesn't matter.

370
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,769
I'll dance, I'll wait here
and then I'll dance again.

371
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,079
That's all.

372
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,670
A hundred years,
doing the same piece every night.

373
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,289
Is that enough? What about Stefan?

374
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,110
I waited too long.

375
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,260
I should have gone when he asked me.
I should have disappeared, but...

376
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,460
...I wanted this.

377
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:49,099
This dance, this....

378
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,179
I hesitated...

379
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,199
...and I lost everything
that mattered.

380
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:01,659
Now all I do is wait.

381
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,000
But you dance.

382
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:09,989
There's a section in the first act...

383
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:15,239
...during the courtship dance,
where my foot slips.

384
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:21,909
My ankle is turned
and I don't quite hold...

385
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,710
...every time.

386
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,880
He doesn't notice.

387
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:32,679
He doesn't even know ballet that well.

388
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,170
But always, at that same moment...

389
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,849
...I slip.

390
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:47,329
It isn't just the same ballet.

391
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,070
It's the same performance.

392
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,210
I don't dance.

393
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,099
I echo.

394
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,210
Please...

395
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:07,739
...can you make it stop?

396
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,150
- It's working!
- There are dozens of them.

397
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,179
- Yay, us!
- It has to be weakening his hold.

398
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:26,050
I can help you,
but you have to do something.

399
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,769
- What?
- Dance something new.

400
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:33,250
- I can't.
- He's losing control of all of this.

401
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:37,699
But you have to take the stage.

402
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,510
It's not too late.

403
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,550
You can change things.

404
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:48,010
Where's your power center?

405
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,760
- How dare you?!
- I'll guess.

406
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,670
- You have no right.
- Save it.

407
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,920
She was my love.

408
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:37,170
She danced only for me.

409
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:40,449
Yeah. You love her that much?

410
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,030
Start a website.

411
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,699
You'll have to clean the wound.

412
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,300
Do you want something for the pain?

413
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,280
What pain?

414
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,809
Do you think I can still return it?

415
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:16,630
Because otherwise we'll have
to take on a lot more cases.

416
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,400
Cordy?

417
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,380
You know, we should probably not talk
about our little adventure.

418
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:27,849
Anything that might have been seen.
Anything that might have been perky.

419
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:31,210
- I want to pretend it never happened.
- Exactly.

420
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:34,320
Wipe it from my memory.

421
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:37,809
What? Was it, like, disgusting?

422
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,710
No! I....
I would just want....

423
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:45,260
If we were to....

424
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,469
I would just want it to be...

425
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,730
...new.

426
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,480
Start at the beginning.

427
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,300
Lost me in the middle.

428
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:01,030
Cordy, you and I, we've been
working together for a long time.

429
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,699
What I mean is, you've become...

430
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,650
...a truly extraordinary woman.

431
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,690
I know we haven't
always gotten along...

432
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,219
...but I think that, you know, we....

433
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,170
- Groo?
- Yes!

434
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,269
We grew closer together, and I think--

435
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,670
- Groo!
- Princess!

436
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

437
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,599
- I feared you'd forget who I was.
- Remind me.

438
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:42,889
He just showed up.

439
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:45,750
Once everyone in Pylea
got their freedom...

440
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:48,579
...the political situation
got sketchy.

441
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,900
The Groosalugg here got deposed
and they set up a people's republic.

442
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,079
So he came looking for his true love.

443
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,179
- That's good for her.
- Yeah.

444
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,630
- I'm gonna check on Connor.
- Well, he's sleeping.

445
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,449
That's a surprise.

446
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,880
I thought for sure she was
meant to be with Angel.

447
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,900
I guess you never
can predict those things.

448
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,130
You know?

449
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:29,260
No, I guess you never can.
