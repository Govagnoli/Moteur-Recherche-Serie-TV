1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,470
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:08,369
I've fought vamps and demons,
but never had a Fred before.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,539
He's not taking the baby
overnight. He's taking it for good.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,619
- Justine?
- I just need to do this.

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,410
- Wes thought Angel--
- Was going to kill Connor.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,640
He had a reason for taking Connor.
We have to tell Angel.

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,859
- He'll forgive Wesley?
- Maybe begin to forgive.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,719
You son of a bitch!
You think I forgive you?! Never!

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,880
You're a dead man! You're dead!

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,859
It's hopeless.

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,100
Half these files, I can't read
the clients' names.

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,210
Friz, Frizzana, Frizzlecar?
What does this say?

13
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,320
I think it's Frzylcka.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,479
They were that couple that called
with the squatter in their lair.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,990
Wesley was supposed to--

16
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,939
He was supposed to
see to that.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,869
- He was too busy stealing the baby.
- Don't.

18
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,060
Okay?

19
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,870
How's it coming?
Any headway on those files?

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,209
- Some, sort of.
- There's so much to keep track of.

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,489
Still, times like these,
it's good to keep busy.

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,810
Throw yourself into work.
Stay active.

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,180
He lost the only
child he'll ever have.

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,019
Oh, sugar, I know. I know.

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,409
- I wish he'd talk to us.
- Leave him alone.

26
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,870
The rage has passed,
but you really want to know?

27
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm sure he's not planning to...

28
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,019
...finish what he started.

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,989
Wesley's too smart
to show his face.

30
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,909
We're back!
And we're bearing gifts.

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,040
What happened?

32
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm so sorry.

33
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,800
No more bets.

34
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,919
No more bets.
The wheel's in motion.

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,610
Place a bet, place a bet.

36
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,629
Table six. The one in blue.
Palmed a king in his left hand.

37
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,639
And, Benny...

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,620
...just take the left hand. We can
make money off the right.

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,340
You.

40
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,719
Good.

41
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Bring him in.
His marker's up.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,560
Time to collect his soul.

43
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,079
I'm just here, okay?

44
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,519
- This house is thick with sadness.
- Tell me about it.

45
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,339
Home is where the heart is,
but these hearts are broken.

46
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,660
I wish to aid my princess
in her time of need.

47
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,620
I brought clothing and food
for her shiv-roth.

48
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,000
The vigil of the bereaved.
I almost forgot that word.

49
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:10,629
We can't help their pain.
Is that why you're leaving?

50
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,110
Me? No, no, these are....

51
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:16,279
- They're not mine.
- They are Wesley's, then?

52
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,529
You might want to avoid
saying the name.

53
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,879
- Wesley. That was it.
- Don't be ridiculous, Monica.

54
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,410
- It was Sherman.
- You don't know any Shermans.

55
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,800
- It was Wesley. Irish fellow?
- English, you old bat.

56
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,769
That's who we were talking to.
Is he here?

57
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,079
- He's on sabbatical.
- Sorry for the mix-up.

58
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,120
It says you have a squatter
in your lair?

59
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,959
- Damn Skench demons. They're all alike.
- Here we go.

60
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,790
- Person spends his half-life--
- Building a lair.

61
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,040
And what happens?
A Skench demon squats.

62
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,160
On your coffee table. Ask me how
often I've listened to this.

63
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,009
- Like you ever listen.
- You have so much to say.

64
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:00,680
Skenches. I've heard about them.
Impish kind of demon?

65
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,110
- Like a leprechaun?
- Leprechauns don't exist.

66
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,810
- Now, Syd, don't embarrass the lad.
- Oh, sorry, kid.

67
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,670
Skenches take over a house,
drive out the people?

68
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,620
You can't stay.

69
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,860
The shrieking all night
and the projectile phlegm.

70
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,600
The only thing worse is putting up
with her for 300 years.

71
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,339
- You've been married three centuries?
- Ever since the mitosis.

72
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,689
Not that I'd mind being
a single-celled organism.

73
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,430
Oh, shut up, Syd.

74
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,629
I thought getting rid of them was
easy. Don't you lop off its head?

75
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,579
- If you can avoid the phlegm.
- Syd has a phlegm phobia.

76
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,149
I do not.
I have a phobia about sputum.

77
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,060
I think we got everything.

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,920
I'll clean out your
Skench problem.

79
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,569
We'll call you
as soon as it's done.

80
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,279
- Call me anytime.
- For crying out loud.

81
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,490
She's a 16th of your age.
Put your eyes back in your head.

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,209
An amoeba can dream, can't he?

83
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,439
Man, you hear those two?

84
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,490
It's beautiful.

85
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,019
All that time,
and they're still in love.

86
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,439
The way they finish each
other's insults, it's....

87
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,500
Beautiful.

88
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,329
- Is there evil to vanquish?
- Thanks, bro. I got it.

89
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,009
Just a demon under
Alvarado and Clark.

90
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,699
- Bye.
- Don't forget your machete.

91
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,079
Yes, dear.

92
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,949
He's fortunate to have such
a woman looking after his weapon.

93
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,269
I'm not touching that one.

94
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,110
Probably best to keep
this stuff out of sight...

95
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,920
...just in case....

96
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,980
I gotta run. I have a reading
in Topanga Canyon.

97
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,810
It's a good time for house calls...

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,040
...considering the vibe here.

99
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,759
- Hey, if he needs anything, just....
- I'll call.

100
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,730
Hi, Wesley.

101
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,839
How are you feeling?

102
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,490
It's not permanent, though.

103
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,189
I brought you some stuff
from the office.

104
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,590
Things there are....

105
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,409
Well, things.

106
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,919
Gunn and I found your notes
about the baby.

107
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,309
The prophecy.

108
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,259
You thought Angel was gonna kill him.

109
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,500
You were trying to protect him.

110
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,409
Both of them.

111
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,080
I wanted you to know
I understand that.

112
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,139
And I also wanted to say...

113
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,169
... what Angel tried to do to you
was wrong...

114
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,509
...and I'm sorry.

115
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,659
But he was right to blame you.

116
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,049
You should have come to us.

117
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,500
You should've trusted us
instead of Holtz.

118
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,330
You were our friend,
and you didn't even--

119
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,039
If Angel sees you again,
he'll kill you.

120
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,659
This time for real.

121
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,559
Don't come back to the hotel.

122
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,460
Ever.

123
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,200
The prophecy was false.

124
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,120
Angel was never going to hurt Connor.

125
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,049
It was all for nothing.

126
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,149
Hail to you, potential client.

127
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,279
How may I be of service?

128
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,720
- This Angel Investigations?
- It is. You in need of some help?

129
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,450
So...

130
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,779
...you must be Angel.

131
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,090
Gotta be it.

132
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,330
Smells like old people in...

133
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,970
...here! Gross!

134
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,279
Okay, definitely not a leprechaun.

135
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,679
Must be my lucky day.

136
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,299
Wanna bet?

137
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,769
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

138
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,190
- You got an appointment?
- No, I got business.

139
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,700
Over here, slick.
A little touch-and-go.

140
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,039
- You packing?
- No.

141
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,110
He could kill you 10 ways
from Sunday.

142
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,250
- But then he'd cook me too. Clean.
- Told you.

143
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:01,600
- Not everyone's as honest as you, bro.
- I ain't your bro.

144
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,389
You got a name or just a 'tude?

145
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,929
Name's Gunn.

146
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,159
Charles Gunn, if I'm not mistaken.
Man of the streets...

147
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,480
...protector of the young.
What can I do for you?

148
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,360
I want something.

149
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,990
I don't traffic in wants.
I supply needs.

150
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,850
Things you gotta have now,
or you'll die.

151
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,879
- They tend to be more valuable.
- I need it.

152
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,269
Then maybe I can assist.
What is it?

153
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,679
Money? Power?

154
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,759
Love?

155
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,019
Very nice.

156
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,059
She's a real beauty.
I can make it happen...

157
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,129
...but there's a cost.
I guess you know that.

158
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,659
Nothing to pay now,
but one day you will. The cost...

159
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,559
...is your future.

160
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,149
What future?

161
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,230
Well...

162
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,500
...there's that.

163
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,269
I need you to state for the record
of your own freewill.

164
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,190
You're sure you wish
to mortgage your future...

165
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,080
...for your present happiness?

166
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,850
I'm sure.

167
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,620
Shake on that?

168
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,320
Good.

169
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,409
You made a deal. Signed a blood oath
trading your soul.

170
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,080
- You think you can get out of it?
- Who said I'm trying to?

171
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,820
- You're giving away your soul.
- What are you saying?

172
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,539
Some broad.
You're falling for her hard.

173
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,789
- Fred.
- We don't get a name, just an image.

174
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,600
We watch the Akashic records.
Wouldn't we know...

175
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,990
...when one of our souls
was transferred?

176
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,740
Isn't Fred a guy's name?

177
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,509
None of mine. I'm here to say
you broke the contract.

178
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,539
Your soul ain't yours to give.
It's Mr. Jenoff's to take.

179
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,370
- I gotta see him.
- What you gotta do is pay up.

180
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,860
- I'm not the same person I was then.
- We get older...

181
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,799
...and we pay our debts to him.

182
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,519
There must be something
else he can take.

183
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,759
I have never heard that before.
Now, listen good.

184
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,500
You have got 24 hours
to get your house in order...

185
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,820
...and get down to that casino.
If you're thinking about...

186
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,070
...running or cheating, don't.

187
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,210
Because we'll take your soul
and the girl's.

188
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,669
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Keep it that way...

189
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,210
...or you can get her killed.

190
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,779
It's up to you now, slick.

191
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,289
See you tomorrow.

192
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,789
You okay?

193
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,480
- What?
- I said, are you okay?

194
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,570
Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,500
Seemed rude to chow down
in front of Angel...

196
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,899
...so I took a little break.

197
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,299
- You are not okay, pal.
- I'm just tired, but--

198
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:38,000
Cordelia here. I can see the misery
on your face.

199
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,600
- I know what's going on.
- You do?

200
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,039
It's pretty obvious.

201
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,389
Angel's lost his son,
Wesley's gone, and you are...

202
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,750
...happy as a kid in a candy store.

203
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,750
Um, happy?

204
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,600
And racked with guilt because
of it. Well, don't be.

205
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,370
You and Fred are meant to be.
I get that now.

206
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,619
She's a doll.
I was a little slow on the uptake.

207
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,700
I thought she and Wes, but....

208
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:14,309
The way you look at each other.
This place could use...

209
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,809
...a little happiness right now.
You and Fred have your...

210
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,920
...big, bright futures ahead of you.

211
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,940
I'm here to tell you it's all
right to enjoy it. Life goes on.

212
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,910
I should enjoy my future.

213
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm just saying. One thing
I learned on Hell Mouth:

214
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,480
Every day is precious. You never
know when it may be your last.

215
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,819
I never figured I'd be around
this long...

216
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,849
...or have this much.

217
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,589
Some people never know
one day of joy. You're lucky.

218
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,170
Maybe I am.

219
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,500
So live a little.

220
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,839
We don't have any pressing cases,
and I haven't had a vision in, like--

221
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh, wait.

222
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:01,539
I'm having one right now.
It's of you and Fred.

223
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,160
Taking tomorrow off.

224
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:08,069
And see, my visions.
Never wrong.

225
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,299
Have some fun.

226
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,170
All right, ready?

227
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,150
Red T-shirt...

228
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,369
...your dark-blue blue jeans,
gray boots.

229
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,759
Oh. Was I right about any of it?

230
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,730
Okay, that was just a warm-up.

231
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,000
Yellow long-sleeve tee...

232
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,390
...gray cords, tan boots.

233
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,319
See?

234
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,269
Record secure. Never takes me
more than twice.

235
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,380
Me?

236
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,799
Maybe you should come
over here and find out.

237
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,670
Of course, if it takes you
too long....

238
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,450
- It won't.
- Hey!

239
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,859
Sorry, I have to cancel.
Somebody just walked in.

240
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:18,869
- He better looking than me?
- Way.

241
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,549
And he brought me
breakfast in bed.

242
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,539
- Voila, madame. Room service.
- Cool.

243
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,869
- You didn't cook, did you?
- Nope.

244
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,539
Food from your favorite diner.

245
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,299
Pancakes and waffles?
I'm in starch heaven. Yum.

246
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,900
- Is today special or something?
- Yep, very special.

247
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,220
- How come?
- Because we have the day off.

248
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,450
- We do?
- We'll spend every minute...

249
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,380
...having the best day of our lives.

250
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,769
- Well, now it's official.
- What?

251
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,400
You are the best boyfriend ever.

252
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,579
Pancake kiss!

253
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,369
How we feeling today?

254
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,650
It's been rough,
but I have good news.

255
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,579
There's no sign of infection
or rebleeding...

256
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,410
...and the swelling's down.
We can stop worrying...

257
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,049
...about your airway
becoming compromised.

258
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,630
I'm gonna release you today.

259
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,519
Is there someone that can pick you up?

260
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,299
Friend or a family member
we can call?

261
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,539
I think he was gonna be left-handed.

262
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,160
The way he'd hold on to your fingers...

263
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,500
...his left hand always squeezed...

264
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,720
...just a little bit tighter.

265
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,630
Kid had a grip.

266
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,759
He was gonna be a southpaw for sure.

267
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,220
When you live as long as I do...

268
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,250
...you eventually lose everyone.

269
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,259
You don't get used to it,
but you expect it. You deal.

270
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,039
But he was just....

271
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,819
He was just a little....

272
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,940
You think you know about living
because you have this long life.

273
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,170
That's really all you have.
I mean, in my case, anyway.

274
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,720
Then one day you wake up...

275
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,400
...and you have something else.

276
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,819
The future.

277
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,400
I had a son.

278
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,109
And now for our next item
of pleasure, we got movies galore.

279
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,420
You pick. You wanna hit the 12-plex?
See every preview?

280
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,559
Like seeing a year's
worth of movies at once.

281
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,920
Your shake okay?
It's your favorite. Double mocha.

282
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,410
- I'm kind of full.
- Oh, my God. This is serious.

283
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,250
It's Sixth Street tacos,
fish sticks at the pier....

284
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,009
Don't fold on me.
We got more fun to go today.

285
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,539
I'm all for fun.
It's just, I might explode.

286
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,700
Right. Sorry.

287
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,200
No more food. But movie, club,
shopping, fun still to be had.

288
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,369
- You wanna go to the roller rink?
- I'm kind of wiped.

289
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,279
We've been having so much fun today.

290
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,890
Don't you think
we should save some...

291
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:16,579
...before all the other people get
sad because we took all the happy?

292
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,829
I blew it. I tried too hard.

293
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,640
No, it's been like the most wonderful,
beautiful day ever.

294
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,220
Aside from the knot in my tummy.

295
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,009
Being with you is always special.

296
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:34,829
We don't have to cram the rest of
our lives into one single day, right?

297
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,769
Oh, my God.

298
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,599
You did try too hard.
You haven't been yourself.

299
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,599
You did this because
something's wrong.

300
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,859
- No.
- Something is terribly wrong.

301
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,240
Charles, do you have leukemia?

302
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,420
I see it on the news.
They're young, in love...

303
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,599
...their whole lives ahead
when tragedy strikes.

304
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,279
- I'm not sick.
- You're not?

305
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,930
- You promise?
- I'm not sick.

306
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,609
Thank God.

307
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:14,119
I feel much better.

308
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,259
Except for the terrible knot inside.

309
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,029
Which isn't the food at all.

310
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,920
It's us.

311
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,740
What's wrong with us?

312
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:36,490
- It's nothing.
- Oh, that helps.

313
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,150
- Maybe we should go.
- We should stay here...

314
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,150
...and you should stop lying to me.

315
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,650
I know something's wrong.
Just be honest and tell me.

316
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,200
Charles.

317
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,380
Charles.

318
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,099
Whatever it is,
we'll get through it.

319
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,200
No, we won't.

320
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,710
What?

321
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,049
This isn't something
we're gonna talk through.

322
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,160
We share our feelings, then hug.

323
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,170
- I don't like how you're speaking.
- Too bad.

324
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,849
- Why are you being mean?
- I'm being honest. You want that?

325
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,710
Yeah.

326
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,069
Be honest.

327
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,960
Is it me?

328
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,410
Wow, you finally figured
that one out.

329
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,430
- What's wrong with me?
- Now I gotta make a list?

330
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,170
- I don't think I have enough time.
- Are you joking?

331
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:50,500
- What's happening?
- You and me are over. Done.

332
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:53,720
- No.
- Am I asking? I'm telling. Enough.

333
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:56,329
- I don't believe it.
- Better start.

334
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,490
But wait. Wait.

335
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,359
Is there someone else?

336
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,099
What's her name?

337
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,589
Her name is "I'm a real woman, not a
stick figure." Get the picture?

338
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,549
- Yeah.
- Good.

339
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:37,500
I won't sit here and pretend I know
what you're going through...

340
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:41,029
...or that I could begin
to understand your feelings.

341
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:45,940
The last thing you need right now
is someone saying...

342
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,509
...that given time, things will
get better, or the hurt will go away.

343
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,769
Because it won't get better.

344
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,660
The hurt's never going to go away.

345
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:04,109
If you lived another 200 years,
you'd never forget...

346
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,700
...how Connor was taken from you,
and you shouldn't.

347
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,680
You loved your son, Angel...

348
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,460
...and you'll go on loving him...

349
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:20,529
...and missing him.

350
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,480
You'll go on living too.

351
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,779
You'll do that.

352
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,589
I don't know how.

353
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,690
You don't need to.

354
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,230
The how works itself out.
Life will just keep happening.

355
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:43,470
There'll be people who need us, and...

356
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,299
...we'll help them.

357
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,670
Because that's what we do.

358
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,480
- Fred.
- I'm sorry.

359
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:09,869
I was gonna knock, but it wasn't
a good time, so I didn't.

360
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,430
- I don't know what else to do.
- What is it? What's wrong?

361
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,279
It's Charles. I think
he's in terrible danger.

362
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,569
I'm here to pay my bill.

363
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,809
- Wow.
- I know, huh?

364
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,220
- I am sorry this has come to pass.
- I'm confused.

365
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,109
- What was unclear?
- Well, upstairs...

366
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,920
- ...you said Gunn was in danger.
- He is.

367
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:01,309
- And you think that because...?
- He broke up with me.

368
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,140
But not really.

369
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,799
- No?
- No!

370
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,460
- That is good. I'm relieved.
- This is worse, much worse.

371
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,539
- I wish he had broken up.
- Are you sure he didn't?

372
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:16,589
- Those things he said to you--
- I know he said those things...

373
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,720
- ...but he would never say them.
- Those things he said?

374
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,109
Exactly! That's why I know
he's in trouble.

375
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,609
Let me get this straight.
You and Gunn are dating?

376
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:29,660
Not anymore, I guess!

377
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,779
- Fred, honey.
- Don't you see? He hurt me.

378
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:37,029
And the only reason he'd do that
is to protect me.

379
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,579
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad
because this hurts like hell.

380
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,299
I guess we better help him.

381
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,309
We are not losing another
member of this family.

382
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:13,920
This is Gunn,

383
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:15,240
leave a message,

384
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,150
Still no answer at his place
or on his cell phone.

385
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,240
Oh, no.

386
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,319
- This does not bode well.
- We'll split up.

387
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,220
To cover more ground.
It is a good plan.

388
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,460
Fred and I will check out
his old gang haunts.

389
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,549
- Or if they know any of his enemies.
- Exactly.

390
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:33,240
- You two go by his place.
- Report his truck stolen.

391
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,640
Not a bad idea.
Get the police involved.

392
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,640
We should leave Lorne a note.

393
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,069
If we come up with nothing,
we'll regroup.

394
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:44,039
We could leave these small
rectangles behind...

395
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,430
...like that creature who
inquired about Gunn.

396
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,200
Right. Good.

397
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,630
What? Let me see that.

398
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:57,059
Rectangles with telephonic digits
so people can get in touch with us.

399
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:00,450
- Somebody came by looking for Charles?
- Yesterday.

400
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,730
Remind me to give that rectangle
to Gunn once we find him.

401
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,849
I'm confident we shall.

402
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,150
- Works for Jenoff.
- Jenoff?

403
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,160
The Soul Sucker.

404
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,269
Charles Gunn.

405
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm impressed.

406
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,309
Not a lot of guys walk through
that door willingly.

407
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:26,079
Not the second time, anyway.

408
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,200
She must be special,
to give her my merchandise.

409
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm making good on my debt.
Don't talk about her.

410
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,339
- Don't think about her.
- She's not part of the deal.

411
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,710
- Hold him.
- I'm not gonna run.

412
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,829
But touch me, and you better.

413
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,859
Let's get this over with.

414
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,529
Gunn!

415
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,539
- Charles!
- Fred!

416
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,049
Hey.

417
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,509
- Angel.
- I know.

418
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,000
- We are surrounded.
- I know.

419
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,960
- We have to save Charles.
- I know.

420
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,500
Who's a guy gotta kill
to talk to the boss?

421
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,109
I'm the boss.

422
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,910
- Why are you disrupting my business?
- You're disrupting mine.

423
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,289
You're about to deprive me
of a valuable employee.

424
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,869
Charles Gunn works for me.

425
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:02,000
A good businessman looks into
the background of employees.

426
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:06,440
Had you done that, you might've
learned he's short-term material.

427
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,380
I'll make a deal with you.

428
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:14,809
You release him, forget what
he owes you, I'll let you live.

429
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,240
Thank you.

430
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,400
Kill them.

431
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,609
Double or nothing.

432
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,240
You offering me your soul?

433
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:33,519
- Chance to win it, anyway.
- How stupid do I look?

434
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,019
You're a vampire.
I can smell it.

435
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,069
Take a bigger whiff.
I'm a vampire with a soul.

436
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:45,769
You're that vampire.

437
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,190
I choose the game.
I win, we walk out of here.

438
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,720
Gunn's debt disappears.
You win...

439
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:55,799
...you get us both.

440
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,179
Brilliant stall tactic.
Now, what's the plan?

441
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,539
- This is the plan.
- Really?

442
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,469
Really. We're gonna win
Gunn's soul back.

443
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,219
This is so wrong in so many ways.

444
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,949
It's not money or a bunny Angel's
playing for. It's my boyfriend.

445
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,219
Don't be nervous.

446
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,070
Been around a long time,
won a lot of bets.

447
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,710
We're different.
I get lost and lose things.

448
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:44,570
- And I can't lose Charles.
- I'm not gonna lose.

449
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,429
You worried about this?

450
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,110
Like taking candy from a baby.

451
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,880
If we must rely on luck,
I prefer the odds of my sword.

452
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,550
- We should fight our way out.
- Fighting puts us at risk.

453
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:01,340
- My way is safer.
- If you win.

454
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,780
If you lose, won't you go evil
and kill everybody, including us?

455
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,409
- Am I wrong?
- Not wrong in theory.

456
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,449
- But I've gotta go with ace.
- I'm gonna win.

457
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,000
If I lose, you know what to do.

458
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,110
- Make it quick.
- You know I will.

459
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,949
Jenoff lets me have the bodies
when he's done.

460
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,789
One hand of cards. You win...

461
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,710
...this man walks free.

462
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,289
I win, I keep his soul,
and I get yours.

463
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,679
Name your game.
Omaha, Texas Hold 'Em...

464
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,280
- ...Seven Card Stud.
- How about a cut of the deck?

465
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,809
High card wins.

466
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,829
Vampire's not only got soul,
he's got guts.

467
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:37,800
- Feeling lucky?
- After you.

468
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,309
- A three?
- A three?

469
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,170
A three. You lose.

470
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,719
- That quick enough?
- Works for me.

471
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,489
Charles!

472
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,119
- Angel?
- No need to say thanks.

473
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,309
Right. If killing him was that easy,
I would've done it.

474
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,719
Now we fight.

475
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,869
Anybody else in here owe this guy?

476
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,659
Let's go.

477
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,429
Say it again,
a little slower this time.

478
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,489
I was terribly, terribly
wrong to break up with you.

479
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,199
- And say those mean and untrue things.
- Good.

480
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,050
Now say it into the tape recorder.

481
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,110
I'm really sorry,
and I'll never do it again.

482
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,409
- I'm just glad you're all right.
- I'm all right if you and me are good.

483
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,179
We are, aren't we?

484
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,659
- Just one last thing.
- Name it.

485
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:19,179
Who'd you trade your soul for?

486
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,360
That....

487
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,760
- That was a long time ago.
- I know. Tell me...

488
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,690
...and we'll never talk about it again.

489
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,050
Who was she?

490
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,840
Charles....

491
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,280
- That was before I met you.
- You must've wanted her pretty bad.

492
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,650
Guess I did.

493
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:41,739
Just tell me.

494
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,070
It....

495
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,230
It was a truck.

496
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:56,760
I was 17 years old, and I sold
my soul for a truck.

497
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,070
- Not this truck.
- Don't go dissing my girl.

498
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,880
Your soul wasn't
worth air conditioning?

499
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,539
This truck kept me alive. Helped me
save a lot of other lives too.

500
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,690
I know it sounds dumb...

501
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:12,019
...but I didn't think a soul
was that big a deal.

502
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,869
Didn't think I had a future then.

503
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:17,099
Now I do.

504
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,309
What is it about you
that makes me melt?

505
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,800
Maybe it's that I love you.

506
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,920
That's gotta be it.
