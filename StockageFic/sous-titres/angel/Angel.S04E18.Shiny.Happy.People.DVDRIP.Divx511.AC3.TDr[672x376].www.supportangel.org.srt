that through this new race...

163
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,968

But you didn't.

It was we who failed you.

00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,966

00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,126
I need you.

you didn't want to know even...

00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,092
...you'd trust me, right?

530
00:34:57,253 --> 00:34:59,369
Of course.

I...

532
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,208
I went to see that man
from the restaurant.

533
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:07,126
- The one who...
- The attacker? Why?

534
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:10,167
That's what I wanted to know,
why he would do that.

Wesley...

536
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:17,402
...he saw something.

537
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:22,763
We both saw something.

538
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:26,085
I needed to know if it
was the same something.

539
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,965
- And?
- It was.

540
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:36,803
Wesley, I know you're going
to find this hard to accept, but...

You don't believe me.

If you say you saw it, I believe you.

He told me not to tell anyone.

it's not what I would have wanted.

She tried to kill you.

that brings me is immeasurable.

She was acting weird earlier.

...being Fred.

That man at the hospital...

589
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:51,168
I'm still shocked
she would go to see him.

590
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:54,131
Once he had her there, he
must have monkeyed with her brain.

591
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:57,763
Maybe he made her do it,
with magic or something.

00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,728
I doubt even Fred understands...

...why she's so determined to destroy
everything we're trying to create...

her even more dangerous.

As long as she's out there,
she's a threat.

It may come to that.

But first, we have to try to help her.
