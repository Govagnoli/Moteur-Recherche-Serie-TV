1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,470
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,389
- What are you?
- You already know.

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,789
I'm glad we're not friends.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,419
Don't blame me for everything
you can't handle.

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,960
They brought Darla back.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,190
This is no life, Angel.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,780
My boy's still in there,
and he wants out.

8
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,370
This creep knows what happened.
He's playing us.

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,460
Might be.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,280
He's got mental problems.

11
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,929
I don't care about that.
We got one body already.

12
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:43,909
- And if she dies?
- If she dies, he's all yours.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,200
We can help you.
Tell us what you know...

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,740
...and we'll send you back to holding.

15
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,140
You stay quiet,
my partner dents your skull.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,329
Hey, you listening?

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,390
I think you got involved in something
bigger than you expected.

18
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,560
You got scared, panicked
and an officer ended up on the floor.

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,260
Not to mention the body
without a head.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,260
- Do yourself--
- She shouldn't have been there.

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,099
She didn't know.

22
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,890
He didn't know what
he was getting into.

23
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,170
None of them did.
If they'd known, they--

24
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,939
You didn't bring it here, did you?

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,370
No.

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,620
No, then it'd be too late
for all of us.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,780
He grabbed her hard.

28
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,319
Very hard.

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,229
I'm quite good with the ladies myself.

30
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,669
Just tell us what happened.

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,849
It all went horribly wrong.

32
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,069
None of us knew the effect
it would have until it was too late.

33
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,009
I tried to stop him...

34
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,500
...but I got hit and fell.

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,280
And when I looked up, he had her.

36
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,389
He was holding her.

37
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,770
Then she was on the floor.

38
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,259
If we'd found out sooner, I would
have stopped him. I would have.

39
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,729
Stopped who?

40
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,379
He should never have been there.

41
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,449
Of all people, he should never--

42
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,830
You don't tell him what to do.
He's the boss.

43
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,270
The boss?

44
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,620
He helps people, you know.

45
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,939
When he's not in trouble himself.
Cordy and I tried to get him out.

46
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,110
She was with me.

47
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,040
Oh, God....

48
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,300
Cordelia.

49
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,230
- Your head.
- Excuse me?

50
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,459
Your hair.

51
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:27,970
It's new.

52
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,569
It's great!

53
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,639
- When did this happen?
- Ten days ago.

54
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,199
Of course. I didn't want
to embarrass you by--

55
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,360
Noticing?

56
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,529
- Nice suit.
- I was just on my way out to--

57
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,149
Yet another glamorous celebrity-filled
gala with Miss Virginia Bryce?

58
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,319
We should check on Angel.
He doesn't seem to do much lately.

59
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,389
Au contraire, His day is packed.

60
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:03,860
Brood about Darla,
brood about Darla...

61
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,230
...lunch, followed by Darla-brooding.

62
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:11,660
Right. Enough is enough. I'm gonna
march up there and tell him just that.

63
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,810
- Nice posturing.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,110
He's not there. Gunn's cousin
is involved in something big.

65
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,810
Big, meaning illegal.
Angel and Gunn went to help.

66
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,430
That's good. He's getting out.
Something I'm gonna do myself.

67
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,670
Traipsing off to your shallow,
soul-sucking party?

68
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,709
Premiere, actually.
And I happen to have an extra ticket.

69
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,050
Who does shallow better than me?

70
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,709
- He cool, right?
- He's cool.

71
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm not prejudiced.
I just hate vampires.

72
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,519
- You're enlightened. I can tell.
- See how they do?

73
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,120
They mess with your mind.
That's why I called you--

74
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,769
You got a vampire problem,
Angel has experience in that area.

75
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,959
Yo, spill it. We ain't got all night.

76
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,240
I sort of said I'd take this job
driving for this big-time crew.

77
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,500
E.J. vouched for me,
but now I'm thinking--

78
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,620
- You don't like prison.
- Yeah.

79
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,850
And they're bringing in
this psycho vampire from Vegas.

80
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,660
- And like I said, man--
- What's the job?

81
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,379
Taking off some museum.
Don't know which.

82
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,740
- What are they after?
- Something big. Supernatural.

83
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,579
It's going down this week,
but I'm meeting the boss tonight.

84
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,209
And if I don't show,
I'll be hunted down and killed.

85
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,160
Where's the meet?

86
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,689
- Psycho vampire got a name?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,310
E.J. said it.
It's something like Jee-Don...

88
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,569
- ...or Joe-Don or--
- Jay-Don.

89
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,120
That's it.
He's coming in for the meeting.

90
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,069
They're picking him up.

91
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,019
- Where?
- Downtown bus, midnight.

92
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,920
- Hey, what am I gonna do?
- Take the meeting.

93
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,430
- I'll get you out before it goes down.
- I owe you bigtime, cuz.

94
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:24,209
Thank you, man. Nice to meet you.

95
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,910
- So you know this Jay-Don?
- I know of him.

96
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,490
He's a player and way dangerous.

97
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,060
- I'll take it from here.
- You'll what?

98
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,660
This is my cousin's life.

99
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,990
Which is why I don't want you in
with guns a-blazing.

100
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,819
- You're giving me orders?
- I'm paying you.

101
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,620
I brought it to you.

102
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,899
If I can't shut it down,
I'll protect him.

103
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,920
- I should sit home and knit?
- I could use a sweater.

104
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,689
Something dark.

105
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,680
Darla?

106
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,870
You expecting her? Because that
would cut down on my legwork.

107
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:36,909
- What are you doing here?
- She was involved in a little murder.

108
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,200
Remember? A guy's throat
got ripped out.

109
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,669
I'm sure you'll tell me
she's innocent.

110
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,529
Maybe not.

111
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,769
Don't suppose you'd testify
in a sunny court of law.

112
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,159
Don't suppose you got
a search warrant.

113
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,490
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

114
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,029
Darla's not here.
I don't know where she is.

115
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,090
I will find her, Angel.
And when I do, she's toast.

116
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:14,460
- She's human now, remember?
- Toast with life in prison.

117
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:21,480
Kate, there are forces at work here
that you know nothing about.

118
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,279
- Gathering storm?
- Don't get caught.

119
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,620
- You afraid I'll get hurt?
- I'm afraid you'd get killed.

120
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,559
I'm saying this so you won't.

121
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,559
Me dead. I guess I'd kind of
be like you then, wouldn't I?

122
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,049
I won't stand by
while you two finish the game.

123
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,139
Let's try this one more time.

124
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,669
You come between us,
it'll be your last move.

125
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,289
Let go of me.

126
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,759
Really, the stain's hardly noticeable.

127
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,879
Cordelia, what happened?

128
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:09,559
It's not blood, it's cocktail sauce.
Courtesy of Mr. Star-Schmoozer here.

129
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,360
I mean to your head.

130
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,440
Your hair.

131
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,330
Well, it looks great.

132
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,250
- When did this happen?
- Ten days ago. Pay attention.

133
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,379
- Why doesn't anyone tell me this stuff?
- We had a little mishap.

134
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,049
With the little shrimp and the sauce.

135
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,940
- And her dress.
- You were at a party?

136
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:39,409
You know, party, soiree,
night of the thousand humiliations.

137
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,240
I spilled it on her
in front of Mr. Fat Chow-Chow.

138
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:49,590
Chow Yun-Fat.

139
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,830
What, you met Chow Yun-Fat?

140
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,080
- How'd it go with Gunn's cousin?
- Fine. A group of-- Cordelia?

141
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,320
Listening.

142
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,940
A group of thieves is planning
to heist a local museum.

143
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,980
Probably something
with mystical power.

144
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,639
- Do you know which museum?
- No. Gunn's cousin is just the driver.

145
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,799
We should research museums
with recent acquisitions.

146
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,539
This is wonderful. You're on a case.

147
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,450
You're back.

148
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,879
It'll be just like old times.

149
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:29,250
Meeting Evil face-to-face,
kicking Evil's booty.

150
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,519
Wes and I will crank up
the research machine, and you'll--

151
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:36,950
What'll you do?

152
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,779
They're bringing Jay-Don in from
Vegas. If he's involved, it's big.

153
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,700
- I've heard of him. Isn't he a--
- Deadly killer?

154
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,759
Well, that. I was about to say
a loud, flashy character.

155
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,240
He ran with Sinatra's Rat Pack.
Never got over it.

156
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,509
- I think I'll meet his bus.
- And take his place? Great plan, boss!

157
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,450
What better way to get your mind off
things we don't even need to--

158
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,700
- How loud and flashy?
- I believe he's quite the extrovert.

159
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,490
- What?
- Well, I'm sure you can pull it off.

160
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,779
You're...colorful.

161
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,120
This is such an honor.
Hi. I'm a big fan.

162
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,320
When the boss said that Jay-Don
was coming in, I was like, wow!

163
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,799
- Can I see the glasses?
- No touching them or the hair, doll.

164
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,120
Yeah, right, doll. You got it.
That's cool.

165
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,470
I'm supposed to ask you something.
What is it?

166
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,200
Oh, God, what is it?

167
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,399
Oh, yeah.

168
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,049
- What's the password?
- There is no password.

169
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,529
Just checking.

170
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:30,639
- Jay-Don?
- You think I'm traveling in luggage?

171
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,299
How you doing?

172
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,700
You look sharp. That plastic surgeon,
he give you the big rebate?

173
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,730
- Let's go. Car's over here.
- The trip was faboo.

174
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,860
I love flying coach.
And what is that piece of junk?

175
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,980
- You're funny, vampire.
- Whoa. We need to talk, bro.

176
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,059
Two things bringing in the chicks:
the 'do and the ride.

177
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,139
Get in.

178
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,519
I hope I don't see anybody I know.

179
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:27,200
He's got him.

180
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,809
- Vampires wig me.
- You feel like a meal?

181
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,860
You must be Bob, the security guard.

182
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,340
- And you're a great big monster.
- This is Jay-Don.

183
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,110
- He talks too much.
- I'm a people person.

184
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,500
- Great shirt. Ed's Big and Spiny?
- You're funny.

185
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,659
- You'll be funnier dead.
- Funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?

186
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,769
- Shut up, all of you.
- I wasn't talking.

187
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,870
- Where's Lester?
- Yeah. We can't do it without him.

188
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,169
- Who's Lester?
- The driver.

189
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,730
- He should've already been here.
- He's E.J.'s guy. He'll show.

190
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,559
I hate waiting.

191
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,769
You got anybody to eat around here?

192
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,360
Finally.

193
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,019
What kind of name is Lester anyway?
Norwegian? Finnish?

194
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,509
- What took you so long?
- What took me so long is I'm a pro.

195
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,309
I cased the area,
made sure no cops followed me.

196
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,350
Looks like I'm the last one
at the party.

197
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,009
- I said I'd handle it.
- I don't take orders.

198
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,269
- Something wrong?
- Depends.

199
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,590
Do we all gotta wear
these ugly-ass shirts?

200
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,669
Because I got my pride.

201
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,710
So, what we looking for?

202
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,750
The Shroud of Rahmon. It's worth about
two million on the black market.

203
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,169
- Do you want to pay attention now?
- You got my undivided.

204
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,799
Bob turns off the alarm at 2:40.

205
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,559
We enter, take this hall to the
elevator, where we meet Bob at 2:45...

206
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,389
...and we all go down together.

207
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,870
This is the vault where they keep it.

208
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,450
The vault has a lock code.

209
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,029
That means we have to blow it.
Now, the door has no alarm...

210
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,159
...but the vault itself has its
own system, a thermal sensor.

211
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,660
- Body heat sets it off.
- That's where I come in.

212
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,380
No body heat.
Goes with the no soul thing.

213
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,710
Jay-Don enters, goes to the control box
in the back, disarms it.

214
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,609
- We're in.
- How big is the case?

215
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,309
Big.

216
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,819
It's made of consecrated wood with
gold edges and a lead-lined interior.

217
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,220
It weighs about a ton. It's going
to take all of us just to lift it.

218
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,029
I can handle my end.
I'm not so sure about him.

219
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,140
- I can handle my side.
- With a forklift.

220
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,000
- You want a piece of me?
- Take it easy.

221
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,960
He's a troublemaker.
I know a Majnu demon...

222
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,680
...professional driver, never talks.

223
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,039
And I know a vampire better shut up.

224
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,809
Guys, I apologize.
This is something I should just...

225
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,460
...take outside!

226
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,950
- I got a problem with that.
- So do I.

227
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,730
I gotta spend the rest
of the week with him?

228
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,829
No. Just the rest of the night.

229
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,009
- No waiting. We do this now.
- Tonight?

230
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,099
And no one leaves my sight
until it's over.

231
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,799
Anybody tries, they get a bullet
from me or a stake from him.

232
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,259
Museums, museums.
Okay, we've got the MOCA.

233
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,630
We've got the LACMA.
Ooh, the Gene Autry!

234
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,779
Well, it could be
a magical stuffed horse.

235
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,880
Let's assume not
and try Natural History.

236
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,769
Okay, here we go. Site map,
membership, museum shop....

237
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:47,480
Don't they have
a "Things to Steal" section?

238
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,099
Click on Recent Acquisitions. There.

239
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,390
I've got it. Backseat surfer.

240
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,529
- Where's Angel?
- Could be a long meeting.

241
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,700
- Could it be chelicerae arthropods?
- Keep going.

242
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,119
Wait. "On the 3rd of this month...

243
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,579
...the museum received
the Shroud of Rahmon...

244
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,630
...from a tomb unearthed
by New Mexico archaeologists."

245
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,200
Okay, two words I don't like:
tomb and unearthed.

246
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:18,819
- People, leave your tombs earthed.
- Have you ever heard of it?

247
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,559
I don't like shrouds.
They're an after-you-die outfit.

248
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,619
Get all you can from the database.
I'll hit the books.

249
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,039
The driver should stay here
in case someone--

250
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,089
We need him inside.

251
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,269
- Don't hit me again.
- I was protecting you.

252
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,490
I appreciate that.

253
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,750
Don't do it again.

254
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,119
We have one minute
before Earl makes his rounds.

255
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,980
You don't have to hit him hard.

256
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:04,410
They got me, Earl!

257
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,420
You kill him, the cops will be
all over us. We gotta do this clean.

258
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,400
Tape him.

259
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,069
Let's go.

260
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,150
Come on.
Come on, hurry up and blow it!

261
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,819
He's a guard
at the Museum of Natural History.

262
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,539
Robert Skale.
He has a record. Small-timer.

263
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,470
This one may be M. James Menlo.
He likes to crack bank vaults.

264
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,250
Our guess is they're pulling
a heist at the museum.

265
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,289
Then we picked up this one tonight.

266
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,180
Carlson said you knew him.

267
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:25,359
It's not within our investigation,
but Carlson said you'd be interested.

268
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,519
I'm interested.

269
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,450
You're taking too long!

270
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,160
Spine-Man, chill. This is nitro.
I don't want our body parts mixed up.

271
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,809
- We should've been in there by now.
- Shut up!

272
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,380
Allow me.

273
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,259
The shroud was woven by the head
priest, driven mad by the demon.

274
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,900
Once Rahmon was defeated,
the shroud was dyed...

275
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,920
...with the blood of seven virgins,
sacrificed on the full moon...

276
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:34,730
...then laid upon Rahmon,
to prevent his resurrection.

277
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,000
Why is it always virgin women
who are sacrificed?

278
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,390
- For purity.
- It has nothing to do with purity.

279
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,299
It's about dominance.

280
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:48,740
If someone ordered a male body part
for religious sacrifice...

281
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:52,200
...the world would be
atheist, like that.

282
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,670
The shroud supposedly
absorbed Rahmon's power.

283
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,890
So he who has the shroud
has the power.

284
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:03,890
You said Rahmon was
a drive-you-mad kind of fella?

285
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:04,920
Ooh.

286
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,309
I hate it when you do that.

287
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,400
In 1803, the shroud
was removed from its casing.

288
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,670
- And yuckiness ensued?
- Yes.

289
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,089
All of El Encanto went insane.

290
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,630
Mothers and children hacking each
other, men roaming like rabid dogs--

291
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:23,799
I get the picture.

292
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,390
In order to take his mind off
the torment that is Darla...

293
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,940
...we sent Angel after a box
that makes you crazy.

294
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,470
We'll warn Angel
before they steal the shroud.

295
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,190
Just as soon as he comes back.

296
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,619
Unless, of course,
they're stealing it right now.

297
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,869
The shroud's gonna make us rich.
I can feel it.

298
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,910
You feel it? This is gonna be amazing.

299
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,539
How's it going in there?
Is everything all right?

300
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:37,559
Everything's fine.

301
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,809
- I feel something weird in here.
- Humans always gotta feel something.

302
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:08,210
They always gotta tell you,
"I'm so happy.

303
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,309
I'm so sad. I'm so scared."
It makes me sick.

304
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,619
I like it when they're scared.
It makes them taste salty.

305
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,549
I ask for your opinion,
you overgrown leech?

306
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,500
- Altoids, aisle four.
- We don't have time for this.

307
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:26,660
- Let's get it and go.
- When they gonna make pretty demons?

308
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,579
On the count of three.

309
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,200
- One.
- You about to turn or something?

310
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:34,369
No.

311
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,599
- Two.
- You look like it.

312
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,380
- Lift, Lester.
- Don't order me, Elvis.

313
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,079
Three!

314
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:45,160
So it is tonight.
They must be somewhere...

315
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,140
...inside.

316
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,859
Sorry, I'm feeling a little....

317
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,210
Me too. I think it's the altitude.

318
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:56,559
Right. The altitude here at sea level.

319
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,269
- Let's not lose focus.
- Maybe we should split up.

320
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,720
- Too dangerous. Let's stick together.
- Right.

321
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,130
Lockley requesting backup.

322
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:13,779
Possible 459 in progress
at the Museum of Natural History.

323
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,160
- Hold up your corner.
- Who made you corner monitor?

324
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,059
- You gonna get married?
- Same old story.

325
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,880
Pushy vampires,
think the world is theirs.

326
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,509
- They can have it.
- I visited Topkapi once.

327
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,130
Always taking.
Your blood, your sister.

328
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:42,759
- Somebody shut that human up!
- Wanna take somebody?

329
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,500
- Try taking me!
- It's slipping!

330
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,220
- Don't drop it!
- Hold it, hold it!

331
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,839
Oops.

332
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,680
I hate this
vampires-killed-my-sister song.

333
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,869
Don't you know anything else?

334
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,549
- Get your hands off my throat.
- You gonna play nice?

335
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,869
- I'm cool.
- We can't leave it. We must move it.

336
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,529
Someone else will come along. Move it!

337
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,599
Kill the human! Kill it!

338
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,369
Case.

339
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,990
All righty, pardners,
it's roping time!

340
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:36,579
I'll play the defenseless calf.
Who gets to be the cowboy?

341
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:42,079
Tightly, so it looks real.
I'm not the bad guy, I'm the good guy.

342
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm the good guy.
No, wait. The bad guy.

343
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,220
- Pick it up.
- Wait. You gotta hit me.

344
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,049
Somebody's gotta hit me.
Man, you gotta hit me.

345
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,460
Do it. Make it real.

346
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,880
Looks real to me.

347
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,509
Where's Angel?

348
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:29,470
Angel?

349
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,819
Right. That's why I'm here.
To warn Angel about...

350
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:36,769
...something...

351
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,140
...important.

352
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,940
Your hair.

353
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,009
- To warn Angel about my hair?
- It's blond.

354
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:51,630
The shroud.

355
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:57,549
He's got to know about the shroud.
It makes everyone act differently.

356
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,109
My teeth are so big.

357
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:07,730
I...

358
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:09,980
...am...

359
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,589
...pleasant.

360
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,579
We must hurry before it's too late.

361
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,000
I noticed your hair right away.

362
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,160
Oh.

363
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:43,230
Hello, plastic person.

364
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:48,200
You're all by your lonesome in here.

365
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:52,940
So....

366
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,529
I guess you won't be needing this.

367
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,049
- We left fingerprints!
- What?

368
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,160
- They'll find us!
- Forget him. Keep going.

369
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,920
No fingerprints!

370
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,430
I gotta put it down.
I gotta put it down.

371
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,430
- Humans! Good for nothing!
- Keep going.

372
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,589
I can't, I can't.
My head. It's full of flies.

373
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,559
- Get away from it!
- I don't need any of you.

374
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,200
What's wrong now, son?
Tired? Got a little backache?

375
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,680
A little toothache?

376
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,980
- What?
- Angel, thank God I found you...

377
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,819
- ...in time. Is it in time?
- Wesley?

378
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:54,619
Yes! I had a message for you.
And the message was....

379
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,900
The shroud!
The shroud, very dangerous.

380
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:03,200
It makes people bad, although
it's amazing how good I feel.

381
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,940
- Get out.
- Is that Gunn? What's he doing here?

382
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:11,390
- I never thought him a museum type.
- Police! Nobody move!

383
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,470
Wow!

384
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,740
Look at you, rushing in here
all by yourself.

385
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,529
- You're the best cop ever.
- Too many humans.

386
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,289
- Excuse me, this is my girl.
- Stay back.

387
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,769
Okay.

388
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:34,789
You got me. My life of crime is over.

389
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,740
I'm going down.
But first, a little impression.

390
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,829
"I protect the innocent...

391
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:44,630
...rain on everyone's parade,
obsess about my dad's death...

392
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,359
...and bother people
who steal things!"

393
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,299
Angel.

394
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,299
Oh, Katie, what are you so afraid of?

395
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,349
Is it this?

396
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:05,700
Is it the part where I kill you?
I love that in a woman.

397
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,339
Don't move! Police!

398
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,400
- Oh, I didn't--
- Don't move. Stay where you are.

399
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:48,670
- Oh, my God.
- Kate. Come on, wake up.

400
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:52,619
- We got an officer down.
- What's your 20?

401
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,789
You drank her.

402
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,369
Animal! You drank that cop.

403
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:26,929
- What now?
- Open it.

404
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,369
Good thing we didn't do that in the
museum and miss out on the lifting.

405
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,519
Open it! There's a catch.

406
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,530
That works too.

407
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,920
I got it. I got it!

408
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:05,829
No! No!

409
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,730
You don't know what this means,
what it's about.

410
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:14,050
It belongs to my people. My people!

411
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,710
I didn't see any of your people
when we was hauling it.

412
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,510
Fellas, fellas.

413
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,280
Cool your jets, okay.
There's plenty here for all of...

414
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,119
...me.

415
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:32,150
How's it work? The one with
the biggest piece gets a wish?

416
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:34,239
- Don't hurt it.
- What about you?

417
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,949
- You want it?
- I get it, I kill you.

418
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,340
Tell your wish,
because it won't come true.

419
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,619
It's mine!

420
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,590
Got it! Got it! Got it!

421
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,199
Wait, wait. Gunn, I remember.
You have to trust me.

422
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,639
I know what to do with this.

423
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,960
I think.

424
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,889
- You want us to believe a magic sheet--
- A shroud! A shroud.

425
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,289
Right, right.

426
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,820
It turns people
into superstrong lunatics?

427
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,059
So one ripped the head off a guard...

428
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,719
...and another viciously
attacked Detective Lockley.

429
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,269
- That it?
- I know how it sounds.

430
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:33,130
I really don't think you do.

431
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,570
- What are you doing?
- Arresting you.

432
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,840
For the murder of the guard
and the attempted--

433
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,789
Let him go.

434
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,599
Stay down or they'll kill you.

435
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,239
I don't think he's coming down.

436
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,449
Mm.

437
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,960
I don't think recent events
did him much good.

438
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,590
Again, a hearty "mm."

439
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:24,130
We had every good intention,
of course.

440
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,260
Right. Sending him into the path
of a crazy-making...

441
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,320
...one-way ticket to Eviltown
death cloth. Good plan.

442
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,630
I'm not as worried about
the shroud's effects as--

443
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,579
What?

444
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,489
My stealing?
I returned everything, I swear.

445
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,340
Angel drank human blood
from a living person.

446
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,460
He hasn't done that in a long time.

447
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,860
So on top of everything else, we may
have reawakened his bloodlust?

448
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:56,210
Yes.

449
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:04,179
- Full day's work, then.
- I think so.

450
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,920
Thank you,
