You never stop fighting.

506
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:24,322
Hey, I was gonna, but someone
got all pep-talky on me.

507
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,812
Yeah.

508
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:30,132
I'm sorry I didn't get to see you,
our little brain tour notwithstanding.

509
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,051
Another time.

510
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,009
I have a lot to thank you for.

511
00:37:35,813 --> 00:37:38,850
Well, that vice is plenty versa.
Don't even start.

512
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,924
It's only gonna lead to hugging and...

513
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,412
- We can't have that.
- No.

514
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:46,884
CONNOR:
All right, I get it. I messed up.

515
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,283
Hey, cheer up, punk.
It just makes you one of us.

516
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,727
You headed out?

517
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,884
- Hey, no tears, big guy.
- No, I'm good.

518
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,692
I wish I could've seen you
kicking the crap out of Junior.

519
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:56,888
It was pretty funny.

522
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,652
Faith.

523
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:09,008
See? Brits know how to say goodbye.
Angel here wanted to hug.

524
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:10,447
No, I didn't.

525
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:12,492
You run a good show.

526
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:15,451
Yeah, sit back and let
the girl do all the heavy lifting.

527
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:18,127
That's pretty much it.

FRED:
I think that volume is outdated.

529
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:25,043
You'd know better than me, but there's
some interesting stuff about hell mouths.

530
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,044
- It might help.
- This is great.

531
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:31,207
I have to say, some day I'd love to bend
your ear about the Pergamum Codex.

532
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:33,973
Some of the really obscure
passages are actually Latin...

533
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,892
...translated from a demonic tongue.
They're kind of a hoot.

534
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:40,092
All this stuff about bacchanals
and spells and...

535
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:43,404
Actually, I think it's
probably funnier in Latin.

536
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,448
- You know how that is sometimes.
- I'm seeing someone.

537
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,451
Time goes by, Will.

538
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:55,446
Okay, good. Wagons west.

539
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:58,332
- See you guys.
- Willow...

540
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,043
He's gonna tell you how much
he owes you.

541
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:07,008
Oh, don't mention it. I got a slayer
out of the deal, so we're even-steven.

542
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:15,208
- I'll tell Buffy you said hi.
- Good. Thanks.

543
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,525
Oh, um...

544
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:23,131
Next time you guys resurrect Angelus,
call me first, okay?

how the worst is behind us...
