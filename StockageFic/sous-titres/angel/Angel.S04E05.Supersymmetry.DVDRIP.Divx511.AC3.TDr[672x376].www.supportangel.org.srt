to Dirichlet boundary conditions...

00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,521
Welcome back.

339
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:37,005
I've been holding on
to something for you.

340
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,563
The last test I took before...

341
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:49,648
A-minus?

342
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:52,452
Well, I would have given another
student an A-plus...

343
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:55,525
...but with you,
I had to use a different standard.

344
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,523
Now he tells me.

345
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:03,932
I'd love another crack at it.
Teaching you.

346
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,973
You have a gift.
It shouldn't be wasted.

347
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:12,891
It's been so long.
I mean, writing the article was great...

348
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,246
...but I have another life now.

349
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,241
Sounds like a life you stumbled into,
not one you chose.

350
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:22,204
I guess it kind of chose me.

351
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:26,803
You know, I don't know
what I saw yesterday.

352
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:32,849
There are studies about subconscious
suggestion, mass hysteria.

353
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:35,324
But I know what I see right now.

354
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:37,802
You do?

355
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:43,567
A talented young woman who deserves
to live in the world she was meant for.

356
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,285
You guys know how it is.

357
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:54,685
You hear things, but you don't know
if they really happened.

358
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,572
Like the one about the girl,
the cat and the peanut butter.

359
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,531
That one's true.
Long story.

360
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,291
Yeah, like, you're Angel, right?

361
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,161
There are whole forums
on you in chat rooms, man.

362
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,888
But who knew you actually,
like, existed?

363
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:09,892
The disappearances?

364
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:14,368
Supposedly there were three
before your girlfriend and one since.

365
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,052
- What do you know?
- Just rumors.

366
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:19,529
They were all science types.
These weren't everyday kidnappings.

367
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:23,772
Hey, maybe I could help you guys.
Be your intern.

368
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:27,962
We're full up on interns,
but the decoder ring's in the mail.

369
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:31,083
They talk about me in the chatty rooms?

370
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:37,251
You really should read
<i>Quantum Cryptography.</i>

371
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,126
Professor Seidel,
the oscillator's tweaked again.

372
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,005
I'll have a look.

373
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,843
Would you write down
your numbers for me?

374
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,050
I don't wanna lose track
of you for another six years.

375
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:53,168
You laugh.
I do have a system.

377
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:13,128
That's just wrong.

SEIDEL: I'll meet you back at 4:00.
I have some pressing...

379
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:39,491
I don't like this, man.
I got a bad feeling. What?

380
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:42,213
Here. The thing all those students
had in common.

381
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,612
Oliver Seidel.

382
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:47,887
As in, the guy she's with right now.

383
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,447
Fred, there's something we
gotta tell you. The portal...

384
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:53,046
It was Professor Seidel.

385
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:54,522
Yeah.

386
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,971
And he's done it before.

387
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:00,007
- That's right. There are others.
FRED: No.

388
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:02,485
To me.

389
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,326
He's the son of a bitch
that sent me to Pylea.

390
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,292
What?

391
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,729
- We're gonna get this guy.
- Count on it. He's gonna pay.

392
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,566
No.

393
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:15,443
He's gonna die.

394
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,170
What do you mean, die?

395
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:26,412
I don't know yet.
But it's gonna be about pain.

396
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,566
The halberd could work.

Would that take long?

400

Not that you should do it at all.

401

Ever.

402
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:48,891
He's a killer, and he's just
sitting there, smiling...

403
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:52,045
...telling me I'm so gifted
and how he wants to teach me.

404
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:56,092
- Oh, there's gonna be a lesson, all right.
- All right, Fred, let's calm down.

405
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:58,523
I idolized him, and he sent me to hell.

406
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,332
Me and God knows how many
others who didn't make it back.

407
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,768
So sure, I'll calm down.
When he's dead.

408
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,248
A few years ago I would've
done in the guy myself.

409
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,369
But this? It isn't what we do.

410
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,605
- We kill monsters every day.
- We help people.

411
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,367
Fred, if you do this, the demons
you'll be living with...

412
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:17,570
...won't be the horned kind.
They'll be the kind you can't get rid of.

413
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,172
- You're wrong.
- He's right.

compared to how it'd be afterward.

...but don't let him be defining
what you are now.

No, thanks. I'm just...

...gonna go lay down
for a few days.

424
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:04,083

her mind because vengeance...

Professor Seidel is capable of.

He opened that portal
right in front of them.

434
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,562

That's why I came to you.

509
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,326
...much less where I belong
or who with.

510
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,611
There's a picture over there when you
were a baby, it's only eight months old.

511
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:58,726
There's a lot I need to figure out.

512
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:01,166
I'm sorry.

513
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,611
- So I'm gonna...
- You're going back to him.

514
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,161
Aren't you?

515
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:17,124
I just need some time to think, okay?

516
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,764
Oh, man.

517
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,686
What the...?

518
00:35:47,013 --> 00:35:48,162
Stay right there.

519
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,646
Winifred.

520
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,847
Fred, please...

521
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,527
...let's talk about this.
- Talk?

522
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:01,130
Sure, let's talk.
Because you gave me the chance to...

523
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,490
Oh, wait. No, you didn't.

524
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:08,565
- Oh, well, no talking.
- Fred, I know you.

525
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:11,009
You're not capable of hurting anyone.

526
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:13,807
You don't know me.
Not anymore.

527
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:18,330
Five years of pain in a hell dimension will
make a girl capable of a lot of things.

528
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,210
Come on.
I'm holding your head.

[ROARS]

530
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,561
It's funny thinking how threatened you
were by me when I was a grad student.

531
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,729
That's why you sent me
and the others away.

532
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,571
You couldn't handle the competition.

533
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,088
- Fred.
- And that's why Laurie's still around.

534
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:49,483
She's not smart enough
to overshadow you, is she?

535
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,008
Not like me. I'm special.

536
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:55,370
Special on a Pylean platter
with a side of you-make-me-sick!

537
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,569
- Why don't you just let me...
- Go?

538
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:00,008
Well, since you asked so nicely, sure.

539
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:03,292
I've even practiced a goodbye speech.

- Go away, Charles!

542
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:15,808
You asked me not to kill him,
and I'm not.

543
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:17,804
- Not exactly.
CHARLES: Sure you are.

544
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:19,651
No way he can survive that!

545
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,329
Fred, don't let him do this to you!

546
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:27,611
How dare you? You don't know!
You don't know what it was like!

547
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:31,286
Please help me!

548
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,126
I promise we'll stop him.
We'll find some other way.

549
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,450
Fred! Winifred, please, help me!

550
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:41,929
Don't you see? He'll never stop.
He'll do it again!

551
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,363
If you kill him, I'm gonna lose you.

552
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:47,889
Help me! Help me!

00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:52,208

555
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,444
What happened to the professor?

556
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,851
It's taken care of.

557
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:30,052
Sucked into his own portal.

558
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,522
Wish I could have seen his face.

00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:36,332
Yeah. I'm gonna...

Good night.

00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,482
Good night.

563
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,007
Hi.

564
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:57,482
Cordelia.

565
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,412
Can we...?

566
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:19,566
- You should have someone look at that.
- It'll be okay.

567
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:23,050
Run-in with a Voynok demon.
Turns out they have nine lives.

568
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:26,922
- Like a cat?
- Only less standoffish.

569
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:31,170
We were friends.

570
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:32,768
I know that.

571
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:38,323
Not just from the pictures, but...

572
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,926
And I know that's why you lied before.
To protect me.

573
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:49,771
Well, l... I staked a vamp today.

574
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:52,686
- Connor took you...?
- And what I realized is...

575
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,847
...whoever I was before...

576
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,205
...I'm still her.

577
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:03,246
She didn't need protecting,
and neither do I.

578
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,444
So no more lies.

579
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:08,846
No more lies.

580
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:11,332
Good.

581
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:15,487
Because there's something
I need to know.

00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,971
