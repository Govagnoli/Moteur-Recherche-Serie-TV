1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,799
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,690
- Show the cleavage.
- Got it.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,360
I've been put in charge.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,580
What do we do, Wesley?

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,939
Last night I lost one of my crew.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,550
- Should've been there.
- How soon can we go?

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,160
Cordy's been sucked into Pylea.

8
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,809
We're going in after her.

9
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,039
The metaphysical laws
don't seem to apply here.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,410
- Cordelia?
- They made me ruler.

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,379
- Your Majesty.
- The Groosalugg.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,369
- Krevlornswath?
- My mother.

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,270
Strike quickly and true.
Then we can eat.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,939
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,920
Put their heads on sticks and display
them outside the princess' window.

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,490
You will do what we say.

17
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,119
Oh, no.

18
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,439
Oh, God, please forgive me.
This is all my fault.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,849
Because I pardoned you,
and they wanted to teach me a lesson.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,099
You didn't do anything wrong.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,590
You didn't do anything.

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,620
I don't like it here anymore.
I just want to go home.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,189
Oh, honey, I'm right there with you.

24
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,889
I know this is a bit of a shock,
but I can explain. Take it easy.

25
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,789
Get it out of your system.
That's good.

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,930
You'll have to breathe sometime.
Shut up!

27
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,500
I don't have hands to cover my ears.

28
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,580
- You're....
- So just please listen.

29
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,830
My people, the fun-loving
Deathwok Clan...

30
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,710
...cut off our heads, we go on
until you mutilate our bodies.

31
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,050
They haven't gotten that far.
Backlog in the mutilation chamber.

32
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,199
So if we move quickly and quietly....

33
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,469
Princess, are you troubled?
We heard shrieking.

34
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,479
Oh, the shrieking.

35
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,729
It's the meditation
I do to help me focus...

36
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,039
...on the great affairs of state
that I must manage.

37
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,090
Remove the head from
our lady's presence.

38
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,250
No, no, no, no!.

39
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,870
I like the filthy head.

40
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,500
That is....
I want to defile it more.

41
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,780
I'll keep it to spit upon,
and when I grow tired of that...

42
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,310
...I will make it a planter.

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,189
A traitor planter, for all to see.

44
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,060
Or maybe a candy dish.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,069
- You may leave.
- As you wish, noble mistress.

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm sorry about the spittle.
I just had to think fast.

47
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,919
This is unsettling for me.

48
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,530
I'm sure it must be.
And after all, I only lost my head!

49
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,490
Technically, my body.

50
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,379
I know this is a trying experience...

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,389
...but I don't see how yelling at me
can help matters.

52
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,289
Take me to the mutilation chamber.

53
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,419
I have no idea where
the mutilation chamber might be.

54
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,370
I'll sit here and die, then.
Find someone who knows!

55
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,669
In what temper did you find her?

56
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,319
- She appeared distressed, master.
- Good.

57
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,279
We'll add more heads,
so she'll remember...

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,139
...who's the master
and who's the servant.

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,579
Her two friends who escaped,
send a hunting party after them.

60
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,540
- Yes, lord.
- The one they call Angel, what is he?

61
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,290
He took apart two of my soldiers.

62
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,899
He is a Van-tal. A drinker of blood.

63
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,959
He can only be killed by fire,
decapitation or wood through the heart.

64
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,769
Perhaps all three, just to be sure.
Hunt him down.

65
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,649
It shall be done.
I will bury my spear in his rump.

66
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,240
Captain, his heart is
where a cow's is. Here.

67
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,040
Disgusting.

68
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,829
This Angel beast has saved a slave
her rightful beheading.

69
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,589
He ignores our laws
and profanes our culture.

70
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,029
He does worse. He brings hope to
the cows, for if one can be free...

71
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,420
...hope arises that all can be free.

72
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't that right, Markallo?

73
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,649
My lord, as it was ordained,
our lives belong to you.

74
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:22,709
They do. Yet we live in a time
where runaways become rebels.

75
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:26,560
Where portals open to worlds where
the clergy have not decreed them.

76
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,740
Even slaves supposedly loyal to me...

77
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,779
...give the enemy drawings
to our sacred devices.

78
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:36,579
- It is not true, master.
- Don't be alarmed, Markallo.

79
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,779
You did me a favor. The cows need
to know what we can do to them...

80
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,959
...any time we choose.

81
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,040
Please clean that up.

82
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:59,100
"And if one of thy slaves offend thee,
thou shalt smite him down.

83
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,730
And if all of thy slaves offend thee,
thou shalt smite them down...

84
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,319
...even unto the very last one."

85
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,970
For the crime of collaboration
you are sentenced to death.

86
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,639
We're not collaborators.
We're not even from around here.

87
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,410
On my count of three.

88
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,300
- I should've been quiet.
- I got a plan.

89
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,100
- Thank God. What is it?
- One.

90
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,279
We die painfully, you go to hell
and I spend eternity with Jesus.

91
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,410
Two.

92
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,000
Three.

93
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,759
Imperial Guards!

94
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,250
This is our chance to escape!

95
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,290
There they are!
Kill the otherworlders!

96
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,250
I've had about enough of this world.

97
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,240
I found kalla berries.
They sweeten the oatmeal.

98
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, I call it oatmeal. It's actually
Crug grains and thistles...

99
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,149
...but with enough Kalla berries....

100
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,250
I hope the skins are comfortable.

101
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,240
I seem to remember beds.
You could sleep for hours at a time.

102
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,189
I slept. It was fine.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,610
What?

104
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,279
Did I snore?

105
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,649
I don't remember any snoring.

106
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:00,949
Good.

107
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,370
I remember caterwauling.

108
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:06,560
Sorry.

109
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,439
I don't mind. Sometimes it
just burbles up inside you...

110
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,120
...and you have to bellow a little.

111
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,810
Do it all the time.
No one's around to hear.

112
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,870
You'll get better
with a little rest and care.

113
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,709
- I don't think so.
- Why wouldn't you?

114
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,149
You saw what I turned into.

115
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,500
Back in L.A. it's bad,
but here it's....

116
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,909
We all got our demons.

117
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,659
Okay, so maybe you got a beast in you.

118
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,600
I know what it's like to be squirrelly
and a freak, with no one to--

119
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,299
Does it taste like oatmeal? I forget
how things are supposed to taste.

120
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,419
- Tastes good.
- Tacos!

121
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,769
Sorry. I didn't mean to holler at you.
I love tacos.

122
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,769
- Do they still have them back....
- Home? They didn't outlaw tacos.

123
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,320
No, of course not.

124
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm trying to make
an enchilada out of treebark.

125
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:22,899
Bark enchiladas.

126
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,830
How's that going?

127
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,480
There's work to be done.

128
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,250
Come in!

129
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,340
What may thy lowly servant
do for thee?

130
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,549
You're not lowly. Get up.
You're just like me.

131
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,700
Like you?
The Light That Shines Upon the Land?

132
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,080
Sure.

133
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,950
Is that what they really call me?

134
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,269
Anyway, you have served me
long and loyally...

135
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,429
...these last two-and-a-half days.

136
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,649
- I'm very fond of you, Lamara.
- Marelda.

137
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,509
- I knew that.
- Of course. You know all.

138
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,129
You must cut my tongue.

139
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,659
No cutting. What is it
with you people and mutilation?

140
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,419
- We don't have a lot of entertainment.
- Can you keep a secret, Geraldo?

141
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,840
Take me to the mutilation chamber.

142
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,700
- This cannot be done.
- Why not?

143
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,919
You would bring shame to the kingdom.

144
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,009
You cannot defile your holy self
by entering such a place.

145
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,820
Okay. Take off your clothes.

146
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,159
Can't do this in L.A.

147
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,669
- Why not?
- I'll burst into flames.

148
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,240
Part of the beast thing.

149
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,309
So it's better for you here.

150
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,039
Well, there's the sun.

151
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:02,309
Also the thing inside that
wants to rip my friends apart.

152
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,679
Krv Drpglr.

153
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,070
I know these words.
They open up the portals.

154
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,570
They're consonant representations...

155
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,909
...of a mathematical
transfiguration formula.

156
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,720
Obviously.

157
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:33,720
I thought if you said them out loud
in order the quaking would....

158
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,029
You mean opening a portal.

159
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,990
It's how we got here
and how we'll get back.

160
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,870
No. I tried for years and years...

161
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,980
...until my tongue was swollen.

162
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,590
- It doesn't work on this side.
- It does.

163
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,960
A Drokken and a green warrior got
to L.A. from this end.

164
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,000
Someone opened up the portals. Maybe
you did, you just don't know where.

165
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,870
Me? I don't think so.
The priests have all the power here.

166
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,139
I can't change. I won't change.

167
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,289
Missed the heart, did I?

168
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,700
Don't die! Please don't die!
Please don't die!

169
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,350
- They came for you. Why?
- They know we'll rescue the princess.

170
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,539
- From what?
- Mating with the Groosalugg.

171
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,210
It will fulfill their prophecies
and consolidate their power.

172
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,700
We don't want that to happen
any more than you do.

173
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,879
You're right, we're on the same side.
Release them.

174
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,830
Though their hands were tied and their
necks were bared, they fought with us.

175
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,629
I'm ashamed.
We nearly cut your heads off.

176
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,940
You were just doing your job.

177
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,450
You are free to go.

178
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,690
Five cheers for the otherworlders!

179
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,149
Brave warriors! Brave warriors!
Brave warriors!

180
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,139
- In this world you get five.
- First we find Angel.

181
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:55,460
Last time he had a "Rip out your guts
now, ask questions later" look.

182
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,049
What do you suggest?

183
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,590
These guys got a cause worth
fighting for. Isn't that what we do?

184
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:05,000
And Cordelia?

185
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,590
To get her out of that castle,
we'll need a lot of muscle.

186
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,019
Muscle could be handy
if we have to incapacitate Angel.

187
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,970
Also, look at them.
They're no match for the Covenant.

188
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,980
I don't want to leave them
to be killed.

189
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,500
I do that enough.

190
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,080
There you are. Good.

191
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,600
Hi.

192
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,919
- You heal fast.
- One of the pluses of being a beast.

193
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:42,759
But you're not. When you were fighting
this time, you didn't change.

194
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,940
- I was afraid.
- Of what?

195
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,960
That if I did, I'd never get back.

196
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,779
You're not a beast.

197
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,629
We'll write that on your bones
once he tears you to pieces.

198
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,179
I'll roll him into the Drokken gully
like the others.

199
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,289
Wait. I need to talk him.

200
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,029
Tell me about the princess.

201
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,700
The cow-bitch who brought you
into our world?

202
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:23,059
Call her that again,
I'll remove your face. Slowly.

203
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,779
Once the Groosalugg mates with her,
she'll be put to death.

204
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,440
Like we already did
with that traitor, Krevlornswath.

205
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,039
You killed Lorne?

206
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,470
We cut his head off
and mutilated his body.

207
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,309
I have to go.

208
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,159
- They'll kill you.
- One of my friends is already dead.

209
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,340
But it's safe here.
Out there, it's....

210
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,450
It's safe here with me.

211
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,789
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,299
They'll kill you, and you'll turn into
that beast. Maybe not in that order.

213
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,919
- They're in trouble.
- But the beast.

214
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,929
You don't want them
to see you that way.

215
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not afraid of it
like everyone else.

216
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:20,519
It's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

217
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,820
It's pretty dark in here.

218
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,139
Let me just get used to it.

219
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,980
- Oh, yuck!
- Ow! Hey!

220
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,210
I'm sorry. Sorry.

221
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,769
These people are crazy!
Anything look familiar?

222
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,820
Get me closer.

223
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,330
- Oh, God. Oh, no!
- What?

224
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,309
- That looks like your suit.
- It is my suit.

225
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,240
You think they have French viscose
in this hellhole?

226
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,539
Why am I still alive?
Once they chop me up, it's over.

227
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:07,109
I'm looking at pieces of myself.
Oh, it's over!

228
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,400
Wait. Since when do I have five toes?

229
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,589
Somebody's coming.

230
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,849
- Do you mind if I hit him with you?
- Yes!

231
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,259
- Your Highness?
- Groo, it's you.

232
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,180
I've done something terrible.
I betrayed my vows.

233
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,869
He was your friend.
I can't see you suffer.

234
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,279
What?

235
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,950
I stole his body
and put his garment on these parts.

236
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,420
- To fool them.
- You did all this for me?

237
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,900
That's not terrible,
that's wonderful!

238
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,960
Feels like somebody works out.

239
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,420
Hi. And thank you from the bottom
of my neck on down.

240
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,470
- Where's my body?
- I smuggled it to your mother's farm.

241
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,059
Your cousin Landok will meet us at
the watchtower and take you home.

242
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:02,839
This is great!
The man's an honest-to-God hero.

243
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,740
Watch the head!

244
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,700
- Still want to storm the castle gates?
- Yes.

245
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,400
We can't defeat them.
They have power and wealth.

246
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,259
- Storm the gates.
- If you do, they'll cut you down.

247
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:19,420
You can't wage a frontal attack
against a stronger opponent.

248
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,380
This battle can only be won
through guerilla warfare.

249
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,900
You create a diversion, then you
strike at several points at once.

250
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,119
- Then you come from behind.
- And kill their leader.

251
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,190
Silas, the head priest.
It's a good plan.

252
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,930
I agree.

253
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,259
- You shall lead us.
- Me? No. I was just suggesting--

254
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,549
You fought well.
The Covenant hates you.

255
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,619
And you have a plan.
Besides, our leader's dead.

256
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,259
- Hail to our new leader!
- Hail!

257
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,160
Why do people keep
putting me in charge?

258
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,140
- I have no idea.
- Hail!

259
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,559
How's it feel?

260
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,140
All right.

261
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,839
It's best if you don't
move it for a while.

262
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:08,319
Well, I better....

263
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,910
Help your friends. I know.

264
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,660
You're a good man.

265
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,789
- I don't know how to get there.
- Oh.

266
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,160
I can show you.

267
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,269
I disobeyed the Covenant.

268
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,180
I shall spend eternity burning
in Tarkna for my sin.

269
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,069
Who believes in literal
Tarkna nowadays?

270
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,349
It was worth it for one moment
of your intimate touch.

271
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,880
That was an accident.
It was kind of dark and....

272
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,250
Oh, you mean the hug.

273
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,430
When I hugged you.

274
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,099
That was nice.

275
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,549
Where were we?

276
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,650
Oh, yeah. The nutcake clergy guys
need someone to disobey them.

277
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,150
They're evil
and they run an evil regime.

278
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,049
It's not my duty
to question authority.

279
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,329
You're Groosalugg, the brave,
undefeated champion.

280
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,440
If it's not your duty,
then I don't know what is.

281
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,869
I fight who I am told.

282
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,789
I am not a real champion.

283
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,089
Then it's time you stopped working
for monk-boy and became one.

284
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:50,309
What you did for me and my friend,
that was pure champ, all the way.

285
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,380
I'm unworthy of lifting your burden.

286
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:57,240
Nonsense. You're way worthy.

287
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:01,009
- What burden is that again?
- When you receive me.

288
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:05,240
- On the night we are wed.
- Receive? Oh.

289
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,220
Receive. When I and you,
on the wedding night....

290
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,720
I think there'll be
burden-lifting on both sides.

291
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,079
Not that I have a lot of experience.

292
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,890
It's in the prophecies.
One who's cursed with visions...

293
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,150
...will mate with the Groosalugg,
whose demon blood shall absorb them.

294
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,450
Absorb them?

295
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,849
Your visions shall pass to me.

296
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,500
I knew there was a catch!

297
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,009
You can't take my visions.

298
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,839
I need them. I use them to help
my friends fight evil back home.

299
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,609
And I'll use them here to fight evil,
just as you have done.

300
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,670
Groo, I can't give up my visions.

301
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,009
I like them.

302
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,150
Okay, I don't like the pain and agony
that's steadily getting worse--

303
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,630
You are pure human.

304
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,269
You are not meant to carry
such a burden.

305
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,380
Maybe not.

306
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,410
But I'm not ready
to give them up, either.

307
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,609
They're a part of who I am now.
They're an honor.

308
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,720
And you know, the visions,
they only last for like a--

309
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,240
No, no.

310
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,279
Groosalugg is the most formidable.
We have to get him out of the castle.

311
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,269
If challenged, he must accept?

312
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:53,019
As champion of the realm, he cannot
refuse. But no man can defeat him.

313
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:55,920
We'll worry about that later.
First we get him out.

314
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,099
Then we create diversions here,
here and here.

315
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:02,380
We'll scale the wall here,
where their defenses are weak.

316
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,730
I wouldn't split my crew up that much.

317
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,150
I'm leading this charge.
Tell me about the killing device.

318
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:12,400
It sends a signal
to the collar on every slave.

319
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:15,400
- What kind of a signal?
- Blows their heads off.

320
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,230
Silas will use it.
We have to get to him before he does.

321
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,730
- The castle is well-guarded.
- Unlike this place.

322
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,099
It's all right. It's all right.

323
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,289
He's a friend.

324
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,829
Glad we were keeping watch.

325
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,470
He's Angel. He does that.
How's she do that?

326
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,700
She's Fred. She does that too.

327
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,170
Winifred?
The girl from Cordy's vision?

328
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:40,009
Check the perimeter.

329
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,069
These are my friends. Wesley, Gunn.

330
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,380
Hi.

331
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,680
These-- Those were the rebels.
We've joined forces.

332
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,880
They made Wes their general.

333
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,029
But you're here now.
If you want to, I mean....

334
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,160
- You're much better at--
- No, Wes, I can't.

335
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,190
You know what happens to me.

336
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,819
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:12,119
I'm ashamed for what I did to you.

338
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,759
It's a crazy place here.
The sooner we all get out, the better.

339
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:21,470
Fred can help us.
She knows a lot about the portals.

340
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,380
Not a lot.

341
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:27,990
The trionic speechcraft formulation
has to alter the reality sphere.

342
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,109
Lutzbalm predicted it at Zurich in '89.
Laughed him off the stage.

343
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,859
Although the slavery and degradation's
no laughing matter.

344
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,849
It's no Crug-grain-and-Kalla-berry
breakfast all right.

345
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,119
She's been here a while.

346
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:48,750
Guys, I have some bad news
about the Host.

347
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,039
We've captured this warrior
of the Deathwok Clan!

348
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,319
- Landok.
- Angel the Drokken killer.

349
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,220
I won't battle you for saving
this slave girl's neck.

350
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,240
Good.

351
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:02,410
It is forbidden to fight
while performing a sacred duty.

352
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,859
I was transporting my kinsman home
when these fools stopped me.

353
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:09,440
- They cut off the Host's head.
- What?

354
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,230
- No.
- Yes, I have it right here.

355
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:24,440
- He was....
- Yeah.

356
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,059
That's it? Where's the praising
and extolling of my virtues?

357
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,079
Where's the love?

358
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,599
I'll only say this once.

359
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,220
The guys you send to create
those diversions will die.

360
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,230
Yes, they are.

361
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,740
You try not to get anybody killed,
you wind up getting everybody killed.

362
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,289
Get ready to move out.

363
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,569
What should I do?

364
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,869
Go to the village, call out
the Groosalugg and kill him.

365
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,089
Kill their undefeated champion?

366
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:20,819
- I can't, I'll turn into the beast.
- I know.

367
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,950
When I fired you guys,
the reason I....

368
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,480
The darkness was coming out of me.
I didn't want you near it.

369
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,190
The thing that comes out here
is 10 times worse.

370
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,650
I do this, you know
I won't come back from it.

371
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,529
Yes, you will. I know you.

372
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:49,160
We know you.

373
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,710
We know you're a man with a demon
inside, not the other way around.

374
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,470
You have the strength to do what's
needed, and you'll come back to us.

375
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,410
I could go with you. I know
how to prepare the Challenge Torch.

376
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,670
You'll come back.

377
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,089
You really think he'll come back?

378
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,839
I need him to think it.

379
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,359
What can I get you?

380
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,220
Nothing.

381
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,309
Just don't leave.

382
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,460
Whatever you do, don't fight a big,
ugly, pointy demon with green skin.

383
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,609
I saw what he'll do to you.

384
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,210
Good. I see we're progressing
towards mating. Let's get on with it.

385
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,809
- What about the wedding?
- I tire of waiting. Do it.

386
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,940
With you guys just standing around?
I don't think so.

387
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,960
Then I'll encourage you.

388
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,839
My lord, there's something in
the village you'll want to see.

389
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,900
I challenge the Groosalugg
to mortal combat.

390
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,779
Come out and face me,
you spineless coward!

391
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:40,619
Why'd you add "coward"?
That's really gonna piss him off.

392
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,730
What is it? Who's yelling?

393
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,160
You've been challenged.
You must fight.

394
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,390
What? No! No fighting.
I had a vision. He can't fight.

395
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,829
Our honor is at stake.

396
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,230
- Listen to me!
- Silence!

397
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,880
No, don't do it! Please!
Don't do it, Groo! No!

398
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,539
No! No!

399
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,099
Who calls me out?

400
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,329
- Do you love her?
- More than I thought possible.

401
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,400
If this filth should win...

402
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,019
...he will ravage
and he will defile her.

403
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,789
He will use her
for his pleasure again...

404
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:26,730
...and again.

405
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,539
And when she has
no more screaming in her...

406
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:38,299
...he will kill her.

407
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,529
He will not. He will die!

408
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,440
The Groosalugg has been challenged!

409
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,390
He will fight the challenger
in the village square!

410
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,829
Rebels at the south gate!
And at the north wall!

411
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,650
Death to the state!
Death to the state!

412
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,339
Death to the state!

413
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,640
This guy doesn't feel pain?

414
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,400
He feels it, but he's the Groosalugg.
He overcomes all things.

415
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,349
Good luck.

416
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,099
You will die, barbarian.

417
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,980
You can't hold back. You'll die!

418
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,410
Not holding back, holding on.

419
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,750
- Rebels have reached the castle.
- It's Silas. Stop him!

420
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:24,839
There they are!

421
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,130
There you are.
Please, I had a vision.

422
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,230
The beast is gonna kill him.
You have to stop it.

423
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,660
This is all your fault.

424
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,799
You think you can destroy
our way of life? Think again.

425
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:06,160
I will kill every cow in the world...

426
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,849
...before I'll allow that to happen.

427
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,809
Every one of you.

428
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,650
You would defile her! You animal!

429
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,579
You're a little late.

430
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,329
Stand down.

431
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,349
- You don't have to do this.
- I don't have to, but I'm going to.

432
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,380
And you and your filthy
cow princess can go to--

433
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,769
Your cow princess is tired
of hearing you yak, padre,

434
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,019
- Nice.
- These guys stay dead without a head?

435
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,730
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

436
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,349
We gotta get to the village.
The Groosalugg is facing a beast.

437
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,440
Actually, the beast
he's facing is Angel.

438
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,840
We're not gonna do this.
We're gonna find another way.

439
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,670
I'm not an animal.

440
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,679
- Stop! Stop the fight! Stop!
- All right...

441
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,860
...what part of me being noble
didn't get through?

442
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,300
Stop the fight. Don't hurt him. Stop.

443
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,460
- I love him. I love him.
- You love me?

444
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,349
Not you, dumb-ass.
Him. I love him.

445
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,019
Lay down your weapons!

446
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,550
Silas is dead.
All priests have been defeated.

447
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,590
Any guard who harms a human from this
day forth shall have to answer to me!

448
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,320
- But you love me too, right?
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

449
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,210
- As a friend and coworker.
- We need medical attention!

450
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:02,179
Maybe love is too strong a term.

451
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,210
Good as new. Although I seem
to have put on about 158 pounds.

452
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,429
You look great. Love the trousers.

453
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:18,739
It's been a thrill, Mom.
See you in a millennium.

454
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,309
Isn't there something you want
to say to your mother?

455
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,360
- "May you burn in Tarkna"?
- Come on. She's not that bad.

456
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,769
She didn't put your body on the maggot
pile like you thought she would.

457
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,110
Go.

458
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:34,840
Bye, Mom.

459
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,030
Thanks for storing my body on the lice
pile instead of the maggot heap.

460
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:42,570
I thought you were lost to us forever.

461
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,059
But you came back.

462
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,360
You came back.

463
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:52,130
The runt of my loins came back
after raining misery on our lives...

464
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,420
...and managed to shame us
even further!

465
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,710
All right then, we'll be....

466
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:01,380
Who will do our labor now that
your cow friend has freed the slaves?

467
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,789
Do you know what they call me
at the Hall of Drink and Chance?

468
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:08,480
Mother of the Vile Excrement!

469
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,489
- Keep in touch.
- Go on, misfit!

470
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,699
Back to your world
where no one knows his place!

471
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,989
May you rot in Tarkna!

472
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,699
- Every family's got its problems.
- Numfar, do the dance of shame.

473
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,429
Yours more than most.

474
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:29,820
My friend told me I had to come back.
I didn't believe her.

475
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:32,690
I realized I did have
to come back, because...

476
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,070
...I always thought I had
to come back deep down.

477
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:40,590
I had to find out I didn't have
to come back. I don't belong here.

478
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,889
I hate it here.
You know where I belong?

479
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,710
L.A. You know why?

480
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,829
Nobody belongs there. It's
the perfect place for guys like us.

481
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,880
- Kind of beautiful.
- Ain't it?

482
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,199
- I'm moved, if I say so myself.
- Please do.

483
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,239
- I feel a song coming on.
- I thought you might.

484
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,309
Somewhere over the rainbow

485
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,900
Way up high

486
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,440
I have a vision.

487
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,670
Actually, two visions. In one
of them, you get to keep your head.

488
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,190
- At your service, your majesty.
- Take a memo.

489
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,210
As it is now written,
all citizens are created equal.

490
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,480
Slavery and religious persecution
are outlawed.

491
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:37,699
I think we did it.

492
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,820
I opened portals,
but I couldn't tell where.

493
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,809
You need the priests' formulas
to figure that out.

494
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,079
- So we can go home?
- We take these and she says the words.

495
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,769
Those are sacred books.

496
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,099
Which you should have
as a small memento.

497
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,010
You're in charge now,
and you've got a long road ahead.

498
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:04,230
Slavery has ended,
but reconstruction has just begun.

499
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:09,530
- What is this "reconstruction"?
- Gunn, you want to field this?

500
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,659
It means saying people are free
don't make them free.

501
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,800
You got races that hate each other.

502
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,610
Some getting work they don't want,
others losing the little they had.

503
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:26,219
You're looking at social confusion,
economic depression and maybe riots.

504
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,579
Good luck.

505
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,199
You'll do fine.

506
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:37,940
It worries me, but not as much as....

507
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:44,230
Do you have to go, majesty?

508
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:46,449
I don't want to.

509
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm really gonna miss your eyes.
And the majesty thing.

510
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:57,739
But I have a job to do back home.

511
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,659
It was really fun being your princess.

512
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,380
Godspeed, princess.

513
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,030
Bye, Groo.

514
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,449
Your majesty.

515
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,150
Your majesty.

516
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,309
- Should people bow in a free society?
- These things take time.

517
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,599
I've been thinking about remodeling
the bar. Who wants a nightcap?

518
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,099
Are you sure?

519
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,110
Trust me. Tacos everywhere.
And soap.

520
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,309
That portal-jumping is fun.
We can sell it to a theme park.

521
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,269
- Can I say it? I want to say it.
- Say what?

522
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,510
There's no place like--

523
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:45,679
Willow?

524
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,550
What's--?

525
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,179
It's Buffy.
