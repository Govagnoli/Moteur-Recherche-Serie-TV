1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,870
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,780
Who is he? He's magnificent.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,990
I could show you things
you've never seen.

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,570
We were together 150 years.
We shared everything.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,150
- It's Holtz.
- A vampire hunter.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,870
How does he keep finding us?
We have a message for your husband.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,410
- You remember Caroline.
- Hardy screamer.

8
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,870
It'll be 200 years
before you find Angelus.

9
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,480
I want your word
you will show no mercy.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,059
That's her. Darla. She's back.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,719
God doesn't want you, but I still do.

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,829
- You still have a soul.
- Get out.

13
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,979
- It's impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,990
- You're carrying a boy.
- Great.

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,899
No one knows how Darla's pregnant.

16
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,979
Prophecies mention a Tro-Clon
bringing the ruination of mankind.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,350
But the scroll is missing.

18
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,399
Her water's broken.

19
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,689
Get this baby
before anybody finds out.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,500
I don't care who that man is.
Take him out now.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,789
Angelus. I've been looking for you.

22
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,569
Holtz.

23
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,000
My God.

24
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,049
You have no god, demon.

25
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:16,359
The Tro-Clon.

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,459
The prophecy. "Raised up
from darkness to bring darkness."

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,579
It's you.
Holtz, whatever brought you here--

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,780
You did.

29
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,959
You and your demon bitch.

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,950
For 200 years I slept.

31
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,170
For 200 years I dreamt of nothing,
but this moment.

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,849
Which would explain
why you look so well-rested.

33
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,609
You haven't changed.

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,370
Actually, I have. While you
were sleeping, a lot changed.

35
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,359
Really?

36
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,909
- Somehow things seem the same to me.
- You're wrong.

37
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,759
I will have justice.

38
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,469
No. I don't think you will. There's no
justice for the things I did to you.

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,879
You didn't do them to me.

40
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,479
And you didn't do them alone.

41
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,740
Find the female.
If he's here, Darla can't be far.

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,159
Or are you going to tell me
that's changed too?

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,159
- She's gonna pop right here.
- The contractions are more frequent.

44
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,610
You think?

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,120
Angel not back with the scrolls?
The prophecies would guide us.

46
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,340
Women have given birth
without them for years.

47
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,539
We could really use Vaseline
and a catcher's mitt.

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,530
She's not ready to deliver, but she's
moved into the active stage of labor.

49
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,800
We can't stay. It's too exposed.

50
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,340
- He should have been back.
- Something happened.

51
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,800
It's up to us to protect
his unborn child.

52
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:26,400
Darla, we're taking you out of here.
Relax. Try to breathe, like this:

53
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,659
I don't...

54
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,419
...breathe!

55
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,560
Papa?

56
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,560
Papa.

57
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,879
Sarah?

58
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,180
Sarah.

59
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,399
- Sarah.
- Mommy won't wake up.

60
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,990
Quiet now.

61
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,579
- Captain--
- Don't come in here.

62
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,699
- Sweet Jesus.
- Get out!

63
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,550
We have no idea who he is.
We ran the surveillance tapes...

64
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,310
...through face and voice recognition.
He's not in the system.

65
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,329
- A new player.
- Or an old one.

66
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,189
- Go.
- He addressed Angel as Angelus.

67
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,240
That suggests personal history.

68
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,350
- An old friend.
- Not likely. Angelus had no friends.

69
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,439
- The status of our surveillance?
- We're working on it.

70
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,620
You hear from Cmdr. Burke
or Dr. Fetvanovich?

71
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,470
Units were deployed in Angel's hotel,
but that's all we know.

72
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,600
Actually, that's all you know.

73
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,569
- I, on the other hand, know nothing.
- Sir?

74
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,470
I could never have been involved...

75
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,860
...in such an ill-conceived
and, in the end, botched operation.

76
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,839
- Because you were never here.
- Correct.

77
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,899
- But we were.
- You were.

78
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,930
I'll expect a full report
at Thursday's staff meeting.

79
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:54,970
When I hear about this for the first
time, I will be shocked and appalled.

80
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,519
Good night.

81
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,670
He's gonna crucify us.

82
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,250
They don't crucify here.
It's too Christian.

83
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,980
You're still human.
How'd you manage this?

84
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,089
So the question becomes:

85
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,740
Now that I have you,
what's the best way to get her?

86
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,660
- Only dark magics could bring you.
- She was the trick, not you.

87
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:30,620
- Darla was the unpredictable one.
- Was it a demon or something else?

88
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,940
What if I just kill you now?
Would she somehow sense it?

89
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,000
Would that bring her bursting in
through those doors?

90
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,509
Did something come to you
or did you seek it?

91
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,990
She might show herself
in the service of revenge.

92
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,309
- It can be a powerful motivator.
- Yes, it can.

93
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,940
What'd you have to give up
for this second chance?

94
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:00,690
Give up? I had nothing to give up.

95
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,789
You saw to that.

96
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,659
We took a lot from you, that's true.
But we didn't get everything.

97
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,620
- We couldn't take your soul.
- What do you know of a soul?

98
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,409
I know yours will be destroyed...

99
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,529
...if you allow yourself to be used
in the service of evil.

100
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,440
You're a good man, Holtz.
A righteous man.

101
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:31,120
And you're being used
for some purpose other than justice.

102
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,110
Could it be you really have changed?

103
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,870
I don't remember you ever
pleading so cravenly before.

104
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,120
And I remember you used
to work with men.

105
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,779
Smack him again.

106
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,730
That hurts.

107
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,899
Well, you know what they say,
birth, painful.

108
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:06,269
Generally for mothers, not bystanders.
How long have I been out?

109
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,789
Not long. But we seem
to be between contractions now.

110
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,250
- Yeah, she's been doing that.
- Hormones.

111
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,559
Come on, then. Darla,
do you feel well enough to travel?

112
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,649
Good.

113
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,490
Doesn't anyone want
to sit back here with me?

114
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,279
- We're good.
- Yeah, it's comfy.

115
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:43,080
I promise I won't throw anyone out
of the car. Not while it's moving.

116
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,879
It's not that we don't trust you.
I mean, we don't trust you.

117
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,399
But the fact is, your water
broke all over the back seat.

118
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,870
What? What are you waiting for?

119
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,539
- I presume we have a tire iron.
- Yeah, why? We got a flat?

120
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,200
And how about a hurling ax
or some sort of heavy mallet?

121
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,279
Also, a shotgun wouldn't be
a terrible thing at this juncture.

122
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:31,210
Are you still concerned about my soul,
Angelus, my vampire priest?

123
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,970
Excuse me.

124
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,100
You've got her? Good.
Bring her in.

125
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,610
Lilah.

126
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,289
This isn't her.

127
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,059
- She isn't even a vampire.
- No, I'm an attorney.

128
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,330
Let me guess. Dead guys all over
my floor.... Friends of yours?

129
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,740
If I knew you were torturing him,
I wouldn't have interrupted.

130
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,620
- I'll wait until you're finished.
- He'll be dead by then.

131
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,090
- Really?
- You say you're an attorney.

132
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,019
You deal in man's laws.
I deal in God's.

133
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,159
Ah, right. A good guy.

134
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,019
Do you know what he is?

135
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,649
Vampire cursed by gypsies
who restored his soul...

136
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,809
...destined to atone for centuries
of evil, wacky sidekicks.

137
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,750
I'd have him killed myself, except
my employers have this "policy."

138
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,129
- What does she mean, cursed by gypsies?
- Long story, Holtz.

139
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,330
I'll leave for 20 seconds.
That should give you enough time.

140
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,440
I'll find people to clean this mess.
I've got an early meeting.

141
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,179
- I can't allow you to leave.
- What do you mean? Sure, you can.

142
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,690
You said you worked for the law.

143
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,179
No, I didn't. I said I'm a lawyer.
I don't care about the law.

144
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,899
- Lilah?
- What?

145
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,090
Duck.

146
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,539
Search the grounds!

147
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:31,850
The men you sent
to kill Angelus were brave.

148
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,110
- Good.
- They fought to the last.

149
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,809
I get that.

150
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,940
Send more, I'll do the same.
No one will have him but me.

151
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,879
They weren't sent for Angel.
This was meant for his girlfriend.

152
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,570
- You know of Darla?
- Sure.

153
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:54,789
Tell me, these gypsies,
did they curse her as well?

154
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,360
- Has she too been re-ensouled?
- Darla? No. She's free-range evil.

155
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,899
If you do catch up with her,
we can do some business.

156
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,169
My only business with Darla is to send
her back to the hell that made her.

157
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,879
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

158
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,450
Harvey? It's Lilah.
I got a job for you.

159
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,769
Angel Investigations.
Yeah. Full cleaner service.

160
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,600
Thanks.

161
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,149
- Keep them away from the car!
- Don't let them get behind you!

162
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,799
Charles!

163
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,559
Thanks.

164
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,190
What are we looking at?

165
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,139
- Holtz?
- Yeah.

166
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,659
- Who hunted you through--
- The late 1700s.

167
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,039
- It wasn't his great-great-grandson?
- No, it was him.

168
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,250
Maybe he's the one
to rain down ruination.

169
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,590
The prophecies said the Tro-Clon
would be a confluence of events.

170
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,090
And an 18th-century
vampire hunter appearing...

171
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,629
...in the 21st century
seems con-fluey.

172
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,240
- He's here for the baby?
- He doesn't know about it.

173
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,889
He wouldn't have to. That's the tragic
beauty of a cosmic convergence.

174
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,789
He just plays his own small part.

175
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,950
He's looking for Angel and Darla
and finds Angel's unborn child...

176
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,960
...who wasn't evil as we feared...

177
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,059
...but was meant
to be some messianic figure.

178
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:29,240
But Holtz kills it and his vengeance
somehow triggers the end of the world.

179
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,500
Or not. It could go either way.

180
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,080
Have you thought of a name yet?

181
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,620
We must find Darla before Holtz does.

182
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,950
- I'll find her faster alone.
- Of course.

183
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,330
Find a safe place for her
to have this baby.

184
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,950
We can do that.

185
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,179
Hey. Be careful.

186
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,440
Angel, the scrolls.
You didn't manage to...?

187
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,360
No.

188
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,039
I'm sure we'll be fine without them.

189
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:05,039
Nyazian.

190
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,539
Exquisite. I recognize
the Ga-Shundi cross-text.

191
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,569
Quite a find.
Do you know what this is worth?

192
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,509
Hopefully enough to cover my ass.
These notes should speed things up.

193
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,730
Another translator worked on this.
I don't recognize the handwriting.

194
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,420
- The idiom indicates an Englishman.
- I don't know. I don't remember.

195
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,670
It wasn't that worm Forsche
in Ancient Symbols and Icons, was it?

196
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,049
- It was somebody else.
- He's only got that one eye.

197
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,339
Don't worry about it.
Outside contractors.

198
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,160
I highlighted the part
they concentrated on.

199
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,390
- You highlighted an ancient scroll?
- In yellow.

200
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,609
Can you translate it?

201
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:57,329
With sacred prophecies, it's more
an interpretation than a translation.

202
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,509
I'm just looking for the gist.
What does it say?

203
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,740
Let's see.

204
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,859
"Bring forth...

205
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,450
...appear...born."
Something about a birth.

206
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,559
- What about the birth?
- It's unclear.

207
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,099
Make it clear.

208
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:19,029
- Well, this should be fun.
- No, it shouldn't be fun.

209
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:24,609
What it should be is done by morning.
Or I'll have your family killed.

210
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,109
You knew. You knew,
and you didn't tell me.

211
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,829
So I left out one teeny-weeny detail.
Didn't seem all that important.

212
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,299
Not important? Angelus with a soul?

213
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,390
- It doesn't mean anything.
- It means everything.

214
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,359
See? This is why I didn't mention it.

215
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,079
So Angel has a soul. Big whoop.
So did Attila the Hun.

216
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,619
And a big heart
when it came to gift-giving.

217
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,099
He's still a vampire.
Angel, not Attila.

218
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,779
- He's not the same.
- Of course he is.

219
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,490
His hair's shorter, spikier. He's
using product. But it's the same guy.

220
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:10,029
No, he's changed. He's different.

221
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,109
I don't know what moral mind games
you've been torturing yourself with.

222
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,769
But don't let his soul get in the way
of what you swore to do.

223
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,950
- "Get in the way"?
- That's what this is about.

224
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:29,759
Angel has a soul. Now you're wondering
if things are murkier, ethically.

225
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,029
"Things"...

226
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,069
...have never been clearer.

227
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,369
Releasing his soul
to suffer for all eternity...

228
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,859
...only makes his destruction
more just. More fitting.

229
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,750
- Then what's the problem?
- You have me hunting the wrong prey.

230
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,519
Ah, right. Because an Angel
with a soul...

231
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,970
...is a slightly different challenge
than an Angel without a soul.

232
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,480
- I must know everything.
- Right. No, got you. My mistake.

233
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,309
You've kept nothing else
from me, then?

234
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,490
No. Nothing I can think of.

235
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,000
You always did love a view.

236
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,039
Look at it. Listen to it.

237
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,480
Can you smell it?
This world, this horrible world.

238
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,670
Why would anyone want
to bring a baby into it?

239
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,910
To make it better maybe?

240
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,309
Or to destroy it finally.

241
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,710
Why does everyone insist on planning
my son's future before he's born?

242
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,769
All right then, how's this?
It doesn't have a future.

243
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,769
- Darla--
- Not with me.

244
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,289
Darla.

245
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,410
- I can't have this baby.
- What?

246
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:02,789
- I can't let it out.
- Not sure you have a lot of choice.

247
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,099
I know it wants to come out.
I can feel it. It's ready.

248
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,759
I can't let it.
I can't let it because....

249
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,160
Because....

250
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,319
You love it.

251
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:23,220
Completely. I love it completely.

252
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,200
I've never loved anything as much
as this life inside of me.

253
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,950
Well, you've never loved
anything, Darla.

254
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,069
That's true.
Four hundred years, and I never did.

255
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,799
Until now.

256
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,529
I don't know what to do.

257
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,869
Well, you'll do the only thing
that you can do.

258
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,710
- You'll have it. You'll have it and--
- What? We'll raise it?

259
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,960
- Why not?
- It's impossible.

260
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,769
This whole thing is impossible,
but it's happening.

261
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,859
What do I have to offer a child,
a human child, besides ugly death?

262
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,210
- Darla.
- You know it's true.

263
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,279
I know you love our baby.

264
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,230
You bonded with it.
You spent nine months nourishing it--

265
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:21,849
I haven't been nourishing it.
I haven't given it a thing.

266
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm dead. It's been nourishing me.

267
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,970
These feelings I'm having aren't mine.
They're coming from it.

268
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,740
- You don't know that.
- Of course I do. We both do.

269
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,539
I don't have a soul. It does.

270
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,130
Right now, that soul is inside of me,
but soon it won't be and then...

271
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,049
- Darla.
- ...I won't be able to love it.

272
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:52,549
I won't even be able to remember that
I loved it, and I want to remember.

273
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,990
She wants to have it here?
This is a terrible idea.

274
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,220
Can't you see I'm getting ready
for a grand reopening?

275
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,440
Gorsh entrails
next to the maraschinos.

276
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,039
I can't have a baby here.
I just had the booths Simonized.

277
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,990
Lorne, should we tell Angel and Darla
they're not welcome?

278
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,190
Of course not. Caritas will
always be a sanctuary.

279
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:27,990
That is, if some people ever finish
the work they promised to do.

280
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:29,589
How's the job coming?

281
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,599
- We'll finish by your opening tomorrow.
- New security system?

282
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,940
Routes the new spells to prevent
both human and demon violence...

283
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,519
...creating a carnage-free Caritas.

284
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,490
But balancing that interspecies flux
is trickier than I expected.

285
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:49,769
That's not the only tricky thing here.
You hum as you work.

286
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,700
- Yeah, so?
- So? I just read you, buster.

287
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,150
- What are you leaving unconnected?
- You questioning my work?

288
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:01,690
- No, I'm firing you. Get out. Out.
- I'm union. Gotta pay me for the day.

289
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,420
Out. I'll finish this myself.
How hard could this be?

290
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:13,029
You won't let me hurt it, will you?

291
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,960
You'll protect it, right?
From me, I mean?

292
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,589
- Yeah.
- We've found a place.

293
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,279
Is it safe?

294
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,049
By the time you get here
it'll be safe as houses.

295
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,049
Okay, try that.

296
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,339
Nope, still not working.

297
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,670
Okay. Try it now.

298
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,799
No.

299
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,509
Hey. Darla.

300
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,730
We should get going.
I can feel a storm coming.

301
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:03,809
You okay? Another contraction?

302
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,329
No, it's something else.

303
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,460
- You've got something?
- Yes, I believe I do.

304
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,400
I must say, whoever you had working
on this before was very close.

305
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,069
- These notes were helpful.
- Great. What does it say?

306
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,220
He had trouble here with the tense.
Ga-Shundi tenses are tricky buggers.

307
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:32,859
I'm riveted.
What does it say about the birth?

308
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:37,480
- Actually, it's funny. It doesn't.
- What do you mean? You said it did.

309
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,000
- I did.
- But it doesn't?

310
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,569
- In a way.
- I have a gun.

311
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:46,910
The prophecy is not so much a birth
announcement as it is an obituary.

312
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,789
- Obituary?
- Yes.

313
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,849
The prophet is telling us
there will be no birth.

314
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,460
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

315
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,059
"For surely in that time
when the sky opens...

316
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,279
...and the heavens weep,
there will be no birth. Only death."

317
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,990
- Only death?
- Just death.

318
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,420
Just death.

319
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,279
Captain?

320
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,250
Captain, we beg you.
Let us take you out of this place.

321
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,089
- It is the devil's work.
- Not the devil.

322
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,220
Just a demon.

323
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,859
What are we going to do?

324
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,240
Whatever we have to.

325
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:12,119
Papa, no, please! Please!

326
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,710
No, Papa. Papa, don't! Let me go!

327
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,880
No, Papa, no! Don't! Don't! Don't!

328
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,930
No! No! No!

329
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,460
Okay. I'm convinced
I got it that time.

330
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,680
Let me see that.

331
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,099
Just a few more steps,
that's it. Okay. All right.

332
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,509
Guys, a chair, a chair.

333
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,819
Jeez, what happened?

334
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,720
Thanks.

335
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,250
You're welcome.

336
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,990
You gave us quite a scare.

337
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:17,470
But I guess you're used to that,
what with being a scary thing and all.

338
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:23,250
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what got into me.

339
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,750
She's in a lot of pain.

340
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,700
- How frequent are the contractions?
- It's been an hour.

341
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,660
She was well into
the active stage of labor.

342
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,559
- She just stopped having them.
- But the pain she's experiencing.

343
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:43,730
- She's experiencing something else.
- That's worrying.

344
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,160
- Angel.
- Darla?

345
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,069
- Angel.
- Let's get her to my bedroom.

346
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,849
Easy, now.
We'll get you right in here.

347
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,700
It's time to get to work.

348
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,740
You found him, then?

349
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,019
- Tell him.
- Don't forget what we discussed.

350
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,890
You'll get your money.

351
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,430
I got mouths to feed. Plus a family.
Some of them have mouths too.

352
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,829
Just tell him what you heard!

353
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,950
Lorne, should we
tell Angel and Darla they're not welcome?

354
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:26,890
Of course not.
Caritas will always be a sanctuary.

355
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,849
- She okay?
- She's tough as nails.

356
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,369
And immortal, so that's
in her favor, healthwise.

357
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,809
How about the baby?

358
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,980
What? What is it?

359
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,750
I think you need to prepare
yourself for the worst.

360
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,670
- No.
- The baby's heartbeat is very faint.

361
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,480
What do we do?

362
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,740
I'm not sure we can do anything.
Her body isn't a life-giving vessel.

363
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,970
I don't know that it's equipped
to bring a baby to term.

364
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,519
So, what are you saying?
Just let it die?

365
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,420
- What about a C-section?
- Normally that's what we'd do.

366
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,940
But the mystical force that's been
protecting the pregnancy--

367
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,529
- Is gonna end up killing it.
- That's my fear.

368
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,750
This doesn't make any sense.
This whole thing is a miracle, right?

369
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,789
You don't just get
half a miracle, do you?

370
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,990
The Powers brought her this far
and protected the baby all this time.

371
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,089
We don't know that.

372
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,309
We don't know that it's the Powers
that have been protecting it.

373
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,269
What if Darla's carrying
the thing in the prophecy?

374
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:03,819
That scourge of mankind that will
plunge the world into darkness?

375
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,670
What if what's happening to Darla now
is the Powers doing something?

376
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,819
How? By killing my kid?

377
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,119
You always have to be
so damned honest?

378
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,400
What?! Hey, hey, it worked!

379
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,660
I fixed it!

380
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:33,539
Yay, me?

381
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,279
How you doing?

382
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,329
He finally stopped kicking.

383
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,880
Did he?

384
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,440
I guess he figured
he finally got your attention.

385
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,650
You called him "he."

386
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,089
That's the first time
you've ever done that.

387
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,950
He's dying.

388
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,849
Isn't he?

389
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,359
No.

390
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,170
You lied much better
when you didn't have a soul.

391
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,829
- I can feel the life slipping away.
- Then don't let it.

392
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,210
You have to fight for this. Please.

393
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:47,269
I don't know how.

394
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:52,359
My boy.

395
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,380
My darling boy.

396
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,859
I told you I had nothing
to offer this kid.

397
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:05,190
Some mother. Can't even offer it life.

398
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,980
Maybe I should go in there. Apologize.

399
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,539
Best to just stay here. Wait this out.

400
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,230
I think both Angel and Darla
just need a little time alone.

401
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,200
This isn't gonna end well, is it?

402
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:26,869
Okay, everybody's drinking.
I'm buying.

403
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,170
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

404
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,069
We're not open.
Come back tomorrow night.

405
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,130
It's the grand reopening.
Here, here's a flyer.

406
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,200
Thanks.

407
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,759
Run!

408
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:10,099
- What's going on?
- Just run! Run!

409
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,099
- What is it?
- We're under attack.

410
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,599
You have double-protection
sanctorium spells.

411
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,480
It's a thing with the door,
the stairs and the world.

412
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,139
- You can be outside and chuck stuff in.
- I just said that.

413
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,050
- We gotta get out.
- Holtz.

414
00:34:58,449 --> 00:34:59,920
- Back door?
- What?

415
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,500
- Move the bed.
- How is that possible?

416
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,900
I would've mentioned it before,
but it wasn't the right time.

417
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:10,400
No, it's the perfect time.

418
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,070
- What's behind the bed?
- An old loading dock door.

419
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,210
My God, what we did to him.

420
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,409
I know.

421
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,170
- You got an ax, a hammer or anything?
- Buddha head.

422
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,190
Rhino.

423
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,940
That's why this is happening.

424
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:36,719
His family, his children....
What that must have been like for him.

425
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,650
- Doesn't seem so funny now, does it?
- Darla.

426
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,280
We could use some vampire
strength here.

427
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,210
Cordy, Fred.

428
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,860
- Go. I can't. It doesn't matter.
- I'm not leaving you.

429
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,179
All right, go get my car.
It's out front. I got you.

430
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,880
Go!

431
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,199
- Fred, go with them.
- It's okay, they'll come back for us.

432
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,670
- You're going to be okay.
- No.

433
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,980
No, I don't think so.
Once he's gone, I won't be okay.

434
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,090
I won't be okay at all.

435
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,389
I don't know what I'll be.

436
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:04,389
Angel, our baby's gonna die
right here in this alley.

437
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:15,119
You died in an alley. Remember?

438
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,449
I remember.

439
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,469
I wanna say I'm sorry.

440
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,670
I wanna say it and mean it,
but I can't.

441
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,130
Aren't you gonna tell me it's okay?

442
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,929
No.

443
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,010
No. It's really not, is it?

444
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,769
We did so many
terrible things together.

445
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,949
So much destruction.

446
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,059
So much pain.

447
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,159
We can't make up for any of it,
you know that, don't you?

448
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,099
Yeah.

449
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,639
This child....

450
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,449
Angel, it's the one good thing
we ever did together.

451
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,440
The only good thing.

452
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,420
You make sure to tell him that.

453
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,429
Do it.

454
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,389
Now's your chance. Do it.
Finish it while you still can.

455
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,800
You can't just let him walk away.
Not now!

456
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,530
Not after what you swore to me!

457
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,829
I swore that I would show no mercy.

458
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,690
And I won't.
