<i>Friends, enemies.</i>

<i>These lines--</i>
<i>they do not exist for men like us.</i>

00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:27,850
<i>There's no Better Business Bureau</i>
<i>for what we do.</i>

6
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:31,115
Customer complaints
are dealt with through...

7
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:35,921
killing, torture, beating...

8
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,324
sometimes fire.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,727
We call it word-of-mouth advertising.

10
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:48,066
If I'd known this was going to be a seminar,
I'd have worn my name tag.

11
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:52,074
[ Chuckles ] Just want to make sure
we know where we stand.

12
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:55,145
Right now you're standing
on the brink of my patience.

13
00:00:55,246 --> 00:01:00,115
I agreed to meet with your distributor,
Emil, not your muscle.

14
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:03,277
What? Dante and Philip?

15
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:05,514
They're assistants...

16
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,989
here to make us more comfortable.

17
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,152
Don't think of them as muscle.

18
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,263
Are you hungry?

19
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,698
I could get Dante to fix you
a fish sandwich of some sort.

20
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:21,294
- This is a waste of time.
- Please. Please.

21
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,636
<i>My distributor is simply cautious.</i>

22
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:28,109
He'd like me to verify the merchandise
before we move forward.

23
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:40,322
Now... who is this?

24
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,790
My muscle.

25
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:47,455
What we've got here is a modification
of the TS-1 1 3 sniper rifle.

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:52,696
We've altered its targeting and firing
mechanisms to fit the parameters you gave us.

27
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:55,795
The scope works along
amplified thermal wavelengths.

28
00:01:55,906 --> 00:02:00,343
Girl... you're making me
so hot right now.

29
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,344
Wow.

30
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:06,177
Turned on by a woman holding
an enormous gun. What a surprise.

31
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,686
<i>We replaced the delivery system</i>
<i>with a balantine energy charge...</i>

32
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,484
eliminating the need
for conventional ammunition.

00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,821
<i>[ Wesley ] Wolfram and Hart</i>
<i>has 200 units ready now.</i>

34
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:18,918
We'll begin making more
once we receive payment.

35
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:23,659
And your boss doesn't mind selling this
exciting weaponry to someone like me?

36
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:26,031
As long as it doesn't show up in L.A.

37
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:30,072
We choose our battles, Emil,
and you sidestepped the issue of payment.

38
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,938
You'll get your money.

39
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:36,274
You'll get nothing until I meet
with your distributor.

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,712
- I'm not going through middlemen.
- Ah!

41
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:42,718
Did you just refer to me as a middleman?

42
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:49,883
You are lucky Wolfram and Hart has
such good word-of-mouth advertising.

43
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:54,526
<i>Here. Call this number.</i>

44
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,896
He'll arrange everything.

45
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,732
To think, I used to sell this guy
collapsible swords.

<i>-Almost makes me--</i>

<i>[ Emil ]</i>
<i>No one double-crosses me.!</i>

- What hit that guy?
- I'm not sure.

50
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,248
Down!

51
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,982
Yes, thank you, Wesley.
I'd love a gun.

52
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:36,434

<i>- [ Fred Whimpers ]</i>
- Fred!

54
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,231
Fred?

55
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,343
[ Moans ]

56
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,874
<i>[ Angel ]</i>
<i>She could've been killed.</i>

57
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:53,272
<i>[ Eve ] Medical's optimistic.</i>
<i>She should be up and about soon.</i>

58
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:56,369
<i>That's not the point. What the hell</i>
<i>was Fred doing there in the first place?</i>

59
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,074
I needed someone who could explain
the weapon convincingly.

60
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,413
Nobody else here knows
how to explain a gun?

61
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:05,818
I needed someone who wouldn't arouse
Emil's suspicions, someone I could trust.

62
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:10,383
And so, conveniently, the only person
who could go with you... was Fred.

63
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:14,225
- What does that--
- She shouldn't have been there.
It was a reckless decision.

64
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,994
Fred has more than proven herself
in the field. There was no reason to think--

65
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:21,435
We found her bleeding to death
on the ground.

66
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,834
<i>From now on,you clear it with me</i>
<i>before using any of my people.</i>

67
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:28,969
- Your people?
- Got it?

68
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:41,022
- Kind of hard on him, weren't you?
- Well, she could've--

69
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,593
Been killed. So you said.

70
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:47,523
I think you're making
too big a deal about this.

71
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,826
From what I understand,
her wound wasn't all that severe.

72
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,027
- You weren't there. You didn't see her.
- But she's okay.

73
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:56,106
- You're still beating him up.
- He can be careless.

74
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:58,674
Focuses too much
on the big picture?

75
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:01,506
- Overlooks the people involved?
- Something like that.

76
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:04,877
Willing to risk anything or anyone...

77
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:06,882
for the greater good.

78
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:10,943
But, hey, I'm just asking.

79
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,352
Could it be there is another reason...

80
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:16,392
you're getting so mad at him
about this?

81
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,393
Hmm.

82
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:21,123
Stealing your son, for instance?

83
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,131
We don't talk about my son.

84
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,929
You don't trust Wesley, do you?

85
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:30,370
I mean, I can see that. He did
turn Connor over to your sworn enemy.

86
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:33,932
He didn't mean for that to happen.
He thought he was doing the right thing.

87
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:37,241
And I guess it all worked out.
Connor's okay.

88
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:41,579
<i>You're happy. Maybe Wesley knew</i>
<i>what he was doing after all.</i>

89
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,318
Even if he doesn't remember any of it.

90
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:48,823
That's got nothing to do with--

91
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,793
I just want to be kept informed.
That's all.

92
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,988
<i>Is it?</i>

93
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:58,534
Or are you worried about the next time Wesley
betrays you, trying to do the right thing?

94
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:06,665
- They gave me the all clear.
- I was just coming down to find you.

95
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,678
Though I do have to take
a boatload of antibiotics.

96
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,341
Apparently there's some concern
about where that grappling hook's been.

97
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,918
We're taking the cyborg apart
in the lab right now.

98
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,078
You should see how intricate it is.

99
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:21,954
It's like an M.C. Escher picture,
but with wires and flesh instead of geese.

100
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,289
I'm sorry about what happened, Fred.

101
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:26,453
Are you kidding me?

102
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:30,021
I feel bad because all I had to do was hide,
and I couldn't even do that right.

103
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,796
- I should have done a better job protecting you.
- What?

104
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,702
[ Groans ]
That didn't come out--

105
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,140
Do you realize how patronizing that sounds?
Protecting me?

106
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,371
I just meant you shouldn't have
been there in the first place.

107
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,880
- That's not for you to decide.
- Yes, it is, actually.

108
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,975
<i>I made the call. I screwed up.</i>

109
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:53,045
Listen to you. You're blaming yourself
because poor Fred got hurt.

110
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:57,616
Stop trying to be all valiant.
You're coming off like a self-pitying child.

111
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,457
- Hello, Father.
- Oh, yeah. That's mature.

112
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,364
I wish I was your father.
I'd tell you to grow up.

113
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,632
It doesn't work. I've tried.

114
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,673
What are you doing here?

115
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:15,108
- You're Wesley's--
- I see manners are still my son's strong point.

How do you do?

117
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:22,843
Winifred Burkle.
I-I didn't realize you were--

118
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,114
Um, we were just--

119
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:30,250
I, um, have an employee
that I have to belittle...

120
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,158
<i>and to show him I'm in charge.</i>

121
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:36,130
I-- I should let you two catch up.

122
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,258
It was really nice to meet you.

123
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:42,031
- I'm sure I'll see you again soon.
- The pleasure is mine.

124
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,340
''Self-pitying child''?

125
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:53,940
Imagine how humiliating
that will be for her employee.

00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,549
What are you--
Is Mom all right?

127
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,350
She's fine.

00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,324
No, you and I

Oh. Of course. Please.

132
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,904
Sit down.

133
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,532
As you may well know...

134
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:22,441
the Watchers Council
was destroyed last year.

135
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,446
I heard.

136
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:27,016
The remaining former Watchers,
myself included...

137
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,052
have decided to re-form the Council...

138
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:32,417
and I've been sent to contact you.

139
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:37,649
Are you saying the Council
wants me to come back?

140
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,820
Not necessarily.

141
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,398
Your name's proven to be
a point of contention.

142
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,332
There are some who believe
that your tenure as Watcher...

143
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,403
ranks as our most embarrassing failure.

144
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,072
Really?

145
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:54,507
I beat out everybody dying
in an explosion...

146
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,704
as most embarrassing failure.

147
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:00,510
Friends and colleagues lost their lives
in that event, Wesley.

148
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,847
A little respect.

149
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,786
Sorry.

150
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,588
The Council have agreed to take you back,
pending my assessment.

151
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:15,559
I'm here to evaluate you.

152
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,599
I see.

153
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,607
Well, I'll save you the trouble.
I'm not interested.

154
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:29,475
This is no time to be stubborn, boy.

155
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,106
The Council are giving you
a chance to clear your name.

156

[ Chuckles ]
Wolfram and Hart?

159
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:46,295
So this is the haven of evil, is it?

160
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,331
Not anymore.
This isn't the Wolfram and-- [ Groans ]

It's okay. It's no problem.

Sorry.

164

I'm sorry.

- You have the wrong idea about this place.
- Do I?

166
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:11,585
The atrocities committed by Wolfram and Hart
are quite well documented.

167

We're working to change that.

can make a difference.

Yes, my entire week!

175
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:38,942
I don't care about <i>Iron Eagle II,</i> Van.
Nobody did.

[ Chuckles ]
No, don't tell him that.

177
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,777
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
you should be ashamed.

178
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:49,518
- I didn't know you had a younger brother.
- Lorne. Yes.

179
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,618
This is my father,
Roger Wyndam-Pryce.

180
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,357
- How do you do?
- Father?

181
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,524
Oh, I don't believe it.

182
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,762
Okay, I do believe it, but only 'cause
I heard you were in the building.

183
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:03,396
[ Chuckling ]
Well, look at you.

184
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:07,068
It's like Winston Churchill
and a young Richard Harris...

185
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,304
had a beautiful love child...

186
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:14,543
which, according to my sources,
may not be as ridiculous as it sounds.

187
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:18,815
- Lorne runs our entertainment division.
- Entertainment division?

188
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,380
I can see how that would be very useful
in the fight against evil.

189
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,960
You'd be amazed at how many
horrible movies we've stopped.

190
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,529
- Gunn, this is my father.
- It's an honor.

191
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:30,099
This place is buzzing about you.
You better watch out.

192
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,998
If you're anything like your son here,
we might put you to work.

193
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,571
- You might be out of luck.
- Listen, the lab called for you.

194
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:38,140
They're working on RoboCop upstairs,
need your help.

195
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,506
- RoboCop?
- We had an encounter with a cyborg last night...

196
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,944
while we were infiltrating
a weapons ring.

197
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,381
I should head up there.

198
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:51,215
- Would you like to come along?
- Yes.

199
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:55,758

- No. Not at all.

<i>We found cybernetics throughout the body...</i>

201
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,234

replacing entire organic systems.

202
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,303
- Was it human?
- We think so.

203
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,599
The nervous system
seems human at least...

204
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:14,200
but the rest of the technology's so foreign
to us, we can't be sure of anything right now.

205
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,872
This thing really blurs the line
between human and robot.

206
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:22,441
Aha. So you're not ruling out that
a human being could have boffed a robot.

207
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:28,324
Sex with robots is more common
than most people think.

208
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:30,325
Um...

209
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:34,124
the cybernetics require
central processing to function...

210
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,529
which means
if we can crack its memory...

211
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:40,000
we may find a record of everything
it's done until this point.

212

Sorry.

- Daddy, eh?

222
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:16,767
I always thought Wesley was grown
in some sort of greenhouse for dandies.

223
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:20,001
- Spike.
- You've heard of me?

224
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,975
No. We've met.

225
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,945
<i>1 963, my colleagues and I...</i>

I didn't know your father was coming
to visit, Wesley. I'm Angel.

- Pleasure to meet you.
- You really expect me to shake that?

232
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,566

No.

of a horror show to you...

00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:07,282

- So I'm told.

Incessantly, in fact.

239
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,088
Of course.
We were just going over the autopsy.

- Fred, keep me posted.
<i>-Sure.</i>

242
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,249
Yes. Interesting.

243
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:38,378
We're reading trace radiation signatures,
so we've been hesitant to crack it open.

244
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:41,946
It could be a bomb,
some sort of self-destruct device.

245
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,117
Let me help you with that.

246
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:47,924
- Here. You shouldn't.
- Thanks.

247
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:51,398
Anyway, we were wanting you
to decipher it...

248
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:54,231
before we went digging around
in there.

249
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:58,137

He's a genius when it comes to languages.

Oh, the academy didn't
make him head boy for nothing.

251

Mind you, as I recall,
the pickings were a bit slim that year.

252
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,913
The patent indicates
a Hellenic derivation.

253
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,785
I'd say early Moracian, in fact.

254
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:17,086
It's a directive of some sort...

255
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:19,593

256
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,596

Look for an incident device.
A switch or a circuit breaker of some sort.

There's nothing. Fred!
You have to get out of here.

00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,858
Quite simple, really.

00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:39,567
- What happened?
- I can explain.

281
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,304
Apparently, when Percy here
