1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,810
Previously on Angel...

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,929
Landok, is that you?

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,960
Landokmar of the Deathwok Clan.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,650
- The two of you are...?
- Cousins.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,589
Show the cleavage, say the line.
Don't waste more of our time, princess.

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,809
I just wanted to act.

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,559
- You should've waited for me,
- We waited for months,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,140
We're looking for someone working here.

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,539
Fred disappeared 5 years ago.
They never found her.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,890
Here it is.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,460
Fred was holding this book
in my vision,

12
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,009
The portal works both ways,

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,509
Cordy? Cordy?

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,250
Cordelia?

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,880
Oh, no. Oh, my God, no.
How could I have let this happen?

16
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,789
No, she's here somewhere.
She's just hiding.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,609
- What?
- She's gone.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,859
Sucked into the portal.
She's in the Host's dimension.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,760
Where's Cordelia?

20
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,819
Angel?

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,349
Wesley!

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,219
Mr. Green Mojo Guy's cousin?

23
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,319
Help!

24
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,310
Right.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,400
Good one, Cor. Scream very loudly
so the hell-beasts come to you.

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,219
Worth a shot.

27
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,519
So...

28
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,819
...silver lining.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,060
It's kind of a pretty place,
when you look at it.

30
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:10,439
Woodsy woods. Sunny and mild.

31
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,000
Giant hairy hell-beast staring at me.

32
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,500
That's incredibly frightening.
Good hell-beast.

33
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,939
You're a lazy hell-beast, aren't you?
Yes!

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,930
You'll stay right there
while I run for my life.

35
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,009
I don't know where she is.

36
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,909
My world, sure,
but who knows if she even....

37
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,539
Because there's the--
With the--

38
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,409
- I wish I could get drunk.
- Let's be logical.

39
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,870
Screw logic.
We're getting Cordy back.

40
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,530
We'll open up another portal.
We'll go in after her.

41
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,900
- Not a good idea.
- I don't care.

42
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,509
We're unprepared. Let's go
to the hotel, do research--

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,689
No! I want to jump through the big
swirly hole thingy and save Cordelia.

44
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:09,479
We might never be able to get back.

45
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,210
It's Cordy.

46
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:23,750
Oh, crap.

47
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,860
Maybe I have to stand
where the portal opened.

48
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,470
What, out of batteries?
Is it out of batteries?

49
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,870
I don't know.
I don't know how it works.

50
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,639
Damn it!

51
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,050
I just got her back.

52
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,100
There won't be any big swirly
hole-jumping without a big swirly hole.

53
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,680
Yeah, right.

54
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,480
Back to the hotel,
figure out how to make one.

55
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,379
Maybe it's best
that you can't get in.

56
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,470
- What?
- I'm just saying, my world?

57
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,339
You don't want to jump into my world
looking like that.

58
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,199
- Like what?
- Like a human.

59
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,879
I can't die like this!

60
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,540
Oh, thank God!

61
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,689
And also, eew!

62
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,259
Come here, boy! Seekul!

63
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,319
Come here. Come on.

64
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,730
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

65
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,600
Good boy, Seekul.

66
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,540
Really cute...

67
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,339
...thing you've got there.

68
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,649
Personally, I've always been
a real thing-lover.

69
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,089
Good boy, good boy.
You found me a cow.

70
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,420
Who you calling "cow," mister?

71
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,089
Um.... Uh-oh.

72
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,300
A fine old cow. Good cow.

73
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:34,120
Should fetch a pretty price
at the market.

74
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,790
Okay, but you're like Hindu, right?

75
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,769
You don't eat the cows?

76
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:44,100
Kind of a chatty cow, huh, Seekul?

77
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,439
That'll drive down the price.

78
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,449
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

79
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,149
Start talking,

80
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,779
About my dimension? Sure.
I was there, I came here.

81
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,810
I like here, I don't want to go there.
Is that all? I need--

82
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,300
Sit.

83
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,189
How'd you get from your world to here?

84
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,240
Through a portal.

85
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,199
- How did you open that portal?
- I didn't.

86
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,230
You're not helping.

87
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,930
It's no secret that I hate Pylea.

88
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,100
- Pylea?
- My home dimension.

89
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,019
Back then, I would've done
anything to get out.

90
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,060
So one day, five years ago,
I'm in the woods...

91
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,899
...when suddenly, out of nowhere,
a portal appears.

92
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,410
Like an answer to my prayers.

93
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,410
- You knew it was a portal?
- At first, I didn't.

94
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,389
But when I got closer...

95
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,269
...it goes all bendy, flashy light,
whoosh through the portal...

96
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,290
...bang, I'm in another dimension.

97
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,350
This dimension,
which I love and adore...

98
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,370
...and will never, never, never leave.

99
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,290
But then, who opened the portal?

100
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,709
Gift horse.

101
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,300
Mouth.

102
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,850
So where did you end up
in this dimension?

103
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,620
In an abandoned building,
unlike any I'd ever seen.

104
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,110
That's when I realized
I'd been delivered from hell.

105
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,399
I created Caritas on that spot.

106
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,930
So Pylea's a hell dimension?
Cordy's stuck in hell?

107
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,060
Not literally.

108
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,050
- It runs a close second.
- Hard to believe.

109
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,350
Do you?

110
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,250
Well, try this.

111
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:31,509
They have no music there.
It doesn't exist.

112
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,169
Do you know what that's like?

113
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,529
No lullabies, no love songs.

114
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,779
I thought I was crazy,
that I had ghosts in my head...

115
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,299
...simply because I could hear music.

116
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,110
I didn't know it was music.
I just knew it was something...

117
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,210
...beautiful...

118
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,549
...and painful and right.

119
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,240
And I was the only one
who could hear it.

120
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,350
Then I wound up here
and heard Aretha for the first time.

121
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,429
Don't kid yourselves.

122
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,419
Cordy's in a very bad place.

123
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,700
- It's cold.
- What? Put on a sweater.

124
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,799
No, no, no. The hot spot is cold.

125
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,340
Certain geographical areas are rife
with psychic energy.

126
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,899
These areas tend to function
as dimensional hot spots.

127
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,889
Natural gateways between worlds.
Caritas is one such spot.

128
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,750
- The catch is--
- Gotta have one of those.

129
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,039
Creating a portal tends to deplete
the hot spot of its psychic energy.

130
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,559
And since we opened one....

131
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,129
The hot spot is cold.
Can't open the portal.

132
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,129
I was right. It was the batteries.

133
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,549
The same probably applies
to the one in the library.

134
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,799
Why not then wait
till the portal recharges?

135
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,500
No time. We have to find
another hot spot, and fast.

136
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,909
- That's not our only problem.
- Of course not.

137
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,960
When separate entities enter a portal,
they tend to...

138
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,440
...well, separate.

139
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,279
Assuming we find a hot spot
and open a portal...

140
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:14,250
...if we simply jump in, we could
wind up on opposite ends of the world.

141
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,309
- So Landok and Cordy...
- ...didn't arrive together.

142
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,529
She really is alone.

143
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,860
Hey.

144
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,070
Where have you been?
We spoke hours ago.

145
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:28,730
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,500
No, it's okay. It's fine.
You bring him up to date.

147
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,950
Two problems. Finding a dimensional
hot spot and figuring out how--

148
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,200
I'm not going.

149
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,379
- What?
- Last night, I lost one of my crew.

150
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,929
I should've been there.

151
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,019
Sorry, but Wes said the trip
was one-way and I can't.

152
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:05,149
I know that makes me--

153
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,340
I don't know what it makes me.

154
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,679
But I owed it to you
to tell you face to face.

155
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,129
I wish you luck.

156
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,139
Please, find her.

157
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,100
Tough decision. Poor kid.
But I'm right there with him.

158
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,370
Yeah.

159
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,490
Me, too, I guess.

160
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,799
No, about the "not going" part.
You know I'm not going, right?

161
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,320
What?

162
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,620
It's your world. We need a guide.

163
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,019
When I said I love this dimension
and I'll never, never, never leave...

164
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,480
...which "never" did you
not understand?

165
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,169
- First Gunn, now-- I can't believe it!
- I'm sorry. But I'll tell you what.

166
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,179
I've got an idea about finding
your hot spot. Back in a jiff.

167
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,490
Gunn does have...

168
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,210
...responsibilities. Ties.

169
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,059
- People to take care of.
- So do I.

170
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,429
And right now...

171
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,720
...you and I have to figure out
how to save her.

172
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,309
She's a good cow.

173
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,360
Strong. Maybe a little talkative,
but you can whip it out of her.

174
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,730
Skinny.

175
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,460
Ugly too.

176
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,230
One pig.

177
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,600
Two pigs.

178
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,490
For this old cow?
She'll probably croak soon.

179
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,740
A pig and a pint, then. Flib liquor.

180
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,019
Fine. Put the collar on.

181
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,379
Since the last cow died, we're mucking
out the flehegna stables ourselves.

182
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,759
You should see my rash.

183
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,970
I got it, I got it. Okay.

184
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,360
Okay, look.

185
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,649
First of all,
I am a human being, not a cow.

186
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,730
You can't just barter a human being.

187
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,100
Second of all, one pig?
One measly pig?

188
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,419
Third of all,
there's been a huge misunderstanding.

189
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,129
I am an American and I have rights.

190
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,350
Right now I'd like to get back to--

191
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,470
That hurt!

192
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,899
Cows don't talk. They do their job,
if they know what's good for them.

193
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,860
Come by tomorrow and pick up
your stuff. Come on, cow.

194
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,419
If you think I'll follow you--
You've got another thing--

195
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,929
Ow. Coming.

196
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,799
You don't know where
you're going, You're lost.

197
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,090
Miles from anything that grounds you.

198
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,799
I get a deep sense
of longing, separation.

199
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:05,009
- Is this a bad time?
- It's like you feel cut off.

200
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,759
- Lorne!
- Aggie! How's it going?

201
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,220
You know the business.
Vague predictions, lengthy pauses.

202
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,590
Anything to keep the numbers rolling.

203
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,980
- Hiding from the mob?
- Don't get me started.

204
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,299
It's Hollywood chic, going incognito,
but this hat's chafing my horns.

205
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,110
- So what brings you here?
- Like you don't already know.

206
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,919
I just want to see what kind of spin
you'll put on it.

207
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,529
Dimensional portals, psychic hot spots.
I need one.

208
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,350
- Why?
- Some friends are going on a trip.

209
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:40,830
And the big flashing neon warning
light in your aura means what?

210
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,710
Eat at Joe's.

211
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,379
- Can you help me find a hot spot?
- No.

212
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,139
Gotta admit I didn't see that coming.

213
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:55,860
There's ugly conflict vibes coming
off you, pointing at that portal.

214
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,029
You sure it's not the chili
I had for lunch yesterday?

215
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,259
Talk about conflict!

216
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,779
They need it to go to Pylea,
my home dimension.

217
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,909
You're not going?

218
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,940
Aggie, I'd rather have
a hydrochloric acid facial.

219
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,429
Or a hive of wasps nesting
in my throat.

220
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,049
Or watch a junior high production
of Cats, See where I'm going?

221
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,320
- Not Pylea.
- Exactamundo.

222
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,549
Well, that's too bad.
Now they'll never rescue the girl.

223
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,360
Come again?

224
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:35,179
I can find your hot spot, but on
one condition. You've gotta go.

225
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,399
It's the only way
you'll ever resolve...

226
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,639
...all these issues clouding up
your aura.

227
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:44,580
And be honest.

228
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,190
Deep down, you've known you have
to take that one last trip home.

229
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,769
It's the "last" that scares me.

230
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,210
Sometimes the journey's taken
simply because it must be taken.

231
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,610
Is that vague enough?

232
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,900
Is that what I sound like?
No wonder people complain.

233
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,240
I could try a binding spell to fuse us
together as we enter the portal.

234
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,660
Good. Let's do that.

235
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,299
We may emerge on the other side as
a freakishly hybridized Siamese twin.

236
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,130
Keep looking.

237
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,369
This is the third reference
I've seen to iron or metal.

238
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,420
Could be how to keep us
from scattering.

239
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,819
We get handcuffed together?
Who has handcuffs?

240
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,049
Well, I...

241
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,319
...wouldn't know.
But I don't think it'd work.

242
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:46,640
What will work? It's been 12 hours
since she went through that portal.

243
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,690
- What do you want?
- Angel. Good afternoon.

244
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,359
Lawyers. Don't you people sleep
during the day?

245
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,089
Gavin Park and Mr. Hayes.
We represent Wolfram--

246
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,470
Already bored.

247
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,109
- We've come to appraise the hotel.
- What?

248
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,119
Your lease expires soon, and Wolfram
and Hart may buy this building.

249
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,660
You gotta be kidding. You couldn't
turn me, so now you want to evict me.

250
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,700
They're trying to annoy me to death.

251
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,390
We'd like to walk around,
if you don't mind.

252
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:25,829
You think I mind?

253
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,049
Very well.

254
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,990
We'll contact your real estate company
about your noncompliance.

255
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,180
They'll send you
a notice of obligation.

256
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,059
After that, if you still
refuse to cooperate...

257
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,750
...I'm sure that, in your lease,
there must be one or two loopholes.

258
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,700
How quick can we get
out of this world?

259
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,509
I want to go home.
I want to be in my bed.

260
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,519
I want to order some Thai food.

261
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,619
I want to read the latest issue
of Marie Claire,

262
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,630
I want to be doing anything
but shoveling demon horse poo!

263
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,289
Woman has ears like a bat.

264
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,500
There's gotta be a way
to get this off.

265
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,380
Don't do that.

266
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,819
Who's there? What do you want?

267
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,750
I forget. It's not important.

268
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:36,160
If you take your collar off,
bad things will happen to your head.

269
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,230
It'll implode.
So, don't take the collar off.

270
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,619
I can't talk to you
if you don't have a head.

271
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,250
Okay.

272
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,160
Are you a human?

273
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,289
Keep shoveling. Go shovel.

274
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,910
Where'd you come from?

275
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,150
Los Angeles.
How long have you been here?

276
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,960
I was born here.

277
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,220
I mean, not really, I just--
Sometimes I think I was.

278
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:05,099
I mean, I don't think
it was my thoughts.

279
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,029
I forget certain words.
How'd you get here?

280
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,890
Tell me where "here" is first.

281
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,720
Pylea. Well, keep shoveling! Geez!

282
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,759
Another dimension.
You're lost, I can tell.

283
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,450
So many of us are lost even there,
but it's true. I'm not crazy.

284
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,420
Well, crazy, but I'm not wrong.

285
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,740
So how do I get out of here?

286
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,190
Oh, I forgot laughing.

287
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,980
You don't.

288
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,539
They use you as a slave,
and then your body gives.

289
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,329
Zip. Gone.

290
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,980
Well, that's not happening
to me, okay?

291
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,990
I have friends who are gonna
rescue me any time now.

292
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:58,430
I tried to get back. I didn't have
the math, which is strange, because--

293
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,890
- How'd you get here?
- I'm pretty sure I....

294
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,789
I was sucked in by a portal.

295
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,680
- A portal?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:09,380
Where was it?

297
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,849
- Fugitive!
- Oh, no!

298
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,160
Get her! Get her!

299
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,400
What's going on? What's going on?

300
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,410
On your face, cow. On the floor.

301
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,039
No! No!

302
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,970
Let go of me!

303
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,559
A disabled collar. Clever little cow.

304
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,269
You should've stayed in the woods.

305
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,250
Let go of me!

306
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,450
- Wait--
- Face down!

307
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,940
As soon as Wes solves
our scattering problem, we leave.

308
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,559
Don't know if we'll be coming back.

309
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,599
It's 11:16.

310
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,349
Cordy's been gone
for almost 24 hours now.

311
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,299
I think I've covered everything.

312
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:20,480
Oh, the mortgage for the hotel
is under the company name.

313
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,329
The lease is up in six months.
That's what they tell me.

314
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:28,460
So, I guess that's it.
Take care of yourself.

315
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,200
How you holding up?

316
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,980
Waiting for Wes to have
that eureka moment.

317
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,589
- Eureka!
- Oh, geez, thank God.

318
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,990
He actually really says "eureka"?

319
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:48,160
I know how to get us
through the portal!

320
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,650
Let's go.

321
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:01,000
Six packets of hefroot, four queeks,
a bottle of flib liquor and a spatula.

322
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:07,529
Vakma, is it?
Earlier, that girl in the barn--

323
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,539
Shut up, cow.

324
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,869
Trensiduf of the Gathwok Clan
was right. You talk too much.

325
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,140
You're spilling my viper's milk.

326
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,049
I'm sorry.
If I wasn't carrying every....

327
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,099
Oh, no.

328
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,109
Stand up straight.
That milk's worth more than you.

329
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,559
Bad cow! Bad!

330
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,619
A Drokken, it's attacking a villager.

331
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,390
Near the forest, by a big yellow rock.

332
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:55,029
- No one's gonna ask if I'm okay?
- Cursed! My cow is cursed!

333
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,930
No, wait. It's not a curse!

334
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,990
You have to go save this villager,
or the Drokken will--

335
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,259
Cursed! Cursed!

336
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,039
Cursed! Cursed! Cursed!

337
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,670
Here. Stop here.

338
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,700
Here? Isn't this a movie studio?

339
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,809
Makes a certain kind of sense, no?

340
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,200
This is where Aggie said it was.
And she's never wrong about hot spots.

341
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,980
She was doing SkyBar
way before Brad and Jennifer.

342
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:29,720
You got the book?

343
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,609
Good. Hold that puppy tight, okay?

344
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:37,789
I don't want to be stuck over there,
waiting for a mystical locksmith.

345
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,450
All right, then.

346
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,359
I suppose we should probably begin.

347
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,990
Should I, I don't know,
put the top up?

348
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,000
Shouldn't be necessary. If I'm right,
we only require a metal enclosure...

349
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,079
...to insure that we travel together.

350
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,009
The car, top up or down, should do it.

351
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,190
I'm almost positive.

352
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,950
Almost?

353
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,920
Ninety-six percent.

354
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,240
It's not like
I've ever done this before.

355
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,619
- I'm under a great deal of pressure--
- Oh, suck it up, English.

356
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,380
Gunn. How did you--?

357
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,410
Got a phone message.

358
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,079
Sounded like the captain of
the Titanic going down with the ship.

359
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,460
I just thought that
someone on this side should...

360
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:46,269
...know the details, in case.

361
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,980
A back-up man. Terrific idea.

362
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,970
Now that he's going,
someone should stay, mind the store.

363
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,279
- Don't worry. Get me something nice--
- Shut up.

364
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,079
- Everyone set?
- Let's get a move on.

365
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,539
Right. Here goes.

366
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,799
Cool.

367
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,819
- Ninety-six percent, huh?
- Give or take.

368
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,950
Gentlemen, take a good look.

369
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,470
Now, say goodbye.

370
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:50,779
The sun! The daylight! Quick, hand me
a blanket, or I'll catch on fire!

371
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,420
- Why am I not on fire?
- Yo, that was phat.

372
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:04,450
It is another dimension.
Perhaps there's some....

373
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:07,170
Back up, Copernicus. That's suns.

374
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:10,210
Plural.

375
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,240
Suns, yes.

376
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,359
Perhaps they don't have
the same effect on vampires.

377
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,730
Watch it, all right?

378
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,430
Hey!

379
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,720
Fascinating!

380
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,869
Y'all see that bendy thing?

381
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,490
- So we made it. This is your world?
- Ah, yes. Home sweet hell.

382
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,690
I'm not on fire.

383
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,259
We're together! And we didn't merge
into a freakish four-man Siamese twin.

384
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,589
That was a risk?
How come nobody told me?

385
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,170
Everybody notice
how much fire I'm not on?

386
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:47,849
A beautiful day in the neighborhood.
May I suggest we hide the car?

387
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,480
It's a bit conspicuous, seeing
we don't have convertibles here.

388
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:54,640
Or, you know, cars.

389
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,420
Maybe this is
where Cordy came through.

390
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,160
Could be.

391
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,430
Let's gather branches and brush
to cover up the car.

392
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,910
Look, there's some over in
that patch of sun. I'll get them!

393
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,769
I'll give it to you. Tripping to an
alternate universe? Pretty damn cool.

394
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,640
- But I want to find Cordy quick.
- Me too.

395
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,319
I mean, for her sake, of course.

396
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,099
If I know Pylea, she could probably
use a friend about now.

397
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,980
I'd just like to say that I don't know
anything about a curse, okay?

398
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,160
I just have these visions that--

399
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,049
I don't get them very often.

400
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,140
We found the body by Dester's Rock.
A Drokken beast ate him.

401
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,259
Oh, God, it's you.

402
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,789
I'm really sorry about that, honest.

403
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:59,400
But I didn't make it happen,
I just saw it.

404
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:03,380
- Before it had come to pass.
- Exactly.

405
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,630
- It is the curse.
- No, no curse!

406
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,140
Just visions. They're not dangerous.
I use them to help people.

407
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,640
Enough.

408
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,319
We must discover beyond doubt
if she's cursed with the sight.

409
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,410
We will commence the test.

410
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,410
Test? But I haven't studied.

411
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:33,809
- Not much with the humor, huh?
- Bring the instruments.

412
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,839
Now we shall see
if you are truly cursed.

413
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,099
- I pray you are not.
- Please. I'll keep them to myself.

414
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,650
I'll never mention them again.
Please, no, no! No!

415
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,319
That should do it. You ready?

416
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,089
Yeah.

417
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,539
We're a few miles from town.
We'll have to walk.

418
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:20,220
No problem walking in the sun.

419
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,769
Yes, we're all heartily aware that
you're not on fire. Shall we go?

420
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,059
Don't forget the book.

421
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,299
What's wrong?

422
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:34,529
That's not funny.

423
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:37,299
- I wasn't trying to-- What?
- I don't have the book.

424
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,130
- What?
- You had the book.

425
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:42,140
- I don't have the book.
- Who had the book?

426
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:43,309
- Wesley.
- Angel.

427
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,720
- No, I didn't. Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

428
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,269
Whoa, whoa!

429
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:49,519
Did we look in the car?

430
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:52,579
I checked it to make sure
we didn't leave anything.

431
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,740
Oh. Like, say, the book!

432
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:00,140
The book was in the car.
That much we know.

433
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,369
But perhaps its only function is
to open portals to Pylea...

434
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,569
...in which case it'd be useless
in Pylea, and therefore...

435
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:11,119
...it only exists in our dimension.

436
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,390
Ordinarily, I handle bad news
really well.

437
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,119
I drown my sorrows in a
cold gin and tonic, squeeze of lime.

438
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,690
Except for they don't have them here!

439
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,130
We'll figure out a way to get back.
Right now, we got to find Cordelia.

440
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,279
That's why we're here, right?

441
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,089
She needs us. Let's go.

442
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:42,099
You grabbed the book from me.
You grabbed it.

443
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,599
The tests are complete.

444
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,299
It is the decision
of the Covenant that the girl...

445
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,920
...is afflicted.

446
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,740
She carries the curse of the sight.

447
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,529
Remember, keep your heads down.
Xenophobia. Kind of a watchword here.

448
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,440
Why are they afraid of Xena?
She's kind of fly.

449
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,950
- "Xenophobia." Fear of foreigners.
- Can we pretend I didn't say that?

450
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,160
Over there is Blix's house,
a boyhood chum of mine.

451
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,289
We were buds.
Always watching out for each other.

452
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,769
Close as a Torto demon
and its parasite.

453
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,839
I'll make the approach.
You stay here.

454
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,319
Why?

455
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,509
We might get beaten to death
with sticks. Be right back.

456
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,920
What? Traitor! Deserter! Betrayer!

457
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,579
- We should run. Now!
- Look, traitor!

458
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,950
Traitor! Stop them!

459
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,210
Traitor!

460
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,950
- Seize them!
- After the traitor!

461
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,730
What now? Where do we go?

462
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,890
Probably the nearest dungeon.
We're surrounded.

463
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:52,809
We've been through a lot together.
We've faced some steep odds.

464
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,609
I got the 20 on the left,
you take the 50 on the right.

465
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,860
I think we're winning!

466
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,469
- Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan.
- Constable Narwek.

467
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,829
Lovely to see you again.
How are you?

468
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,659
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan
you have returned. Why?

469
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,739
I've been asking myself
the same question.

470
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,829
Who are these cow scum?
You are all dressed very strangely.

471
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,639
They're humans.
And they're my friends.

472
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,659
Cows are not friends.

473
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:10,820
They are creatures of labor,
beasts of burden, no more.

474
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,860
I don't know where you've been...

475
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,369
...but clearly you have abandoned
the teachings of your people.

476
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,980
Take him. We'll begin
interrogations immediately.

477
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:27,650
- You can't do this.
- Watch it. Easy.

478
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:30,619
You dare use your tongue
in my presence?

479
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:34,789
Unworthy trash.

480
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,230
For the crime of assault
against your betters...

481
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:52,320
...you are to be detained
until our Highness passes sentence.

482
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,039
I'm guessing community service is out.

483
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,489
It's too bad.

484
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,769
I really like those orange vests.

485
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,110
Gunn, stop.

486
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,900
Put these things away.

487
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,769
The time has arrived, my brethren.

488
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:38,340
She is cursed with sight.
Measures must be taken.

489
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,510
Blood must be spilled.

490
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:52,250
It's no use.
Thing's made out of a magical alloy.

491
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,039
Really? How can you tell?

492
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:57,730
I can't.
I'm making myself feel better.

493
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,690
You found anything yet?

494
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,250
Sealed up tight.
Six, seven inches thick. You?

495
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,309
No. No, these impenetrable
stone walls--

496
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,980
You say impenetrable,
and I will kick your ass.

497
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,170
I was always horrified
by the Tower of London.

498
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,610
It wasn't that bad.

499
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,440
Yes?

500
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,199
Well....

501
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,880
Compared to this place,
I'm sure it takes on a nostalgic glow.

502
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,860
I wonder if the host's okay.

503
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,909
I'm sure "interrogation" just
means some wrist-slapping.

504
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,460
- That, or he's dead.
- Shut up.

505
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,159
- It may not be wrist-slapping.
- No. Shut up.

506
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,730
How we supposed to hear any--

507
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,150
I hear two men talking in the hall.

508
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,239
- Vampire.
- Talking about a girl with visions.

509
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,769
A Covenant. A curse.

510
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,840
Something about testing
the girl for sight.

511
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,500
He said she screamed.

512
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,730
Those bastards!

513
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,639
They're taking us to a castle.

514
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,730
We're gonna be sentenced.

515
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,349
They're coming.

516
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,489
Out, prisoners.

517
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,369
Be ready.

518
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,349
Oh, am I glad to see you. You're
so much less dead than I expected.

519
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,900
- What did they do to you?
- First there was the parade.

520
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,550
Ticker tape, streamers. Honestly,
I was so touched I almost wept.

521
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:16,420
Locked me up, pushed me around,
asked a bunch of questions.

522
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,500
- We have a lead on Cordy.
- You found her?

523
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,340
No. We heard two guys talk
about a girl with visions.

524
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,750
- Yikes. I don't like that.
- They mentioned a Covenant.

525
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,550
- Something about tests.
- We need to get out of here.

526
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:37,849
Silence!

527
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,289
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
you and the cows are not to speak.

528
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,769
- De-bunch your panties, Narwek.
- You are a traitor.

529
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,599
You abandoned your life-giver,
betrayed us...

530
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,829
...and now you consort
with these animals.

531
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:01,800
I will take great pleasure
in watching them kill you slowly.

532
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,039
Do we go in separately or together?
We don't have time.

533
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,289
I've never been sentenced
to death before. Together?

534
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,630
- Listen up.
- After that...

535
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,260
...we'll hang their corpses
in the village square.

536
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,559
Prisoners!

537
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,650
The day of judgement has arrived.
The venerable monarch of Pylea...

538
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:31,309
...general of the ravenous legions,
eater of enemy flesh...

539
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,969
...prelate of the blood rites
and sovereign of death...

540
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:39,539
...is prepared to pass sentence
upon you.

541
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:43,010
One...

542
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,840
Open the doors.

543
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,170
...two....

544
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:58,820
Hi, guys.

545
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,139
Thank you, thank you very much,
