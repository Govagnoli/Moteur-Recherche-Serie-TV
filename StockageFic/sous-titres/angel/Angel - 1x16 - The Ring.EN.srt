1
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:08,580
"Demons, Demons, Demons." They put
a lot of thought into that title.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,570
What would you call it?

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,419
I don't know,
how about "Demon Database"?

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,059
A name rife with single entendre.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,519
Why isn't Wolfram and Hart here?

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,410
- They're lawyers, not demons.
- Fine line.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,670
They have a lot of entries.

8
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,839
Did you know there's 12
species indigenous to L.A. County?

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,350
Do they have the Vigories of Oden Tal?

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,579
Nope.

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,700
There's still a place in this world
for traditional research.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,899
Some ugly critters in here.

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,030
Someone ought to create
an intrademon dating base.

14
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,840
Like "Archfiend.org, where
the lonely and the slimy connect."

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,560
I was just joking, grouchy.
When did you last have a dating base?

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,509
For your information, I lead a rich
and varied social life.

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,479
Every night it's Jeopardy!
then Wheel of Fortune...

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,500
...and a cup of hot cocoa. Look out,
girls, this one can't be tamed.

19
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,019
It may not be as intoxicating
as a life erected on a push-up bra.

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,549
Hey, if anyone's wearing
a push-up bra around here it's....

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,379
- Angel.
- Do you need a counselor?

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,620
No, I'm way too "single entendre"
to benefit from therapy.

23
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,829
- Don't take it personally.
- That's rich...

24
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,290
...coming from Mr. Don't Talk to Me
Before I've Had My Oat Bran.

25
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,409
Children, we have company.

26
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,780
- Is one of you Angel?
- I'm Angel.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,340
I'm Darin MacNamara.
I checked around.

28
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,549
You have a reputation
for handling unusual problems.

29
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,640
A richly deserved reputation.

30
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,200
You all right?

31
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,180
I think I'm gonna pass out.

32
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,540
I'm sorry. It's just--
My brother Jack....

33
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,670
He was kidnapped last night.

34
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,260
I found this in my mailbox today.

35
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,170
Do you know who did this?

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,789
Well, that's why I came to you.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,060
They weren't people.

38
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,460
I'm a few years older than Jack.

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,939
My brother and I haven't exactly
been close since we grew up.

40
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,400
I made something of my life,
and Jack didn't.

41
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,280
Thanks.

42
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,270
I don't know what they want.
There was just--

43
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,460
You were there when he was taken.

44
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,069
Jack called me last night,
asked me to come over.

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,379
He has a gambling problem, said he was
in over his head with a bookie.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,860
- Which one?
- Ernie Nellins.

47
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,419
He works at a sports bar
in Silver Lake called Shots.

48
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,199
I've paid him before.
I told Jack this time to go to hell.

49
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,759
I wanted him to suffer
the consequences of his actions.

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,069
- I didn't know this would happen.
- It's not your fault.

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,979
I felt guilty so I went over there,
and there were these....

52
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,490
I don't know, creatures. Dragging
him away. I tried to stop them.

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,180
- You haven't heard from anyone?
- No.

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,909
I'll pay anything to get him back.
He's my little brother.

55
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,719
Look, my Colleagues
will start looking...

56
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,330
...into whatever kidnapped
your brother.

57
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,860
In the meantime, write down
everything you saw.

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,350
Okay. Thank you.

59
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,550
- What about the bookie?
- I thought we'd have a little chat.

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,089
This is wheat grass.
I ordered the Kiwi Cooler.

61
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,829
Give me that.

62
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,279
How do you drink that swill?
Give me two.

63
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,449
Mind if I play, Ernie?

64
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,730
- Game's invitation only, pal.
- Then invite me.

65
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,750
It's been a while, so I might be
a bit rusty on the rules.

66
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,600
But I think my jacks beat your pair.

67
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,040
No, I'm not looking for a fight.
Just for him.

68
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,329
You should try wheat grass.
It's good for digestion.

69
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,089
- Who are you?
- A friend of Jack's.

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,170
Jack doesn't have any friends.
Just people he doesn't owe.

71
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,769
His brother will pay his debts.

72
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,939
Out of my hands. It's not
about the money anymore.

73
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,730
- It's about making Jack an example.
- Piece by piece?

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,620
- Makes an impression on newcomers.
- Where is he?

75
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,540
- They didn't say and I didn't ask.
- It doesn't mean you don't know.

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,410
There's a place...

77
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,790
...in Beachwood Canyon,

78
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,009
WelI, not exactly in Beachwood Canyon,

79
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,759
Under it, actually,

80
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:04,939
Okay, I'm in,

81
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,579
What did Darin write about
the demons that took Jack?

82
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,740
Bald, ultrawhite skin, slime.

83
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,389
There's always slime.
It's why I don't gamble.

84
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,689
You make a small wager one day...

85
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,529
...and then Beetlejuice-y
albino comes a-knocking.

86
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,910
- Claws or hands?
- He wrote "clawlike hands."

87
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,509
- Could be a mixed breed. Smell?
- Sulfuric.

88
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,360
Add a Porsche and hair plugs
and I've dated this guy.

89
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:33,560
A lot.

90
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,750
- Other distinguishing characteristics?
- An eerie, high-pitched wail.

91
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,009
Probably when it's preparing
to fight or mate.

92
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,389
First I say "yuck"
and then I hit search.

93
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,029
By the time you get done entering
all this into your fancy database...

94
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,480
- ...I could've located it--
- Got it.

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,660
"A Howler Demon."

96
00:06:59,089 --> 00:06:59,959
Yikes,

97
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,110
- Where's Jack MacNamara?
- Not here.

98
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,110
- Where is he?!
- We sold him.

99
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,550
Who did we sell him to?

100
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,300
Okay, go ahead.

101
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,699
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,490
Next, please. Tickets.

103
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,629
You're quick.

104
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,309
- Thank you.
- No problem.

105
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,480
Killing blow! Killing blow!

106
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,779
Killing blow! Killing blow!

107
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,039
Killing blow! Killing blow!

108
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,580
Killing blow! Killing blow!

109
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,159
Killing blow! Killing blow!

110
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,169
Killing blow! Killing blow!

111
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,679
Killing blow! Killing blow!

112
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,149
Killing blow! Killing blow!

113
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,700
The winner, Tom Cribb.

114
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,860
Time: six minutes, 22 seconds.

115
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:00,470
If you're keeping track, that was
Cribb's 7th career kill.

116
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,600
Our next contest features one
of the more popular fighters.

117
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,870
A rare find,
from the barren wastelands!

118
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,539
A true champion who's got it all,
skill, speed and strength.

119
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,639
Let's give it up
for the "Menace of Venice"...

120
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,250
...the "Titan of Terror"...

121
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,269
...the "Umpire of Agony"...

122
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,299
...the one, the only...

123
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,950
...Val Trepkos!

124
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,370
You made it.

125
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,009
Most don't.

126
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,210
Careful, Jack.

127
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,289
You should've seen
what he did to the Howlers.

128
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,200
You set me up.

129
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,960
It was a group effort.

130
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,320
Let's get a look at those teeth.

131
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,509
Teeth tell a lot about the bones.

132
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,830
I told you to be careful.

133
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,720
This one's got some attitude.

134
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,600
That's good.

135
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,740
He'll be a crowd pleaser.

136
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:01,690
I asked for a room with a view.

137
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,629
Guess you don't speak English.

138
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,990
We'll have so much to talk
about during the long winter nights.

139
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,769
Listen up, slaves.

140
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:37,399
There's only one rule. It's real
simple, so you demons can remember.

141
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,740
Stay inside the red.

142
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,600
That wristband will make sure you do.
I know what you're thinking.

143
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,509
You want to tear my throat out.
But you won't.

144
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,649
Because there's only one way out.

145
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,950
When that band comes off.

146
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,970
And the only way that band comes off
is after your 21st kill.

147
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,570
I'm not killing anyone.

148
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,720
Then you'll be killed. Either way,
fans get their money's worth.

149
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,730
Please let us know if you hear
from him. Thank you.

150
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,769
- Cop lady hasn't talked to him?
- No.

151
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,029
She seemed like
she didn't care either.

152
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,379
- He's a missing person.
- He's only gone one night.

153
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,379
He was supposed to check in
with us and didn't.

154
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,750
And he's not someone who tans well.

155
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,539
He's probably holed up,
waiting for nightfall.

156
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:41,850
Maybe. But still,
something's very wrong.

157
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,080
Our client, who should be waiting
by the phone, is nowhere to be found.

158
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,750
Right. Keep trying to track him down.

159
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,690
- What are you doing?
- Following his footsteps.

160
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,690
- You're going to the bookie?
- That's where he went.

161
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,169
Who gets his jollies cutting
off people's extremities?

162
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,820
That's why I'm taking this.

163
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,409
Along with a few other things.

164
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,409
Looks like good gruel.

165
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,750
Who the hell are you?

166
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,250
I'm Angel.

167
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,200
What you are is
a soon-to-be-dead slave.

168
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,700
Shut up.

169
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,980
- Cribb, that's mine!
- And now it's mine.

170
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:51,820
Give it back.

171
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,100
Open your mouth again,
I'll close it for good.

172
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,299
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

173
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,559
Angel, guess how many vampires
I've killed.

174
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,200
Catch you later.

175
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,639
- Why'd you do that?
- You're welcome.

176
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,059
I can fight my own battles.
I got two wins already.

177
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:51,960
So just another 19 and you're out?

178
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,870
That's right. You think I can't
cut it? You want a piece of me?

179
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,649
No, not really.

180
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,009
What's wrong with you?

181
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,389
Don't be rocking the boat,
this is life and death.

182
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,259
All right, girls, listen up.
Here's tonight's card.

183
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,549
Lasovic, you're fighting Baker.

184
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,460
Trepkos, you're the main event.
You'll go against Mellish.

185
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,419
That's an execution.

186
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,590
Shut your trap, slave.
No one's talking to you.

187
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,659
I'm walking out of there tonight.

188
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,870
You better know that.

189
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:41,870
No!

190
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,730
- We paid good money for that one.
- It's all right.

191
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,029
It's an object lesson
for the others.

192
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,940
- We'll have to find a replacement.
- What about Captain America here?

193
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,069
Ice helps keep the swelling down.

194
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,509
You got a hard head, boy.

195
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,089
Stop that.

196
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,839
Who's this?

197
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,519
Wesley Wyndam-Price.
I'm looking for my employer.

198
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:24,180
- He asked about Jack MacNamara.
- I'm kind of busy here.

199
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,200
Where is he?

200
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:31,339
Your boss? He gave me $200
to answer his questions.

201
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,539
I'm a businessman. Make an offer.

202
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,259
The man I work for
means a great deal to me.

203
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,369
I will not give you
a single red cent.

204
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,250
What I will do is
beat it out of you if I have to.

205
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,710
You're from another country?

206
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,400
Are you Robin Hood?

207
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:00,930
Please drop those.

208
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,420
You can go now.

209
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,799
Now where is my employer?

210
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,190
Ladies and gentlemen, the MacNamara
Brothers welcome you to a night...

211
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,869
...of high-voltage entertainment!

212
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,349
- I heard something interesting.
- What?

213
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,980
- I heard the vampire has a soul.
- I wouldn't know about that.

214
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,920
When he's fighting, do you think
that would be a plus or a minus?

215
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,640
Depends on what he's fighting for.

216
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,940
So you'll give me odds on him to win?

217
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,160
I'll give you even money.

218
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,609
I'll take that bet.

219
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,430
Shouldn't go out there cold.

220
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,109
Look, you did me one.

221
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,849
Baker's fast, but his left eye
got hurt two fights ago.

222
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,579
Stay on his left, tie him up.

223
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,630
You can drive his head right into
the wall to get the kill.

224
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

225
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,849
You on drugs? It's not
like you have a choice.

226
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,559
All right, girls. Showtime.

227
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,460
Baker's challenger makes
his ring debut tonight.

228
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,880
He's a highly skilled fighter
with a taste for blood.

229
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:48,730
Let's welcome Angel!

230
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,670
That vampire's not even fighting!

231
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,250
Those two are perfect.

232
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,730
- Did you bring the badge?
- No.

233
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,700
- You said you--!
- Sir, madam.

234
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,680
I'm Detective Andrews.
This is Detective Yelsew.

235
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:22,480
Show them your badge.

236
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,230
Write down their license number,
4, 3, Peter, Charlie, Edward.

237
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,109
What are you doing?

238
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,230
Sir, if you could give us your name.

239
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,509
My name is Matthew Winslow,
as in Winslow Multimedia.

240
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,089
I'm a friend of your boss,
Chief Tyler.

241
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,369
We'll give him your best.
Could I see your tickets?

242
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,440
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer tonight.

243
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:47,029
Are you aware that you've purchased
tickets to an unlicensed event?

244
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:51,450
Answer the detective!

245
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,400
If it's illegal, what are
all these people doing here?

246
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:58,539
We're trying to do you
a favor, Mr. Winslow.

247
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,180
Something's going down tonight.
Something with the Man.

248
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,130
- A raid?
- We're not at liberty to say.

249
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,519
But we could just go on home?

250
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,779
I think that would be wise, sir.

251
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,170
You almost blew it!

252
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,579
I saved us.

253
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,839
"Something's going down with the Man?"

254
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,029
Idiot. Thinks he can get out
of this by pulling a Ghandi.

255
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,309
I think we found our missing client.

256
00:21:58,769 --> 00:21:59,640
Oh, my God!

257
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,180
What is this?

258
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:05,319
These Octavian matches date back
to the Roman Empire.

259
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,460
I'd heard rumors of a revival.

260
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,039
Couldn't they just do
West Side Story?

261
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,250
What's with the bracelets?

262
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,539
If they cross the red line
while wearing one, they disintegrate.

263
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:22,369
Oh.

264
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,130
Oh, my God.

265
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:01,509
Angel! Angel!

266
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,390
Official time:
seven minutes, 33 seconds.

267
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,319
This marks the first
of what promises to be...

268
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,549
...many more kills
by the vampire, Angel!

269
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,559
Angel! Angel!

270
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,559
Trepkos and Mellish, showtime.

271
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,839
Wait. If no one fights,
no one dies.

272
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,420
Quit moping. You're alive.

273
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,039
Baker isn't.

274
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,259
One lucky kill don't
make you an expert.

275
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:50,390
That wasn't the first life I've taken.
Or the 21st.

276
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,809
Trepkos, Mellish, let's go.

277
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,039
We can fight them
if we stop fighting each other.

278
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,910
- Now.
- I'm giving you another way out.

279
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:08,079
I'll kill him quick.

280
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,819
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up...

281
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,220
...for one of your favorite
fighters, Val Trepkos!

282
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,059
- We gotta call the police.
- That's a bad idea.

283
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,849
If they're not already in on this...

284
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,500
...then MacNamara would destroy
the evidence.

285
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:42,799
He'd kill the fighters.
We've gotta get Angel out of there.

286
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,519
To do that, we have to get
him out of the cuffs.

287
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,539
- They were made by ancient sorcerers.
- So get an ancient key.

288
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,549
I might be able to make one myself,
if I could get one of the cuffs...

289
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,359
...which won't be easy--

290
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,849
Unless you procured one
while I wasn't looking.

291
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,099
- Well done.
- Thank you.

292
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,390
That was the most exciting
match I've ever seen.

293
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,950
My favorite part was when you stuck
Baker with the knife.

294
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:16,259
Kind of put a damper
on the brotherhood spiel.

295
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,950
What'd you expect? You're a demon,
like the rest of them.

296
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,369
The difference is,
they know their place.

297
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:26,490
Somebody needs to put you in yours.
You and your brother.

298
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,230
Someone may...someday.

299
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,789
But not you, and not today.

300
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,019
Why put off till tomorrow
what you can do today?

301
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:45,519
Any closer and he's dead.

302
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,240
Tell me how to get this off.

303
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:52,609
How does it open?
Is there some kind of a key?

304
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,049
Where's the key, Jack?

305
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,789
Check his pockets. Cribb.
Trepkos. Any of you.

306
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:02,779
A little help would be nice.
Or I can just do it myself.

307
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,759
What did I tell you, huh?
Now you're really alone.

308
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,259
I got you. Get his brother!

309
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,700
Look at him! Is this who you're all
so afraid of going up against?

310
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,079
How does it feel, Jack?

311
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,069
Tell them how it feels
to be in here. Come on!

312
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,759
How does it feel to be a slave?

313
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,240
Tell them!

314
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:31,470
- Let him go.
- As soon as you let us go.

315
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:34,859
What do you think you are? Moses?

316
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,470
You'll listen if you want
your brother back.

317
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,089
- Last chance.
- Come on, Darin.

318
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,910
There's only one way
this can play out...

319
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,490
...so let's just get it done.
He's your brother.

320
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,539
Now he's my dead brother.

321
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,839
How do you feel?

322
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:21,069
Like I was hit by lightning
after the truck ran me over.

323
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,440
I remember you.

324
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,420
We didn't get a chance to meet.
I'm Lilah Morgan.

325
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,599
You're a fight fan.

326
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,579
And a lawyer.

327
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,670
- Let me guess, Wolfram and Hart.
- I'm an associate here.

328
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:41,539
After some arm-twisting, I convinced
MacNamara to sell your contract.

329
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,369
He knows keeping you would be
too much trouble.

330
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,119
Congratulations, you're free.

331
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,279
As long as I pretend
it never happened.

332
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,970
That MacNamara and his circus
don't exist.

333
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,509
That is the deal, isn't it?

334
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,579
It's a big city, Angel.
A lot of people need your help.

335
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,930
You're a good Samaritan and this pact
with the devil is just an act?

336
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,349
Sometimes you have to compromise.

337
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,880
Look the other way when
Wolfram and Hart are involved?

338
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,690
I prefer to think of it as picking
the battles you can win.

339
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,680
There's not one reason
why we can't work together.

340
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,440
You're right.

341
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:46,660
There are about a thousand.

342
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,220
I saw what you did to Baker,
so I know you want to survive.

343
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,000
This is your only chance. Take it.

344
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,000
Thanks for the champagne.

345
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:10,099
Relax. Take me back.

346
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,940
Don't people get enough
violence watching Springer?

347
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,849
Cordelia, do you mind?
I'm trying to concentrate.

348
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:34,529
You've been concentrating all night.

349
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,250
It's taken this long
to translate the text.

350
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:41,680
I need something that conducts
electricity, but not too much of it.

351
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,730
This cuff is half magic,
half medieval technology!

352
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,109
If I've read the alchemists
correctly, all I need--

353
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,730
Ouch! Are you okay?

354
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,250
Perhaps something that conducts
a little less electricity.

355
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,589
He was free.

356
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,829
Bloodsucker's crazier than I thought.

357
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,279
Think you're proving something
by coming back?

358
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,029
They didn't help you before.
They won't help you now.

359
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,490
They know the only way
out of here is by himself.

360
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,829
You'll find that out soon, because
tonight you're gonna fight Trepkos.

361
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,880
Smart money says he's walking out.

362
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,470
You're his 21st kill.

363
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,049
Too thick.

364
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:17,839
Tick, tick, Wesley!

365
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,569
I don't know what else to try.

366
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,569
We need something supple
enough to thread...

367
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,069
...but strong enough
to spring the release.

368
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,130
Horsehair.

369
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,519
- Horsehair?
- From Keanu.

370
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,779
My palomino before the IRS
took him away.

371
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:36,480
Horsehair.

372
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,470
Well, we tried just about
everything else.

373
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,130
Ten thousand on Trepkos.

374
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,150
Tonight's match features
a new favorite in the ring...

375
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,069
...a vampire.

376
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:08,170
Please welcome,
for the second night in a row...

377
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:12,539
...and still fresh
from his first kill, Angel!

378
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,450
His opponent is a favorite
who needs no introduction.

379
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,380
This marks his 21st
and final fight.

380
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:25,700
Let's give a special welcome
to a true champion, Val Trepkos!

381
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:38,869
Is this how you want to pay
for your freedom? With 21 bodies?

382
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,619
You'll always be their slave
even if they take that cuff off.

383
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,509
- I'll kill you quick.
- I won't let you.

384
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,690
Vampire's gonna get
his head ripped off.

385
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,369
Maybe his heart torn out.

386
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:16,930
What a loser.

387
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,809
Can you help me? I'm a little lost.

388
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,500
I'm looking for the ladies' room.
They said it was this way.

389
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,670
Or is it up a level?

390
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,470
Excuse me! Come here.

391
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,849
Yes, you.

392
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,029
I need to see Angel.
Tall fellow, prominent brow.

393
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,019
Yeah, he's dead.

394
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,039
- Dead?
- He will be. He's fighting Trepkos.

395
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,510
Who the hell are you?

396
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,920
A friend.
Perhaps we can help each other.

397
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,340
- I have a key.
- A key?

398
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,159
Help me save Angel and I'll
get all of you out.

399
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,849
If we band together--

400
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,369
Give that back! Hey!

401
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:25,269
- What happened?
- One of them took my key.

402
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,989
Angel can't last.
We have to do something now!

403
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,130
We will.

404
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,369
Killing blow! Killing blow!

405
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,349
Angel! Angel!

406
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,909
Killing blow! Killing blow!

407
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,780
Killing blow! Killing blow!

408
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,340
Both of them.

409
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:47,800
Call them off.

410
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:53,730
Screw you.

411
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,880
Give me your wrist...

412
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,539
...loser.

413
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,769
You stupid slave.

414
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,530
You had your 21...

415
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,280
...but you had to ruin it
for everybody else.

416
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,519
Trepkos...

417
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,210
...catch.

418
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,550
- Easy.
- Thanks.

419
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,880
- Thanks.
- It was a good fight.

420
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,619
I could've taken you.

421
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:27,780
Angel, you don't look so....

422
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:30,639
- It's a good thing you heal fast.
- Yeah.

423
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:33,429
It's also a good thing you found me.

424
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,780
We weren't gonna let anything
happen to you.

425
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,820
I mean, beyond the slavery
and the severe beatings.

426
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,269
Wesley came up with the key.

427
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:47,469
But Cordelia came up with the key
to the key.

428
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,409
You both did great.

429
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,280
I think we did a good thing
here tonight.

430
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,579
Yes, we set the captives free.

431
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,989
Actually, didn't we set
a bunch of demons free?

432
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:08,260
Oh, well, technically....
Yes.
