Who else could

127
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,449
It was probably a mind game
to get the Beast...

128
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:58,332
...to come after us instead of her.

Well, there's one thing I can decrypt.

136
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,647
My sources have confirmed
that without the little girl...

was not her only function.

I've found an entry in Rheinhardt's
Compendium for that same little girl.

Or, rather,
the entity presenting itself as one.

142
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:36,805
Her name is Mesektet.

143
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:39,933
- I figured Tiffany or Brandy.
- So Wolfram and Hart...

144
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,527
...was just a day job.
- Sort of.

145
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:46,487
You see, Mesektet was one of five
enormously powerful beings...

146
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,406
...which are linked to
an embodiment of the ancient god Ra.

147
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:53,122
Which makes them totems, right?
Symbolic manifestations.

148
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,842
Yes. Totems which, together,
form an order called the Ra-Tet.

149
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,488
Must be big. Never heard of them.

150

Their origins have been shrouded
in mystery since the dawn of time.

151
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,926
Only the totems themselves
know their true purpose.

152
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,086
So maybe he killed this Mesektet...

153
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,124
...for another reason.

This Beast has killed
hundreds with his bare hands.

Throw in the storms and quakes
that accompanied the rain of fire...

172
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:06,248
...you could put
the death toll in the thousands.

173
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,485
Wes is right. Statistically,
it's still a coincidence. Two points...

Okay, I gotta go see Angel.

CORDELIA: It's me.

I know I don't have to be

Well, you know that never works.

- Like I really want a progress report.
- That's not what I meant.

He's scared. Scared that you think
he's connected to the Beast.

00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,610
Well, you know, it does tend
to show up whenever he's around.

In fact...

00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:57,084
...I give a whole lot of damn.

...get over it.
- What?

- I had a vision...
- Get over it?

202
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,688
...of the Beast.
- I never really thought about that.

203
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,962
Get over it. Why didn't I
think about that? It's so simple.

I'm sorry I hurt you.

It was the last thing
in the world I wanted to do.

But you have to get past it,
and you have to get past it now...

bigger things at stake.

It was...

213
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,286
...different from any other.

214
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:57,326
I felt like I was inside somebody else,
listening to the demon talk.

215
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,923
But I couldn't tell if it was
in the past or in the future...

216
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,443
...or even where we were exactly.

I mean, who was it you were inside?

I couldn't tell.

00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,124
But I did feel like there
was more I wasn't getting.

220
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,807
Like I was just scratching
at the surface of something.

221
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,643
- Maybe it'll come to me.
- So, what did the demon say?

222
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,971
Don't know.
All I got was a visual.

223
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,562
- Not much to go on, Cordy.
- But it's something.

224
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:33,249
A vision means the phone lines between
us and the Powers That Be are still open.

225
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:37,408
- Maybe they'll send us a clue.
- As if somebody is up there watching.

00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:40,048

00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,404
But I'm back now. So you're gonna
have to suck it up and deal...

And you're the leader.

00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,485
So lead.

00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:56,328

it's slightly demoralizing...

00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,208
...but from here on out,
we're on the offensive.

00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,927
We'll find out its weaknesses,
we'll go in prepared...

00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,964
...and we're gonna fight smart.

But how can we be prepared
when there's nothing on this thing?

240
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:24,445
Yeah, and weaknesses?

241
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:27,372
It's not a sure bet
El Destructo has any.

242
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:29,962
- Everyone has an Achilles' heel.
- Until we find his...

243
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,647
...we'll be cooling ours.
We got nothing without a new lead.

244
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,128
- Gwen.
- Hi there.

245
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,762
Long time, no hand-to-hand.

246
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,451
- I remember you.
- That guy you killed?

247
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,444
Yeah, that's him.

248
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,406
Kicked you in the face too,
didn't I, cherry?

249
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,650
Sorry about that,
I really do try to avoid contact.

250
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,606
Mostly.

251
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,446
- Cordelia, this is...
- I know who she is.

252
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,965

Higher Plane Channel. Thanks.

253
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,170
So you're the girl who makes

254
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,082
Figuratively, at least.

255
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,882
- You must be so happy.
- I am...

256
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:21,728
...not having the best week, honestly.
- Tell me about it.

257
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:25,647
I mean, really,
tell me, freak to freak.

259
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:31,724
- Something happen to you?
- Met with a client last night...

260
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:35,562
...in the oil fields, which is odd,
because I bagged for this guy six years.

261
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:37,764
Big money.
He never wanted to meet before.

262
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,128
Fascinating as these
details must seem to you...

263

00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:48,168
Also, while we were talking...

266
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:51,843
...he got his chest punched out by
a big demon with a head made of rock.

267
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,246
Demon, okay? The whole nine.
Cloven feet and horns and teeth and...

268
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,487
He wasn't wearing lam<i>e</i>, though.

269
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:05,804
The evil ones can't pull it off.
It gets camp.

270
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:09,723
This client of yours.
Was anything removed from the body?

271
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:12,925
Didn't see.

272
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,047
But you are hands down
the weirdest person I know...

273
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,681
...so I figured I'd
ask you what's going on.

274
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:20,286
FRED:
Um, excuse me.

275
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:23,565
Not that I don't still bear
a grudge against you, because I do...

276
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:27,043
...but your client didn't happen to be
a skinless saber-toothed tiger...

277
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,169
...or composed
entirely of light, maybe?

278
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,726
Light came out of his chest.

279
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:33,009
- How did you know?
- A pattern. That's three.

280
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,965
- He's killing the Ra-Tet.
GWEN: What's that?

281
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,691
A mystical order.

282
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:41,131
Each totem representing
a stage in Ra's journey across the sky.

283
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:45,241
Here's your client.
Two others, these...

284
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:46,971
...are dead.

285
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,682
That means there's two totems left.
Manjet and Semkhet.

286
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:55,290
The last sighting of Manjet was
rumored two years ago in Belize.

287
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:58,763
And Semkhet is said to live
in a cave in Death Valley.

288
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:03,285
Then that's easy. All we have to do
is find Semkhet and protect him.

289
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:04,972
LORNE:
Well, won't that be a hoot.

290
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:08,563
Looks like Semkhet is puddy-tat
to the world's scariest 6-year-old.

291
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:11,008
- It could be dangerous.
- I'll take Gwen.

292
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,968
Gee, I feel all warm inside.

293
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,129
- Shouldn't we all go...?
- We can handle it.

294
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,086
The super powers?
I'll catch her up on the drive.

295
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,966
It's a four-hour trip.
Both ways.

296
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:25,648
I'm sure we'll find
something to talk about.

297
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,570
GWEN: Jeez! Where were you when they
taught stealth in super-power school?

298
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,772
- I did that on purpose.
- That's pretty pathetic.

299
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,686
If it's a lie or if it's the truth?

300
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:05,808
- Aren't we here to protect this thing?
- We are, unless it's evil.

301
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:09,966
I say if it is, we prevent the Beast
from killing it by killing it ourselves.

302
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:18,287
So much for protecting it.

303
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,922
Looks like it was ripped apart.

304
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,448
Charring around the edges.

305
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,253
This is definitely our guy.

306
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,405
The Beast is systematically
executing these totems.

307
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,807
- Just don't know why.
MAN: I do.

308
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,286
He's gonna turn out the sun.

309
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:47,004
What are you doing here?

310
00:19:47,173 --> 00:19:49,971
Standing in the remains
of my fallen brethren...

311
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,601
...trying not to have
an anxiety attack.

312
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:55,453
- Who are you two?
- I'm Angel, that's Gwen.

313
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,685
- You got a name?
- I am Manjet...

314
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:02,687
...Sacred Guardian of the Shen,
Keeper of the Orb of Ma'at...

315
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,844
...and Devotee of Light.

316
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,803
Off hours, I like Manny.

317
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,284
- You're Manjet?
- Right.

318
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:16,766
- The last totem of the Ra-Tet?
- Right.

319
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:20,283
- I thought you were in Belize.
- Was, till I heard Mesektet got whacked.

320
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,445
Never liked that chick.
Evil, right down to her Mary Janes.

321
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,446
But family...
What are you gonna do?

322
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,292
What did you mean?
The Beast is gonna "turn out the sun"?

323
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,132
- Is that a metaphor?
- Sorry, I don't speak "college boy."

324
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,853
I said what I meant.
This Beast you're talking about...

325
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,971
...he's looking for a way
to put an end to daylight.

326
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:42,206
He wants to
blot out the sun permanently.

327
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:46,812
So once the totems are dead,
the sun disappears?

328
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:50,966
Not disappears, exactly.
And it's not just killing us either.

329
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:56,253
There's props and a ritual
and a chant and a thing and a...

330
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,244
Suffice to say, it ain't easy.

331
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,691
And folks in the Ra-Tet,
they got some serious juice...

332
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,492
...which is why I never
felt worried before.

333
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:09,132
- But you're worried now.
- Well, there's four out of five down.

334
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:12,929
Let's just say I'm not looking
forward to my retirement in Boca.

335
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,653
So the lights go out. Then what?

336
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:18,885
The city sinks into
never-ending darkness, that's what.

337
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:21,243
Vamps, creepies, crawlies.

338
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,371
Things that go bump in the night
are suddenly bumping 24/7.

339
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,969
- The whole of Los Angeles turns into a...
- A demon playground.

340
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:31,882
Bingo. And that's before
it starts to spread.

341
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:34,851
California, North America.
Eventually...

342
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,004
...hello, global blackout.

343
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:39,607
The world is the devil's oyster.

344
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:43,892
- Well, we gotta stop him.
- You sure do. And good luck with that.

345
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,606
Whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

346
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:50,210
Look, it's probably just a few hours
till this guy catches up with me.

347
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:54,247
I wanna spend my last moments with
my oldest, dearest friends down at...

348
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,973
...the Pink Pony Lounge.

349
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,485
I'll buy you a lap dance
if I can watch.

350
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,809
Forget that.
We can take you somewhere safe.

351
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:06,443
- We can protect you.
- Right. Super Hunk and Spandexia.

352
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:10,282
This thing takes out Mesektet,
and you two are gonna protect me?

353
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,609
I don't see anybody else
lined up for the job.

354
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,371
You think
she'd give me a lap dance?

355
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,127
- Any movement from the Beast?
- Not a peep.

356
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:32,763
Just trying to find ways to kill him.
Which, by the way, there aren't any.

357
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:36,363
That doesn't look like Semkhet.

358
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,849
Semkhet's not available,
sweetheart. Slight case of being...

359
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:42,368
...ripped open to death in a cave.

360
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:46,771
Don't suppose I could interest you
in a short, stocky orb-keeper?

361
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,127
Guys, I'd like you to meet Manny...

362
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:53,603
...the last totem of the Ra-Tet.

363
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,087
This...

364
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:59,724
...is a being of supreme power?
- You ought to see me in my Armani.

365
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,770
What happened
to the second-to-last one?

366
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,441
Somebody already
ripped out the toy surprise.

367
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,762
Good news is,
we discovered the Beast's plan.

368
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:13,251
- Which is?
- To blot out the sun for all of eternity.

369
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:16,644
- You guys got a john?
- Right back there.

370
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,242
Thanks, pal.

371
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,610
Why did the small, yucky man say that?
He's joking, right?

372
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:33,486
Apparently there's a ritual
using members of the Ra-Tet...

373
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,086
...to change day into night.

374
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,604
Forever.

375
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:41,082
As far as evil plans go,
it doesn't suck.

376
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:43,170
ANGEL:
He's killed four of the five so far.

377
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,166
I figure we keep Manny safe,
the lights stay on long enough...

378
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,164
...and we find a way
to defeat the thing.

379
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:52,121
But where are we gonna hide him?
We need a small, controlled space.

380
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:55,649
- Secure the perimeter, guards at all times.
- Kitchen's got a meat locker.

381
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:59,010
Brilliant. Store the one thing
that'll stave off perpetual darkness...

382
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,209
...in the home of the people
the demon knows.

383
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,410
You know what?
You got a better idea, Einstein?

384
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:06,884
Give me time.

385
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,248
- I know a place.
CORDELIA: Great.

386
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:12,126
As long as it's not some
nondescript tenement downtown...

387
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:15,603
...with discarded boxes in the
stairwells and peeling plaster and...

388
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,445
The faint odor of dead people.

389
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:20,081
You didn't have to come
if you didn't want to.

390
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:23,882
But what if I have another vision?
Better I be with you, right?

391
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:27,210
Rather be here than at the hotel,
plowing through annoying books...

392
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:29,933
...with the "symbolic manifestos"
and the "Brilliant!"

393
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,812
MANNY: Never trust the books
or the bookies, kid.

394
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,851
Real juju takes place on the q.t.

395
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,731
That's why you can't find this Beast.
He's too powerful.

396
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,123
- I mean, taking out the Ra-Tet...
GUNN: Speaking of...

397
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:46,285
...ain't you Tet folks supposed to be
all mighty and colossal?

398
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:50,412
"The midday totem is man.
The neutral totem.

399
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,609
The potential of every human soul."

400
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:55,771
So you're just a guy, then?

401
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:59,892
There's more to me than meets the eye.
For example, I'm immortal.

402
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:02,521
Unless I'm
ritually murdered, of course.

403
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,604
Well, it's too bad we came here, then.

404
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:09,204
Because if you're gonna be ritually
murdered, it'll probably be in a hellhole...

405
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,332
...like this.

406
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,245
Come on in.

407
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,410
My butler's already in Tahiti,
so we're on our own here.

408
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:25,885
I'll hit the kitchen for supplies later,
if I can just, well, find the kitchen.

409
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:30,245
The Axis of Pythia, that thing
I used to find you on the higher plane?

410
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:33,211
It's worth $33 million.

411
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:35,284
I gave it back to Gwen
when I was done.

412
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,683
Let's get you set up in the study.

413
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:49,368
I never pass up a good clich<i>e</i>.

414
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,892
It's a panic room too.

415
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,772
Twelve inches of solid steel,
its own ventilation system.

416
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,207
Homey.

417
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,452
You should be safe here.

418
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:04,003
Don't worry, I ain't
expecting any miracles.

419
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:07,643
So, guard duty. What do you think?
You and me, first shift?

420
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:11,044
Wouldn't it make more sense to split up?
One super power per shift?

421
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:14,171
That way, if horn boy shows up,
we mortals might stand a chance.

422
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,131
- Makes sense to me.
- Okay, then, I'll take Denzel.

423
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,646
GUNN:
Actually, it's "Gunn."

424
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:21,168
Not that I mind the freakishly
accurate comparison.

425
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,925
But keep your hands to yourself.

426
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:26,563
Four hours on, four off. Bunk down
off-duty, get as much sleep as we can.

427
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,086
We're already tired.

428
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,448
Got a long few days ahead of us.

429
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:36,441
Hey, Gwen, don't suppose
this joint's got Skinemax?

430
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,892
GWEN: So then after the second
gardener and the fourth nanny...

431
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,964
...I got sent to the Academy.

432
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:55,048
Something tells me my origin story
isn't enough to fascinate you.

433
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:59,684
Oh, no, it is.
I was just... Just thinking.

434
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:03,323
Gunn, I already apologized for killing you.
What more do you want, a wake?

435
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,245
It isn't that.

436
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:09,405
Then it's the English guy, isn't it?

437
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:12,292
I saw the way he looked at your girl.

438
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:15,047
A good thief
is a master of body language.

439
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,569
He starts talking with his body,
he's gonna have a serious problem.

440
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,052
I'm surprised.

441
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:24,604
A few months ago, she was ready
to wear sackcloth and ashes for you.

442
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,645
When did the landscape change?

443
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:33,092
Long story.

444
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,685
[DOOR OPENS]

445
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,766
- How's Manny?
GUNN: Fine.

446
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,367
Gave him some magazines
to keep him occupied.

447
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,001
Swimsuit edition.
He's occupied.

448
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:46,324
Come on.
Show you where you can crash.

449
00:27:56,213 --> 00:28:00,729
So all this time alone together...

450
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,883
...could be good for us.

451
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,202
Maybe we should talk.

452
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,963
Maybe we shouldn't.

453
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:19,849
Valid point.

454
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,332
Angel, get up.

455
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:35,688
Cordy. Cordy, come on,
snap out of it.

456
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,172
Jeez! I'm awake.

457
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,369
What are you doing,
falling asleep on watch?

458
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,091
- I wasn't...
- What's happening?

459
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,845
...asleep.

460
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:44,282
Manny.

461
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:56,281
- It got him.
- Ugh, You think?

462
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:04,725
So was that one of Manny's powers?
Extra blood and guts?

463
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:07,487
Because, I mean, that's a lot
of blood and guts in there.

464
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,644
No way all that
came out of a normal guy.

465
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,725
That was the Beast.
It was looking for something Manny had.

466
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,884
How do you know?

467
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,771
Emptied out his head to find it.

468
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:17,962
Ugh.

469
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,165
Wait. Manny said he was
an orb-keeper, right?

470
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:22,686
Maybe he kept an orb.

471
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,684
- In his head?
- Where do you keep yours?

472
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,571
ANGEL:
Hold on a second.

473
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,045
- She's right.
- Of course.

474
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,771
Semkhet, the demon in the cave.

475
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,572
You said someone already
pulled out the toy surprise.

476
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,610
Did I?

477
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:38,729
It's pulling something out
of these totems.

478
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,770
And you knew that.

479
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:44,807
Something you're not telling me, Gwen?

480
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,688
All right. My client?

481
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,809
The Beast grabbed something
out of him too.

482
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,531
A little, metal boxy thing.

483
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,365
You neglected to mention this fact.

484
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:57,524
I thought the box
might be worth something.

485
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:00,765
Look, the apocalypse was coming,
there was a giant killer demon.

486
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,286
I panicked.

487
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:05,570
I'm still a thief, and as a rule,
we don't share information.

488
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:07,246
GUNN:
Okay, what about this cave demon?

489
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:09,643
Think the big ugly went
hunting inside of him?

490
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:12,202
- It's definitely possible.
- Yes.

491
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,888
But what's impossible is thinking
that somehow, some way...

492
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,487
...the Beast found where
we were hiding...

493
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,883
...spiked the drinks
we made ourselves...

494
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,931
...snuck through this
unreasonably large apartment...

495
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:27,290
...on the tippy-toes of his cloven feet,

...and killed poor Manny,
unseen and unheard.

497
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:34,964
Maybe whoever did it
didn't have cloven feet.

"The answer is among you."
I can't be the only one thinking it.

499
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,931
Don't be ridiculous. Connor doesn't
even know where we are.

500
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:44,687
- You didn't call him?
- He doesn't have a phone.

501
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:46,612
I can't believe you'd...

502
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,004
Even if she didn't call him,
that boy can track anybody, anywhere.

503
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:52,607
I'd know if he'd been here.
I'd be able to smell him.

504
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:56,322
Same way you smelled whatever
it was spiking your blood?

505
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,609
This is impossible.

I thought we were pretty clear
on the whole "impossible" issue.

We've just gotta rewind the tapes.

tell them about Manny.

Let me check the system log.

519
00:31:42,173 --> 00:31:45,051
- You have to talk to him, Angel.
- Who, Gunn? I just did.

520
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:48,444
Connor, you dolt. And you know
who I meant, so why push my buttons?

521
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:51,332
Maybe because it's nice
to make you crazy for a change.

522
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,725
You can't seriously think he did it, when
there are other, more liar-like suspects.

523
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:59,203
Well, so far, he's the only one
who's got a connection to the Beast.

524
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:01,841
I've got the origin of the blackout.

525
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:05,849
It kicked off in a small subset
of the municipal A-14 grid.

526

That's the one under this block.

527
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,805
- About 10 minutes before your watch.
- What does that mean?

528
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,362
That somebody knew when you'd
take over that watch...

529
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,569
...and somebody knew
whose drinks to spike.

530
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,611
- This is an inside job.
- Funny how you were inside at the time.

531
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,685
Enough. Let's just focus on the guy
trying to blot out the sun.

536
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,844
Looks like there's
some assembly required.

537
00:32:38,013 --> 00:32:41,130
Turns out these three pieces
were inside the totems.

538
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,443
Beast kills the totems,
yanks out the pieces...

539
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,808
...and builds himself
a big, old light switch.

540
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:48,931
Well, what about the other two?
What'd he take out of them?

541
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,402
He sucked the energy
out of the little girl...

542
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,962
...and he ripped the heart
out of the shaman...

543
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,488
...but what's not clear
is how he's gonna use them.

544
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:59,406
These wings.
They're metal, right?

545
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:01,484
Get me close enough,
and I can melt them.

546
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,928
- That'll slow him down.
- Lf we find him in time.

547
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:09,045
He's already got all the pieces. Plus, we
don't know where he'll perform this ritual.

548
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,569
I'm not worried about slowing him down.
