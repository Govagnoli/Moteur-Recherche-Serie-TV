1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:05,230
We fade up on an aerial
shot, Downtown skyscrapers, lights...

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:06,830
...yadda, yadda,

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,050
We hear a famous narrator...

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,730
...maybe that bald Star Trek guy
or one of the Baldwins,

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,609
And he says, "It's a big,
bad city out there, "

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,629
Cut to a woman walking
down a dark, spooky street, alone,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,789
We'll cast some beautiful,
young actress,

8
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,690
A starlet whose career
is on the verge of taking off,

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,750
Anyway, she's all nervous, right?
Mucho vulnerable,

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,740
The voice guy says,
"Danger lurks around every corner, "

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:37,960
She's attacked by a big...

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,609
...goon with a knife,

13
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,130
She screams, "Help!

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,210
Is there no one to help me?"

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,350
Well, now there's someone
who'll answer your call,

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,390
He'll protect you...

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,719
...and catch you when you fall,

18
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,100
You can count on it,

19
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:00,359
And you can count on me,
because I'm the Dark Avenger.

20
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,879
- I'm the what?
- The Dark Avenger.

21
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,519
- I'm the Dark Avenger.
- I know, it's perfect.

22
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,530
We can shoot it ourselves.

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,980
I'll charm a post-production house
into doing the effects and--

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,530
I know something about self-promotion.

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,900
One commercial like this could help
get us out of the red, or the black...

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,980
...or whichever means we're broke,
that's us.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,739
Buffy blows into town and puts
you in a permanent funk...

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,980
...and I'm supposed to stand and
watch our business go belly-up?

29
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,239
He's not entirely wrong.

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,819
Advertising a superhero who
can't really go out in the daylight...

31
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,870
...may raise vampire suspicions.

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,849
Not to mention our lack...

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,540
...of an investigator's license.

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,959
Who needs a license
without any clients?

35
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,069
We'll manage, princess.
We always do.

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,849
We will if we project the right image.

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,319
And now I am suddenly thinking
Angel's all wrong for this commercial.

38
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,879
He's larger than life, way too
Braveheart for Joe Couch Potato...

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,280
...to relate to. We need someone...

40
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,680
...who's average...

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,930
...run of the mill, ordinary....

42
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,870
You're perfect.

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,740
- I appreciate the compliment--
- Come into the light.

44
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,969
Let's create cheekbones, okay?

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm not photogenic,
plus I get dry mouth.

46
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,990
Excuse me? This is not a
negotiation, this is a necessity.

47
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,159
Our boss is in a funk. He's
only happy when he's fighting evil.

48
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,500
Now let's drum up some.

49
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,419
I don't know what we need evil for
when we got you.

50
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,729
I heard that.

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,939
"If you need help,
then look no further.

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,729
Angel Investigations is the best.

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,860
- Our rats are low--"
- Rates!

54
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,490
It says "rats."

55
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,409
"Our rates are low,
but our standards are high.

56
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,810
When the chips are down, and
you're at the end of your rope...

57
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,360
...you need someone to count on.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,319
That's what you'll find here.
Someone who'll go all the way...

59
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,699
...who will protect you always.

60
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,110
So don't lose hope.

61
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,460
Come on over to our offices...

62
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,669
...and you'll see that there's
still heroes in this world."

63
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,330
Is that it? Am I done?

64
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,669
I don't know. I'm not
getting everyman, I'm getting...

65
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,790
...weasel.

66
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,629
We don't want weasel.

67
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,449
People will pour in when
they hear about our low rats.

68
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,509
I can try it again.

69
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:28,519
I don't think so.

70
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,660
Weasel factor, huh?

71
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,879
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry. I'm just--

72
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,250
I feel hopeless with him down there
doing the nonprofit brooding.

73
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,490
It's not like he has a heart.

74
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,040
How could it be so broken?

75
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,860
I guess seeing Buffy
got him where he lives.

76
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,470
That's all very sad,
but we live here too.

77
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,410
I'll talk to him.

78
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,399
Maybe if we get him a costume.

79
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
- A costume?
- The guy's a bona fide hero.

80
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,680
Would it kill him to wear tights
for some publicity?

81
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,399
I don't see Angel putting on tights.

82
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,720
Oh, now I do, and it's
really disturbing.

83
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,879
Hey. Is this a private catharsis
or can anyone watch?

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,189
What do you want?

85
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,819
There's a girl who's not
sad enough to cry in my arms...

86
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,069
...but keep up the dark cloud.
I might get lucky.

87
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,089
I just need a little time.

88
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,360
Believe me, I know.

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,759
Last time I saw my ex, she was around
for five minutes and I was a wreck.

90
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,410
It's amazing how they can
do that to you.

91
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,240
Buffy was here more
than five minutes.

92
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,180
Okay.

93
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,980
Ten, but who's counting?

94
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,639
Actually, she was here
for a whole day and night.

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,379
One of us has been drinking...

96
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,389
...and I'm sad to say
it isn't me.

97
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,850
Why didn't you tell me about
the Oracles, Doyle?

98
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,389
The Oracles?
Who told you about the Oracles?

99
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,279
The Mohra demon got away
the first time.

100
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,629
What first time?

101
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,220
I killed it. Some of its blood
mixed with mine and made me mortal.

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,149
That's when you took me
to see the Oracles.

103
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,220
No, see, I'd remember a trip to
the netherworld.

104
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,350
- It doesn't happen every day.
- They said I was released from duty.

105
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,970
Buffy and I were together until...

106
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,959
...we realized it couldn't be.

107
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,699
We don't belong to ourselves.

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,939
We belong in the world, fighting.

109
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,560
So I went back to the Oracles...

110
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,639
...and asked them to
turn back the clock...

111
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,740
...as though that day
had never happened.

112
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,060
Human? You were a real live
flesh and blood human being.

113
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,459
And you and Buffy....

114
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,930
You had the one thing you wanted in
your life and you gave it back?

115
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,480
- Maybe I was wrong.
- Or maybe Cordelia was right.

116
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,050
About you being the real deal
in the hero department.

117
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,069
See, I would've chosen the pleasures
of the flesh over duty and honor.

118
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,649
I don't have that strength.

119
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,370
You never know till you're tested.

120
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,149
You've lived, loved, fought
and vanquished in a day...

121
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,610
...and I'm still trying to
ask Cordy out for dinner.

122
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,790
Not to mention telling her
I'm half demon.

123
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,050
That should come first, huh?

124
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,259
They said something bad is coming.
Soldiers of Darkness...

125
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,279
...and the End of Days.

126
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,990
So much for long-term savings bonds.

127
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,990
I don't know what's coming,
but I know we're part of it.

128
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,800
If it's a fight they want,
can't someone else give it to them?

129
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:42,389
It seems unfair. You gotta
save all the helpless...

130
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,720
...now you gotta fight
the apocalypse?

131
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:46,949
It's all the same thing.

132
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,540
Fight the good fight,
whichever way you can.

133
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,230
Tell you what, you fight,
and I'll keep score.

134
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,240
Angel started the day over knowing
he'd remember everything?

135
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,329
That's pretty amazing, huh?

136
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,129
Amazing he didn't check stock quotes
or the lotto numbers.

137
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,639
He should've told us what happened.

138
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,180
We can't keep secrets from each other.

139
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,480
No, we can't.

140
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,889
Thanks.

141
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,509
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about secrets and whatnot.

142
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:30,829
My marriage would've
stood a better chance...

143
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,720
...if me and Harry talked more.

144
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,559
Really let each other in.

145
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,220
So, how is she?
You two keeping in touch?

146
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,320
- Well, she's decided to stay in L.A.
- Oh.

147
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,149
You'll probably be seeing
a lot of each other, then.

148
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,480
Well, not right away. We both
need to get on with our lives.

149
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,740
- Getting on is good.
- If I want a lasting relationship...

150
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,429
...I need to put a few cards
on the table.

151
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,190
Such as?

152
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,730
Thing of it is...

153
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,149
...I'm a little bit more
than meets the--

154
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,299
Oh, oh, I know this one.

155
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,809
Mask, Mask-head.

156
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,809
The Man With Two Brains,

157
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,190
Whoever you saw just now...

158
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,610
...did they look like they
could afford to pay?

159
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,360
Pretty low-rent,
even by demon standards.

160
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,500
You said they were hiding.
It's a good place for it.

161
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,250
Doyle.

162
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,960
Signs of life.

163
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,830
I smell something.

164
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,629
Still warm. They left in a hurry.

165
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,750
Not food.

166
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,409
Fear.

167
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,149
Don't be afraid.

168
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,840
It's okay. We're here to help.

169
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,259
We gave our money to a man
for passports...

170
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,879
...and safe passage on a ship.

171
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,700
We didn't know. It was stupid of us.

172
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,519
He disappeared with our money
and the ship never came.

173
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,279
- Where were you going?
- Briole...

174
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,850
...a small island off
the coast of Ecuador.

175
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,610
Others of our kind have
found sanctuary there.

176
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,700
Sanctuary from whom?

177
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,029
They're close.

178
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,299
They almost got us.
We lost half our supplies.

179
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,980
Rieff, we have a guest.

180
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,000
It's the Promised One.

181
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,009
Terrific.

182
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,620
There's been a misunderstanding.

183
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,649
I don't think so. Many of
our prophesies are cryptic...

184
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,019
...but one thing is clear:
In the final days of this century...

185
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,710
...the Promised One will
save us from the Scourge.

186
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,509
- The Scourge?
- He doesn't even know who they are.

187
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,419
How can he protect us?

188
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,539
They're coming!
No matter how many...

189
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,710
...promised guys you throw at them,
they won't stop until we're dead.

190
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,269
You're gonna get us all killed.

191
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,210
He's young. I'm sorry.

192
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,220
Excuse me.

193
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,460
We need to deal with this.
They think I'm some promised savior.

194
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:54,990
What?

195
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,279
The Scourge.

196
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:58,899
You know them?

197
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,330
What are they?

198
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,269
Death.

199
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,409
- Who's there?
- A friend.

200
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:36,210
I don't have any.

201
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,860
All right.
I'm more like a relative...

202
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,710
...who needs your help.

203
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,129
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

204
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,019
My name is Lucas.
I'm a Brachen demon, like you.

205
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,259
My clan has been living in the woods,
in Oregon. Safe, until they came.

206
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,149
Not all of us escaped.

207
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,659
I don't know what you think I can do.

208
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,529
I got problems of my own.

209
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,690
They know we're here.
They're coming for us.

210
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,190
What are you talking about?
Who's coming for you?

211
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,740
The Scourge.

212
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,389
Who the hell is that?

213
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,669
An army of pure-blood demons.

214
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,070
They hate us mixed-heritage types.

215
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,110
Very into pedigree.

216
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,580
They hunt us down like animals.

217
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,330
- No one fights back?
- Sure they do.

218
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,289
All the time. You can kill them.

219
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,409
They believe in what they're doing.

220
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,009
They're ready to die for the cause.

221
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,240
Hard to fight fanatics.

222
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,480
- More like impossible.
- I'm not asking you to fight...

223
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,580
- ...just help us hide for a while.
- You got the wrong guy, pal.

224
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,639
Want to set up a little off-track
betting? I got the know-how.

225
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,960
But demon-hiding? It's not my line.

226
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,799
- You're one of us.
- No, I'm not.

227
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,700
I was raised human.

228
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,879
I'm not looking to explore me roots.

229
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,879
We don't have anyone else to turn to.

230
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,909
I don't know what to tell you.

231
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:09,850
You're up against something big.

232
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,649
Anybody that helps you,
they're taking a chance.

233
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,850
And I'm not, you know,
dying to take chances.

234
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:22,649
Doyle, if you don't believe
we share a common family...

235
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,690
...believe we share a common enemy.

236
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,799
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

237
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,129
Guess not.

238
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,710
I punked out,

239
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,980
I just found out about my demon side.
I didn't know what it meant.

240
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:51,059
The idea of sudden obligations with
guys that looked like pincushions...

241
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,960
...was a little too much
to take then.

242
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,559
Then what happened?

243
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,159
Damn it.

244
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:26,960
Believe we share a common enemy,

245
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,090
When I got the visions
I thought it was a stroke,

246
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,690
I didn't know what the images meant.

247
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,090
But I had to know if it was a dream...

248
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,889
...or real,

249
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,200
It wasn't a dream,

250
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,420
- You couldn't have known.
- They need more than a Promised One.

251
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,319
The contractually obligated
500 might be a start.

252
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,730
You can't fight the Scourge, Angel.

253
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,400
It won't come to that,
because we'll get them out.

254
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,529
Hello?

255
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,490
Angel?

256
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:09,240
Hello.

257
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:14,670
While this may look like a
popular brand of breath freshener...

258
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,529
...it's really a cunningly disguised
demon repellent.

259
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,789
- Wintergreen.
- Cordy, it's okay.

260
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,740
We're here to help them.

261
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,700
Oh. Hi.

262
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,130
- Where's Angel?
- Securing documents for safe passage.

263
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,849
- Did you get the truck?
- Yes, it's out front.

264
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,940
Hey, Doyle, you did notice
that these folks are demons?

265
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,980
Yeah, I know that.
It doesn't make them bad people.

266
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,410
Excuse us a sec?

267
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,799
Okay, mission statement check.
We battle the forces of darkness.

268
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,509
They're half-human
and they're in trouble.

269
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,109
We don't have time.
Angel wants you to go to the harbor.

270
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,400
Pier 12, slip four, The Quintessa,

271
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,069
Use Angel's name,
he knows the captain.

272
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,180
- So we're booking them on a cruise?
- Basically, yeah.

273
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,420
- I guess not Carnival.
- He runs a freighter.

274
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,269
He owes Angel some money.
He does this, they're even.

275
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,130
Hang on. This guy owes Angel money?

276
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,190
- Why aren't we collecting it?
- Cordy, oppressed demon people here.

277
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:23,819
Not getting safer.

278
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:27,339
- So we pay to send them on a cruise?
- Please.

279
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,640
Just do it.

280
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,200
We need to know the ship is ready
before we can move.

281
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,519
Bad things are coming, aren't they?

282
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,089
Very bad things.

283
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,000
- I'm on it.
- Call me the minute it's done.

284
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,170
Okay.

285
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,579
- I can get into trouble doing this.
- Not as much as if you don't.

286
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:56,319
I look the other way on some
of Randy's shipments...

287
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,500
...because he's my brother,
not because of the money.

288
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,619
Family's important.

289
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,509
- So you're not going to pay?
- I'm not paying.

290
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,700
- It's extortion.
- Big Randy told you about me, right?

291
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,859
- He said you bit him.
- I never bit him.

292
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,009
- So you don't--
- I wasn't hungry.

293
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,240
- What should the documents say?
- The ship...

294
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,099
...is carrying a cargo
of medical waste.

295
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:24,480
No one looks inside or tries
to stop it from leaving port.

296
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,259
If they do, I'm gonna be feeling
it's your fault.

297
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,029
Then look for me to get
a little bit peckish.

298
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,180
Have a nice trip.

299
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,839
We don't have time for this.
What's wrong with that boy?

300
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,720
- What is it?
- Rieff. He took off.

301
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,920
He does this every time.

302
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,220
He'll be back.

303
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,380
No, he won't.

304
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,750
He says there isn't any Promised One.

305
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,700
And he wasn't gonna stay here
and get killed with the rest of us.

306
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,940
- We're not gonna get killed, are we?
- No.

307
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,710
No one's gonna get killed.

308
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,920
Clear out when Cordelia calls.

309
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,789
Go to the ship. If you're not here,
I'll take the boy there.

310
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,509
Hey.

311
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:26,109
Do you know where he went?

312
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,079
Rieff, wait!

313
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,480
Wait!

314
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,470
- You're fast.
- I'm walking.

315
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:44,309
- You're just old.
- Yeah, okay.

316
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,509
We ought to go. Angel's got a ship.

317
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,500
Great. Have fun.
Take some Dramamine.

318
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,710
- You're not coming with?
- You can't make me.

319
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,539
You're right. You're old enough.

320
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,869
It's your choice.

321
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,579
Right, a choice.

322
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,200
Where do I want to be hated?

323
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,109
You wouldn't get it.

324
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,750
You're passing. My mother
was the same way.

325
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:12,589
Could walk down the streets.

326
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,829
She took me out with her one day.
I was so excited.

327
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,269
In the neighborhood
with the other kids.

328
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,809
You know what day it was?

329
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,170
What day was it?

330
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,170
It was Halloween.

331
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,809
So that's my choice.

332
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,269
I can be hated by humans
because they're scared...

333
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,009
...or by pure-bloods
who want to kill me.

334
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,299
It's so easy, it's not
much of a choice.

335
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:45,160
Seems your family's one
place you know you belong.

336
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:46,789
Hey.

337
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,869
- Bet that little girl will miss you.
- Yeah, well, she's dead by now.

338
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,940
Or might as well be.

339
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,299
They're coming again, I can feel it.

340
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,990
- It's different this time.
- Why?

341
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,029
Because of the Promised One?

342
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:09,720
- So you know it's not true.
- No, I don't.

343
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,869
I don't know about your people's
myths and legends...

344
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,250
...but I do know Angel,
and he's the genuine article.

345
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,220
- A hero.
- Yeah, that's exactly what he is.

346
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,529
They can call him whatever they like.
What does it matter?

347
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,779
It matters because it's a lie.

348
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:30,650
They put their faith in something.
You don't have to if you don't want.

349
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,039
Maybe Angel doesn't know
what he's doing.

350
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,019
But the other option, losing
yourself, hoping it all goes away...

351
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,089
...I know that never works.

352
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,539
How about we go find your family?

353
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,000
Well, it's not exactly
The Love Boat, is it?

354
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,539
Sorry, we haul cargo, not people.

355
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,710
- It's never complained.
- We can bring in some blankets.

356
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:00,240
How many are we talking?

357
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,079
Maybe 20. Some are short people,
you know, children.

358
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,670
It won't be too comfortable but
we'll get them where they're going.

359
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,140
We'll take it.

360
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:16,680
- Hey, this way.
- Huh?

361
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,329
I thought all Brachens
had good sense of direction.

362
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:22,150
Yeah, we're all pretty good at
basketball too.

363
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:25,819
What?

364
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,450
They're here.

365
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:41,849
Come on, let's go.

366
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,269
Go!

367
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,670
In there.

368
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,190
Check up there!

369
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,119
Sit tight.

370
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,660
Destroy it all!

371
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,900
Doyle.

372
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,690
Stay here.

373
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,420
You understand?

374
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,990
- Get him!
- There! Go, go!

375
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,750
Here's one!

376
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:45,480
Kill him!

377
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,029
Take your squad on
the east side, move!

378
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,589
They're coming.

379
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,049
Good.

380
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,630
They were here, sir. Recently.

381
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,539
And when the lights come on,
where do the vermin go?

382
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:35,980
- Keep looking.
- For what?

383
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,289
This?

384
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,609
Back off, it's my kill.

385
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,230
Vampires don't feed on demon blood.

386
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,299
Please. I wouldn't eat this.
He reeks of humanity.

387
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:50,599
You're one to talk, vampire.

388
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,750
Yours is the lowest
of all half-breeds.

389
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,730
You think I don't know that?

390
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:58,500
You think I don't smell the humanity
inside me, day and night...

391
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,829
- ...polluting me?
- Please don't!

392
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,490
Shut up!

393
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,059
A half-breed who murders other
half-breeds. Always charming.

394
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,519
I know who you are.
I want to join you.

395
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,089
Join us? You wish to die?

396
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,509
I need to be cleansed,
and only you can show me the way.

397
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:21,509
Kill me if you want,
you'd only be freeing me.

398
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:24,930
I can kill half-breeds for you.
I do it faster and better...

399
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,880
...than anyone you've got.

400
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,019
I know their minds, where they hide...

401
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,029
...what they think.

402
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,329
I can help you.

403
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,529
Maybe you can.

404
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:49,680
Bring him! Take him
to area one, now! Move!

405
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,430
Faster! Come on!

406
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,789
I think I hated that plan.

407
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,990
Can all Brachen demons do that?

408
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,710
We're stronger in demon form.

409
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,779
But I generally prefer
to pass as human.

410
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,490
Where is everyone?

411
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:49,849
Where they're supposed to be,
I hope.

412
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,200
Look, I got my clearance.
We have to go now.

413
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,849
- I've got a schedule to keep.
- They'll be here.

414
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,150
Just a few more minutes.

415
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,349
Angel said he'd cut half my debt
for this favor, right?

416
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,130
Yep. Half. That's what he said.
Big whopping 50 percent.

417
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:08,099
- Quite a deal.
- He takes 60 percent off...

418
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:09,549
...then I wait.

419
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,369
You drive a hard bargain.

420
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,140
We can't thank you enough.
I'm sure Rieff's in safe hands.

421
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,720
- Doyle will get him here.
- He's a good one.

422
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,160
He understands our suffering.

423
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,130
We both do.

424
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,180
I didn't mean to say
that you didn't.

425
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,440
It's just more familiar for Doyle.

426
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,839
He has to live with persecution.
You always do when you're half demon.

427
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,240
Demon?

428
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,400
The other day, I was asked:

429
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,119
Why hunt the mongrel?

430
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,519
Doesn't its very inferiority
guarantee that it poses no threat?

431
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,640
Won't it die of its own innate,
mortal stupidity?

432
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,369
Let me tell you...

433
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,630
...even the smallest of vermin
need be addressed.

434
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,180
Half-breeds. Worse.
They keep cross-breeding...

435
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,470
...forever diluting our precious
demon blood...

436
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:12,259
...with their weak,
simpering humanity.

437
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:15,190
If we allow this to happen...

438
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,329
...it's like giving up
the call to evil altogether.

439
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:21,789
It's as good as turning human
ourselves.

440
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, I say never!

441
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:27,119
I say, we will not stop...

442
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,660
...until every half-breed
is erased...

443
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,380
...and our purity rules this planet!

444
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,700
We will not stop because
the higher order demands it!

445
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:41,720
Now, this very evening...

446
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,039
...we take a giant step
towards our goal.

447
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,220
Tonight, the half-breeds
that have eluded us...

448
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,450
...will be destroyed.

449
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,829
And we know how to find them
thanks to this good man.

450
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,329
First mate on a ship
they think means salvation...

451
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,519
...not annihilation.

452
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,539
He comes to us for money,
but he is a brother to our cause.

453
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,220
And we invite him...

454
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,660
...to witness the power of the beacon.

455
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,750
Tonight, the Lister half-breeds....

456
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,079
Incredible, isn't he?

457
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,849
- He makes it all so clear.
- Yes.

458
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,579
- Things are very clear.
- The Listers...

459
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,960
...along with any creatures
contaminated with human blood...

460
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:37,700
...will perish the moment this
cleansing light touches them.

461
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,900
When it achieves full power
and detonates...

462
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,519
...its deadly reach will extend
a quarter mile in every direction.

463
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,240
Want to see how it works?

464
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:02,650
A fitting end for a sorry mutation.

465
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,460
Go now! And deliver this,
our message!

466
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,529
Our victory depends on it!

467
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,190
Someone's coming!

468
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,940
Do you know what you put us through?
We gotta get out of here.

469
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,190
- I'm sorry.
- Let's get you down with the others.

470
00:32:58,329 --> 00:32:59,200
Thanks.

471
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,529
- What?
- You're alive.

472
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:06,759
And you're not happy?

473
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,690
We were worried.

474
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,750
Oh. Well, it's all gonna be okay--

475
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,799
What was that for?

476
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,200
Why didn't you tell me
you were half demon?

477
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:22,880
I thought we agreed
that secrets are bad.

478
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:27,859
I wanted to tell you.

479
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,309
I was afraid.

480
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,309
- I thought if I did, you'd reject me.
- I've rejected you way before now.

481
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:37,779
So you're half demon. Big whoop.

482
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,880
I can't believe you think
I'd care about that.

483
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,299
I work for a vampire. Hello!

484
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:47,200
- It's true. I just--
- Do you think I'm superficial?

485
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,119
Being half demon is
far down the list.

486
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,029
Way under short and poor.

487
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,710
Anything else I should know?

488
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,009
No, the half demon thing
is my big secret.

489
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:06,579
Good.

490
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,219
That's out. It's done.

491
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,050
Would you ask me out
for dinner already?

492
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,760
Yeah?

493
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,789
Cordelia...

494
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,269
- ...would you like to--
- It's Angel.

495
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,610
- We have to go now.
- What's going on?

496
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,500
- I can't find my first mate.
- Go to the bridge.

497
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,500
They're here.

498
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,980
- Angel.
- Get below. Lock the doors.

499
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,369
- But--
- Move! Now!

500
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,130
Stay with the others.

501
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,969
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

502
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,389
Lock the hatches!
The Scourge is here!

503
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,320
We're shoving off,
we're gonna make it.

504
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,780
You lied to us, half-breed.

505
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,699
You catch on quick, football-head.

506
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,670
Kill him.

507
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:17,800
Painfully.

508
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,070
It's gonna detonate.

509
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,500
Get out! Everyone out! Now!

510
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,139
Welcome to a cleaner world.
Soon, only the pure...

511
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:15,119
...will be left standing.

512
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,960
Actually, pure boy...

513
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,829
...you'll be on your ass.

514
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:23,880
Locked from the outside,
we're trapped!

515
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,099
- What's this?
- Kills anything with human blood.

516
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,769
It's getting brighter
and that little doohickey's....

517
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,139
It's fully armed, isn't it?

518
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,480
Almost.

519
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,630
I think I can still pull the cables.

520
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,750
Without touching the light?

521
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,489
- It's suicide.
- There's gotta be another way.

522
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,280
- It's all right.
- No!

523
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,159
The good fight, yeah?

524
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,679
You never know until
you've been tested.

525
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,530
I get that now.

526
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,869
Too bad we'll never know...

527
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,949
...if this is a face
you could learn to love.

528
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,000
Doyle.

529
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,449
Doyle.

530
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:07,539
Doyle!

531
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,769
Doyle!

532
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:11,530
No!

533
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,449
No!

534
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,940
If you need help,
then look no further,

535
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,230
Angel Investigations is the best,

536
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,320
- Our rats are low--
- Rates!

537
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:27,789
It says "rats, "

538
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,179
Our rates are low,
but our standards are high,

539
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,110
When the chips are down...

540
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:39,110
...and you're at the end
of your rope...

541
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,409
...you need someone to count on,

542
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,670
That's what you'll find here,
Someone who'll go all the way...

543
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:49,130
... who will protect you
no matter what,

544
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,340
Come on over to our offices...

545
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:56,469
...and you'll see that there's
still heroes in this world,

546
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,280
Is that it?

547
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:09,010
Am I done?
