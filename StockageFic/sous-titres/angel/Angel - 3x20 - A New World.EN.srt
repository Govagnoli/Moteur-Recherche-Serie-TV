1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:02,799
Previously;

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,679
They've been feeding you your son's
blood so you'll like it and want more.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,289
Angelus is in his nature.
The beast will re-emerge.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,939
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,960
Hello, son. Your name is Steven
Franklin Thomas, and I'm your father.

6
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,890
- Give us the kid.
- Anyone tries to take him, he dies.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,980
You look into the Quor-toth,
the darkest of the dark worlds.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,510
Daniel!

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,090
There are no portals to Quor-toth.
Punching through requires dark magics.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,689
The kind of power
it takes centuries to build.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,450
There's almost always some
cosmic price to using primordial powers.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,670
- What are you fleeing from?
- The Destroyer.

13
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,600
It's coming after you, Angel.

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,030
Hi, Dad.

15
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,849
Wait!

16
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,200
No!

17
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,489
Interesting.

18
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:50,719
My God.

19
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,520
It's you.

20
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,180
Connor.

21
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,419
Angel!

22
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,909
Look, will you just stop for a--?

23
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,860
- Can't we just talk about this?
- No.

24
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,189
Wait!

25
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,719
Okay, everybody just calm down.

26
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,460
Angel, if Peter Pan here
doesn't stop--

27
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,459
No!

28
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,310
Connor!

29
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,980
You're gonna fry out here, man.
Come on.

30
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,920
We'll go.

31
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,470
- Anybody get the bus number?
- 17. I'll see where it ends up.

32
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,889
- Let me check online. It'll be faster.
- That was it, Angel.

33
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,050
No, it isn't.
I'm gonna find him.

34
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,350
The fight you just had. It was
the vision I warned you about.

35
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,480
- You never mentioned Connor.
- Because I only saw you.

36
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,569
Angel, we sure this was Connor?
Just because he said "Hi, Dad"?

37
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,560
It was him.

38
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,560
- He was just in diapers, now he's a teen?
- Tell me we don't live in a soap opera.

39
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,899
I'm less worried about how he
grew up than why he came back.

40
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,540
He came back because he could.
He found a way to escape that place.

41
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,240
That's a possibility.

42
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,500
Here's another: You sure he said
"Hi, Dad" and not "You're dead"?

43
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,860
He's angry and afraid.
As soon as we talk-- Fred?

44
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,839
The 17 ends up at Union Station.

45
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,730
I'll go underground.
Somebody hit the streets.

46
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,259
- You got it, man.
- We will not fail, man.

47
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,300
Let's split up.

48
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,449
You guys start at the end of the line,
work your way--

49
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,279
Okay, that can't be good.

50
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,509
The dimensional rift from Quor-toth
must still be open.

51
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,709
Let's close it up before anything
else slithers or slides out of there.

52
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:29,259
Amen to that.

53
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,629
Princess, perhaps your newfound
powers can seal it shut.

54
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,009
Can't hurt to try.

55
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,610
I command you, close!

56
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,540
Okay, I got nothing.

57
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,439
- We do know somebody who might--
- No.

58
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,079
I already went to Wes'.
Can't do that again.

59
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,240
Well, I might know a guy
who knows another guy.

60
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,860
Is it dangerous?

61
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,310
It's not dangerous, it's just awkward.
This guy's all hands.

62
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,269
I mean, all hands. Like, 50 of them.
Anybody fluent in sign language?

63
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,980
We can't all leave when we have
a cosmic crack hanging over us.

64
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,129
Then I will stay...

65
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,149
...and guard the hotel.

66
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,459
I'm with him. You two hit the streets.
Lorne?

67
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,620
Already gone.

68
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,120
You went to Wesley's for me.

69
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,709
He's the one who told you
how to save me.

70
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah. He made it clear.

71
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,670
That's a door none of us
is ever gonna be knocking on again.

72
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,060
I would've called, but I figured
you'd tell me to go to hell...

73
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,100
...so I thought I'd just take a shot
and drop by.

74
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,139
- Invite me in?
- No.

75
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,050
Okay.

76
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,709
Not what I expected. You know,
bunch of flowers, some get-well cards.

77
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,949
Maybe a couple of those balloons
with the smiley faces on them.

78
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,790
I guess when she slit your throat
she nicked your sense of humor.

79
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,040
Not at all.
I find you being here extremely funny.

80
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:32,419
- How's that?
- Because you're going to offer me a job.

81
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,500
It's a shame, really, what happened.

82
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,840
You dedicate your life to a cause,
and the very people you try to help...

83
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,269
...turn their backs on you.

84
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,529
Yes, tragic.

85
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,299
Now get the hell out.

86
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,850
A man with your talents, a scholar,
a man of intellect....

87
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,789
Inside knowledge
of Angel Investigations.

88
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,070
Did I mention Wolfram and Hart
has the finest library of...

89
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,370
...mystical, occult and supernatural
reference material in the world?

90
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,690
Full medical, dental, 4O1(k) package.

91
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,830
- Not interested.
- Hey, it was worth a shot.

92
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,570
Anyway, here's something to help pass
the time in the unemployment line.

93
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,799
- Dante's Divine Comedy.
- It's just part one, "The Inferno."

94
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,720
It's not a first edition. More like the
1500s. But it's in the original Tuscan.

95
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,259
- Have you read it?
- Several times.

96
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,950
Then you know it's a guided tour
of the nine levels of hell.

97
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,080
Yes. Descending concentric rings
based on the severity of the sin.

98
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,799
You know...

99
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,850
...I always forget. At the very
bottom of hell, in the ninth circle...

100
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,659
...the devil's frozen in ice, right?
He's got three heads, three mouths...

101
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,649
...and those mouths are reserved
for the worst sinners.

102
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:07,639
Now, I can't remember,
who is in the center mouth?

103
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,590
What was his name?

104
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,480
The one person in all of human history
deemed the greatest sinner....

105
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,110
Who is it?

106
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,019
Judas Iscariot.

107
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,110
Right.

108
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,039
The worst spot in hell is reserved
for those who betray.

109
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,340
So don't pretend you're too good
to work for us.

110
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,830
- Did you find him?
- No,

111
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,580
We just missed him,
He's leaving a trail,

112
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,870
What? Did he hurt somebody?

113
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,860
No. I mean gawkers, folks not used
to seeing a kid in animal skins...

114
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,320
...riding on top a bus. Well, not south
of Santa Monica Boulevard anyway.

115
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,299
- Two more Robin Hood reports.
- Hear that? He's headed downtown.

116
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,990
- Where are you?
- Just east of Union.

117
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,360
- He won't head all the way into town.
- No?

118
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,570
He'll head for someplace
less populated.

119
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,690
- You want us to come get you?
- No. Just keep following the trail.

120
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,049
The minute it goes cold, let me know.

121
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:48,649
And if it doesn't go cold?
I mean, if we find him first?

122
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,740
He's my son.

123
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,940
He's my son, and he's alive.
He's gonna stay alive.

124
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:58,320
- Anything else we can do for you?
- Yeah.

125
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,690
Make the sun go down.

126
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,070
Come on, Tyke.
Look, this stuff is good.

127
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,570
Why are you being such a jerk?
I need it right now.

128
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,120
Tyke, come on.

129
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,559
Don't be such a jerk. Come on.

130
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,980
Brand new, never opened.
They've gotta be worth half a gram.

131
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,080
- They suck.
- They rock.

132
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:39,409
Look, it's like every hit from the '80s.
Plus, this girl is hot.

133
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,970
Get out of here, Sunny.
You're embarrassing yourself.

134
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,730
They're worth at least
a quarter. Please.

135
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:48,740
All right, okay.

136
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,549
Bye! Bye! Bye!

137
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,539
You jerk!

138
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,110
- Ow!
- You know what?

139
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,500
- That you get to work off.
- Let me go!

140
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,379
- No!
- Walk away.

141
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,389
An entire suit made of chammies.
That's different.

142
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,029
"What are you wearing to the Oscars?"
"My chammy suit."

143
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,070
What's all this?

144
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,490
Things I killed.

145
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,019
Aren't you all scary.
Chammies and teeth.

146
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,610
Wanna know what else is scary?

147
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,090
Me.

148
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,289
Just get rid of him.

149
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,840
No!

150
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,370
Don't!

151
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,659
Are you crazy? The police are probably
on their way. We gotta go.

152
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,190
So he won't forget me.

153
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,590
Isn't your neck stiff?

154
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,259
You've been standing
like that all day.

155
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,210
Pylean warriors are trained
for such endurance.

156
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,740
I once happened upon
a herd of Burrbeasts.

157
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,039
As you know, an engorged Burrbeast
will couple with anything that moves.

158
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,500
I was forced to stand
perfectly still...

159
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,049
...for 11 days and nights.

160
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,980
So you were never...?

161
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:30,059
No.

162
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,139
That honor was yours, princess.

163
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,840
I don't know.

164
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,059
Angel does all that...

165
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,389
...ninja-statue-don't-move-a-muscle-
or-you're-dead stuff too.

166
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:44,460
Me? I wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Of course, heels? Not helping.

167
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,870
Yes, I'm sure Angel has regaled you
with his many exploits.

168
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,710
He's tried, all right.

169
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,509
But I get so bored with all that
"days of yore" crap.

170
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,039
I mean, they're nothing like
your thrilling tales of adventure.

171
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,500
Not that you need adventurous
tales to impress me.

172
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm impressed by you just being you.

173
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,819
But the way you constantly
speak of Angel....

174
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,339
Is because these last weeks
have been so hard for him.

175
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,960
He needs me.

176
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,849
And you do too.

177
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,609
I should be watching for creatures
from the other dimension.

178
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,440
You're the only creature from another
dimension I'm interested in.

179
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,269
I was worried that your affection
for the Groosalugg had waned.

180
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,819
Some shopkeepers saw Connor jump off
the bus right up the road from here.

181
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,990
He was here. I can smell him.

182
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:13,759
Cops say it was a drug thing gone
wrong. Some guy got killed.

183
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,430
It wasn't our boy.
They I.D.'d a local as the shooter.

184
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:22,049
- So he was here, but not part of--?
- He was part of it. Lot of mayhem.

185
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,609
Including a guy's ear
sliced off as a trophy.

186
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:25,980
Ew....

187
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,799
He was raised
in a hell dimension, okay?

188
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,079
So how do you want to play this?

189
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,319
It'll be dark soon.
You two head back to the hotel.

190
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:39,869
- Shouldn't we all keep looking?
- I'll have a better chance alone.

191
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,460
I don't want to scare him.
He's all alone in a strange world.

192
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,480
So that was really cool today.

193
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,500
So where'd you learn to fight all
badass like that?

194
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,720
In Quor-toth.

195
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,210
Quor-toth.... Mexico, right?

196
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:11,859
Sorry.

197
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,910
Lots of folks squat here.

198
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,349
Most are cool, but...

199
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,730
...if a fat guy asks you to play
"Teddy Bear in the Hole"...

200
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,890
...just tell him to get lost.

201
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,650
So, what did you do for kicks
in Quor-toth?

202
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,150
- Kicks?
- You know, like, fun.

203
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,369
Parties, movies, the mall?

204
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,119
- How'd you spend your time?
- I hunt.

205
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,779
Big surprise.

206
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,150
Home sweet home.

207
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,539
This is....

208
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,690
This is home.

209
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,920
Tonight it is.

210
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,039
You're welcome to crash here too.

211
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:40,819
Don't think it's your size.
People squat here, and they leave stuff.

212
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,150
So...

213
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,519
...how you feel about losing the whole
dead-animal thing?

214
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,599
I mean...

215
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,809
...not that I'm against
eating a cheeseburger.

216
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,569
We have all the food groups.
Meat...

217
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,940
...chocolate.

218
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,829
- So you were really going to kill Tyke.
- He was hurting you.

219
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,660
- Well, it's good you didn't.
- Why?

220
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,509
Because it's wrong.

221
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,319
I mean...

222
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,309
...I know Tyke's a bastard, but...

223
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,069
...cops are even worse.

224
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:43,730
I love these.

225
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,720
Have you ever had one?

226
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,660
Well, then get on down here, cowboy.

227
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,559
Isn't it the best?

228
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,920
I know this.
A tool for eating.

229
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,490
Um.... No.

230
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,789
That isn't for food.

231
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:33,240
It's for this.
I get it from Tyke.

232
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,400
It's medicine.

233
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,119
You're sick?

234
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:44,890
No, it's not that kind of medicine.

235
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,880
It helps me sometimes when I'm...

236
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,039
...sad.

237
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,319
You're sad?

238
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,740
No.

239
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,359
Connor's new to this world,
alone, probably scared,

240
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:12,660
- He looked scared kicking my ass.
- We should've gone with Angel.

241
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,579
Especially now that we know
what Connor's capable of.

242
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,279
Food, cash...

243
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,369
...place to crash....

244
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,079
I've had worse days.

245
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,380
How about you?

246
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,470
So, what's your deal?

247
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,579
Why did you come to L.A.?

248
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,329
To find my father.

249
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,240
Really?

250
00:23:57,849 --> 00:23:59,920
I came here to get away from mine.

251
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,970
Parents should have to take a test
before they can have kids.

252
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,660
And if they're drunks or idiots...

253
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,910
...or evil, they should
just be sterilized.

254
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,259
If they're evil,
they should be killed.

255
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,980
You don't say much,
but I like what you say.

256
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,869
I'll be right back.

257
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,730
Sunny?

258
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,119
Sunny?

259
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:47,490
Sunny.

260
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,559
Connor.

261
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,430
- She put any of this crap in you?
- No.

262
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,019
Okay.

263
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,349
Sorry, I'm just....

264
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,750
We'll take care of this, okay?

265
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:25,799
Together.

266
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,799
Too late.

267
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,920
Too late.

268
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,480
Connor.

269
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,259
I'm sorry about....

270
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,200
Was she your friend?

271
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,190
Connor, just talk to me.

272
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,220
You must be feeling like you just traded
one hell dimension for another...

273
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:51,670
...but if you just let me....

274
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,380
What are you doing?

275
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,809
- What is that?
- Give it back.

276
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,740
Why? Who are you tracking?

277
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,299
You're going after the guy
who gave her the junk.

278
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:11,349
- His medicine killed her.
- And you're gonna do what about it?

279
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,720
- Punish.
- You mean kill.

280
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,259
Slow down.

281
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,029
Listen to me.

282
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:24,460
No!

283
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,920
You will listen.

284
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,630
I'm not gonna let you walk out that
door and get in any more trouble.

285
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,450
Hear me?

286
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,019
Fine.

287
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,200
I'm sorry.

288
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:05,039
- You just don't understand this world.
- I understand.

289
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:08,250
Sunny was nice.
Now she's dead.

290
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,859
- Connor--
- Stop calling me that!

291
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,630
My name is Steven.

292
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,079
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

293
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,730
Standing, talking....
Boom! Knocked on our butts.

294
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,289
- You think something else came out?
- Hello? Face down, knocked out?

295
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,029
I found a picture of that beast
Connor killed.

296
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:41,839
And it says that these things
usually have a mate.

297
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,150
Lorne should have been back
with that expert hours ago.

298
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,759
Well, he said it was complicated.

299
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,730
There's that other expert.

300
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,619
You know someone else who can--?

301
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,089
I don't think Angel's
going to go for that.

302
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,390
Yes, we must always consider Angel.
Angel is our leader.

303
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,730
We must obey his wishes.

304
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,710
We're supposed to sit here with a fissure
from a hell dimension in the lobby...

305
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,250
...when we know someone
who can help us?

306
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,990
- I don't think so. I'm calling him.
- Fred. No, you're not.

307
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,130
- Lorne.
- Sorry it took so long, kids.

308
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,319
Mistress Myrna is a very difficult
woman to find.

309
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:39,059
You see what I mean?
It's been like this all day.

310
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,079
One of the nasty side effects
of specializing in dimensional magic.

311
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:47,380
What I wouldn't do for a lasso
and some Krazy Glue.

312
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,460
Steven.

313
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,829
Okay.

314
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:01,690
Steven.

315
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,329
It's a good name.

316
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,650
Not Irish, but....

317
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,799
I know we haven't gotten off
to a great start, but if we can just...

318
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:16,930
...take a minute...

319
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,440
...that'd be good. Please, just....

320
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,990
Don't run away from me, all right?
I lost you once already.

321
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,460
There's just....

322
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:37,670
There's just so much I want to know.
There's so much I need to know.

323
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,160
You been okay?

324
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,640
I mean, what was it like there?

325
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,299
Do you have any friends?

326
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,380
Okay, I mean, not friends.

327
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,460
It's not like you were at summer camp.
You were stuck...

328
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,849
...in a hell dimension.

329
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,950
Connor, I'm so sorry.

330
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,109
I tried to come after you.
I would've done anything. I just--

331
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,029
- I couldn't find a way in.
- I found a way out.

332
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,490
Yeah.

333
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,559
You did. You sure did.

334
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:33,829
I should have tried harder.
I shouldn't have quit.

335
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,730
But you're back.

336
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,890
And that's what's important, you know?
You came back to me.

337
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,240
I want to know everything, son.
I want to know everything.

338
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,769
Everything about you.
What your life's been like.

339
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,970
You must have a million questions.

340
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,710
No.

341
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,690
- No?
- My father told me everything.

342
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,900
Your father?

343
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,740
Holtz isn't your father--

344
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,410
You don't get to say that name.
You don't even get to think it.

345
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,180
I know everything.

346
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,160
He told me all about you.

347
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,359
That you're a...

348
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:25,829
...thing that...

349
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,349
...kills and drinks blood.

350
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,339
- You're a vampire.
- What do you know about vampires?

351
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:35,849
Decapitation, stake in the heart...

352
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,990
...daylight, fire. I forget anything?

353
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,049
You have a second face.

354
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,049
A face for killing.

355
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,039
Show it to me.

356
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,920
I want to see it.

357
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,079
Show me the face you used
to kill my father's family.

358
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,099
Show me! Come on, show me!

359
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,280
It looks like this, son.

360
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,610
That's what you are.

361
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,389
It's part of what I am.

362
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,099
A part I hope you'll be able
to accept one day.

363
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,230
- You'd have to kill me first.
- Well, that's a plan.

364
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,010
But I got a better one.

365
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:37,869
- Chammy man.
- No, no, no. Don't.

366
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,400
Where's Sunny?

367
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,119
Would that be the dead girl
in the bathroom?

368
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,239
- Who are you?
- I'm his father.

369
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,340
- No, you're not.
- Will you let me handle this?

370
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:02,710
Let's find a way to work this out.
Talk through it.

371
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,179
Which is a thing that we do here.

372
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,969
There's no need for violence.

373
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,260
I'm sorry, did you say "no need for
violence"? You may want to speak up.

374
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,619
You see, I don't hear so good anymore!

375
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,159
Sunny's dead in the can. OD.

376
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:27,460
I begged her to get help.

377
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,230
- One down, one to go.
- We can make this right.

378
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:34,269
You can give me a new ear?

379
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,630
- Well, maybe you can wear a hat.
- Maybe I could blow your head off.

380
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:45,030
That's my coat. And whatever's not in
Sunny's body better be in the pockets.

381
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,500
- Son, give him the coat.
- You killed her.

382
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:50,929
Tyke!

383
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,019
Cops, man. They're looking for you.
They're everywhere.

384
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:05,360
I hope this pentagram wasn't some
dark attempt to close the fissure.

385
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,789
No, that was a dark attempt
to open one.

386
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,880
Different one. Long story.

387
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:20,570
So you think you can close it then?

388
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,150
Sure. That's not the worry.

389
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,059
You have worry?

390
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,389
How did it open? There are no portals
to Quor-toth, and for good reason.

391
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,300
It's not a place anyone should ever go.

392
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,469
If there aren't any portals,
what is it?

393
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:41,429
A tear in reality. Big cosmic no-no.

394
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,610
Something punched its way through.

395
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,739
Something I really don't want to meet.
Excuse me.

396
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,480
Sorry.

397
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,769
Here you go.
Just the way you asked.

398
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,480
Should we leave
or get behind something?

399
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,780
No, it's pretty routine. Just sometimes
I get a little schmutz in my eye.

400
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:36,429
It's closed.

401
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,539
Did anything
else come through it?

402
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,050
Not sure, and not sticking around
to find out. Bye.

403
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,360
Dead body in the river,
another one in the bathroom.

404
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,570
It just does not bode
well for you, does it?

405
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,260
You see, son, violence
just always ends up badly!

406
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:11,420
Hey!

407
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,929
- Connor, we've gotta get out--
- I've gotta get out of here!

408
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,070
Don't.

409
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,329
Use me.

410
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm bigger.
I'll make a better shield.

411
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,309
L.A.P.D. ! Drop your weapons!

412
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,889
Out that window!
Go! Out the window!

413
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,429
Stay down! Stay down!

414
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,079
Go!

415
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,039
- Do you need to stop?
- I'm okay.

416
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,590
Get behind here.

417
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,039
Maybe I do need a second.

418
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,539
What you did....

419
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,940
You hurt?

420
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,289
You know, if you want,
you can come back to the hotel.

421
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,760
No pressure or anything.

422
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:43,139
- No....
- But if you need a place to stay....

423
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,260
- I have to go.
- You're not alone.

424
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:50,780
You know that, right?

425
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,920
Yeah. I know.

426
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,280
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Dad.
