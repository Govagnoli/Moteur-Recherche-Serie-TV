1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,370
Previously:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,219
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,990
Anybody talk to Fred?

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:11,089
She's been back three months
and hasn't gone out.

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,199
I'm working on something aimed
at Angel Investigations.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,300
What are you doing?
Building code violations.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,899
- I'm fighting Angel in my own way.
- I bet he's terrified.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,210
- It's just business.
- Don't come at me through Cordelia.

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,560
Hey, Fred.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,500
- Sorry. Did I startle you guys?
- No.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,289
Only in the sense of shocking
and jolting us. What's up?

12
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:53,469
Nothing, just taking a little stroll.
Why do girls want to look like that?

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,799
I was in a cave starving.
What's their excuse?

14
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,380
Fashion.

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,870
So everybody's just reading
and hanging out?

16
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,519
- Angel's upstairs.
- Oh.

17
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,140
He's probably reading too.
He's so deep, you know? Thoughtful.

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,859
I'm guessing The Brothers Karamazov,
Joyce, a little Goethe to round it out.

19
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,760
- Anyone else read this?
- Read what?

20
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:31,700
Charlton Heston double feature.
At the Nuart?

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,280
- Soylent Green and The Omega Man,
- Wow.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,790
It's two for one.
Did I mention Charlton Heston?

23
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,260
- Who's in?
- That sounds great.

24
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,519
Fred. Wesley?

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,849
I'm translating Fassad's Guide
from Sumerian.

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,599
Gunn? Cordy?

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,879
Looks like it's just you and me, Fred.

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,159
Well, the worm certainly has turned.

29
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah, the worm's turning and....
Am I the worm?

30
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:10,060
Friends and coworkers have accused me
of being the stay-at-home, sulky one.

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,159
Some people just don't know
how to have fun anymore.

32
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,020
- Can we take a breather, stud?
- If you need one.

33
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,770
Hey, tiger. Me too, just for a minute.

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,900
Pace yourself, sweetheart.

35
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:50,400
It's good to be young.
So, ready for round four?

36
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,259
You okay, baby?

37
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,659
It's been fun.

38
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,050
He opened every door for me.

39
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,860
He bought popcorn, and every
few minutes he'd go like this:

40
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,899
To let me know
it was okay to have some.

41
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,959
And he's lonely because
he's the last man on Earth.

42
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,319
- Angel?
- Charlton Heston, The Omega Man,

43
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,740
Omega being the last letter
of the Greek alphabet.

44
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,959
He walks on the street side.
It's old-fashioned, but chivalrous.

45
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,540
- We're talking about Angel?
- Right.

46
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,069
Though he didn't talk a lot,
it was still okay.

47
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:51,370
It wasn't that awkward quiet.
You know that awkward quiet?

48
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,509
No, that's never happened to me.

49
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,120
You need to talk to Fred.

50
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,839
- What about?
- About the big date you had last night.

51
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,850
- Date? It was a movie.
- That's what you need to tell her.

52
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,220
She's in there going on and on
about what a super time you guys had.

53
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,740
She's just enthusiastic.
Don't read too much into it.

54
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,699
She's got the big puppy love.
I mean, who wouldn't?

55
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,939
You're handsome
and brave and heroic...

56
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,209
...emotionally stunted, erratic,
prone to evil and a eunuch.

57
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,350
How can you--? I'm not a eunuch.

58
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,949
- It's a figure of speech.
- Find a better one.

59
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,850
I just mean sex is
a no-no because of this...

60
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,040
... "if you know perfect bliss,
you'll turn evil" curse.

61
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,269
Really no cure for that, huh?

62
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,199
All I'm telling you is
this thing with Fred will go bad...

63
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,899
- ...unless it's nipped in the bud.
- Okay.

64
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,529
- Maybe just a short talk.
- Okay.

65
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,980
- So how soon can you do that?
- Nice try. It's gotta come from you.

66
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,889
Angel has something to say.

67
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,250
Did anybody else see this?

68
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:28,040
"Police found the body of Woodrow
Raglan in an Elondria Hotel suite.

69
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,120
A witness said it was
as if his insides had--"

70
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,230
Collapsed. There was something
else like that last week.

71
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,540
No one is hiring us to look into this.
Let's do more important things.

72
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,529
Ten days ago, a body found in another
hotel room under similar conditions.

73
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,089
What do you think?
Spell? Curse? Serial demon?

74
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,339
Tough to say. Worth a closer look.

75
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,980
Cordelia, open up a case file.
We have to get on this right away.

76
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,550
Angel.

77
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,670
- Good morning, Lilah.
- Good morning.

78
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,000
Here we are at my office. Bye.

79
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,480
You're a tough one. I know
I'm gonna have to earn your respect.

80
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,050
But give me time.
You'll see I'm a creative guy.

81
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,930
Like tormenting Angel
with building code violations?

82
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,649
So Machiavellian.
We'll drown him in red tape.

83
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,529
There are other levels to this.
Avenues of interest I have.

84
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,250
One of them being:
Does Angel even exist?

85
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,829
- Are you getting metaphysical?
- No.

86
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,339
He has no Social Security number,
taxpayer I.D. or last name.

87
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,100
How can he go to the Building
Department or anywhere else official?

88
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,970
He's the rat, we're the maze.
Don't you wanna see what he'll do?

89
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,910
- He might just rip out your throat.
- You think he'd be that clichéd?

90
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,980
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

91
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,370
Get Carter Williams on the phone.
The graphic artist.

92
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,870
Look under F for forger.

93
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,389
There was a third victim
five weeks ago.

94
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,959
They were all young, healthy males
who died in expensive hotel suites.

95
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,190
Imagine spending money for a suite,
then you're a big bag of mush bones?

96
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,659
I guess it wouldn't be good wherever
that happened. Please continue.

97
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,539
Gunn, interview staff at the hotels
where they died.

98
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,779
I'm meeting a contact from
the coroner's office in 30 minutes.

99
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,480
They were members of
the same health club. The bodies.

100
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,820
When they weren't dead.

101
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,429
- We'll go to the gym.
- My thought exactly.

102
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,580
- I'll drive.
- What are we waiting for?

103
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,649
Everybody know what they're doing?
Good.

104
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,019
I'll just stay here.
Okay, I'll do that.

105
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,740
You can't just keep ignoring Fred.

106
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,259
There's your business
and your social life.

107
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,419
Everybody knows that you keep
those two things sep--

108
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,570
I'm gonna go see if he knows anything.

109
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,000
Hi, I have a few questions.
My name's Angel.

110
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,309
Angel. Good news, dude.
We're running our best offer ever.

111
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,399
I can get you a six-month
trial membership for $350.

112
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,970
No, I'm looking into some guys
that were members here.

113
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,240
Woody, right.
Yeah, I heard he, like, died.

114
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,940
He, like, did.
Along with the others. All members.

115
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,000
I need to ask you, Phil,
does the club condone steroid use?

116
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,549
- No. Absolutely not.
- Then let's keep this between us.

117
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,450
I'll look at their records
and get out of your hair.

118
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,669
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

119
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,419
So did you ever see anyone come in
who looked suspicious?

120
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,480
Or really pale?
Or maybe green and scaly?

121
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,529
Nothing connects the three,
except they were in Pilates together.

122
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,889
Pilates? Is that like TaeBo?

123
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,730
Yeah, if you're living in 1999.

124
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,850
Relax the neck and shoulders.

125
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:40,659
Using your lower abdominals,
bring the spine down to the floor.

126
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,529
Take a deep breath in as your arms come
up to the ceiling, making a window.

127
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:50,909
Good. Now shoulders down and exhale...

128
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,250
...as you float your head
and chest up through your arms.

129
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,940
There could be follow-up questions.
I'll need numbers. How about you?

130
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,769
I'm gonna check the retirement home
on the street behind us.

131
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,029
Bye.

132
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,129
Maybe when you're done with
your work here, you can pick me up.

133
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,220
He's just someone I work with.
Anyway....

134
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,480
Mr. Roscoe.

135
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,899
My name's Angel.

136
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,600
"Angel Investigations. "

137
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,070
- May I ask you a few questions?
- Well, it's pretty late.

138
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,269
Shouldn't take long.

139
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,899
Come on, if you're coming.

140
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,169
Nice to have a view. Bet you
spend a lot of time enjoying it.

141
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,960
Not that much.

142
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,860
Well, I don't see any harm in looking.
It's about all I can do anymore.

143
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,879
- What is it you want?
- Your help.

144
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:39,149
Wondering if you'd seen these men
across the way in the gym.

145
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:46,769
No, don't think so. I'm more of a
girl-watcher, know what I'm saying?

146
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,220
Jeez.

147
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,210
They all died? How?

148
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,980
- That's what we're trying to find out.
- You work with police?

149
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm a private investigator.
I work with a team.

150
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,059
Sounds nice. I was a salesman.
Worked alone for 50 years.

151
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,809
Nothian herb jar.

152
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,710
That's a pretty exotic item.

153
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,779
Did you deal in the occult?

154
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,350
Occult, shmoccult. I traveled a lot,
picked up some trinkets.

155
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,840
Do a lot of bungee-jumping,
Mr. Roscoe?

156
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,679
- More than you might think, Mr. Angel.
- Just Angel.

157
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,370
I'll remember that.

158
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,899
You might wanna think twice
about casting a--

159
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,879
You are me.

160
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,629
That's gonna smart later.

161
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,429
Hello?

162
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,100
Hello.

163
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,990
So, what did you find
at the old folks' home?

164
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:33,360
Nothing. Didn't pan out.
How about you?

165
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,009
Got a two-month free trial membership
and made some new friends.

166
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,299
All right, I got nothing.

167
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,039
Pretty clear we're barking up
the wrong tree, huh?

168
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,090
Yeah.

169
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,879
Well, get in.
I'll take you back to the hotel.

170
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,970
All right!

171
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,600
You and me, going back
to the hotel. Nice.

172
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,370
- Are you all right?
- Honey, I've never been better.

173
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,399
Nice.

174
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,559
You supposed to be back there?

175
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,289
Ding, ding.
Paying customers. Hello?

176
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:36,549
- Slow night.
- Yeah.

177
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,340
Maybe Wes or Gunn found something.

178
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,490
Wes or Gunn?

179
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,240
They're a great part
of our investigating team...

180
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,950
...working here with us
in this old, abandoned hotel.

181
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,850
"Cordelia. "

182
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,220
Have I ever told you
you're a very beautiful woman?

183
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,019
Very funny. I know you never said
anything that tacky or overt to Fred.

184
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,860
But you're still gonna have that talk,
whether you want to or not.

185
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,340
- A talk with Fred?
- Yes.

186
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,320
Just keep it simple.
One, you're not like other men.

187
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,389
Two, there's no room
at work for romance.

188
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:27,539
Romance with Fred?
So I'm a...?

189
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:30,940
Obviously.

190
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,779
Get some rest.
See you tomorrow.

191
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,869
You've reached Angel
Investigations, leave a message,

192
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,549
Cordelia, are you there? Pick up,

193
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,390
Angel, how's my head?

194
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,299
Hope you put ice on it.
Sweet deal you got here.

195
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,450
Love the hotel. And Cordelia....

196
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,900
- That's how I spell W-O-M-A-N.
- Where is she?

197
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,980
You just worry about eating nice, soft
food and staying out of Ryan's way.

198
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,079
Ryan?

199
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,650
We just talked about this.

200
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,890
There go your phone privileges
for the month.

201
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,710
- You're not to be out of your room.
- I'm stretching my legs.

202
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,789
Who am I?

203
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,630
You're Ryan.

204
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,269
At least you're not having an episode.

205
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:29,630
Marcus, you think you're a 24-year-old
stud or a famous skateboarder...

206
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,779
...keep it to yourself unless you
wanna wake up in restraints again.

207
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,670
- Copy?
- I know who I am.

208
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,460
Then let's get you back to beddy-bye.

209
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,859
Angel. What happened?

210
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,569
Hey, doll. I was working on the case.
I must've dozed off.

211
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:07,400
- Too tired to go up to your room?
- My room? Right, which is upstairs.

212
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,420
You know me. I was giving 100%.
What did I do with that case file?

213
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,319
- You gave it to me yesterday.
- Must be getting old.

214
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,299
Not until you have
that talk with Fred.

215
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,480
There's something about brewed tea
you cannot replicate with a bag.

216
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,000
- What happened?
- I was looking for something.

217
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,349
- I'll clean it up.
- Don't avoid the talk.

218
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,200
I know. I know. I know.

219
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,599
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right.

220
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,470
Well.... You?

221
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,529
So we gotta talk.

222
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,660
I got nothing against you personally.
It's just....

223
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,259
This will be harder than I thought.
I don't know how to spit this out.

224
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,319
Angel.

225
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,650
- Whatever it is, I'm here for you.
- Yeah, that may be the problem.

226
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,599
I mean, whatever we had,
whatever we...

227
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,809
...did.

228
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,069
I just think that we should
keep that behind us.

229
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,339
Start from scratch. You know,
two men working side by side...

230
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,940
...but, you know,
none of that funny stuff.

231
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,480
Shake on that?

232
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,930
I guess.

233
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,019
- All right, give me a hug.
- Wesley, food's here.

234
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,849
Okay.

235
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,049
- Wesley?
- Yes?

236
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,650
- Do you know where Fred is?
- Up in her room.

237
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,970
Her room. Right.

238
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,480
Somebody say something about food?
I could eat a horse.

239
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,940
Breakfast burritos all around.

240
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,950
- Thanks, bro. Keep the change on that.
- Okay.

241
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,670
- Get anything from the hotel?
- Yeah, I did.

242
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,059
These guys ran up huge bills,
mostly alcohol.

243
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:14,259
At least they went out partying.
I got their phone bills.

244
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,109
Isn't that illegal? I mean, don't
these guys deserve a little privacy?

245
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,250
- What?
- Why are you eating?

246
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,740
- I'm hungry.
- They called the same number.

247
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,660
I checked it out.
First Class Escorts, La Brea and 6th.

248
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,539
Escorts? You mean hookers?

249
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:38,440
I should interview them
while the trail is hot.

250
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,380
I'll take this.
You interview the hotel staff.

251
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,089
- I figured it out.
- I'll interview the hookers.

252
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,799
- Are there any men who aren't dogs?
- Not very many.

253
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:56,740
A woman is more than a piece of meat.
I'm sorry, that's just how I feel.

254
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:05,180
My contact at the coroner.
I can see one of the bodies.

255
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,710
Gunn can go with you.

256
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,369
That wasn't the kind of body
I had in mind to see.

257
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,460
We're going, we're going.

258
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,900
You know, that's a great idea.
I'll just stay here...

259
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,630
...hold the fort,
keep an eye on the evidence.

260
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,140
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me get that.

261
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,190
- Thank you.
- There you go.

262
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,960
- Great.
- I'll take it.

263
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,980
Great, thank you.

264
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,380
- Yeah. over there. Let's go.
- Okay.

265
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,539
- I got someone I want you to meet.
- I can't right now.

266
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,029
This is my baby granddaughter,
Katrina.

267
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,259
Girl's gonna rule the world.
Isn't she something?

268
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,599
She's beautiful.

269
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:21,759
What you doing?

270
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,420
Well. Hey, sweetheart.
Where you been hiding?

271
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,240
You know, up in my room.

272
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:33,119
Everybody says, "Fred,
you should get out more," so....

273
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,420
Fred.

274
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,819
Have I ever told you
you're a very beautiful woman?

275
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,170
Um, no.

276
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,750
Do you like olives?

277
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,740
I got work to finish up here.

278
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,710
Go up and put on something pretty,
and we'll go out on the town.

279
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,170
- Really?
- And that's just for starters.

280
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,480
Okay. I'll be--
I'll just go and-- Okay!

281
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,869
What can I do for you?

282
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,920
Don't go all night-stalker on me.
I'm here to do you a favor.

283
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:30,819
We both agreed that business with
Cordelia was just business, right?

284
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,880
Sure.

285
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,160
It's all there:
earthquake-safe certification...

286
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,599
...statement of asbestos-level
compliance, all of it.

287
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,029
I'm not playing you here.

288
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:51,440
It's not about you. It's about Gavin.
Thinks he's so smart.

289
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,220
You're welcome.

290
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,619
I'm sorry. Thanks.
That was a really thoughtful favor.

291
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,109
How about a drink?

292
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,809
Have I ever told you
you're a very beautiful woman?

293
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,839
What's going on?

294
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,420
Clear the floor!

295
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,680
My heart.

296
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,259
- Want another?
- I'll have to call a taxi as it is.

297
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,009
Oops.

298
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:08,240
- What do you want?
- You.

299
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,289
Don't tell me
you never thought about it.

300
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,309
Son of a bitch!

301
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,589
Sorry, it felt like the thing to do.

302
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,009
- Are you born-again?
- I don't know what game this is.

303
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,170
But I hope you enjoyed it. You'll
never get this close to me again.

304
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,190
What? This is new.

305
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,089
What are--?

306
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,319
Ah.

307
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,339
What the--?

308
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,890
You're awake.

309
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:49,690
- It's beating.
- It was your fourth heart attack.

310
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,569
You can't survive another one.
You got lucky.

311
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,859
Try something like that again,
you may not be.

312
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,349
Julia Roberts ever makes a realistic
movie about being an escort...

313
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,549
...I think it should be called
Pretty Skanky Woman,

314
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:10,450
Angel?

315
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,420
Fred?

316
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,789
What's wrong? What happened?

317
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,869
I should've knocked.

318
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,069
I always forget to knock because, you
know, I didn't have a door for so long.

319
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,450
He called me sweetheart.
But it's just an expression, isn't it?

320
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,039
When a waitress calls you honey,
it doesn't mean you're special.

321
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,259
It's just a word, right?

322
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,630
Sweetheart.

323
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,869
Is this about Angel?

324
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:17,650
He talked to you, didn't he?

325
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,089
This is all my fault.
I told him to do that.

326
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:26,849
You told him to make out
with that woman on the desk?

327
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,329
What? No.

328
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,579
What woman?

329
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:52,720
My boyfriend's probably looking for me.
He could catch us at any moment.

330
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,809
Sort of makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?

331
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,910
Yeah. It does.

332
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,559
Hey!

333
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,710
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- He bit me!

334
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,410
Freak!

335
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,180
Nice!

336
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,839
- Bring it on. That all you got?
- What are you on?

337
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:35,670
I'd say I'm high on life. Only, I ain't
alive, which means I'll never die.

338
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,880
I'll be young, handsome
and strong forever.

339
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,019
There's just one thing
I gotta do first.

340
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,609
I don't believe it. On my desk?

341
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:56,109
Well, it did used to be his.
He was just kind of reclaiming it.

342
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,829
How? By marking it?

343
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,779
- This isn't like him.
- This is totally like him.

344
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:08,640
- Doing the dance with a cheap blond.
- Brunette. She was a cheap brunette.

345
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:12,559
- You're right. This isn't like him.
- So who was she?

346
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,480
It doesn't matter who she was.
The question is, who is he?

347
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,319
We're all thinking it.

348
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,559
- He's Angelus again.
- Who's Angelus?

349
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,099
The badass vamp Angel turns into.

350
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,319
But then why isn't there a body here?

351
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,990
That's not what I meant. Why would
Angel need to read about vampires?

352
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,069
- He wouldn't.
- What are you saying?

353
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:43,859
In our case, each victim exhibited
uncharacteristic behavior before death.

354
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,099
They weren't themselves.

355
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,440
Angel's infected
by whatever got into them?

356
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,410
Not whatever, whomever. At the gym,
anything unusual happen to Angel?

357
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,690
Not really. I was with him
pretty much the whole time.

358
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,079
Except when he went to the--

359
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,089
Hey.

360
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:23,539
What are you doing out of bed?
Are you trying to bust loose again?

361
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,630
Damn, Marcus. You don't quit, do you?
You wanna have another heart attack?

362
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,740
Look, I can't really explain this,
but I need to get out of here.

363
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,000
Just don't turn me in.

364
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,930
Not gonna have to.
Your kid's signing in at reception.

365
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,130
- My kid?
- Uh-huh.

366
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,599
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

367
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:56,589
Hi, Dad.

368
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,519
You finally found a body
that won't burn out, huh?

369
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,119
Looks like.

370
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,539
Only one way you can
keep it though, right?

371
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,150
- You've gotta kill yourself.
- I can live with that.

372
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,820
You sure? I don't think you know
what you're getting into.

373
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:04,349
I know. You don't seem
to know what you had.

374
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,329
You were the worst vampire.

375
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:10,449
Vampires don't help people, moron,
they kill them.

376
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,320
- Here, let me show you.
- You may have the attitude and power.

377
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,190
But there's one thing you don't have
and never will: friends.

378
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,659
Four of them behind you
with heavy things.

379
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,969
He's the one that's
been casting that spell.

380
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,710
You're Angel? With that cologne?
I don't think so.

381
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,010
Don't stake him.

382
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,420
God, I love technology.

383
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:45,369
Are you all right?

384
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,010
I gotta pee.

385
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,030
Did you see an Algurian conjuring orb?
Could've been glowing.

386
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,679
In his room. On a shrine.

387
00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:00,070
I was right. Algurian body-switching
spell. Keep an eye on him.

388
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:04,949
Fred! He's out. He's out.

389
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,989
Read this.

390
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,639
It's cool, Gunn. It's me.

391
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,940
- I got his conjuring stone.
- You can't take that!

392
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:54,019
- You don't deserve that body!
- I was gonna say the same to you.

393
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,070
I'll tell you why you have a weak
heart, Marcus. You never use it.

394
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,239
You're pathetic. You're all path--!

395
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,440
You should try to keep a lid
on that rage. It's not healthy.

396
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,150
- What's going on?
- Dad's having a bad night.

397
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,869
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

398
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,289
How's your head?
Sorry about all that.

399
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:40,400
I gather I had it coming.

400
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,500
Yes.

401
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,329
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

402
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:53,210
Uh-huh. Okay.

403
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,489
Is this about how
you're not like other men...

404
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,420
...what, with that curse and all?

405
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,500
And how you're really fond of me,
but that's as far as it goes?

406
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,719
Uh.... Yeah.

407
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,960
Cordelia explained it to me.

408
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,090
She said you'd probably
just screw it up.

409
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,059
She did, did she?

410
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,449
Well, she's probably right.

411
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,010
What?

412
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,090
It's like something out of Fitzgerald.

413
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:46,750
The man who can have everything
but love.

414
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:54,429
Well, maybe in some ways,
you're better off, because love is....

415
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,210
Well, in a way, it's everything.

416
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:04,400
But it's also heartache
and disappointment.

417
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,039
And those are good things to avoid.

418
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:14,519
Angel, Willow's on the phone.
She's alive. Buffy's alive!

419
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,849
Buffy?
