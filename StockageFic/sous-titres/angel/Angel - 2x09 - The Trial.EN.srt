1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,089
Previously on Angel:

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,830
How about gracing us
with a number?

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,849
The Host.
He helps demons.

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,970
Reads their souls.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,289
Only when they sing karaoke.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,529
Darla. That's her.

7
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,850
You're what Wolfram & Hart
brought back.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,089
- I remember everything.
- You have a soul now.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,719
Soon those memories are gonna
start eating away at you.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,760
What did you do? What am I?

11
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,760
You allowed her to escape,
you facilitated it.

12
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,299
- She needed help.
- You know what she was.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,729
What we were.

14
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,820
Turn me back. I can't bear
this pounding in my chest!

15
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,009
I can't.

16
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,130
- Darla, wait.
- No.

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,390
Don't look for me again.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,850
Don't you think we should
check on him?

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,549
He's been in that cellar a long time.

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,250
I keep hearing a "chucka-chucka" sound.

21
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,579
- What's he doing?
- How should I know?

22
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,099
He barely says "Good morning,
and get me a glass of blood."

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,719
He's so distraught about--

24
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,769
Don't say Darla. I'm sick and
tired of hearing about her.

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,920
If I hear the name
Darla one more time--

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,370
He's not distraught,
he's obsessed. I thought...

27
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,060
...you'd be a man and talk to him.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,579
I was a man. I said...things.

29
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,129
- Like what?
- Like...

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,269
...did he prefer milk
or sugar in his tea?

31
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,879
- It's how men talk in England.
- Shh!

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,000
Listen. It stopped.

33
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,909
He's coming.

34
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,159
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Nothing.

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,700
So you were doing your laundry?

36
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,489
There's a washer and dryer
in the cellar.

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,950
Don't you love when
they're still warm?

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,640
"Wrinkle-free." Right, after you
iron it for about 15 minutes.

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,030
Good to see you being domestic.

40
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah. You seem all calm and homey.

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,300
Are you on drugs?

42
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,259
I know I've caused you a lot of grief
over Darla, and I apologize.

43
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,479
Darla may never need my help.

44
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,009
I can only be there for her if
and when she decides to come around.

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,509
But I can't do it for her,
and I know that now.

46
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,780
We had tea.

47
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,039
In the meantime, there's nothing
I can do but let go.

48
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,060
I found Darla.

49
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,990
Wasn't easy, but my knowledge...

50
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,280
...of L.A.'s motels paid off.

51
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,180
- You lied to us.
- I did, I know.

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,800
Why?

53
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:46,740
Figured you'd nag.

54
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,379
- Royal Viking Motel.
- Near skid row.

55
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,849
She's not living
off Wolfram & Hart now.

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,969
They'll look for her.

57
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,419
- What do you think they'll do?
- Let's get there first.

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,030
If you expect us to go with you on a
wild goose chase, guess again.

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,840
We're not going to enable you
in your addiction!

60
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,879
Didn't we learn anything from the tea?

61
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,159
You're a hard one to find.

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,209
Thanks for coming in.

63
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,850
Did I ever have a choice?

64
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:09,709
Of course.

65
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,509
We would never force you
against your will.

66
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,259
It wasn't my will to even be here.

67
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,980
I never asked for this life.

68
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,180
Well, no one ever does.

69
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,899
God doesn't give us a say.

70
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,180
God wasn't the one
who brought me back.

71
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,420
True.

72
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,889
What do you want me to do?
Go back to him?

73
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,250
There's nothing between us anymore.

74
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,470
You misunderstand.

75
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,709
We didn't invite you here
to discuss Angel.

76
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,000
This is about you.

77
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,600
You're not our prisoner, Darla.

78
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,120
You are, however,
our moral responsibility.

79
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,860
You probably don't remember
your first few weeks with us.

80
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,639
No one remembers their
first days of life...

81
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,180
...but that's when
these were initiated.

82
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,569
Did you know anything about this?

83
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,860
We'll deal with this
any way you see fit.

84
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,300
It's up to you.

85
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,439
We just thought you should know.

86
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,959
- She ain't here, bro.
- No.

87
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,269
But she was, not long ago.

88
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,100
- I smell the fear.
- Don't envy that talent.

89
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,259
Not based on what I'm getting
with my human smeller.

90
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:53,230
Not even for free cable, you know?

91
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,699
She chose this place
for a reason.

92
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,529
- How'd you--
- Motel. She didn't live here.

93
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,720
I wouldn't call it living.

94
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,569
Looks like maybe she was
expecting company.

95
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,410
In the form of you.

96
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,149
No blood.

97
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,829
- Nothing new, anyway.
- You smell that too?

98
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,699
- Room's seen a lot of it.
- Step down from her last digs.

99
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,990
When you're desperate, you do
what you have to do.

100
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,339
Don't these people know who we are?

101
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,100
I think they do.
Explains the lynch mob.

102
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,889
Look, we should all rest.

103
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,970
It'll be dawn in a few hours,
and she won't last carrying us both.

104
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,910
I hate the French.
We should go to Romania.

105
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,269
In Italy you wanted France.

106
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,829
In Romania they know how
to treat a vampire.

107
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,959
You said you were craving
rich food. Something French.

108
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,209
The valley seems quiet.

109
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,379
I told you, we lost them back in Arles.

110
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,769
This man Holtz. How does
he keep finding us?

111
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,430
We stay in the best hotels...

112
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,449
...order room service,
eat the waiters. People talk.

113
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,029
Holtz is no mere mortal.

114
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,660
Of course he is. He's just a man.
A vampire hunter.

115
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,870
Drove us into a barn, like animals.

116
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,019
All right, then, let's be animals.

117
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,700
At least for tonight. Unless...

118
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,710
...you're too tired.

119
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,950
- Shouldn't we keep watch?
- I can see the window.

120
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,480
And we'll hear hoofbeats,
should anyone approach.

121
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,909
You always make the best of it.

122
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,720
You have to admit, the chase
can be exhilarating.

123
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,269
Especially with the proper companion.

124
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,480
Bastards!

125
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,889
That's great.

126
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,639
Really, very threatening.

127
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,990
Getting to you, isn't it?
When I was a human...

128
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,529
...I didn't have much luck with women.

129
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,809
- Hard to believe.
- Had a skin condition.

130
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,009
But now, something about the teeth.
Chicks go crazy for it.

131
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:28,070
You've got girlfriends everywhere,
I imagine.

132
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,490
Mostly I just kill them.
Dump the bodies.

133
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,350
That must be very lonely for you.

134
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,070
We're lonely, we creatures
of the night.

135
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,750
Doomed to walk the earth.

136
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,110
How long have you been...?

137
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,909
An eternal child of darkness?
Since '92.

138
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,639
1992?

139
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,740
It's already the last century.

140
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,889
And in all this time,
you've never considered...

141
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,190
...making yourself a mate?

142
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:01,990
How do you mean?

143
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,820
Well, isn't it true that
some vampires choose a mortal7.

144
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,539
Someone they can sire.

145
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,889
Someone who too can walk
those lonely nights...

146
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,669
...hunting with them,
feeding with them.

147
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,080
Joining with them.

148
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,450
That'd be weird.

149
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,840
Weird? It's mythic.

150
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,769
You read too much Anne Rice.
You've got no idea....

151
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,120
Teach me.

152
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,629
You want me to make you?

153
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,340
You think I came in here
for the snacks?

154
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,340
Sweetheart, in this bar
you are the snacks.

155
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,809
I live nearby. We can go to my place,
you can do it there.

156
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,600
You're serious about this.

157
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,850
So what? I make you and then...

158
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,070
...you'd be my immortal babe?

159
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,190
Yes.

160
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,259
That sounds like commitment to me.

161
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:02,870
Then use me as long
as you like...

162
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,639
...any way you like, then discard me.
No strings.

163
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,539
There's an alley out back.

164
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,940
What if I just kill you?
Drain you and leave your body.

165
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,090
I'll take my chances.

166
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,080
I should probably mention...

167
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,820
- ...I'm not clear on how this works.
- What?

168
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,830
I never did it to anybody. And I
was out when it happened to me.

169
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,259
I'll walk you through it.

170
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,879
Drink. When you feel my heart
start to slow, stop.

171
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,059
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

172
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,340
I wasn't in danger,
Angelus, believe me.

173
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,009
I always pick the stupid ones,
didn't you know?

174
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,769
- I can take care of myself.
- I was saving you from yourself.

175
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,269
- Who asked you?
- This isn't the answer.

176
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,100
You don't even know the question.

177
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,639
You do this, I won't leave you alone.

178
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,299
Next time, it'll be you
on the end of this stake.

179
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,250
I'm sorry, but I don't
want that. Not again.

180
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,350
I won't let it happen twice.

181
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,950
- Where are you going?
- I'll try the west side.

182
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,269
- Another dive?
- What do you care?

183
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,720
This isn't you.

184
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,860
We had 150 years together,
but you don't know me.

185
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,720
You really want to be made
in an alley?

186
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,389
I wanted you to do it.

187
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,460
That'll never happen.

188
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,409
I do what I have to do.
Anyway, you were made in an alley.

189
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,570
- That's not the point.
- What is?

190
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,200
The point is, you were
undead for 400 years.

191
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,940
You've been human for a few months.
Give it a chance.

192
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,539
- I don't have time.
- Yes, you do.

193
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,419
Don't throw this away--

194
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,179
I'm dying.

195
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,549
What?

196
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:10,750
Yeah.

197
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,879
And not sometime, not later. Now.

198
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,429
Right now.

199
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,919
They showed me my medical files.
The tests say...

200
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,000
...I've got two months left.

201
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,899
So excuse me,
I'm in sort of a hurry.

202
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,620
- How many men are there?
- I can't die like this.

203
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,570
We could flee to the hills.

204
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,850
We can't make it on foot
before sunrise.

205
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,679
We'll not make it easy for them.

206
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,669
Between the two of us,
we can go out with a reputation.

207
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,460
Even death, with the right companion--

208
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,450
I hope you survive.

209
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,220
If you do, maybe we'll
meet again in Vienna.

210
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,409
Angel's back!

211
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,019
He has Darla with him!

212
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:23,970
Hi.

213
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,940
You're planning on sleeping over?

214
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,059
I'm dying.

215
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,070
- So just one night?
- Dying?

216
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,269
- He doesn't believe it.
- What?

217
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,100
Wolfram & Hart showed her some files
that say she only has a few months.

218
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,559
- So more than one night?
- You think it's a trick?

219
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,370
Of course it's a trick.
They're playing mind games.

220
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,200
- To what end?
- I don't know.

221
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,870
- You just won't believe it.
- I can't believe them.

222
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,129
They can't be trusted.

223
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,019
I don't trust them.
But I know mind games.

224
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,730
So do you. We've played them together.

225
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,399
You were just soulless demons.
They're lawyers.

226
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,220
She's right. We were amateurs.

227
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,049
And if you're wrong?

228
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm not.

229
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,389
And I'll prove it to you.

230
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,000
Can you watch her for a while?

231
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,620
I'll be back soon.

232
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,700
- Sure.
- Don't worry about it.

233
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,580
- You can't keep me.
- You're not a prisoner.

234
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,610
I've heard that a lot lately.

235
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,259
Just give me a chance, okay?

236
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,240
So. First up, you're a prisoner.

237
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,929
I have to concur with that.

238
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,620
- You've got our friend all in knots.
- Can't say we like you much.

239
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,279
So, sorry about the dying,
but if you try to escape...

240
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,139
- ...we will hit you.
- On the head.

241
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,299
With very large and
heavy objects. Okay?

242
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,950
- Maybe I can't come in but--
- Wipe your feet.

243
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:12,919
What?

244
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,759
Wipe your feet. Come in.

245
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,279
Jeez, I invited you in already.

246
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,779
Do you really need to throttle me?

247
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,309
Need to?

248
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,330
Yes, she's dying.

249
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,500
Those medical reports are real.

250
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,899
Want a second opinion? Here.

251
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,279
How about a third? How about a tenth?

252
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,070
I used every connection we had.

253
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,850
That's my own doctor.

254
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,759
They're all the same:
Syphilitic heart condition. Terminal.

255
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,539
Darla was a working girl
in the New World.

256
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,309
Had syphilis when she was human.

257
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,609
She's human again.

258
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,470
Picking up where she left off.

259
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:15,799
Today that can be cleared up with
antibiotics, if you catch it.

260
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:20,180
We're about a month and, what--
400 years too late?

261
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,700
You didn't believe it either.

262
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,079
So it's true.

263
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,650
I had to be sure.

264
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:40,309
Why?

265
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,460
Why? I don't want her to die
any more than you do.

266
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,619
Do you love her, Lindsey?

267
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,119
Is that what this is?

268
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,440
Look at you. A few months
with her, you're a schoolboy.

269
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,160
I was with her for 150 years.

270
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,589
But you never loved her.

271
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,700
- I wasn't capable, neither are you.
- Maybe not.

272
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,599
But I'd save her if I could.
You can, and you won't.

273
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:22,839
You've got a choice.

274
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,990
Waste her life searching
for a cure that doesn't exist.

275
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,839
Watch her die.

276
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,269
Or use your only real power.

277
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,230
You can make this disease go away.

278
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:37,759
- By killing her.
- Giving her life. Eternal life.

279
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,660
Then what, Lindsey?
You can be together?

280
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,849
If I were to do it...

281
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,630
...how long do you think it would be
before she hunted you down?

282
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,230
Gotta say, that thought
almost makes it worth it.

283
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,269
But there's another way. I'll find it.

284
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,700
Not only is she putting
his life at stake...

285
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,069
...but ours. After 400 years
of death and destruction...

286
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,450
...it seems to me you get voted
off the island. Am I right?

287
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,009
You're back.

288
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,960
Was it good news?

289
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,029
Give me a minute, will you, guys?

290
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,059
Jasmine. It blooms at night.
I remember what that was like.

291
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,210
I told you it was the truth.

292
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,089
- Darla.
- I have to go.

293
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,630
We'll find a cure.

294
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,319
I've been around long enough
to recognize a lost cause.

295
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,160
Unless....

296
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,170
That's exactly what they
want us to do, Darla.

297
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,819
I don't care. I don't want to die.

298
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,470
- I can't do it.
- I need it.

299
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,019
No, you don't. I don't know
what you need. I wish I did.

300
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,259
I don't know either.

301
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:27,859
No...

302
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,680
...you do. You're the only one that
could. You just can't see it.

303
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,880
You need help.

304
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,420
Ill wind blow away

305
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,630
let me rest today

306
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,269
You're blowing me no good

307
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,859
What does that mean?

308
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,400
It means, Ground Control to Major Tom,
may not be able to save her.

309
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,859
I'm gonna do it.
You're gonna help me.

310
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,970
I sense pain and anger. Still testy?

311
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,799
Because you sent me to a swami
whose impostor tried to kill me?

312
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,880
It was painful. I'm still reeling.

313
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,980
I feel your pain,
trying to kill me and all.

314
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,440
People try to kill you every day.
I mean Ramone.

315
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,980
Overheard us and betrayed me.

316
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,029
A world-class bartender.

317
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,059
He made a Sea Breeze
that took you to Tahiti.

318
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,289
He's off the menu now.

319
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,410
- Can we get back to Darla?
- If you'll shush up and listen.

320
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,970
You're only misleading
the sunshine I'm needing

321
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:03,319
Ain't that a shame

322
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,009
It's so hard to keep up

323
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,089
With troubles that creep up

324
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,730
Aren't you reading her?

325
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,559
I'm a channel surfer.

326
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,720
You're a big hunk of hero sandwich.
You want to save the girl.

327
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,269
I can see why. But you're missing
the crucial point here.

328
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,259
Not everything
can be put back together.

329
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,759
- She can't die.
- Why do you care so much?

330
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,859
She had more than most of us.
400-plus years.

331
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,039
As a vampire. Before that, she was--

332
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,539
She never had a chance.

333
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,259
No good

334
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,680
Someone get my heart.
That girl's ripped it right out.

335
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,359
I know I'm probably
going to regret this.

336
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,059
In fact, being prescient,
I'm sure of it.

337
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,519
There is one way.

338
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:16,480
- It's a bit of a quest. May kill you.
- I'll take it.

339
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,440
All right, big fella,
you asked for it.

340
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,789
You're about to face hell
and high water.

341
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,740
Go to this address.

342
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,829
What is it?

343
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,809
Where we find out if you're
ready to take the plunge.

344
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,480
- Well, here we are.
- I don't think this is right.

345
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,920
He said I had to take the plunge.

346
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,569
- Into an empty pool?
- Sure.

347
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,480
With water you'd miss out
on all that skull crushing.

348
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,450
Maybe he meant another pool.

349
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,099
Something in the koi pond. Very Zen.

350
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,240
It's a test.
A leap-of-faith thing.

351
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,890
Then don't do it.

352
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:06,150
A green-faced lounge singer asks
you to do this, and you do it?

353
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,190
Why?

354
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,359
I'll either be back with a cure...

355
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,500
...or you're about to see
something funny.

356
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,599
You certainly have faith.
Now we'll test your valor.

357
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,660
I shall be assisting you
with the trials, sir.

358
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,039
- Darla. Why is she here?
- You wish to save her life?

359
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,609
- Yes.
- She's your collateral then.

360
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,980
Should you complete all three trials,
she will be made whole.

361
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,900
- What happens if I don't?
- She dies instantly.

362
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,460
In the meantime, Darla, relax with
a beverage in our antechamber.

363
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,660
No.

364
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:01,740
It's better this way. Soon,
no living thing will be safe in here.

365
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,759
Nobody said--

366
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:07,740
Sorry for the misunderstanding,
but life is the bargain here.

367
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,769
By entering, you have placed hers
in the balance.

368
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:17,369
Along with your own, of course.
You'd best get ready now, sir.

369
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,299
This is no time to be dwelling
on the negative.

370
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,750
Your trials will consist
of three challenges.

371
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,789
I'll need your shirt and shoes.

372
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,769
Unarmed combat?

373
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,400
Well, you'll be unarmed, yes.

374
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,950
Okay, three challenges. What are they?

375
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,380
That's for you to discover.

376
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,700
Shoes and socks, please.

377
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,730
You've seen this before.
Give me something.

378
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,029
- I've never given information before.
- How many asked?

379
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,720
In theory,
the first test is child's play.

380
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,269
- That gate opens, you walk through it.
- That's it?

381
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,130
- What's the catch?
- That would be telling, wouldn't it?

382
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,500
What's two and three?

383
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,390
I wouldn't know about
the last two tests.

384
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,000
Nobody survives the first one.

385
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,680
Best of luck.

386
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,880
You must be the catch.

387
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,079
Seventeen seconds.
Twice the time others have lasted.

388
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,940
- Call this off.
- Impossible.

389
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,099
The tests can't be stopped.

390
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,029
- I need to see what's happening. Now.
- If you insist.

391
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,410
But please remember, you did ask.

392
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,400
Hey, I defeated him! Open up!

393
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,789
This how a guy like you gets
his rocks off?

394
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,509
I have no feelings
about this contest, miss.

395
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:04,849
Do you?

396
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,009
Why don't you just kill him?

397
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,819
We don't want anything, miss.
The journey is all.

398
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,210
Where it leads is not our concern.

399
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:13,680
Holy water.

400
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,849
He's quite remarkable.

401
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,589
Yes, he is.

402
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:53,049
Well played. You've fielded
our strokes from end to end.

403
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,880
My hat's off to you, sir. Of course,
there is one final challenge.

404
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,859
- What is this?
- I think you know, sir.

405
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,799
Stakes. You call this...

406
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,200
...a test?

407
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:25,240
- Only way it works is you kill me?
- Exactly.

408
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,140
You do understand this third test
has no catch, as you put it.

409
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,930
Death is the final challenge.

410
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,089
We can't restore one life
without taking another.

411
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,059
In order for Darla to live,
you must die.

412
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,460
My apologies for any discomfort
this causes.

413
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,549
I really can't imagine the pain.

414
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:53,049
How about we switch places?

415
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,859
My death wouldn't balance
a thing. Yours--

416
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,849
I die, Darla lives.

417
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,420
Yes. I'm unaware of any deities
the vampire worships.

418
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,970
But if you'd like to pray...

419
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,269
...now would be the time.

420
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,970
Don't do this.

421
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,720
- What are you waiting for?
- For you.

422
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:21,210
I need your permission.
You've earned a choice.

423
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,890
Accept your death
so that she may live or....

424
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,369
Or what?!

425
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,519
Leave. Refuse the challenge
and walk away.

426
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,890
No one will stop you.

427
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,099
- Our doors are open.
- What about Darla?

428
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,029
- Oh, she dies.
- No deal.

429
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,869
I expected as much.
A pity. I like you.

430
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:45,960
Spare me.

431
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,329
I'd very much like to.

432
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,519
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

433
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,109
Isn't the world a better place
with you in it?

434
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,650
You can save so many people.

435
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:02,230
It seems she can barely save herself.

436
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,519
The world can be a very bad place.

437
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,910
Take yourself out, and how long
will it be before she stumbles?

438
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,759
I don't know.

439
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,430
No, you don't.

440
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:29,640
Are you still ready to give your life
when she can promise you nothing?

441
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,349
Yes.

442
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,089
As you wish.

443
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,650
No.

444
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,269
Do it.

445
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,220
No!

446
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,500
Angel!

447
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:14,789
Congratulations. You've passed
the third test by accepting death.

448
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:20,079
No one's ever gone that far before,
in terms of sacrifice.

449
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,300
- Kudos.
- Pay up.

450
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,070
Of course. You're a lucky woman.

451
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,880
Soon you'll have your whole life
ahead. Use it wisely.

452
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:35,219
Hey, unless this fortune cookie
crap is some new torture...

453
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,159
...let's get on with it.

454
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,059
This way, miss.

455
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,099
- What?
- What is it?

456
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,340
- This is very embarrassing.
- What is?

457
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:01,239
Not to mention unprecedented.

458
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,340
She's been given new life once before.
By supernatural means?

459
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:12,349
- They brought me back.
- What are you saying?

460
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,610
- I can't help you.
- We had a bargain.

461
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,300
She's earned a second chance.

462
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,650
She's living her second chance.

463
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,190
But you played magnificently.

464
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,989
You should've told us
she was brought to life before this.

465
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,630
I truly am sorry, sir.

466
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:41,539
The fact of the matter is,
there's nothing I can do.

467
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,570
Angel.

468
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,050
It may be different.

469
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:51,900
We don't know.

470
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:57,539
Maybe, because, you know,
I have a soul...

471
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,480
- ...if I did bite you--
- No.

472
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,630
We don't know what it'll do.

473
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,980
Angel, I've seen it now.
Everything you're going through...

474
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:12,159
...everything you've gone through.
I felt it.

475
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:19,460
I felt how you care the way
no one's ever cared before.

476
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,659
Not for me.

477
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:29,380
- That's all I need.
- It's not enough.

478
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:31,429
It is.

479
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:35,289
How could The Powers bring you back...

480
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,920
...and take a second chance
away like this?

481
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,880
Maybe this is my second chance.

482
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,880
To die?

483
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:47,909
Yes, to die.

484
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,550
The way I was supposed to
in the first place.

485
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm not gonna leave you.

486
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,550
Every moment you have left,
I'm gonna be by your side.

487
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,059
You never have to be alone again.

488
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,389
How'd you think this would end?

489
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,489
Thank you, thank you very much,
