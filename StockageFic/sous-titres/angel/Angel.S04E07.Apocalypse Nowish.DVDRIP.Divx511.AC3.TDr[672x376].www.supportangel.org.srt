00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,969
Oh, you think?
Well, don't. Just shut up.

350
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:52,045
Get me an incident report
cross-referenced by region...

351
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:54,169
...socioeconomic backgrounds
and species.

352
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,405
And get Gavin up here. Somebody's
muscling in on our apocalypse...

353
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,609
...and that's not gonna happen
while...

354
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,685
Let me get back to you.

355
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,203
ANGEL: Close the door.
- How did you get in here?

356
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,810
Vampire detectors, my ass.

357
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,770
Well, here we are, all nice and cozy.

358
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,164
Let's talk about, hmm, gee,
let me guess, Lorne.

359
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,648
How is he doing? Still green?

360
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,730
I told you we would have
a conversation.

361
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:25,051
Swell, but I'm having a bit of a day,
so let's say we skip the usual two-step.

362
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:27,488
You threaten me, I threaten you.
Yada yada, yawn.

363
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,486
Jump directly to throwing you out
on your thick, meaty head...

364
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:33,565
...because you know what?
You're not getting anything out of me.

365
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,367
Didn't think I would. But Gavin...

366
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,047
...he was more accommodating.

367
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,848
Couldn't you have tortured him
a little bit more?

368
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:49,403
Wanted to, but he wouldn't stop talking
long enough for me to get into it.

369
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:50,887
I have a cure for that.

370
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,692
Vindict on your own time.
I'm kind of on the clock here.

371
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,522
What did he tell you?

372
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:58,446
You're trying to decipher what
you took out of Lorne's head.

373
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:01,002
Hundreds of psychics,
probing and prodding.

374
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:04,961
Well, not quite that many now, because
every time they peel back a layer...

375
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,169
...their brains end up
decorating the walls.

376
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,893
You should see the cleaning bill.
That is terrifying.

377
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,442
Anything you got on what's coming,
now's a good time.

378
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,171
Not big on sharing.

379
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,362
You think I'm joking.

380
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:18,246
Not unless you got a sense of humor
to go with that soul.

381
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:20,569
Look, you got it right
from the weasel's mouth.

382
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,805
Whatever Lorne gleaned from
reading Wonder Girl, it's protected.

in this light.

You're not afraid of me, Lilah.

390
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,046
You're afraid of what's coming.

Maybe we can help each other, huh?

You wanna play hero,
go find another sandbox.

395
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,331
Normally, this would be the part
where I'd make a grand threat.

396

But thanks to Gavin...

Like he knows anything.

398

That's the point.

This thing caught you by surprise too.

400
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,048
You had no idea it was coming.

401
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:10,289
So I'm supposed to throw in
with Mr. Goody...

402
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:13,013
...because the great unknown
has me shaking in my pumps?

403
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:14,851
It's a win-win for you, Lilah.

404
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:18,847

makes you employee of the month...

into motion the last 1000 years.

406

You help me, and I don't stop it...

407
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,250
...well, the only way that's gonna
happen is if this thing kills me.

408
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,052
And if that's the way it goes...

...you win again.

00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,684
So you can keep playing it hard...

411
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:39,447
...or you can play it smart.

Been inside all day.

Thought I'd take a walk, clear the
cobwebs, recharge the chargeables.

- About the vision?

Yeah. Flashes, images,

I remember wanting
to come back home.

To be able to touch, to feel.

430

To be human again.

431
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,605
- You are.
- But I can't remember how.

00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,686
Am I on vacation?

433
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:04,724
Did I go cosmic AWOL?

434
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:08,568
Did I do something to piss off the
powers that be and get kicked out?

435
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,644
Why am I here?

436
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,565
Because you're important.

Yeah, the world really
stopped turning without me.

Maybe you're right.

444
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:49,530
Maybe I was sent back because I'm
important or needed for this.

To stop whatever's about to happen.

446

CORDELIA: <i>Exactly? No.</i>

450
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:10,962
But for the first time since I've been
back, I feel like I have a purpose.

451
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,442
Like a reason for being here.

for my life to start.

Whatever's happening, whatever Cordy's
seeing, the answers are in these pages.

517
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:45,485
We need to figure this out.

518
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:54,767
- We'll never figure this out.
- We have to keep trying.

519
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:57,242
Normally, I'd agree,
but this is a waste of time.

520

- It's all we have.
WESLEY: Something's missing.

521
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,246
Bits and pieces of glyphs, archaic
languages, symbols, all jumbled together.

Do you recognize any of them?

523
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:11,289
Um, "heat, fallen, shrine, flesh."

524
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,212
- None of it makes sense.
- We gotta keep at it till it does.

525
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,728
- We should take a step back.

It's not the free refills

Don't know what I'd say.

I've seen the way he looks at you

you've got love, it can't be that bad.

556

I gotta go. I've gotta stop it.

557

should really slow that thing down.

some grand higher purpose.
